<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-720"><span class="space">b.</span> Clauses Defining Application of the "Covered By" Doctrine</h5>
<p class="noindent">After much litigation, on a remand from a reviewing court, and over the dissent of Member Beck, proposals were determined to be negotiable that established exceptions to the "covered by" doctrine, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Customs Serv.,</span> 64 FLRA 156, 156-159 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is before the Authority on a remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the court) in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 399 F.3d 334 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (<span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>) (reviewing <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 59 FLRA 217 (2003) (<span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>) (then-Member Pope dissenting)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court remanded the case to the Authority to determine whether the two disputed proposals constitute permissive subjects of bargaining under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute). For the following reasons, we find that the proposals are within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Proposals</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Proposal 1</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Article 37, Section 1.A</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Unless it is clear that a matter at issue was specifically addressed by the parties in this Agreement or an existing Memorandum of Understanding, the subject is appropriate for mid-term bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Proposal 2</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Article 37, Section 1.C.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Employer recognizes that the Union in accordance with law and the terms of this Agreement has the right to...(2) initiate bargaining on its own and engage in mid-term bargaining over matters not specifically addressed in this Agreement or an existing Memorandum of Understanding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;Meaning of the Proposals</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth in <span class="Italic">NTEU I,</span> 59 FLRA at 219, both proposals would require the Agency to engage in mid-term bargaining, either over Agency-initiated changes (Proposal 1) or over Union requests for mid-term bargaining (Proposal 2), unless the subject matter of bargaining is specifically addressed in the parties' National Agreement or an existing Memorandum of Understanding. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The effect of both proposals would be to preclude the Agency from using the second prong of the "covered by" doctrine to excuse its failure to bargain in these circumstances.[2] <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;The "covered by" doctrine is set forth in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs, Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md,</span> 47 FLRA 1004, 1017-1018 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). Under the first prong of that doctrine, the Authority examines whether a matter is expressly contained in the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1018. If it is not, then under the second prong, the Authority will consider whether the subject is inseparably bound up with, and thus plainly an aspect of, a subject expressly covered by the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;The Authority's Decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span> and the Court's Decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU I,</span> the Authority found that, because the proposals would limit the Agency's ability to raise a "covered by" defense to an alleged failure to bargain, the proposals would require the Agency to limit its "right" under the Statute to raise such a defense. 59 FLRA at 220 (citing <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> 55 FLRA 374, 377 (1999)). Stating that "proposals that a party negotiate to limit a right granted to it by the Statute[ ]" are permissive subjects of bargaining, 59 FLRA at 219 (citation omitted), the Authority found the proposals to be negotiable only at the Agency's election. In reaching this conclusion, the Authority rejected the Union's reliance on Authority precedent finding "reopener" proposals to be negotiable because, according to the Authority, in those cases, and unlike this case, there were no claims that the proposals concerned permissive subjects of bargaining.[3] <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 221 (citing <span class="Italic">Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n,</span> 56 FLRA 69, 72-73 (2000) (<span class="Italic">POPA</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1995,</span> 47 FLRA 470, 472-73 (1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;A reopener clause specifies the conditions under which a party may seek to negotiate over a term that is "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See NTEU II,</span> 399 F.3d at 341 (citing e.g.,<span class="Italic"> NLRB v. Lion Oil Co.,</span> 352 U.S. 282, 286 (1957)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Union sought judicial review, the court in <span class="Italic">NTEU ll </span>remanded the case. The court remanded the case for two reasons. First, the court held that the Authority's decision had failed to address relevant Authority precedent concerning "unilateral rights." S<span class="Italic">ee NTEU ll,</span> 399 F.3d at 340-41. The court pointed out that both Authority precedent and judicial precedent that the Authority had adopted "limits permissive subjects of bargaining to 'unilateral rights specifically vested in one party.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 340 (quoting <span class="Italic">United States Food &#x0026; Drug Admin.,</span> 53 FLRA 1269, 1275 (1998) (<span class="Italic">FDA</span>) (quoting in turn <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA,</span> 712 F.2d 640, 646 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>)). Thus, in the court's opinion, the issue before the Authority, which the Authority had failed to address, was "whether the 'covered by' defense is a unilateral right explicitly or by unambiguous implication conferred by the Statute." <span class="Italic">NTEU II,</span> 399 F.3d at 341 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the court remanded the case because the Authority's decision "fails to explain (or even to discuss) the relationship between the Union proposals...and both FLRA and private sector precedent regarding zipper and reopener clauses." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court was particularly concerned that the Authority had failed to distinguish the Union's proposals from reopener clauses. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 342. As the court observed, the Authority has often ordered agencies to bargain over reopener proposals, treating them as mandatory bargaining subjects. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the court's remand instructions, we have reexamined the Authority's <span class="Italic">NTEU I </span>decision, and have determined to reverse it. Mindful of the issues identified by the court in <span class="Italic">NTEU II,</span> we begin our analysis with the presumption that all matters relating to conditions of employment are mandatory subjects of bargaining unless the Statute explicitly or by unambiguous implication vests in a party an unqualified, or "unilateral," right. <span class="Italic">See NTEU II,</span> 399 F.3d at 340; <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 712 F.2d at 646 &#x0026; n.27, 649.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This presumption is applicable in the instant case.&#x2003;Matters relating to the parties' mid-term bargaining relationship plainly relate to conditions of employment. There is no dispute that, under the Statute, agencies are obligated to engage in mid-term bargaining over negotiable union proposals concerning matters that are not "covered by" the collective bargaining agreement, unless the union has waived its right to bargain about the subject matter involved. <span class="Italic">E.g., United States Dep't of the Interior, Wash., D.C.,</span> 56 FLRA 45, 50 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In like manner, proposals, such as those at issue in this case, that seek to define the parties' mid-term bargaining rights and obligations by limiting the availability of the "covered by" defense, also relate to conditions of employment. The Union's proposals are therefore mandatory subjects of bargaining unless the "covered by" defense to an alleged failure to bargain is a "unilateral right" explicitly or by unambiguous implication vested in a party by the Statute. For the reasons discussed below, we hold that the "covered by" defense is not such a right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, there is no explicit, vested right in the Statute to raise a "covered by" defense. Unlike provisions of the Statute that explicitly grant parties various rights,[5] nothing in the Statute explicitly sets forth a right to raise a "covered by" defense, or to decline to bargain mid-term over a proposal that would limit a party's ability to raise such a defense. <span class="Italic">Cf. FDA,</span> 53 FLRA at 1276 (proposal for more than one collective bargaining agreement was permissive subject of bargaining because union had a unilateral right to negotiate with "an agency" under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12) of the Statute). In this regard, as the court stated, "Congress knew how to write a provision defining permissive subjects of bargaining unambiguously." <span class="Italic">NTEU II,</span> 399 F.3d at 340 (quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE,</span> 712 F.2d at 646). Congress did not include in the Statute a provision listing the "covered by" defense as a permissive subject of bargaining, or addressing the "covered by" defense in any manner whatsoever. Rather, the "covered by" defense is a legal doctrine developed to elucidate the mutual obligation to bargain mid-term.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102 ("Employees' rights"), 7106 ("Management rights"), &#x0026; 7114 ("Representation rights and duties").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The ability to raise this defense arises only after the parties have entered into a collective bargaining agreement. As such, it appears to be particularly appropriate for parties, during negotiations, to determine whether and how the "covered by" doctrine will apply once they reach such an agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we conclude that the Statute does not vest such a right in parties by "unambiguous implication[.]" <span class="Italic">NTEU II,</span> 399 F.3d at 341. We note in this regard, that in <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base v. FLRA,</span> 962 F.2d 48, 59 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>), on which the Authority relied in <span class="Italic">SSA,</span> the court stated that "[a] primary purpose of the Statute is to promote collective bargaining and the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 59 (citing &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102(2) &#x0026; 7114(a)(4) of the Statute).[7] The court also stated that "[i]mplicit in this statutory purpose is the need to provide the parties to such an agreement with stability and repose with respect to matters reduced to writing in the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_1150"></span>[7]&#x2003;As noted previously, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102 &#x0026; 7114 concern, respectively, employees' rights and representation rights and duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted, the Authority relied on these principles in <span class="Italic">SSA,</span> 47 FLRA at 1017. In this connection, the Authority stated that, "upon execution of an agreement, <span class="Italic">an</span> <span class="Italic">agency</span> should be free from a requirement to continue negotiations over terms and conditions of employment already resolved by the previous bargaining; similarly, <span class="Italic">a</span> <span class="Italic">union</span> should be secure in the knowledge that the agency may not rely on that agreement to unilaterally change terms and conditions that were in no manner the subject of bargaining." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1017-18 (emphasis added). Put simply, the ability to raise a "covered by" defense is rooted in the policies of: (1) promoting collective bargaining and the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements; and (2) enabling parties to rely on the agreements that they reach, once they have reached them. These policies involve the parties' mutual obligation to bargain, not unilateral rights.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;We do not use the term "unilateral" to refer only to rights that are held by one party and withheld from the other parry. Rather, it also applies to rights that are held by more than one party, but which one party may unilaterally raise as a basis for refusing to bargain. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., FDA,</span> 53 FLRA at 1276 ("<span class="Italic">both</span> the agency and the exclusive representative have a <span class="Italic">unilateral</span> right to demand that they negotiate with each other as one entity[,]" and, thus, the union had the right to refuse to negotiate over a proposal to negotiate two separate collective bargaining agreements for employees who were members of a single bargaining unit) (emphasis added). In any event, the ability to raise a "covered by" defense does not fall within either category of unilateral rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finding a duty to bargain over whether and how the "covered by" doctrine will apply during the terms of parties' collective bargaining agreements is consistent with both of these policies. In addition, finding such a duty to bargain is likely to encourage parties to reach agreements that are more comprehensive, of greater duration, and clearer. In this connection, it is reasonable to conclude that parties will be more willing to reach more comprehensive agreements if they have no need to be concerned that raising a matter at the negotiating table may later result in the successful use of a "covered by" defense to future failures to bargain over those subjects. It also is reasonable to conclude that they will enter into longer-duration agreements if they are not concerned that they will be foreclosed from bargaining a wide range of subjects mid-term. Finally, it appears likely that parties will be more clear in their agreements as to exactly how those agreements should be interpreted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, although the "covered by" doctrine set forth in <span class="Italic">SSA</span> is the standard---default--arrangement that applies in assessing duty to bargain issues, this does not mean that parties cannot be required to bargain over the scope of that doctrine. In this connection, as the court has recognized, a broad-scope grievance procedure is "the standard arrangement[ ]" provided for in the Statute, <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 712 F.2d at 644, but parties nonetheless are required to bargain over proposals to narrow the scope of the grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vermont Air Nat'I Guard, Burlington, Vt.,</span> 9 FLRA 737, 740-41 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd AFGE,</span> 712 F.2d 640. The same reasoning applies with respect to negotiating to narrow the scope of the "covered by" doctrine.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find that the proposals at issue here are similar to reopener proposals, which both the Authority and the National Labor Relations Board have found to be mandatory subjects of bargaining. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., POPA,</span> 56 FLRA at 72-73 (Chairman Wasserman and Member Cabaniss dissenting in part on other grounds); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1995,</span> 47 FLRA 470, 471-73 (1993); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 3804,</span> 21 FLRA 870, 889-91 (1986); [9] <span class="Italic">McAllister Bros.,</span> 312 NLRB 1121, 1129 (1993). Like the instant proposals, reopener proposals seek bargaining over matters that are "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement. In fact, the instant proposals appear more likely to further the statutory purpose of contractual repose--which, as discussed above, is one of the policies behind the "covered by" doctrine--than are many reopener proposals. In this connection, while many reopener proposals seek to open a contract as to entire subjects, the instant proposals would permit reopening as to only those aspects of subjects that are not expressly addressed in the contract.[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;We note, as the Authority did in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> <span class="Italic">I</span>, 59 FLRA at 221, that the above-cited Authority decisions did not present the precise legal arguments that are raised here. Nevertheless, we find that our holding in the instant case is consistent with the holdings in those decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;We note the court's finding that, "[i]n some respects, the Union's proposals are arguably more analogous to zipper clauses than they are to reopeners[ ]" because, "[w]hile a reopener clause is ordinarily limited to particular contractual provisions and by certain triggering circumstances, a zipper clause, like the Union's proposals, alters the scope of the duty to bargain mid-term with respect to virtually all contract terms (or, in the case of Union's proposals, all terms not resolved by the agreement)." 399 F.3d at 343.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We agree that the instant proposals are in some ways akin to zipper clauses in that both the instant proposals and zipper clauses alter the scope of the duty to bargain mid-term. However, we need not rely on this similarity in reaching our negotiability determination. In this connection, as the court noted, "[t]he precedent regarding the negotiability of a zipper clause is not as well established as that for the reopener clause[,]" and the Authority has not squarely addressed whether zipper clauses are mandatory subjects of bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 342. Given our findings above, we need not reach that issue here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the ability to raise a "covered by" defense is not a unilateral, statutory right that is explicitly or by unambiguous implication vested in any party. Accordingly, the instant proposals do not seek the waiver of such a statutory right and are mandatory, not permissive, subjects of bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent">Originally, in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Customs Serv.</span>, 59 FLRA 217, 217-21 (2003), <span class="Italic">remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 399 F.3d 334 (D.C. Cir. 2005), <span class="Italic">post</span>, <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Customs Serv.</span>, 64 FLRA 156 (2009), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, FLRA decided that negotiation over exceptions to, or contractual definition of, application of the "covered by" doctrine was a permissive subject of bargaining--a result that was reversed years later after judicial review and a remand decision from FLRA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 37, Section 1.A</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unless it is clear that a matter at issue was specifically addressed by the parties in this Agreement or an existing Memorandum of Understanding, the subject is appropriate for mid-term bargaining.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Article 37, Section 1.C</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Employer recognizes that the Union in accordance with law and the terms of this Agreement has the right to...(2) initiate bargaining on its own and engage in mid-term bargaining over matters not specifically addressed in this Agreement or an existing Memorandum of Understanding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;Background</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This negotiability dispute involves the "covered by" doctrine originally set forth in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 47 FLRA 1004 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). In <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the Authority stated that it would resolve claims that a party is not obligated to bargain over a matter on the ground that a contract provision covers the matter in dispute by first determining whether the matter is "expressly contained" in the collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">. SSA</span>, 47 FLRA at 1018. If the provision does not expressly encompass the matter, the Authority stated that it would next determine whether the subject is nonetheless "'inseparably bound up with...a subject expressly covered by the contract.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">C &#x0026; S Industries</span>,<span class="Italic"> Inc</span>., 158 NLRB 454, 459 (1966), <span class="Italic">cited with approval in</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 48, 60 (D.C. Cir. 1992) ("<span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span>"). The Authority further stated that it would examine all record evidence to determine whether the parties reasonably should have contemplated that the agreement would foreclose further bargaining in such instances<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1019.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority noted that its doctrine was based on precedent developed by the National Labor Relations Board<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Triangle PWC, Inc.</span>, 231 NLRB 492, 493 (1977) (union demand to bargain on pension levels constituted a "mid" or "in" term attempt to negotiate on a matter covered by the contract, where "[t]he subject was broached but...the [u]nion did not pursue the matter, choosing instead to pursue other contract terms")).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also stated that it "strongly agree[d]" with the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps </span>that "'implicit in [the] statutory purpose is the need to provide the parties to such an agreement with stability and repose with respect to matters reduced to writing in the agreement.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1017, quoting <span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span>, 962 F.2d at 59. In this regard, the Authority further stated the following with respect to the statutory purposes served by the doctrine:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In sum, in examining whether a matter is contained in or covered by an agreement, we must be sensitive both to the policies embodied in the Statute favoring the resolution of disputes through bargaining and to the disruption that can result from endless negotiations over the same general subject matter. Thus, the stability and repose that we seek must provide a respite from unwanted change to both parties: upon execution of an agreement, an agency should be free from a requirement to continue negotiations over terms and conditions of employment already resolved by the previous bargaining; similarly, a union should be secure in the knowledge that the agency may not rely on that agreement to unilaterally change terms and conditions that were in no manner the subject of bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 47 FLRA at 1017.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv., Customs Mgmt. Ctr., Miami, Fla.</span>, 56 FLRA <span id="page_1151"></span>809, 814 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Customs Mgmt.</span>), the Authority clarified that the "covered by" doctrine has two prongs. The Authority stated that, to the extent that some decisions issued subsequent to <span class="Italic">SSA </span>suggested that the "third" or "intent" part of the doctrine was a separate, independent element of the <span class="Italic">SSA </span>doctrine, it is not<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In this regard, the Authority held:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If the agreement provision does not expressly encompass the matter, the Authority moves to the next part of the analysis to determine whether the matter sought to be bargained is an aspect of matters already negotiated. That analysis, of whether the matter sought to be bargained is in fact an aspect of matters already negotiated, will as deemed necessary consider the parties' bargaining history or intent as a requisite component of the examination of all the record evidence<span class="Italic">. See SSA</span>, 47 FLRA at 1019. As examination of bargaining history and intent is clearly an aspect of the "covered by" doctrine established by private sector and Authority precedent, we reject the...argument that such evidence cannot be considered. However, this part of the <span class="Italic">SSA </span>doctrine, the "intent" portion of the examination of the record evidence[,] is not a separate, independent criterion. Rather, it is an integral component of that part of the "covered by" analysis to determine whether the matter sought to be bargained is inseparably bound up with and thus is plainly an aspect of a subject covered by the contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 814 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the "covered by" doctrine operates as a defense to an alleged unlawful refusal to bargain, by an agency under &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5) or by a union under &#x00A7; 7116(b)(5) of the Statute. The "covered by" doctrine has two prongs. Under the first prong, if a party seeks to bargain over a matter that is expressly addressed by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the other party may properly refuse to bargain over the matter. Under the second prong, if a matter is not expressly addressed by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement but is nonetheless inseparably bound up with and, thus, an aspect of a subject covered by the terms of the agreement, the party may also properly refuse to bargain over the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Meaning of the Proposals</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both proposals would require the Agency to engage in mid-term bargaining, either over Agency-initiated changes (Proposal 1) or over Union requests for mid-term bargaining (Proposal 2), unless the subject matter of bargaining is specifically addressed in the parties' National Agreement or an existing Memorandum of Understanding. The effect of both proposals would be to preclude the Agency from using the second prong of the "covered by" doctrine to excuse its failure to bargain in these circumstances. Because the proposals have the same effect, we will address them jointly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Proposals 1 and 2 Constitute Matters that Are Negotiable at the Election of the Agency</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both proposals would require the Agency to waive part of the "covered by" doctrine that it would otherwise be entitled to assert as a defense under the Statute to counter a claim that it has failed to bargain in good faith. The Agency asserts that the "covered by" doctrine involves the exercise of a statutory right and that, although it could elect to agree to a limitation on its ability to apply the "covered by" defense, it cannot be required to bargain to agree to such a limitation. The Union asserts that the "covered by" doctrine is a contractual defense, not a statutory right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to resolve the negotiability dispute in this case, we first examine the collective bargaining obligations of an agency and a union under the Statute. An agency and an exclusive representative are required to negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4). "Collective bargaining" means the performance of the mutual obligation of the parties to, among other things, bargain with respect to the conditions of employment of unit employees as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) and to execute, if requested by either party, a written collective bargaining agreement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12). Once a collective bargaining agreement is executed, the terms of the agreement govern the parties' relationship as to those matters during the life of the agreement. The "covered by" doctrine recognizes that certain matters--both those expressly set forth in an agreement as well as those inseparably bound up with matters expressly set forth in the agreement--are not subject to renewed bargaining during the life of the agreement because, as set forth in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the purpose of the agreement is to provide stability and repose as to those matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the obligation to bargain concerning employees' conditions of employment, "the parties to a collective bargaining relationship may also negotiate over a wide range of 'permissive' subjects." <span class="Italic">United States Food and Drug Admin., Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Regions</span>, 53 FLRA 1269, 1273 (1998) (<span class="Italic">FDA</span>). "As the name implies, parties may, but are not required to, bargain over permissive subjects." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1273-74. Permissive subjects include "proposals that a party negotiate to limit a right granted to it by the Statute." <span class="Italic">Id. See generally AFGE, Local 32</span>, 51 FLRA 491, 497 n.11 (1995) (noting that bargaining proposals fall into three categories under the Statute: mandatory, permissive, and prohibited).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">FDA</span>, the Authority held that a proposal by an agency to negotiate two separate collective bargaining agreements within one bargaining unit was a permissive subject<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, 53 FLRA at 1273-77. In this regard, the Authority noted that local negotiation (as opposed to negotiation only at the level of exclusive recognition) is a permissive subject of bargaining, because parties are only required to bargain at the certified exclusive representative and agency level<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1274<span class="Italic">. See also DODDS</span>, 12 FLRA at 53 (where a union's exclusive recognition was at the national level, "the Statute does not require negotiations at other than the national level").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, although the Statute gives an agency the right to decline to bargain over the types of employees or volunteers to be assigned to a particular work group, an agency may elect to bargain over this matter because this matter constitutes a permissive subject of bargaining<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Def., Def. Contract Audit Agency, Cent. Region</span>, 47 FLRA 512 (1993).[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;It is also well established that, even if parties have negotiated over a permissive subject in the past, there is no basis to conclude that such previous bargaining renders future bargaining mandatory. In <span class="Italic">Allied Chemical &#x0026; Alkali Workers of Am., Local Union No. 1 v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., Chem. Div.</span>, 404 U.S. 157, 187 (1971), the Supreme Court considered the effect of an employer's prior agreement to a contract provision that constituted a permissive subject of bargaining, on the employer's duty to bargain under section 8(d) of the National Labor Relations Act. The Court held that by once bargaining and agreeing on a permissive subject, the parties do not make the subject a mandatory topic of future bargaining. Because the duty to bargain under the Statute parallels the duty to bargain under the Act, the Authority adopted the rationale of the Court in that case with respect to the duty to bargain over permissive subjects<span class="Italic">. See NATCA</span>, 56 FLRA at 291<span class="Italic">. See also AFGE, Local 225</span>, 56 FLRA 686, 689 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has expressly, and in our view correctly, held that the "covered by" defense constitutes a right under the Statute<span class="Italic">. See SSA II</span>, 55 FLRA at 377. In this regard, the Authority specifically stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In [<span class="Italic">SSA</span>], the Authority advised that the Statute provides stability and repose to matters reduced to writing in a collective bargaining agreement. 47 FLRA at 1017. Accordingly, the Statute frees an agency from a requirement to continue negotiations over terms and conditions of employment already resolved by previous bargaining<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1018. <span class="Italic">However, a statutory right, such as the refusal to bargain based on an affirmative "covered-by" defense pertaining to the parties' collective bargaining agreement, is subject to waiver.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, 55 FLRA at 377 (emphasis added). The Authority concluded in <span class="Italic">SSA II </span>that the agency had, in fact, "waived its right to assert a 'covered by' defense under [<span class="Italic">SSA</span>] to a statutory obligation to bargain except to the extent the matter is set forth explicitly and comprehensively in an agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the proposals concern a permissive subject because they seek to limit, or partially waive, the Agency's ability to use the statutory "covered by" defense. Although application of the "covered by" defense involves an examination of the parties' collective bargaining agreement to determine what is or is not expressly encompassed in it or inseparably bound up with its terms, this fact does not detract from the Authority's previously established conclusion that the right to raise the "covered by" defense is a statutory right. Stated otherwise, the right to use the "covered by" doctrine as a defense flows from the Statute. As set forth above, <span class="Italic">SSA </span>established the doctrine, consistent with private sector and judicial precedent, to serve the Statute's purposes of stability and repose. The doctrine is based in the Statute; it is not a right that either party must negotiate into a collective bargaining agreement in order to make use of it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that a party cannot be forced to waive its statutory rights, and that a proposal to require such a waiver constitutes a permissive subject of bargaining<span class="Italic">. See Merit Sys. Prot. Bd. Prof'l Ass'n</span>, 30 FLRA 852, 861-62 (1988). Because a party (an agency or a union) cannot be forced to waive its statutory rights and because the "covered by" doctrine constitutes such a statutory right, the proposals here are negotiable only at the election of the Agency. The Agency could choose to agree to a limitation on its ability to use the "covered by" doctrine, but cannot be required to bargain to agree to such a limitation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's assertion that the Authority "should follow its line of cases holding that the covered-by defense is a contractual defense which arises from those provisions found in the parties' collective bargaining agreements" is without merit. For the reasons set forth above, the "covered by" doctrine arises from the Statute, not a contract. Moreover, the Union's reliance on<span class="Italic"> SSA </span>III is unavailing. In <span class="Italic">SSA III</span>, 57 FLRA at 460, the <span id="page_1152"></span>Authority found that the "covered by" doctrine did not apply because neither party was raising the doctrine as a defense to an alleged unlawful refusal to bargain. The Authority made no determination in that case that undermines the statutory nature of the "covered by" doctrine. Accordingly, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">SSA III</span> is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Union's contention that the proposals in this case are mandatory subjects of bargaining because they are similar to mid-term re-opener proposals is also without merit. First, the Union's argument is premised on its view, which we have rejected, that the "covered by" doctrine is based in contract, not in the Statute. Additionally, cases in which the Authority has addressed the negotiability of re-opener clause proposals are not dispositive here because in none of those cases does the record reflect that an agency made the claim, as the Agency does here, that those proposals constituted permissive subjects of bargaining<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n</span>, 56 FLRA 69, 72-73 (2000); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1995</span>, 47 FLRA 470, 472-73 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the proposals in this case concern permissive subjects of bargaining and are negotiable only at the election of the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's conclusion that an agency need only permissively bargain over a reopener clause, and the failure of FLRA to distinguish its treatment of reopener and zipper clauses, fell under attack and suffered remand for reconsideration in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 399 F.3d 334, 337-43 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (following remand and a determination that the proposals were negotiable, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Customs Serv.</span>, 64 FLRA 156 (2009), <span class="Italic">supra</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We review orders of the FLRA in accordance with section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c). Thus, the Authority's decision will not be set aside unless it is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A). The Authority is entitled to "considerable deference when...applying the general provisions of the [Statute] to the complexities of federal labor relations." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S. 89, 97 (1983), 104 S. Ct. 439 (internal quotation marks omitted).

"If an agency construes its charter erratically or inconsistently, however, little or no deference will be owed to its decisions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 643 n.17 (citing <span class="Italic">Adamo Wrecking Co. v.

<p class="noindent-1">The duty to bargain mid-term derives from the FSLMRS's command to both labor and management to "meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4). Although the text of the FSLMRS imposes no explicit obligation to bargain mid-term, we concluded in <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. F.L.R.A.</span>, 810 F.2d 295 (D.C. Cir. 1987), that mid-term bargaining is required under the Statute based on the purpose and legislative history of the Statute as well as analogous private sector precedent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 298-301.[3] The FLRA adopted our position, holding that an agency has a duty to bargain over midterm proposals regarding matters not "contained in the agreement unless the union has waived its right to bargain about the subject matter involved." [4] <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Serv. &#x0026; Nat'l Treasury Employees Union,</span> 29 FLRA 162, 166 (1987). The "contained in" exception to the duty to bargain was borrowed from the private sector. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 158(d). The FLRA gradually refined its understanding of the "contained in" requirement, settling on the "covered by" test enunciated in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>: parties are free from any duty to bargain mid-term over matters "expressly contained in" <span class="Italic">or </span>"inseparably bound up with" a contract term. 47 F.L.R.A. at 1016-18. This approach was intended to balance the twin aims of the Statute: stability in collective bargaining agreements and promotion of collective bargaining to the broadest extent possible. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1018.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;At least one circuit took the opposite position, finding no duty under the FSLMRS to bargain mid-term. <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin. v. FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d 1280, 1288-89 (4th Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Whether a matter is "covered by" the agreement (and therefore exempt from any requirement to bargain mid-term) is analytically distinct from whether a party has "waived" its right to bargain midterm over that matter. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Navy v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 48, 50 (D.C. Cir. 1992) ("A <span class="Italic">waiver</span> occurs when a union knowingly and voluntarily relinquishes its right to bargain over a matter; but where the matter is <span class="Italic">covered by</span> a collective bargaining agreement, the union has exercised its bargaining right and the question of waiver is irrelevant.") (emphasis in original). Here, there is no issue of waiver because the Union made the proposals during end-term bargaining over a new collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue of mid-term bargaining under the FSLMRS reached the United States Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Employees, Local 1309 v. U.S. Dep't of Interior</span>, 526 U.S. 86 (1999) (<span class="Italic">NFFE</span>). There the Court held that "the Statute delegates to the Federal Labor Relations Authority the legal power to determine whether the parties must engage in mid-term bargaining (or bargaining about that matter)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 88. It further held that "Congress delegated to the Authority the power to determine--within appropriate legal bounds--whether, when, where, and what sort of mid-term bargaining is required." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 98-99 (internal citations omitted). On remand from the Supreme Court, the Authority iterated its earlier interpretation that "under the Statute, agencies are obligated to bargain during the term of a collective bargaining agreement on negotiable union proposals concerning matters that are not 'contained in or covered by' the term agreement, unless the union has waived its right to bargain about the subject matter involved." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior &#x0026; U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia</span>, 56 F.L.R.A. 45, 50 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Interior</span>). Like the instant case, <span class="Italic">Interior </span>involved a union proposal made during end-term negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement. The union proposal in <span class="Italic">Interior </span>required mid-term bargaining over all negotiable union proposals "not covered by the provisions of this agreement." <span class="Italic">Interior</span>, 56 F.L.R.A. at 45. The Authority held the proposal to be a mandatory subject of bargaining because it "restates a statutory obligation" and "is not otherwise inconsistent with federal law or government-wide regulation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 50.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case presents an issue left undecided by the FLRA in <span class="Italic">Interior</span>: the negotiability of a mid-term bargaining proposal that does more than "restate[ ] a statutory obligation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under the Statute, mandatory subjects of bargaining are those that involve "conditions of employment," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12). "Conditions of employment" are broadly defined to include "personnel policies, practices, and matters...affecting working conditions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14). The Authority's approach mirrors that of the private sector. <span class="Italic">See Gen. Elec. Co. &#x0026; Int'l Union of Elec. Radio &#x0026; Mach. Workers</span>, 173 N.L.R.B. 253, 257 (1968) ("[P]reliminary matters are just as much part of the process of collective bargaining as the negotiation over wages, hours, etc."), <span class="Italic">enf'd </span>412 F.2d 512 (2d Cir. 1969). <span class="Italic">See also NLRB v. Borg-Warner Corp.</span>, 356 U.S. 342, 349 (1958) (parties have an "obligation...to bargain with each other in good faith with respect to 'wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment'"). Either party may bargain to impasse over mandatory topics. <span class="Italic">Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. &#x0026; Nat'l Treasury Employees Union</span>, 18 F.L.R.A. 768, 771 (1985) (<span class="Italic">FDIC</span>). Permissive subjects, by contrast, are those over which the parties have no obligation to bargain, either because they do not involve "conditions of employment" or because they involve "proposals that a party negotiate to limit a right granted to it by the Statute." <span class="Italic">U.S. Food and Drug Admin. &#x0026; Am. Fed. Gov't Employees</span>, 53 F.L.R.A. 1269, 1274 (1998). Permissive subjects are not bargained to impasse. <span class="Italic">FDIC </span>at 771 ("Clearly, if parties are not required to bargain over permissive subjects of bargaining, it follows that parties cannot insist on bargaining to impasse with respect to such matters...."). Because the parties do not dispute that mid-term bargaining involves a condition of employment, the question is whether the "covered by" doctrine embodies a statutory right the agency cannot be required to waive and therefore the Union's proposals involve only a permissive subject of bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union first argues that, under FLRA precedent, the statutory right to decline mid-term bargaining extends only to matters "resolved" by the collective bargaining agreement and that the "covered by" test is simply a substitute for the parties' intent. Under the Union's theory, the only matters "resolved" by the agreement are the ones intended by the parties to be resolved. Accordingly, a proposal to delineate the scope of the duty to bargain mid-term does not affect the statutory right because it merely clarifies the parties' intentions. The NTEU relies heavily on <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv., Customs Mgt. Ct. &#x0026; NTEU</span>, 56 F.L.R.A. 809 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Customs</span>), in which the Authority held that the parties' intent is an "integral component of [the second prong] of the 'covered by' analysis to determine whether the matter sought to be bargained is inseparably bound up with and thus is plainly an aspect of a subject covered by the contract." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 814. The Union also cites a 1997 memorandum issued by the FLRA General Counsel declaring that "the parties may agree that the contract contains the full understanding and obligation of the parties to negotiate over a specific matter during the term of the agreement." FLRA Office of Gen. Counsel Mem., The Impact of Collective Bargaining Agreements on The Duty to Bargain And The Exercise of Other Statutory Rights, at 16 (March 5, 1997) (<span class="Italic">reprinted in </span>Appendix to Brief for Petitioner).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Union's view of FLRA precedent is not unreasonable, we defer to the Authority's interpretation of its own precedent. The FLRA's decision in <span class="Italic">Customs </span>explains that the second prong of the "covered by" doctrine requires a review of "all the record evidence," of which the parties' intent is a "requisite component" but not the entire inquiry. <span class="Italic">Customs</span>, 56 F.L.R.A. at 814. In essence, in the FLRA's view, the "covered by" test defines the scope of mid-term bargaining in a manner that may be broader or narrower than the parties' intent. In addition, the General Counsel Memorandum cited by the NTEU merely states that the parties "may agree" to define the scope of the duty to bargain mid-term, presumably including an agreement to bypass the "covered by" doctrine; it does not, however, address whether such a proposal would be a mandatory or permissive subject of bargaining. Moreover, the Union offers no statutory text, no FLRA decision and no case law to buttress its claim that the operative language governing the scope of the duty to bargain mid-term<span id="page_1153"></span> covers only "matters <span class="Italic">resolved </span>through the[ ] agreement" (emphasis added), as opposed to matters "'<span class="Italic">covered by</span>' or '<span class="Italic">contained in</span>' a collective bargaining agreement." <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 48, 53 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (emphases added). The "covered by" doctrine embodies the FLRA's long-standing interpretation of the scope of the duty to bargain mid-term under the Statute; accordingly, the Union's attempt to redefine that interpretation fails.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's second argument--that even if the "covered by" test defines the scope of a statutory right, it is not a "unilateral" statutory right, and thus not subject to permissive bargaining only--has more purchase. Many provisions of the FSLMRS confer benefits and impose obligations in varying degrees on labor and management. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111 (agency must grant exclusive recognition to elected labor organization); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at &#x00A7; 7115 (upon request, agency must pay union dues from employee's paycheck); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at &#x00A7; 7119 (Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services available to either party); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at &#x00A7; 7121 (collective bargaining agreement must include grievance procedure). Not all of these provisions constitute "statutory rights" that must be waived before they are negotiable. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. FLRA</span>, 712 F.2d 640 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>), we held that the scope of a statutorily-defined grievance procedure was a mandatory subject of bargaining notwithstanding the fact that bargaining might displace the "standard arrangement" set forth in the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 644. <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv. &#x0026; NTEU</span>, 37 F.L.R.A. 1423 (1990) (agency proposal to permit unilateral reassignment of employees a mandatory subject of bargaining despite union's statutory right to bargain over reassignment decisions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">AFGE </span>we examined the negotiability of proposals that seek to alter the statutory scheme. We noted in particular the difference between provisions that confer "unilateral rights" on one of the parties--like the rights clauses found at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102, 7106 and 7114 [5]--and a provision that "describes in neutral terms a clause that must be included in every collective bargaining agreement." <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 712 F.2d at 646. "At a minimum," we found, "section 7106 demonstrates that Congress knew how to write a provision defining permissive subjects of "bargaining unambiguously." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "The Act securely establishes that all 'conditions of employment' are presumed to be mandatory subjects of bargaining...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 649. This statement holds true "unless the Act explicitly or by unambiguous implication vests in a party an unqualified 'right.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 647 n.27.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;These sections are commonly referred to as the union (&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102, 7114) and management (&#x00A7; 7106) rights clauses. Section 7102 sets out the right of employees to participate in a labor organization and engage in collective bargaining, while section 7114 explains the obligations of the union both to its members and to the management group with which it negotiates. Section 7106 details management's authority to, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, make staffing and budget determinations free from bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent decisions by the FLRA have adopted the reasoning of <span class="Italic">AFGE </span>that limits permissive subjects of bargaining to "'unilateral rights specifically vested in one party.'" <span class="Italic">U.S. Food &#x0026; Drug Admin. &#x0026; Am. Fed. Gov't Employees</span>, 53 F.L.R.A. 1269, 1275 (1998) (quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 712 F.2d at 646) (<span class="Italic">FDA</span>). <span class="Italic">See also Am. Fed. of Gov't Employees, Local 225 &#x0026; U.S. Dep't of the Army Armament Research, Dev. and Eng'g Ctr.</span>, 56 F.L.R.A. 686 (employee performance rating formula falls within statutory management rights under section 7106(a)(2) and therefore a permissive subject of bargaining); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Agric. Food Safety and Inspection Serv. &#x0026; Nat'l Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals</span>, 22 F.L.R.A. 586, 592 (1986) (statutory right to file unfair labor practice charge under section 7118 a permissive subject of bargaining). In <span class="Italic">FDA</span>, the FLRA noted that "unilateral rights may be specifically spelled out in the Statute" or "rooted in more general statutory and policy consideration [sic]." <span class="Italic">FDA</span>, 53 F.L.R.A. at 1275. In order to remain consistent with <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, however, any general statutory or policy consideration giving rise to a unilateral right must be manifested in the Statute by "unambiguous implication." <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 712 F.2d at 647 n.27.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's decision fails to address this precedent. "It is well-established in this circuit that where an agency departs from its prior cases, it must offer a reasoned explanation for its change in view." <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 48, 56 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The FLRA ignored <span class="Italic">FDA</span>'s discussion (which echoed our <span class="Italic">AFGE </span>holding) of unilateral rights in its treatment of the "covered by" doctrine. Rather, the Authority merely stated that it had previously "expressly, and in [its] view correctly, held that the 'covered by' defense constitutes a right under the Statute." Order, 59 F.L.R.A. at 220 (citing <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin. &#x0026; Am Fed. Gov't Employees</span>, 55 F.L.R.A. 374, 377 (1999) (<span class="Italic">SSA II</span>)). This approach might have sufficed had <span class="Italic">SSA II </span>thoroughly addressed the precedent. <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, however, was equally conclusory in its discussion of the nature of the "covered by" doctrine. <span class="Italic">SSA II </span>involved the scope of the agency's duty to bargain mid-term under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) ratified by the parties as part of the collective bargaining agreement. The MOU modified the scope of "covered by" in the context of a mid-term bargaining proposal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 376. In finding that the agency had waived the full scope of the doctrine, the FLRA, without elaboration, stated that "a statutory right, such as the refusal to bargain based on an affirmative 'covered by' defense pertaining to the parties' collective bargaining agreement, is subject to waiver." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 377. Notwithstanding its use of the phrase "statutory right," the Authority's declaration failed to shed much light on the issue presented here. First, its unsupported reference to the "covered by" defense as a statutory right was unnecessary to the holding and is therefore <span class="Italic">dictum</span>. Second, the Authority's statement did not address whether the "covered by" defense is a "unilateral right" within the meaning of <span class="Italic">AFGE </span>and <span class="Italic">FDA</span>, that is, subject only to permissive bargaining. Third, the Authority was discussing the <span class="Italic">waiver </span>of a statutory right under a collective bargaining agreement, not the <span class="Italic">negotiability </span>of a proposal to modify that right. As noted earlier, <span class="Italic">supra </span>note 4, the waiver inquiry is not relevant in the context of end-term negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement. Thus, the issue is not whether the Union's proposals seek a "partial[ ] waive[r]" of the "covered by" doctrine or whether the latter "flows from the Statute," but instead whether the "covered by" defense is a unilateral right explicitly or by unambiguous implication conferred by the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE</span>, 712 F.2d at 646-47 &#x0026; n.27.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's order also fails to explain (or even to discuss) the relationship between the Union proposals at issue and both FLRA and private sector precedent regarding zipper and reopener clauses. A zipper clause is a provision in a collective bargaining agreement that waives the right of either party to raise issues for bargaining during the term of the agreement, whether or not the matter was considered during initial bargaining over the agreement. <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Serv. &#x0026; Nat'l Treasury Employees Union</span>, 29 F.L.R.A. 162, 166 (1987). A reopener clause specifies the conditions under which a party may seek to renegotiate a term "covered by" the agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NLRB v. Lion Oil Co.</span>, 352 U.S. 282, 286 (1957) (describing reopener clause).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argued before the FLRA that its proposals were "'similar to mid-term reopener and zipper clause proposals which also allow the parties to determine for themselves what matters can and cannot be negotiated during the life of the parties' term agreement.'" <span class="Italic">See </span>Order, 59 F.L.R.A. at 219. The FLRA declared the Union's argument "without merit" for two reasons. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 221. First, it characterized the Union's argument as premised on the view that the "covered by" test is a contractual rather than statutory right; a view the Authority simply "rejected." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. But this one-word response fails to explain how the Authority distinguished the Union proposals from a reopener clause. Moreover, as our foregoing discussion of "statutory rights" should make clear, the issue cannot be so easily disposed of. The dispositive question is not whether the proposal involves a "statutory right" but whether that right is "unilateral." <span class="Italic">See AFGE</span>, 712 F.2d at 646-47 &#x0026; n.27.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the FLRA treated its earlier cases discussing the negotiability of reopener clause proposals as "not dispositive" because "in none of those cases does the record reflect that an agency made the claim, as the Agency does here, that those proposals constituted permissive subjects of bargaining." Order, 59 F.L.R.A. at 221. The Authority, however, has often ordered an agency to bargain over a reopener proposal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Am. Fed. Gov't Employees &#x0026; U.S. Dep't of Energy</span>, 47 F.L.R.A. 470, 471-73 (1993); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n Gov't Employees &#x0026; Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr.</span>, 24 F.L.R.A. 147, 148-49 (1986); <span class="Italic">Am. Fed. Gov't Employees &#x0026; Fed. Deposit Ins. Co.</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. 870, 889-91 (1986). While these decisions do not expressly refer to a reopener provision as a mandatory subject of bargaining, they do involve the agency's refusal to bargain over a reopener proposal and the resulting issuance of a bargaining order. In <span class="Italic">Am. Fed. Gov't Employees &#x0026; Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 58 F.L.R.A. 341 (2003) (<span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>), the union proposed a limited reopener clause regarding the implementation of a new computer program. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 342. The agency refused to bargain, claiming that the proposal required the waiver of its statutory management rights under section 7106 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This is precisely the argument made by the Agency here, which the Authority treats as a claim that the issue is a permissive subject of bargaining. But in <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, the Authority rejected the argument and ordered the agency to bargain. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 342-43 (agency "failed to establish" reopener proposal "affect[ed]" its management rights under Statute). <span class="Italic">Cf. id</span>. at 343 (criticizing majority for failing to acknowledge "long and consistent[ ]" precedent that reopener proposal constitutes mandatory bargaining subject) (Member Pope, concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, although a reopener clause is a mandatory subject of bargaining in the private sector, <span class="Italic">see McAllister Bros. &#x0026; Local 333, United Marine Div. Int'l Longshoreman's Ass'n.</span>, 312 N.L.R.B. 1121, 1129 (1993) (citing cases), the FLRA conceded at oral argument that the implication of its opinion is that a reopener clause would be only a permissive subject in the federal sector. Yet while the FLRA declares that it imported the "covered by" doctrine from the NLRB, it has failed to justify its departure from the NLRB's approach to reopener clauses by either identifying "practical distinctions between private and governmental needs" or offering "some evidence in the language, history, or structure of the statute suggesting that Congress intended a different result." <span class="Italic">Am. <span id="page_1154"></span>Fed. Gov't Employees v. FLRA</span>, 853 F.2d 986, 992 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The precedent regarding the negotiability of a zipper clause is not as well established as that for the reopener clause.&#x2003;In one of the few cases involving a <span class="Italic">proposed </span>zipper clause, rather than the implementation of a negotiated zipper clause, the parties seemed to assume that a zipper clause is a permissive subject of bargaining. <span class="Italic">Am. Fed. Gov't Employees &#x0026; Dep't of the Navy</span>, 44 F.L.R.A. 543, 546 (1992) ("The Agency conceded before the Arbitrator [with respect to zipper clause] that a party may not insist to impasse on a permissive subject of bargaining."). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 548 (according to union the "disagreement [was over] a permissive subject for bargaining--the union's refusal to agree [to] zipper language"). While two members of this court have expressed their opinion that bargaining over a zipper clause may be mandatory, neither the FLRA nor our court has squarely addressed this issue. <span class="Italic">See FLRA v. Internal Revenue Serv.</span>, 838 F.2d 567 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (Edwards, J. and Silberman, J., concurring in denial of reh'g) (disputing that FLRA precedent established zipper clause as permissive subject of bargaining); <span class="Italic">see also Interior</span>, 56 F.L.R.A. at 54 (declining to address negotiability of zipper clause). In the private sector, the precedent is also not clearly established. Only the Ninth Circuit appears to have decided the question, concluding that the zipper clause is a mandatory subject of bargaining. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Tomco Communications, Inc.</span>, 567 F.2d 871, 879 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority omits any discussion of the relationship between a zipper clause and the Union's proposals. In some respects, the Union's proposals are arguably more analogous to zipper clauses than they are to reopeners. While a reopener clause is ordinarily limited to particular contractual provisions and by certain triggering circumstances, a zipper clause, like the Union proposals, alters the scope of the duty to bargain midterm with respect to virtually all contract terms (or, in the case of the Union proposals, all terms not resolved by the agreement). In <span class="Italic">Interior</span>, the Authority expressed its intent to wait to determine the negotiability of a zipper clause until the issue is "squarely presented." <span class="Italic">Interior</span>, 56 F.L.R.A. at 54. While this case may not present the issue as squarely as the Authority might like, its short-shrift dismissal of the Union's arguments regarding the relationship between its proposals and a zipper clause provides us once again with little basis upon which to uphold the Authority's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we remand the case to the Authority for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
