<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-97"><span class="space">2.</span> Child Who Qualifies to Receive Annuity or Lump Sum Payment</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The ability of a child to receive a lump sum benefit was explained, <span class="Italic">Stubblefield v. OPM</span>, SF-0831-15-0477-I-1 (NP 6/20/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an employee dies and is survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the annuitant, that child is entitled to an annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(2). A "child" is an unmarried dependent child under 18 and includes a stepchild so long as the employee and the stepchild lived in a "regular parent-child relationship." A "dependent child" is one who the employee was either living with or contributing to his or her support, at the time of the employee's death. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge failed to follow <span class="Italic">Salazar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 248, 250-51 (1986), wherein, in the absence of a definition of a "stepchild" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341, the Board relied, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, on guidance from the Social Security Act (SSA), 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 401, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, to find that the annuitant lived with the appellant in a parent-child relationship so as to entitle her to a survivor annuity as his stepchild, even though he was not legally married to her mother. The appellant urges that, here, the Board should follow "analogous Federal law" and rely on the SSA to find that the child was not Benjamin's stepdaughter because the SSA specifically provides that a stepchild must have been such for 9 months. While under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341, the status of a "widow" depends on the length of time she was married to the employee or annuitant, the status of a "child" or a "dependent child" has no such time qualification. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(1)(A), (3), (4). Imposing one where it clearly does not exist in the operative statute, as the appellant urges, would violate, not promote, its purpose of providing financial assistance to those most likely dependent on deceased Federal employees. <span class="Italic">Salazar</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. at 251.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Canelo v. OPM</span>, 56 MSPR 217, 219-23 (1993), described the statutory and regulatory definition of a "child" eligible for an annuity, with particular reference to what constitutes "dependency" of a child:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A lump-sum benefit is to be paid, based on the service of a deceased Federal employee, if that service does not entitle anyone to a survivor annuity at the time of the decedent's death, or if, before a claim for a survivor annuity is filed, the survivor's right to the annuity has terminated. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8341, 8342(d); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(101 (definition of "survivor"). Accordingly, if Donald Dean Benson was entitled to a survivor annuity from the time of the decedent's death through the time his claim was filed, the appellant is not entitled to the lump-sum benefit she claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The decedent's son was not entitled to a survivor annuity on his father's death in the absence of a showing that he was dependent on his father.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's determination that Donald Dean Benson was entitled to a survivor annuity evidently is based on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(2), which describes the annuity to which a "surviving child" of the decedent is entitled. The term "child" is defined by the applicable statutory provision as including "an unmarried dependent child under 18 years of age," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(4)(A); the term "dependent," in the case of any child, is defined as meaning that, at the time of the death of the employee involved, the employee <span id="Page_4214"></span>was "either living with or contributing to the support of such child, as determined in accordance with such regulations as the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have indicated above, the parties agree that the decedent's son was under 18 years of age at times relevant here. There also appears to be no doubt that the decedent's son was unmarried between the time of the decedent's death and the time the son's claim was filed. The administrative judge found, however, that OPM erred in determining that the son was a "dependent" child during that time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, OPM argues that, pursuant to its regulations, "being a legitimate a child, in itself, satisfies the regulatory definition of proof of dependency." The regulatory section on which OPM relies does provide, in effect, that any legitimate child meets the definition of a "dependent" child. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.615(d)(1)(i). In addition, OPM asserts, and the appellant does not deny, that the decedent's son is legitimate. For the reasons stated below, however, we find that proof that a child is legitimate does not establish that the child is "dependent," as that term is defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cull v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 55 M.S.P.R. 476 (1992), the Board addressed the issue of whether proof that a child was adopted by the decedent established that the child was dependent. It found that, although 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.615(d)(1)(ii) presumed that the child at issue in that appeal was dependent merely because she was an adopted child, this presumption was inconsistent with the unambiguous terms of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(3), which required a showing--even in the case of an adopted child--that the decedent either lived with the child at the time of his death or contributed to her support. <span class="Italic">Cull,</span> at 481. It found further that OPM's regulatory definition of dependency constituted an exercise of discretion not granted to it by Congress, and it concluded that the administrative judge in that appeal had acted properly in applying the provisions of U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(3), rather than the provisions of OPM's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While <span class="Italic">Cull</span> did not address the specific regulatory provision at issue in the present appeal, we find that the reasoning in that decision is applicable here. The statutory definition of "dependent" that is at issue both here and in <span class="Italic">Cull</span> applies to "any child." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(3). Accordingly, just as that definition requires a showing of dependency in the case of an adopted child who did not live with the decedent at the time the decedent died, it also requires a showing of dependency in the case of an unmarried legitimate child who did not live with the decedent at the time the decedent died. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> For that reason, we find that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.615(d)(1), like the regulatory provision at issue in <span class="Italic">Cull,</span> is inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(3) and constitutes an exercise of discretion Congress did not grant OPM. Despite the absence of any regulatory requirement that a legitimate child who did not live with the decedent at the time of the decedent's death be shown to be dependent in order to be found entitled to a survivor annuity, the statutory requirement of dependency must be met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The decedent's son has not been shown to have been a "dependent" child.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues in its petition for review that, even if the decedent's son is required to show dependency in order to establish his entitlement to a survivor annuity, he has made this showing. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not allege, and the record does not show, that Donald Dean Benson lived with the decedent at the time the decedent died. Accordingly, the decedent's son was not entitled to a survivor annuity at the time of the decedent's death unless he establishes that the decedent was contributing to his support at the time of the decedent's death. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge found that the decedent had not been shown to have contributed to his son's support. In making this finding, he relied on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.615(d)(2). OPM argues in its petition for review that the administrative judge erred in applying this regulatory section, and it asserts that the section is applicable only in certain cases involving "recognized natural" (i.e., recognized illegitimate) children.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 831.615(d)(2) lists "examples of proofs of regular and substantial support." The only other part of section 831.615 in which the term "regular and substantial support" is used is paragraph (d)(1)(v), a paragraph dealing exclusively with "recognized natural child[ren] to whose support the employee or retiree made regular and substantial contributions." Because the decedent's son is legitimate, we find that paragraph (d)(2) of section 831.615 is not directly applicable to this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have indicated above, however, OPM erred in promulgating its regulations by failing to apply to legitimate children seeking survivor annuities the requirement that they be dependents of the decedents. Because section 831.615(d)(2) represents OPM's attempt to define the manner in which this requirement may be met, and because the requirement is applicable here, we find that the section's provisions are relevant to the present appeal. We find further that the section indicates that OPM has defined the "contributing to the support" statutory provision as requiring that the decedent's support be "regular and substantial," and that OPM has determined that the kinds of evidence described in the section constitute appropriate evidence of "regular and substantial" support. In the absence of any indication that OPM has exceeded its authority in these respects, we have reviewed the record in the present case in order to determine whether it includes sufficient evidence of "regular and substantial" support of the nature described in section 831.615(d) (2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 831.615(d)(2)(v) states that proof of coverage of the child under the health benefits enrollment plan is an example of proof of regular and substantial support. However, section 831.615(d)(2) also expressly states that more than one proof may be required to show support of a child who did not live with the employee in a regular parent-child relationship and for whom a judicial determination of support was not obtained. Here, while the record shows that the decedent enrolled his son for health benefits under an HMO (health maintenance organization), the enrollment was not effective until January 13, 1991, less than a month before the decedent's death on February 13, 1991. The record also shows that the decedent's parental rights and responsibilities were terminated by court decree in 1980. In addition, the appellant submitted five affidavits, including her own, which state that the decedent did not contribute to his son's support, and copies of the decedent's tax returns which do not show that he contributed to his son's support. Therefore, in view of this evidence, the mere enrollment of his son in his health benefits plan does not establish proof of regular and substantial support by the decedent. Accordingly, we find that the record does not establish that Donald Dean Benson was a dependent child entitled to an annuity. The appellant therefore is entitled to receive a lump-sum payment of the decedent's retirement contributions.</p>

OPM</span>, SF-831M-21-0376-I-1, n.4 (NP 9/16/2022) ("'Title 5, United States Code, section 8341(a)(3) defines 'dependent' only in relation to an involved employee or Member of Congress, apparently omitting any child of an annuitant from its purview. However, excluding a child of an annuitant from this definition of 'dependent' would result in a scenario in which an 'employee' who 'dies after retiring,' meaning an annuitant such as the decedent can leave a surviving child entitled to an annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(2), who could never qualify for that annuity because he is excluded from the definitions of a qualifying 'dependent' or 'child' under section 8341(a)(3) and (a)(4).
