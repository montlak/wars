<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-73"><span class="space">2.</span> Pay Entitlement: Ready, Willing, and Able to Work</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Back pay regulations ensure that employees who are reinstated do not recover more than they would have been entitled to had the unwarranted personnel action not occurred. <span class="Italic">Swafford v. TVA</span>, 30 MSPR 130, 133 (1986). The appellant is entitled to back pay if he was capable of working during the period his removal was in effect. <span class="Italic">Deckert v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 11, 12 (1985). The rule was explained, <span class="Italic">Lyle v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 85 MSPR 324, 326-27 &#x00B6; 6 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Consistent with the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, the agency generally may not include any period during which the employee was not "ready, willing, and able" to perform his or her duties because of an incapacitating illness or injury. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(c)(1). Where the agency produces "concrete and positive evidence, as opposed to mere theoretical argument" that the appellant was not ready, willing, and able to work during all or part of the period during which back pay is claimed, the burden of proof on this issue then shifts to the appellant to show otherwise. <span class="Italic">See Hill v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 60 MSPR 498, 501-502 (1994), <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Piccone v. United States,</span> 186 Ct. Cl. 752, 407 F.2d 866, 876 (1969).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A dispute over the ability of an employee to work and to be entitled to back pay is ordinarily resolved through enforcement proceedings, <span class="Italic">Owens v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-315H-14-0479-I-1 (NP 9/21/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency correctly notes that a back pay award may not include any <span id="Page_4862"></span>period during which an employee was not ready, willing, and able to perform his or her duties because of an incapacitating illness or injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(c)(1). In <span class="Italic">Hodges</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 24, the Board noted that entitlement to back pay is normally a compliance matter, but it decided the issue of Mr. Hodges' entitlement to back pay due to the "unique circumstances" of that case, including that the agency did not learn that Mr. Hodges was able to return to work without restrictions until his doctor testified at the hearing, at which time the agency reinstated him. The Board ultimately concluded that Mr. Hodges was not entitled to back pay because he was not ready, willing, and able to work during the removal period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency has not identified any similar "unique circumstances" in this matter, and, in the absence of current medical documentation in the record, we believe it is not appropriate to render a decision on the appellant's entitlement to back pay at the merits stage. Because this order constitutes the Board's final decision in the removal appeal, the parties shall follow the procedures, described below, regarding calculation and payment of back pay. If the appellant believes that the agency has not complied with the Board's order regarding back pay, he should follow the applicable procedures for filing a timely petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The merits initial decision, according to <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. USPS</span>, DA-0754-15-0375-I-1 (NP 5/13/2022), does not address the specifics of back pay entitlement when an action is reversed; disputes over back pay are left to enforcement proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">In reversing the agency's suspension action and finding that the appellant was not ready, willing, and able to work and thus not entitled to back pay, the administrative judge prematurely addressed a compliance issue in her initial decision. When the Boar</span>d directs an agency to correct an unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the denial of pay otherwise due the appellant, the agency determines the amount of back pay he would have received had the action had not occurred, and the appellant may petition the Board for enforcement of the final decision if he believes that the agency is not in compliance with the decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 550.805(a); 1201.182(a). Given the administrative judge's reversal of the agency's suspension action, her findings regarding the appellant's entitlement to back pay were premature prior to the appellant's initiation of a compliance action.[5] Cf. Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service, 73 M.S.P.R. 512, 517 n.6 (1997) (noting that proving an entitlement to back pay occurs at the compliance stage), rev'd in part on reopening, 79 M.S.P.R. 46 (1998). Accordingly, we vacate the administrative judge's finding that the appellant was not ready, willing, and able to work and thus was not entitled to back pay, and we order the agency to determine the amount of back pay due the appellant and notify him when compliance is complete. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 550.805(a)(2); 1201.181(b). If the appellant believes that the agency has not fully complied with this Final Order, he may petition the Board for enforcement in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182.</p>

Department of the Treasury</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 324, &#x00B6; 6 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the appellant would have only worked for 1 week during the period from September 12, 2003, to January 21, 2004, had he not been suspended. The record evidence supports this assertion. The appellant began working for the agency on July 16, 2001. On July 31, 2001, the appellant applied for Workers' Compensation benefits for an injury he allegedly sustained only 2 days after he began working for the agency. It appears that the appellant worked 50.47 hours during July 2001, but he did not perform any work for the agency from early August 2001, through June 19, 2003. From June 20, 2003, through September 12, 2003, the appellant only worked 13.75 hours. Furthermore, he filed an application for immediate disability retirement on September 9, 2003, 3 days before the constructive suspension period began.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The constructive suspension period ended on January 21, 2004, when the agency ordered the appellant to report for duty or to provide medical evidence indicating the nature of his illness or injury and how his condition impacted his ability to perform his position duties. Yet, the appellant did not return to duty at all during 2004. The record evidence strongly indicates that the appellant would not have been ready, willing, and able to work during a significant portion of his constructive suspension period. Thus, the agency has met its initial burden. <span class="Italic">See Lyle</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 324, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (the agency offered concrete evidence that the appellant was unable to perform his duties during a certain time period based upon letters from his physician so indicating); <span class="Italic">cf. Joos v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 342, 348 (1998) (the agency's "naked assertion of ambiguity and conflicting interpretation" of certain evidence constituted "mere theoretical argument" that was insufficient to shift the burden to the appellant to prove that he was ready, willing, and able to work); <span class="Italic">Hill v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 498, 502 (1994) (where the agency produced no evidence that the appellant was not ready, willing, and able to work, and did not even raise the issue, the appellant was not required to prove that he was ready, willing, and able to work in order to receive back pay).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4863"></span>In light of this concrete evidence, the burden shifts to the appellant to demonstrate that he was ready, willing, and able to work for more than 1 week from September 12, 2003, to January 21, 2004. However, he never responded to the agency's evidence, despite his opportunity to do so. Nor did he contest the agency's computation of the amount of back pay he received for the 1 week.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On average, the appellant worked approximately 26 hours per year from the time he started working for the agency in July 2001, through September 2003, when the constructive suspension period began. Thus, it appears that the agency was generous in providing the appellant with a full week of back pay for the approximately 4 months that he was on enforced leave. The appellant has failed to submit any evidence, other than his bare assertion establishing that he was ready, willing, and able to work more than the week for which the agency has paid the appellant back pay. The appellant has not met his burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reviewed the "ready, willing, and able" formulation as to an employee who suffered a procedurally improper period of enforced leave (LWOP) and who prevailed but found the agency unwilling to pay back pay because his medical condition during the period of enforced leave precluded him from working, <span class="Italic">Eisele v. USPS</span>, 391 Fed. Appx. 862, 864-65 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the withdrawal or reduction in pay is entitled to back pay that "the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that period." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1) (Back Pay Act). "[t]he basic principle of back pay, adopted by Congress in 1948, holds that an employee is entitled to be made whole whenever an erroneous personnel action which has terminated or reduced his compensation is corrected by appropriate authority." <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 184 F.3d 1366, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute itself does not address how an agency must calculate the amount of back pay. Congress authorized the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to prescribe regulations to carry out the Back Pay Act. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(c); <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 184 F.3d at 1370. Pursuant to this authority, OPM issued a regulation instructing that when computing the amount of back pay, an agency may not include pay for "[a]ny period during which an employee was not ready, willing, and able to perform his or her duties because of an incapacitating illness or injury." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805. This reflects the desire to make the employee whole and to avoid overcompensation when it is clear that the employee would not have been able to work even in the absence of the wrongful personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's conclusion that Mr. Eisele was not ready, willing, or able to work due to an incapacitating illness or injury is supported by substantial evidence. Drs. Bradner and Falcon determined that Mr. Eisele was not fit to return to work because of his mental condition, and Dr. Fulmer found that he was unable to work because of his shoulder pain and hemorrhoids. Mr. Eisele himself admitted on an insurance claim that he was "continuously and totally disabled and unable to perform substantially all of his occupational duties from April 17, 2008, to the present." Thus, the Board properly declined to grant Mr. Eisele's petition for enforcement because he was not ready, willing, and able to work during the relevant time frame. Although in her prior opinion the administrative judge ordered the Postal Service to give Eisele back pay, in her second decision (the one here under review) she determined that the amount of back pay actually owed to Mr. Eisele was zero. Thus, effectively, the administrative judge determined that Mr. Eisele was not entitled to back pay. <span class="Italic">See Eisele II</span>, at 5 ("The undisputed evidence here, bolstered by the appellant's own admission in OWCP claims and a disability insurance form, shows that he was not ready, willing and able to work from June 14, 2008, to present, and thus is not entitled to back pay as ordered in the initial decision issued on November 26, 2008.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee is not entitled to back pay for periods he was unavailable for work if that unavailability was unrelated to the underlying unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">Bartel v.

To collect back pay, the employee must prove that he was "ready, willing, and able" to perform at all times during the period between the date of the wrongful action and his reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Cisneros v.

FAA</span>, 24 MSPR 560, 564-65 (1984), explained that the purpose of a back pay award is to construct what the circumstances would have been, had the personnel action never taken place. Under <span class="Italic">Bartel</span>, an employee was not entitled to back pay for periods the employee is unavailable for work as long as the unavailability was not related to the agency's unwarranted personnel action.

USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 238, 243 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is the appellant's burden to show, by affidavit or other proof, that he was able to work during his absence.

An employee is entitled to back pay if, during his separation from the agency, his receipt of workers' compensation benefits was caused by injury or illness resulting from the agency's whistleblowing reprisal. The employer may set off from back pay OWCP payments received during the period of the appellant's separation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

<p class="Body-Text">The determinants of entitlement to back pay deviate from the "ready, willing, and able" to work formulation when the back pay covers a period that the employee was placed out of work by the employer's improper assessment of his ability to work. If removal results from the appellant's lack of fitness for the job, and the removal is then reversed, the appellant should receive pay back to the date of removal, despite the agency's protestations concerning the appellant's inability to work. <span class="Italic">Dwyer v.

His efforts in trying to retain his job prior to his discharge and his many efforts to regain his job subsequent to his discharge amply show that he was both ready and willing to perform.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we adopt the AJ's reasoning and findings with regard to back pay. The question is whether a relapse, as here, vitiates the entire period under consideration for back pay. We find that it does not. An employee who is reinstated after being wrongfully dismissed, however, may not recover more than he would have been entitled to had the unwarranted personnel action never occurred. <span class="Italic">See Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 733; <span class="Italic">Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 24 MSPR 560, 564-65 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that back pay was warranted except for the period from April 4, 1992, when the appellant suffered a relapse, through August 27, 1992, when he was released from incarceration. In making this finding, she stated that the situation here is analogous to Board cases where the appellant is entitled to back pay for only those periods during which he was ready, willing, and able to work, citing <span class="Italic">Hulsey</span>, 57 MSPR at 479, n.14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree. In <span class="Italic">Hulsey</span>, the Board found that an appellant "is entitled to reinstatement and back pay if he has taken all appropriate steps toward rehabilitation and was fit for duty, i.e., rehabilitated, during a period of time when he was discriminatorily placed in a non-duty and non-pay status." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission also has held that an award of back pay contains an implicit finding that the employee is fit for duty and rehabilitated. <span class="Italic">See Holley v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, EEOC No. 03910008, slip op. at 4 (Feb. 15, 1991). While the appellant did not remain completely rehabilitated and totally abstain from alcohol throughout the entire period following his removal, he worked from October 16, 1989 until February 3, 1992, for a private company, indicating that he had abstained from alcohol and enjoyed a state of sobriety and was therefore capable of work for a significant period following his removal. Further, the appellant averred that he received unemployment compensation until April 1993, and his receipt of such compensation was conditioned on his making at least two job attempts per week and remaining ready, able, and willing to work. He further claimed that, since his release from incarceration and as <span id="Page_4865"></span>a condition of his probation, he attends AA meetings twice a week and remains sober.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant is currently active in a alcohol rehabilitative program, and has abstained and continues to abstain from abuse of alcohol, he has shown that he was fit for duty and rehabilitated, except for the period in 1992 noted above. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(c)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">also Holley v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 50 MSPR 271, 273 (1991) (courts have considered an employee's subsequent rehabilitation an important factor in fashioning remedies for discrimination) (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">Winslow v. Department of the Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 246, 250 (1990) (because employee was "unavailable" for duty for reasons unrelated to those caused by the agency's removal action, the agency was relieved from its obligation to pay back pay for the period of time during which he was incarcerated).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency did not dispute with concrete positive evidence the appellant's assertions that he was fit for duty, and therefore ready, willing, and able to work, except as noted above. Nor are we persuaded that the cases cited by the agency require a finding that the appellant's post-removal behavior, i.e., relapse, unalterably disqualifies him from being made "whole" for the discrimination he suffered as a result of his handicapping condition of alcoholism. <span class="Italic">Holley</span>, 50 MSPR at 273-74 (1991). The agency therefore failed in its burden to prove its affirmative defense of no liability for back pay and we adopt the Recommended Decision's finding ordering back pay for the relevant period. <span class="Italic">See Redding v. US Postal Service</span>, 32 MSPR 187, 192 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency has NOT COMPLIED with the Board's decision reversing the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency is ORDERED to issue a check to the appellant for the back pay for the period March 28, 1989, through April 3, 1992, and from August 28, 1992, until June 4, 1993, the date of his reinstatement....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Arbitrators have more latitude to fashion remedies. <span class="Italic">Hunter v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 77 MSPR 589, 596 (1998), approved an arbitrator's award that found the agency did not discriminate against an employee based on disability but mitigated the removal by directing the agency to offer the employee reemployment upon a psychiatrist's certification that the employee was fit to return to duty and denying the employee back pay during the period of termination because he was not then fit to work. The Board stated that "[e]ven if the Board would disagree with the arbitrator's remedy determination, the Board will not substitute its judgment with regard to the remedy provided by the arbitrator, absent legal error."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an enforced leave case, the agency may have constructively suspended an individual without procedural protections by refusing to permit the individual to work until a medical condition abated. The Board may set aside the enforced leave as an unlawful suspension, yet the Board may deny back pay under the "ready, willing, and able" rubric, as in <span class="Italic">Bivens v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 450, 457 (1990): "although the appellant did continually attempt to return to work during his suspension, the facts indicate that he would not have been able to work because of his medical condition." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. USPS</span>, AT-0752-09-0883-C-1 (NP 9/9/2016) (indefinite suspension for inability to work was set aside; back pay was denied during enforcement proceedings after the date that an agency-required fitness for duty exam demonstrated that the appellant could not work); <span class="Italic">Lamb v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 79, 85 (1989) (awarding no back pay for the appellant when the agency could not have provided a suitable work environment for a disabled employee). <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 592, 597-600 (1991), reviewed the connection between the "ready, willing, and able" test and the ability of an employee claiming a disability. The Board's conclusion was that if the appellant was not a qualified disabled employee and could not work because of physical impairment, he would not collect back pay, even though his suspension might be procedurally improper:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To help effect the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, the Board is empowered to enforce the payment of back pay awards.... However, where the agency has shown a substantial basis for questioning the appellant's ability to work, it is incumbent upon the appellant to show that he was ready, willing and able to work during the period of time for which a back pay award is requested. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bivens v. Department of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 450 (1990), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 923 F.2d. 868 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "ready, willing and able to work" prerequisite to back pay usually applies to the position the employee occupied prior to the wrongful agency action. However, in a case where there is a finding of handicap discrimination, a qualified handicapped individual must be "ready, willing and able" to work either in his position or in another position with or without reasonable accommodation without endangering the health and safety of himself and others, and without causing undue hardship to agency operations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gallagher v. US Postal Service</span>, 31 MSPR 53 (1986); <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. US Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 471 (1986) (Special Panel decision). Thus, the issue of handicap discrimination is relevant in a compliance case in determining whether the appellant has been restored to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> in terms of his entitlement to back pay and such a claim must be addressed in the administrative judge's decision on the petition for enforcement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Inasmuch as the allegation of handicap discrimination in this case is relevant to the issue of entitlement to back pay, the Board finds that the administrative judge erred in her finding that the issue of handicap discrimination cannot be addressed for the first time in a compliance petition.... The administrative judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">Gay v. US Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 342, 347 (1988), is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Gay</span>, the Board found that a party to a compliance action cannot belatedly challenge a finding in an Initial Decision that it did not choose to challenge in a petition for review. While this is true, our examination of the Initial Decision...reveals that no finding was made regarding handicap discrimination or its relationship to the appellant's ability to work.... Therefore, unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Gay</span>, this appellant is not belatedly challenging a finding in the Initial Decision when no finding was made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paradoxically, although the administrative judge erred in pronouncing that she could not address the appellant's handicap discrimination claims, this error is not fatal to her decision because she did, in effect, dispose of this issue....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Davis III</span> record establishes that, <span class="Italic">from the time of his injury in 1979</span>, the appellant had a chronic back problem that severely impaired his ability to do heavy lifting. On the recommendation of the appellant's treating physician, <span class="Italic">who certified on April 6, 1984</span>, that the appellant still was totally incapable of any heavy labor and could not perform any type of physical labor, the agency placed medical restrictions on the appellant, including no heavy lifting (nothing over 25 pounds), pushing, pulling, bending, stooping, walking, standing, or sustaining any positions. The appellant's physician further certified that the appellant could do sedentary work such as "driving, directing, overseeing, or counseling." The appellant's physician confirmed the appellant's condition and restrictions <span class="Italic">on October 30, 1984</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the hearing for <span class="Italic">Davis III</span>, witnesses testified that the essential duties of a sandblaster required physical effort in excess of the appellant's restrictions and the duties could not be modified to accommodate the appellant's restrictions without further endangering the appellant or exposing his coworkers to added risks because they would not have adequate relief or backup support. Agency witnesses also testified that efforts had been made to place the appellant in another position, but his lack of education and specialized skills, coupled with his medical restrictions, precluded his qualifying for any vacant positions <span class="Italic">during the period of his enforced leave at issue</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because the appellant was unable to perform the essential duties of his position with or without reasonable accommodation from the time of his injury until his removal and because he did not meet the qualification standards of any vacant positions to which he could have been reassigned during the entire period of his enforced leave, the appellant was not a qualified handicapped person and there could not be handicap discrimination in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148 (1988).

USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 219, 226 (1991) (on restoration rights claim arising during enforcement proceedings: "The agency may not now raise the argument that the appellant is not physically qualified for these positions because this issue has been previously litigated and decided."); <span class="Italic">Gay v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 342, 347 (1988) (after a merits determination that the agency's denial of the appellant's restoration rights was the result of disability discrimination, AJ erred by allowing the agency to offer evidence during an enforcement action of undue hardship of accommodating the appellant's partially recovered condition). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cuda v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 195, 203-04 (1998), determined that an AJ's finding that an employee was not physically disqualified for work would prevent relitigation or collateral litigation of the employee's readiness for work from at least the date of the initial decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge found that the appellant's sleep apnea did not substantially limit his ability to perform the duties of his position. Nonetheless, the agency contends that this finding does not resolve the question of whether the appellant is eligible for back pay under its Employee and Labor Relations Manual, Section 436.23, which excludes back pay for periods when the employee was not ready, willing and <span id="Page_4866"></span>able to perform the duties of his position. The agency argues that the administrative judge's finding is called into question by the answer given by James Kohan, M.D., the physician treating the appellant for sleep apnea, to a question by agency counsel at the hearing on July 17, 1996. In response to the question, "when did you say that Mr. Cuda will be able to return to work?," Dr. Kohan replied that "I haven't said that yet. I haven't cleared him yet." In the agency's view, Dr. Kohan's testimony entitled the agency to require the appellant to submit medical evidence of fitness for duty before reinstating him.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The agency also relies on a provision of its personnel handbook requiring medical documentation to be submitted by returning employees who have been absent more than three weeks because of illness or injury. However, this provision does not apply to the appellant because his absence was due to the agency's removal action reversed by the Board, and therefore it does not excuse the agency's failure to reinstate him. <span class="Italic">See Gottlieb v. Veterans Administration</span>, 44 MSPR 298, 302 (1990) (where agency showed no basis for requiring appellant to submit to medical evaluation before it would comply with the Board's reinstatement order, result of evaluation was irrelevant and did not justify noncompliance with order).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the appellant was entitled to rely on the administrative judge's finding that his impairment did not substantially limit his ability to work. Based on his physician's testimony that with treatment he would be able to return to work, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant's "impairment does not constitute a significant barrier to the appellant's employment." This conclusion precludes an argument that the same impairment was one which made the employee unable to work for purposes of back pay. The administrative judge's decision became the final decision of the Board, and we find that the agency is bound by her conclusion that the appellant's sleep apnea was not shown to disable him for employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her recommendation, the administrative judge rejected the agency's argument that Dr. Kohan's testimony called the appellant's ability to work into question on the ground that the testimony related only to the appellant's ability to perform his duties as a Postmaster and never questioned his ability to work in other jobs. We agree with the agency that his testimony had a broader application that [sic] just to the appellant's former position. However, as explained below, we find that the testimony indicates that with treatment the appellant's sleep apnea would not prevent his employment generally.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the agency were not bound by the administrative judge's finding as to the appellant's ability to return to work, we find that the hearing testimony of the appellant's physician, considered in its entirety, does not support the agency's refusal to reinstate the appellant until he submitted medical documentation. Dr. Kohan's testimony clearly indicated that the appellant's sleep apnea was treatable, was being treated, and that with treatment the appellant would be able to resume his duties. When asked at the July 1996 hearing to estimate the time when the appellant would be able to return to work, Dr. Kohan estimated that it would be "less than 30 days." The administrative judge's September 27, 1996, finding that the appellant was able to work is entirely consistent with this testimony, and we find that it does not support the agency's refusal to reinstate the appellant without medical clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we find that the administrative judge's decision cannot reasonably be construed to find that the appellant was able to work prior to the September 27, 1996, decision in view of Dr. Kohan's July 17 hearing testimony that, while full recovery was anticipated in less than 30 days, the appellant was not yet cleared for work. In addition, a February 13, 1996, memo from Dr. Kohan states that the appellant was being evaluated for sleep apnea and should remain out of work until fully evaluated and treated. In a letter to the appellant's counsel dated May 24, 1996, the doctor describes the appellant's treatment and places his return to work in the future by stating that "a full recovery is anticipated." The appellant relies entirely on the administrative judge's finding and has submitted no evidence countering the agency's evidence that he was unable to work because of his impairment from February 13, 1996, until some time after July 17, 1996, or showing a specific date on which he was able to return to work prior to the September 27, 1996, decision on which he relies. Thus he has failed to show an entitlement to back pay prior to that time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant is entitled to back pay from September 27, 1996 to March 10, 1997, when he was actually returned to the rolls, at the rate of pay of the position in which he is placed pursuant to this decision, and from March 10, 1997, until his placement in a position under this decision in the amount of difference between the pay of that position and the pay that he has received since March 10, 1997.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If fitness issues were not litigated before enforcement proceedings, fitness may be an issue. [Refer to the later discussion in this chapter concerning "<a href="0100-2023-23-161.html#sec16-159">Other Post-Reinstatement Action; Medical Certification Requirement</a>."] <span class="Italic">Redding v.

However, in order to confine this burden within reasonable limits, the courts "require the Government to 'demonstrate that it has some concrete and positive evidence, as opposed to a mere theoretical argument, that there is some substance to its (affirmative defense) and is not a mere fishing expedition' or a method of discouraging employees from seeking back pay on meritorious claims because of the cost of providing readiness, willingness, and ability to perform since the adverse action." <span class="Italic">Piccone</span>, 407 F.2d at 876....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...While it is true that the agency has the right to determine when to reinstate an individual returning to work after a protracted period of illness or injury, the Board has the authority to determine when a wrongfully removed employee is entitled to wages he would have earned but for a wrongful removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In conclusion, the agency has not provided concrete and positive evidence that the appellant was unwilling to work during the period in question. We find that the appellant has met his burden and, therefore, the agency cannot find him ready, willing, and able to return to duty for reinstatement purposes, but not for purposes of back pay, when the information relied upon in both cases is the same and establishes that the appellant was at all times ready, willing, and able to perform.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant claims that he was the victim of reprisal or discrimination causing sufficient stress to incapacitate him for a period covered by a removal that is set aside, the Board will not award pay, on reinstatement, for the period of disability if the AJ determined that the appellant was not the victim of reprisal, harassment, or discrimination and that finding was not challenged through PFR.

Department of the Air Force</span>, 60 MSPR 498, 501-502 (1994), <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Piccone v. United States,</span> 407 F.2d 866, 876, 186 Ct. Cl. 752 (Ct. Cl. 1969). The appellant must then prove that he was ready, willing, and able to perform the duties of his position at all relevant times.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency relied upon the appellant's own evidence to question the appellant's medical ability to return to duty. To prove that he was ready, willing, and able to perform the duties of his position, the appellant submitted his own affidavit as well as an affidavit from his psychologist, Daryl K. Hamblin, Ph.D. In his affidavit, the appellant stated "I had been stress-free and ready to return to work a few weeks after I left work under Dr. Hamblin's care in October, 1994. After a brief episode in early March, 1995, I was again ready, willing, and able to return to work." Later in his affidavit the appellant states "I was ready, willing, and able to return to work within a few weeks after I was fired on February 27, 1995, just as Dr. Hamblin said I would be." According to Dr. Hamblin's affidavit, "[i]f decreased symptoms were used as a marker for his being ready, willing, and able to return to work, I would have returned him to work in early January, more specifically, the first work day of that [sic] 1995." Dr. Hamblin further stated that he believed that "conditions in the organization effected [sic] Mr. Bullock's ability to return to work as much or more than his own psychological status," and concluded that "[h]ad there been some way in October of 1994 to protect Mr. Bullock form [sic] further harassment, he would have been able to return to work by the end of October." In response to these affidavits, the agency submitted a letter that it had received from Dr. Hamblin responding to its inquiry concerning the date on which the appellant's mental status returned to normal. In this letter, Dr. Hamblin indicated that the appellant was prepared to return to work in December, 1996. He also indicated that if the appellant had returned to work in November, 1994, "it would probably have been only a short time before he was again stressed to the point <span id="Page_4867"></span>that he would have had difficulty functioning optimally." With regard to the period between his removal and reinstatement, Dr. Hamblin stated that the appellant "was very stressed and would have had difficulty working; at other times he would likely have done very well." In letters that Dr. Hamblin provided to the agency shortly after the appellant was first absent from work, he recommended that the appellant not return to work under the same chain of command, and he indicated that the likelihood of subtle and sudden catastrophic incapacitation was high if the appellant was forced to return to work under the same conditions. Based on these statements, the administrative judge determined that the appellant was not entitled to back pay because she found that there was no medical evidence to show that the appellant was medically able to perform his duties between October, 1994, and July 13, 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the evidence that the appellant provided was insufficient to prove that he was ready, willing, and able to perform the duties of his position during the period encompassed by the Back Pay Act. Dr. Hamblin consistently based his statements concerning the appellant's ability to return to work during this period on a transfer or significant changes in the appellant's working conditions and the cessation of perceived harassment by the agency.[9] However, an appellant is not entitled to back pay, including restoration of annual leave, for any period during which he was not ready, willing, and able to perform the duties of his position because of an incapacitating illness or injury, or for reasons unrelated to or not caused by the unjustified or unwarranted personnel actions. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(c)(1), (c)(2); <span class="Italic">see Hill v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 69 MSPR 453, 456 (1996); <span class="Italic">Winslow v. Department of the Navy,</span> 46 MSPR 246, 250 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 935 F.2d 280 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). The appellant here has failed to show that his claims of harassment meet these requirements. Generally, an appellant is entitled to back pay only if he is ready, willing and able to work in the position the employee occupied prior to the wrongful agency action<span class="Italic">. See Davis,</span> 50 MSPR at 598. The appellant's apparent willingness to return to work during the back-pay period in a position other than the one he occupied prior to his removal is not sufficient to establish his entitlement to back pay in the absence of a finding of handicap discrimination. <span class="Italic">Cf. Cason v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 37 MSPR 261, 270 (1988) (valid claim of handicap discrimination required agency to consider position accommodation). Therefore, the appellant was not entitled to back pay for the period encompassed by the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The appellant's argument concerning the administrative judge's consideration of his harassment claims is not properly before the Board on petition for review. In the initial decision that addressed the appellant's removal, the administrative judge found that the appellant could not prove that officials removed him in retaliation for filing Equal Employment Opportunity complaints. <span class="Italic">Bullock v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> MSPB Docket No. AT-0752-95-0649-I-1, slip op. at 12 (Initial Decision, July 14, 1995). The appellant did not file a petition for review or a cross petition for review challenging this finding, and he is precluded from doing so on petition for review of the compliance decision. <span class="Italic">See Roque v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management,</span> 55 MSPR 50, 52 (a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see Smith v. Dept. of Army</span>, 458 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (back pay liability established by an invalid adverse action (constructive suspension) may extend beyond the period of a removal that is not appealed if the removal would not have occurred had the agency provided the accommodation that would have avoided the earlier adverse action). [Refer earlier to "<a href="0100-2023-23-068.html#sec16-68">Collateral Result of Restoration Order; Action Related to Case Under Appeal</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Events may remove doubt regarding the appellant's ability to work for the agency. If the employee is in jail, or if he is ill, it can reasonably be said that he is unavailable for work and cannot collect back pay for the period of his incarceration, or for the period of illness, that followed dismissal and preceded his successful appeal, <span class="Italic">Marshall v. GPO</span>, 37 MSPR 349, 350-52 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In its brief, the agency argues that it is not liable for any back pay between March 30, 1982, and October 2, 1985. This argument is based on an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulation which prohibits an award of back pay for any:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Period during which an employee was unavailable for the performance of his or her duties for reasons other than those related to, or caused by the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(c)(2). In reliance on this regulation, the agency contends that the appellant is not entitled to any back pay during the disputed period because he would have been unavailable for duty. According to the agency, he would have been unavailable because he would have been indefinitely suspended on March 30, 1982, as a result of an arrest on that day on various weapon and drug charges and subsequently would have been removed on the basis of the misconduct underlying the arrest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 27, 1987, because of the novelty of the issue presented, the Board requested an opinion in this matter from the General Accounting Office (GAO). GAO's authority under 31 USC &#x00A7; 3702 over monetary claims of or against the government includes the authority to resolve back pay disputes. In a letter dated February 23, 1988 (B-229264), the General Counsel of GAO advised the Board that the agency should grant the appellant back pay up to the date of his incarceration for the felony conviction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The response provided to the Board by the GAO is instructive and persuasive. Based upon our review of the record in this case, the following reasoning contained in the GAO opinion is dispositive:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We believe that Mr. Marshall can be considered "unavailable" for work only during those periods when he was actually incarcerated. We agree with the MSPB Administrative Judge that it is too speculative to determine whether GPO would have suspended and removed the employee upon his arrest in March 1982 or upon his arrest in October 1984. Unless GPO is able to sustain a retroactive adverse action based upon either his first or second arrests, we conclude that Mr. Marshall would be considered available for work and entitled to back pay up to the date of his felony incarceration in October 1985.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We also note, however, that there appear to be two periods of illness, July 20, 1982 to February 20, 1983, and March 21, 1984 to May 9, 1984, for which Mr. Marshall, upon request, could be granted sick or annual leave, if any is available. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(d) (1987). Lastly, we note that Mr. Marshall was also incarcerated for brief periods in late 1984 and early 1985.... Should the MSPB decide that Mr. Marshall is entitled to backpay to the date of his incarceration on October 2, 1985, those earlier periods of incarceration should be deducted from the backpay award.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holleman v. MSPB</span>, 629 Fed. Appx. 942, 947 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP) (employee is not entitled to back pay while he is incarcerated and unavailable for work); <span class="Italic">Winslow v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 246, 250-51 (1990) (agency was not required to allow the employee to participate in its work release program; the appellant's absence as a result of incarceration meant that he was not ready, willing, and able to perform his duties during that period of time for the purposes of back pay entitlement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee who is improperly removed from his position and then enters active military duty is not entitled to back pay for the period after his entrance on duty; active service renders him unavailable for performance of the duties of his civilian job. Active military service is incompatible with concurrent civilian service, however limited the duties of the particular military assignment. The result is the same when military service is entered as a result of the appellant's termination. <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp</span>., FAA, 850 F.2d 682 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 32 MSPR 488, 493 (1987) (relying on decisions of the Comptroller General). [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-035.html#sec8-36">Incarceration; Work-Release Program</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may not deduct amounts from pay for hypothetical unavailability for work. It was improper to make deductions from back pay for time that the agency assumed the appellant would have spent on union activities in leave without pay status. Neither the Back Pay Act regulations, providing at 5 CFR 550.805(a)(1) (2022) that an employee shall be deemed to have performed service for the period covered by the reinstatement order, nor the FPM, permitted that deduction. <span class="Italic">Marren v. DOJ</span>, 32 MSPR 285, 288 (1987). The Board reaffirmed its approach in <span class="Italic">Marren v. DOJ</span>, 34 MSPR 520, 524 (1987), determining, first, that an agency may not place an employee on LWOP without his request or assume that the employee would have requested LWOP, and, second, that under the authority of 63 Comp. Gen. 20, 22 (1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Mr. Marren was free to spend the entire period of his unwarranted removal performing union business, internal or otherwise, or any other nonremunerative pursuit of his choice, without adversely affecting a potential back pay award. As to the appellant's being "away from his duty station" at times during the period of his unwarranted removal, Mr. Marren's status at that time was that of a <span class="Italic">former</span> employee who had neither a duty station nor a corresponding obligation not to be away from it. His only obligation to the agency during the period of his unwarranted removal was to maintain that minimum of contact necessary for communicating an offer to return to his former position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In analogous circumstances, the Board determined that if an employee was removed in reprisal for union activities on the pretext of medical inability to perform duties, a period of enforced leave preceding the removal was a constructive suspension. It was part of the improper disciplinary action and the employee was ready, willing, and able to work. <span class="Italic">Clements v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 21 MSPR 275, 277 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Manzi v. United States</span>, 198 Ct. Cl. 489 (1972)). The Board suggested "for clarity" in <span class="Italic">Clements</span> that if an agency has improperly forced an employee to use leave, restoration of leave, and not its monetary equivalent, is the appropriate remedy (citing <span class="Italic">Ainsworth v. United States</span>, 185 Ct. Cl. 110 (1968)); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Marshall v. GPO</span>, 37 MSPR 349, 350-51 (1988) (agency cannot deduct from back pay compensation for a period of time that it believes appellant would have been off the rolls through an indefinite suspension if he had been on the rolls to permit the imposition of an indefinite suspension).</p>
