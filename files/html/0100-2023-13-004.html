<h2 class="h2" id="sec5-5"><span class="space">II.</span> EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS</h2>
<p class="noindent">Bargaining is limited to conditions of employment. The statutory definition is taken from 5 USC 7103(a)(14):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_481"></span>"conditions of employment" means personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions, except that such term does not include policies, practices, and matters--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A)&#x2003;relating to political activities prohibited under subchapter III of chapter 73 of this title;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(B)&#x2003;relating to the classification of any position; or</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I&#x2003;to the extent such matters are specifically provided for by Federal statute;...</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1897 and Dept. of Air Force, Eglin AFB</span>, 24 FLRA 377, 378-79 (1986), resolving as negotiable agency health insurance contributions for NAF employees, helped to explain the "conditions of employment" analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute provides that the scope of the duty of an agency to bargain with an exclusive representative of its employees extends to "conditions of employment," which term is further defined as "personnel policies, practices and matters affecting working conditions." Section 7103(a)(12) and (14). Excluded from the definition of conditions of employment are matters: (1) relating to political activities prohibited under subchapter III of chapter 73 of title 5; (2) relating to the classification of any position; or (3) to the extent such matters are specifically provided for by Federal statute. Section 7114(a)(14). The Statute also excludes from the <span class="Italic">scope of the duty to bargain</span> proposals which concern conditions of employment but which are inconsistent with law and regulation. Section 7117(a). Thus, under the Statute a proposed matter which is a condition of employment and is not inconsistent with applicable law or regulation is within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another NAF case, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1363 and Army Garrison, Yongsan, Korea</span>, 12 FLRA 635, 635-36 (1983), provided definition:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's proposal concerns the dispensation of alcoholic beverages in certain membership associations of nonappropriated fund instrumentalities (NAFIs). The effect of the Union's proposal is to prohibit the dispensation of alcoholic beverages only to persons on duty, as opposed to prohibiting the dispensation of such beverages to all employees during duty hours, as provided under an Agency regulation. The sole contention of the Agency is that dispensation of alcoholic beverages in membership association NAFIs is not a condition of employment within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute, and therefore is outside the scope of bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The duty to bargain under the Statute extends only to "conditions of employment," i.e., personnel policies, practices, and matters affecting working conditions.[1] In construing that statutory phrase, the Authority has found proposals which concern matters directly affecting "the work situation and employment relationship" of bargaining unit employees to be within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">E.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Internal Revenue Service,</span> 3 FLRA 693 (1980). <span class="Italic">See also American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO and Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio,</span> 2 FLRA 604, 606 (1980), <span class="Italic">enforced as to other matters sub nom. Department of Defense v. Federal Labor Relations Authority,</span> 659 F.2d 1140 (D.C. Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom. AFGE v. FLRA,</span> 455 U.S. 945, 102 S. Ct. 1443 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;Section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Authority concludes that the dispensation of alcoholic beverages in membership association NAFIs has no direct relationship to the work situation and the employment relationship of unit employees.

<p class="noindent">The terms "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" are sometimes used interchangeably for purposes of defining a bargaining duty, as the D.C. Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP v. FLRA</span>, 647 F.3d 359, 364-66 (2011) (aff'g. <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 989, 995 (2010)), sustaining FLRA's finding of a ULP when the agency unilaterally implemented a national policy, known as the Revised National Inspectional Assignment Policy (RNIAP), concerning work schedules and assignments:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CBP contends in the alternative that it had no duty to bargain over the changes it made pursuant to the RNIAP because they did not alter inspectors' "conditions of employment." Under the FSLMRS, federal employees have the right "to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through" union representatives. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102(2). "Conditions of employment" are "personnel policies, practices, and matters" that "affect[&#8197;] working conditions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14). CBP argues that this statutory language supports a legally significant distinction between "conditions of employment," which it says are the governing policies and procedures an agency follows when changing an employee's work assignments, and "working conditions," which it says are the more narrow day-to-day circumstances of a particular job. <span class="Italic">See Dep't. of Def. Dependents Schs. V. FLRA</span>, 863 F.2d 988, 990, 274 U.S. App. D.C. 299 (D.C.

According to CBP, although an agency must bargain when it alters a governing policy or "condition of employment," it need not bargain when making small-scale changes in working conditions. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't. of Labor, OSHA, Region I, Boston, Mass. (Dep't of Labor, Boston)</span>, 58 F.L.R.A. 213, 217 (2002) (Cabaniss, Chairman, concurring) ("Our precedent, in its discussion of the statutory duty to bargain, focuses on whether there has been a change to 'conditions of employment' and not whether 'working conditions' have been changed."); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't. of the Air Force, Headquarters, 96 Air Base Wing, Eglin Air Force Base, Fla. (Dep't. of the Air Force, Fla.)</span>, 58 F.L.R.A. 626, 626 (2003) (Cabaniss, Chairman, concurring) ("As there was no change here to the underlying personnel policy, practice, or matter affecting what work assignments [the employees] had to do, there was no change to bargain over, even though...the [employees']...'working conditions'[&#8197;] had been changed."). CBP contends that the adjustments it made in this case to work schedules and overtime eligibility were localized changes to particular inspectors' working conditions and that only a change to the terms of the RNIAP itself--the governing assignment policy or "condition of employment"--would trigger a duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority reasonably rejected CBP's argument. To begin with, the Authority has previously held that there is "no substantive difference between 'conditions of employment' and 'working conditions' as those terms are practically applied." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't. of Homeland Sec.</span>, 64 F.L.R.A. at 995 (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't. of the Air Force, 335th MSG/CC, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz. (Dep't. of the Air Force, Ariz.)</span>, 64 F.L.R.A. 85, 90 (2009)) (internal quotation mark omitted). We think this conclusion is reasonable, given that both courts and the Authority "have accorded [working conditions] a broad interpretation that encapsulates a wide range of subjects that is effectively synonymous with 'conditions of employment.'" <span class="Italic">Dep't. of the Air Force, Ariz.</span>, 64 F.L.R.A. at 90; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Fort Stewart Schs. V. FLRA</span>, 495 U.S. 641, 645, 110 S. Ct. 2043, 109 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1990) ("[T]he term 'working conditions' [as defined in the FSLMRS] more naturally refers...to the 'circumstances' or 'state of affairs' attendant to one's performance of a job."); <span class="Italic">Antilles Consol. Educ. Ass'n.</span>, 22 F.L.R.A. 235, 237 (1986) (stating that, in examining whether a proposal affects "working conditions," the Authority looks to the "work situation or employment relationship" of employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, CBP's actions in this case easily satisfy the Authority's two-pronged test for whether a matter concerns a condition of employment over which an agency must bargain: "(1) Whether the matter...pertains to bargaining unit employees; and (2) [t]he nature and extent of the effect of the matter...on working conditions of those employees." <span class="Italic">Antilles Consol. Educ. Ass'n.</span>, 22 F.L.R.A. at 236-37. The changes CBP made to work schedules, overtime policies, and other matters "pertain[ed] to bargaining unit employees," and also had a significant "effect" on inspectors' working conditions. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dep't. of Labor, Boston</span>, 58 F.L.R.A. at 216 (Cabaniss, Chairman, concurring) (explaining that "an employee's work starting and stopping times" are "working conditions").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, CBP asserts that the Authority's conclusion conflicts with case law holding that an agency does not alter conditions of employment when it applies an existing personnel policy in a way that affects an employee's work assignments. For example, in <span class="Italic">Department of Labor, Boston,</span> an agency employee voluntarily transferred from a position that authorized use of an agency vehicle to a position that did not. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> At 213-14. The Authority held that the agency's refusal to allow the employee to continue using the vehicle did not change her conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> At 216. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Service, Houston District, Houston, Texas (INS, Houston)</span>, 50 F.L.R.A. 140 (1995), the Authority determined that reassigning inspectors to a different shift that had been used for many years did not change their conditions of employment, because the agency "as a routine matter--assign[ed] and reassign[ed] inspectors to different shifts based on anticipated workload requirements," <span class="Italic">see id.</span> At 144; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't. of Homeland Sec., Border &#x0026; Transp. Sec. Directorate, U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., Border Patrol, Tucson Sector, Tucson, Ariz.</span>, 60 F.L.R.A. 169, 174 (2004) (finding that CBP decision that increased workload at particular station did not change inspectors' conditions of employment, because decision did not alter "the 'type' of aliens that were <span id="page_482"></span>being processed, the type of work that [station] employees performed, or, in any manner, the processing of alien apprehensions"); <span class="Italic">Dep't. of the Air Force, Fla.</span>, 58 F.L.R.A. at 626, 629 (upholding arbitrator finding that where agency had "an established practice of modifying work assignments in response to mission and workload functions," a decision resulting in employees spending less time on their own aircraft and more time on other aircraft was "merely a variation of existing assignment practices, not a bargainable change in conditions of employment").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CBP argues that, like the agencies in those cases, it had no duty to bargain over the disputed work assignment changes in this case because it was merely applying existing policies (as set forth in the RNIAP). But as the Authority explained, the cases CBP cites are inapposite because they all "concern[ed] an agency's application of an existing, established practice." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't. of Homeland Sec.</span>, 64 F.L.R.A. at 994 n.11. Here, by contrast, although CBP "followed" the RNIAP, it did so to change rather than apply established practices. In Seattle, the agency revoked the seven-day work week; in Miami and Los Angeles, it changed the overtime policy. These were new assignment practices, changes from CBP's previous way of doing things.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the practices at issue in the cases CBP cites were much narrower in scope than the RNIAP. For example, in <span class="Italic">Department of Labor, Boston,</span> the established "practice" was to provide agency vehicles only for certain positions. In <span class="Italic">INS, Houston,</span> it was to reassign employees among existing shifts based on anticipated workloads. Here, by contrast, the established "policy" was to unilaterally set work hours, workweek length, days off, staff levels, job duties, work locations, overtime eligibility, and more, with the sole requirement that they be set in accordance with "operational requirements" or "operational needs." Were we to take the view CBP urges, the agency would be free to make significant changes to all sorts of work assignment practices without ever involving the Union. None of the cases upon which CBP relies sweeps so broadly. The Authority reasonably concluded that those cases do not govern the dispute here and adequately explained that conclusion in its decision below.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">First, the Authority has previously held that mere increases or decreases in normal duties do not constitute changes over which an agency must bargain.[37]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 577, 579-80 (2012) (finding that an increased workload did not constitute a bargainable change), <span class="Italic">pet.

<p class="noindent-1">Second, the memorandum did not change the <span class="Italic">nature of</span> or the <span class="Italic">type of</span> duties the officers performed. In effect, the memorandum conveyed instructions from the division chief to his agents detailing how they were to perform inspections when it came to referring vehicles from the primary to secondary lane for additional scrutiny. Supervisors have the responsibility, and must have the prerogative, to direct, redirect, and even adjust how employees perform their jobs.[38] A supervisor does not have to negotiate with the union every time she adjusts or alters how employees will perform their duties.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Third, the directions contained in the memorandum did not change anything and they did not impact a condition of employment. Both before and after the memorandum, the agents continued to perform vehicular inspections at either the primary or secondary inspection areas using the same techniques.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Statute did not require CBP to bargain in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also found that CBP violated Article 3A.&#x2003;But Article 3A expressly states that the parties are not required to bargain over any matter that they are "not obligated to negotiate under applicable law." Because we have determined that the Statute does not require CBP to bargain with the Union under these circumstances, CBP also was not obligated to bargain under Article 3A. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's finding of a contractual violation also cannot stand.[42]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span> does not support the Authority's conclusion that the terms "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" have distinct meanings. However, as the Agency notes, that conclusion is based on the plain wording of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14)--not <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>. Section 7103(a)(14) defines the term "<span class="Italic">conditions of employment</span>" as those "personnel policies, practices, and matters" which "<span class="Italic">affect[</span><span class="Italic">&#8197;</span><span class="Italic">] working conditions</span>." Applying a basic canon of statutory interpretation,[20] the Authority in <span class="Italic">DHS</span> found that those two <span class="Italic">different</span> terms--one of which Congress used <span class="Italic">to define</span> the other--cannot mean the same thing.[21] When referring to <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>, the Authority found it persuasive that the Court had previously recognized that "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" are susceptible to <span class="Italic">distinct</span> interpretations.[22] Therefore, contrary to the Union's contention, that case <span class="Italic">does</span> support the conclusion that "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" are <span class="Italic">not</span> synonymous terms.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union next argues that the Authority in DHS erred in its conclusions of law because none of the cases that the Authority cited stand for the proposition that variations to the volume of employees' normal duties do not constitute changes over which an agency must bargain. This is simply untrue. The Authority cited <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, Border and Transportation Security Directorate, U.S. CBP, Border Patrol, Tucson Sector, Tucson, Arizona (CBP)</span>.[24] In that case, the agency was responsible for patrolling the United States border with Mexico and apprehending, and then processing, illegal aliens.[25] After the agency experienced a "sharp increase in illegal[-]alien activity,"[26] it began rerouting detained aliens to the Tucson Station for processing.[27] As a result, employees working at the Tucson Station saw a significant increase in their "processing" duties.[28]</p>

<p class="noindent">The majority opinion in the underlying <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1929</span> decision gave but an unelaborated footnote reference a Supreme Court decision that drew little distinction between conditions of employment and working conditions, <span class="Italic">Ft. Stewart Sch. V. FLRA</span>, 495 U.S. 641, 645-46 110 S. Ct. 2043 (1990), involving the negotiability of pay and benefits for teachers of the Army's Ft. Stewart school system:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority concluded that the Union's proposals related to "conditions of employment," following its decision in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1897</span>, 24 F.L.R.A. 377, 379 (1986) (AFGE). 28 F.L.R.A., at 550-551. Petitioner claims that this was error because &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) defines "conditions of employment" as matters affecting "working conditions," and because the latter term most naturally connotes "the physical conditions under which an employee labors." The difficulty here, of course, is that the word "conditions" has two common meanings. It can mean matters "established or agreed upon as a requisite to the doing...of something else"; and it can also mean "attendant circumstances," or an "existing state of affairs." Webster's Third New International Dictionary 473 (1961). Whereas the term "conditions of employment" in &#x00A7; 7102 seems to us equally susceptible of both meanings, petitioner is correct that the term "working conditions" in the defining provision of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) more naturally refers, in isolation, only to the "circumstances" or "state of affairs" attendant to one's performance of a job. <span class="Italic">See Department of Defense Dependents Schools v. FLRA</span>, 274 U.S. App.D.C. 299, 301, 863 F.2d 988, 990 (1988) ("The term 'working conditions' ordinarily calls to mind the day-to-day circumstances under which an employee performs his or her job"), <span class="Italic">rehearing en banc granted</span>, No. 87-1733 (Feb. 6, 1989). Even if, however, it could not reasonably be interpreted to bear the other meaning in isolation, here it is not in isolation, but forms part of a paragraph whose structure, as a whole, lends support to the Authority's broader reading.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) specifically excepts from the definition of "conditions of employment" (and thus suggests <span class="Italic">are covered</span> by the term "working conditions") "policies, practices, and matters...relating to political activities prohibited under subchapter III of chapter 73 of this title." The subchapter referred to contains restrictions on partisan political activities of federal employees and protects them from being required or coerced to engage in political activity. It is barely conceivable, but most unlikely, that this provision of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) was meant to exclude from collective-bargaining proposals that would somehow infect with politics the "physical conditions" of the workplace; it seems much more plausibly directed at "conditions of employment" in the sense of qualifications demanded of, or obligations imposed upon, employees. And the second exception set forth in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14), as set forth above, <span class="Italic">unquestionably</span> assumes that "conditions of employment" (and hence "working conditions") bears this broader meaning. The exception of "policies, practices, and matters...relating to the classification of any position" would be utterly unnecessary if petitioner's interpretation of "working conditions" were correct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It might reasonably be argued, of course, that these two exceptions are indeed technically unnecessary, and were inserted out of an abundance of caution--a drafting imprecision venerable enough to have left its mark on legal Latin (<span class="Italic">ex abundanti cautela</span>). But petitioner does not make this argument. Indeed, in its reply brief petitioner claims that it is "a serious distortion of [its] position," to characterize it, as respondent Union does, as asserting that "negotiations over 'working conditions' are limited to the physical conditions under which an employee labors." Petitioner asserts that, to the contrary, it "recognize[s] that the phrase 'conditions of employment' is no doubt susceptible of diverse interpretations," including an interpretation whereby it would embrace "any subject which is insisted upon as a prerequisite for continued employment," and petitioner even acknowledges, with apparent approval, that the phrase in the present statute "has been extended beyond the purely physical conditions of the workplace."...The textual argument is thus abandoned. Petitioner seeks to persuade us, not (as respondent Union does) that the term "conditions of employment" (as defined to include only "working conditions") bears one, rather than the other, of its two possible meanings; but rather to persuade us that it bears some third meaning no one has ever conceived of, so that it includes <span class="Italic">other</span> insisted-upon prerequisites for continued employment, but does not include the insisted-upon prerequisite <span class="Italic">par excellence</span>, wages. And this new unheard-of meaning, petitioner contends, is so "unambiguously expressed," <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 467 U.S., at 843, 104 S. Ct., at 2781, that we must impose it upon the agency initially responsible for interpreting the statute, despite the deference otherwise accorded under <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>. To describe this position is sufficient to reject it, but we nonetheless examine briefly the elements petitioner sets forth to establish that "conditions of employment" clearly has a meaning here that it bears nowhere else.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS or Statute), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., requires federal agencies to notify and negotiate with unions before changing federal employees' conditions of employment. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) distributed a memorandum (Memo) to its agents changing vehicle inspection procedures at the El Paso border checkpoint. The American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1929, AFL-CIO (AFGE or Union) filed a grievance on behalf of the CBP agents claiming that the CBP failed to notify and negotiate with it before issuing the Memo. After an arbitrator found in favor of the AFGE, the Federal Labor Relations Authority (Authority) set aside the arbitrator's award, concluding that the memo did not constitute a change over which the CBP must bargain. because the Authority failed to reasonably explain its departure from precedent and its conclusion that the Memo was not subject to bargaining under the Statute, we grant the Union's petition, concluding that the Authority's order was arbitrary and capricious and remanding to the Authority for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FSLMRS "requires a federal agency to negotiate in good faith with the chosen representative of employees covered by the Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4), and makes it an unfair labor practice to refuse to do so, &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5)." <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Sch. V. FLRA</span>, 495 U.S. 641, 644 (1990). "The scope of the negotiating obligation is set forth in &#x00A7; 7102, which confers upon covered employees the right, through their chosen representative, 'to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102(2)). "It is well established that before changing conditions of employment, an agency must provide the union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over those aspects of the change that are within the duty to bargain." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec. U.S. Citizenship &#x0026; Immigration Servs</span>., 69 F.L.R.A. 512, 515 (2016).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute defines "conditions of employment" as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">conditions of employment means personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions, except that such term does not include policies, practices, and matters--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(A)&#x2003;relating to political activities prohibited under subchapter III of chapter 73 of this title;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(B)&#x2003;relating to the classification of any position; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">I &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x2003;to the extent such matters are specifically provided for by Federal statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employing agency in this case is the CBP.&#x2003;The employees are CBP agents who conduct vehicle inspections at border checkpoints in the El Paso, Texas sector. The agents' primary responsibility at the checkpoints is to inspect vehicles entering the United States. The checkpoint is divided into two areas--the primary inspection area and the secondary inspection area. The primary area consists of lanes in which vehicles first enter, stop and are inspected. In this area, agents inspect the vehicle, scan the license plate number and examine the occupants' identifying documents. The secondary area is designed for additional inspection. Agents in the primary area have discretion to send a vehicle to the secondary area for a more thorough inspection--where information like license plate numbers and identifying document data can be run through various databases. The main distinction between the two areas is the duration of the stop and the singling out of a vehicle for additional inspection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2014, the CBP division chief for the El Paso sector discovered that some agents in the primary area were failing to detect fraudulent documents. To address this lapse, the division chief distributed a memorandum to agents entitled "El Paso Sector Checkpoint Operations." The Memo directed agents to (1) "send vehicles with more than one occupant when at least one of the occupants is a non U.S. citizen who present[s] some form of immigration document, to the secondary inspection area for a more thorough immigration inspection, interview, document review, and if needed to conduct a records check" and to (2) "request a second form of identification from non U.S. citizens in order to further confirm the identity of the presenter." The Memo allowed agents to modify the Memo's instructions at their discretion in order to accommodate "local residents, daily commuters, and other trusted travelers who regularly pass through" or when "safety to the public and/or our agents may be an issue, i.e. traffic is backed up, weather related issues, etc."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the Memo, the AFGE filed a grievance on behalf of the agents alleging that the CBP violated the Statute by changing a condition of employment without notifying and negotiating with the Union. The CBP denied the grievance and the parties submitted the matter to arbitration. The arbitrator agreed with the AFGE, concluding that the CBP had changed a condition of employment by issuing the Memo and thus violated the Statute by failing to first notify and negotiate with the Union. Specifically, the arbitrator found that the Memo changed the agents' duties by lessening the primary area agents' discretion to decide who to send to the secondary area, requiring them to determine when the secondary lane was too backed up, increasing the vehicular traffic in the secondary area and potentially requiring them to input more data for referred vehicles into their databases. The arbitrator also found that the Memo raised reasonable safety concerns for secondary area agents who must manage an increase in traffic, persons and inspections.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The CBP filed exceptions to the arbitration award with the Authority.&#x2003;The Authority issued an order setting aside the award. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec. U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot. El Paso, Tex</span>., 70 F.L.R.A. 501 (2018) (<span class="Italic">El Paso I</span>). First, the Authority took "the opportunity" to correct its "erroneous" precedent by "clarify[ing] that there is a distinction between" the terms "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" in the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 501, 503. Second, the Authority concluded that the Memo did not constitute a change that must be bargained over for three reasons: (1) its past decisions had "held that mere increases or decreases in normal duties do not constitute changes over which an agency must bargain," (2) the Memo "did not change the <span class="Italic">nature of</span> or the <span class="Italic">type of</span> duties the officers performed," and (3) "the directions contained in the [Memo] did not change anything and they did not impact a condition of employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 503-04.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union moved for reconsideration.&#x2003;The Authority denied the motion, relying largely on the reasons supporting its original order. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec. U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot. El Paso, Tex</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. 49 (2019) (<span class="Italic">El Paso II</span>). The AFGE now petitions for review of the Authority's orders.[1]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;In the proceedings before the arbitrator and the Authority, the AFGE also challenged the Memo as violating the parties' collective bargaining agreement but, on appeal, does not challenge the Authority's order with respect to the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have jurisdiction of the AFGE's petition for review under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a). "The Authority must 'provide a rational explanation for its decision' but in reviewing unfair labor practice determinations, the court 'recogniz[es] that such determinations are best left to the expert judgment of the [Authority].'" <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. FLRA</span>, 745 F.3d 1219, 1224 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (alterations in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We "will set aside an order of the Authority only if it is 'arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1223 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c) ("Review of the Authority's order shall be on the record in accordance with section 706 of this title."). Under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review, we must ensure that the Authority "examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made." <span class="Italic">Fred Meyer Stores, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 865 F.3d 630, 638 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (alterations in original) (citation omitted). Put differently, to survive arbitrary and capricious review, the Authority must show that it engaged in "reasoned decisionmaking," <span class="Italic">id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Allentown Mack Sales &#x0026; Serv., Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 522 U.S. 359, 374 (1998)), and that its decision was "reasonable and reasonably explained," <span class="Italic">Cytori Therapeutics, Inc. v. FDA</span>, 715 F.3d 922, 926 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Finally, although "the Authority may depart from its precedent," we have explained that "[a]n agency changing its course must supply a reasoned analysis indicating that prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed, not casually ignored." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Emps. V. FLRA</span>, 369 F.3d 548, 553 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (alteration in original) (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also FedEx Home Delivery v. NLRB</span>, 849 F.3d 1123, 1127 (D.C. Cir. 2017) ("[O]n matters to which courts accord administrative deference, agencies may change their interpretation and implementation of the law if doing so is reasonable, within the scope of the statutory delegation, and the departure from past precedent is sensibly explained." (citing <span class="Italic">Nat'l Cable &#x0026; Telecomms. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Servs</span>., 545 U.S. 967, 1001-02 (2005))).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Authority's <span class="Italic">El Paso I</span> order failed to reasonably explain its departure from precedent and its decision denying the AFGE's bargaining request. Specifically, it failed to explain how its decision comports with the express language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14). The Authority characterizes its decision as clarifying the terms of the Statute but its rationale provides more questions than answers. Its order, then, is arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;THE STATUTE AND AUTHORITY PRECEDENT</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin with the Statute itself.&#x2003;"Conditions," on its own, is subject to "two common meanings"--(1) "matters 'established or agreed upon as a requisite to the doing...of something else'"; or (2) "'attendant circumstances,' or an 'existing state of affairs.'" <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>, 495 U.S. at 645 (citation omitted). Thus, "conditions," as used in the statutory phrases <span id="page_485"></span>"conditions of employment" and "working conditions," is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. But unlike the phrase "working conditions," which is undefined by the Statute, "conditions of employment" is expressly defined in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) as "personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule or otherwise, affecting working conditions." Therefore, no matter what ambiguity exists in "conditions" generally, the Statute's definition of "conditions of employment" requires an agency to bargain over changes in personnel policies, practices and matters that affect working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For that reason, the Authority's claim in <span class="Italic">El Paso I</span> that "the issuance of a memorandum which affects working conditions, but not conditions of employment, does not constitute a change over which CBP must bargain," <span class="Italic">El Paso I</span>, 70 FLRA at 501, would appear, at first blush, to contradict the Statute. If the relevant inquiry under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) is whether an agency's action constitutes a change in "personnel policies, practices, and matters...affecting working conditions," it would seem that a memo that affects working conditions is, by definition, a condition of employment over which the agency must bargain. The only way this would not be accurate is if the memo is not a <span class="Italic">personnel policy, practice or matter</span>. The Authority understands this point on appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> Resp. Br. At 21 ("The more natural reading of term 'conditions of employment' is that an agency is not obligated to bargain over 'working conditions' as such, but only a more limited subset of 'personnel policies, practices, and matters...that 'affect[&#8197;] working conditions'" (alteration in original) (quoting &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14)). But that understanding and explanation are wholly lacking in <span class="Italic">El Paso I</span>, where it counts. <span class="Italic">See Temple Univ. Hosp., Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 929 F.3d 729, 734 (D.C. Cir. 2019) ("[C]ourts may not accept appellate counsel's <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> rationalization for agency action; <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> requires that an agency's discretionary order be upheld, if at all, on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself." (quoting <span class="Italic">Erie Brush &#x0026; Mfg. Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 700 F.3d 17, 23 (D.C. Cir. 2012)) (citing <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery Corp</span>., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947))).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Instead, in <span class="Italic">El Paso I</span>, the Authority took "the opportunity" to alter its precedent "to clarify that there is a distinction between" conditions of employment and working conditions but failed to explain its departure from precedent. <span class="Italic">El Paso I</span>, 70 F.L.R.A. at 501, 503. Before <span class="Italic">El Paso I</span>, the Authority defined "working conditions" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) broadly, maintaining that "there is no substantive difference between [the terms] 'conditions of employment' and 'working conditions' as those terms are practically applied." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force 355th MSG/CC Davis-Monthan Air Force Base</span>, 64 F.L.R.A. 85, 90 (2009); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec. v. FLRA</span>, 647 F.3d 359, 365 (D.C. Cir. 2011) ("[B]oth courts and the Authority have accorded [working conditions] a broad interpretation that encapsulates a wide range of subjects that is effectively synonymous with conditions of employment." (second alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).[2] In <span class="Italic">El Paso I</span>, the Authority concluded that its earlier view was "erroneous" because it violated the "canon of statutory interpretation that 'Congress acts intentionally' when it 'inclu[des] or exclu[des]' particular words in a statute" and amounted to "circular reasoning." 70 F.L.R.A. at 503 (alterations in original). The Authority then concluded that "[i]t is...imperative that we respect that distinction and define the differences for the labor-management relationships community." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;We have upheld the Authority's earlier interpretation of conditions of employment and working conditions as reasonable. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 647 F.3d at 364-65. But that holding does not necessarily prevent the Authority from changing its interpretation so long as the change is within the Authority's discretion and is reasonably explained. <span class="Italic">See Brand X</span>, 545 U.S. at 982 ("A court's prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to Chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion."); <span class="Italic">FedEx Home Delivery</span>, 849 F.3d at 1127.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Beyond stating that "[t]he terms are related, but they are not synonymous," <span class="Italic">id</span>., however, the Authority fails to explain the differences between the terms or how the alleged differences matter under the language of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14). First, the Authority has misread United States Supreme Court precedent. It quotes the High Court's <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span> decision for the proposition that "while the term 'conditions of employment' is susceptible to multiple interpretations, the term 'working conditions,' as used in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14), 'more naturally refers...only to the "circumstances" or "state of affairs" attendant to one's performance of a job.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>, 495 U.S. at 645). But the Supreme Court, in deciding whether an employer was required to bargain over wages and benefits in <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>, explained that "working conditions" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) "more naturally refers, in isolation, only to the 'circumstances' or 'state of affairs' attendant" to one's job performance. 495 U.S. at 645 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). But the Court clarified that "here it is not <span class="Italic">in isolation</span>, but forms part of a paragraph whose structure, as a whole, lends support to the Authority's broader reading." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 646. By omitting the phrase "in isolation" and the High Court's subsequent clarification, the Authority misreads <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span> to imply that "working conditions" has a free-standing definition when, in fact, the point being made in <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span> is the opposite.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Authority fails to explain how its definition of "working conditions" differs from the statutory definition of "conditions of employment." It concludes the terms are <span class="Italic">not</span> synonymous but then defines working conditions based on a misreading of <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>. It goes no further, leaving a gap in its reasoning. It does not explain how to tell the difference between what constitutes a condition of employment versus a working condition. More importantly, it does not explain how its revised interpretation substantively changes what aspects of employment are bargainable under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Authority argues that it did explain the difference by relying on concurrences of former FLRA Chairman Dale Cabaniss in earlier cases. But the Authority cites those concurrences only to support the proposition that conditions of employment and working conditions are not synonymous, <span class="Italic">see</span> 70 F.L.R.A. at 503 n.33; it does not elaborate on Cabaniss's view of the distinction between the terms. And if we look to Cabaniss's explanation of how conditions of employment and working conditions are different, that explanation does not help the Authority on the facts of this case. In the cited concurrences, Cabaniss articulated the distinction between the two terms:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As reflected in our Statute, "conditions of employment" is a term of art expressly defined at &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) that means "personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions." Clearly, "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" are related, but they are not the same thing. For example, "working conditions" would be an employee's work starting and stopping times, or whether the employee has the ability to take home a government owned vehicle (GOV): "conditions of employment" would be the "rules, regulations, or otherwise" that define the hours of work for the bargaining unit, or determine whether or what employees have the right to take that GOV home.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr. Sheridan, Wyo</span>., 59 F.L.R.A. 93, 95 (2003) (Cabaniss, Chairman, concurring). Under this reasoning, a memo setting forth procedures for where and how agents conduct inspections would seem to meet Cabaniss's definition of conditions of employment. In other words, had the Authority in <span class="Italic">El Paso I</span> used Cabaniss's formulation to explain the distinction between working conditions and conditions of employment under the Statute, it still would not provide sufficient support for the Authority's conclusion--without further explanation--that the CBP was not required to bargain over the Memo.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Authority departed from precedent based on a misreading of case law and without explaining the departure. Such a change is not "sensisibly explained." <span class="Italic">FedEx Home Delivery</span>, 849 F.3d at 1127.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;THE MEMO</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also fails to explain its determination that the Memo is not a change over which the CBP must bargain.&#x2003;First, the Authority turns to precedent concluding that an agency need not bargain over "mere increases or decreases in normal duties." <span class="Italic">El Paso I</span>, 70 F.L.R.A. at 503 (citing <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union (NTEU)</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. 577, 579 (2012)). But the Authority fails to mention that <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> applies only if the increase or decrease is "not attributable to any change in the agency's policies, practices, or procedures affecting working conditions." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 579. Increases or decreases "'[s]tanding alone' do not trigger notice-and bargaining obligations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (alteration in original) (citation omitted). Granted, in a case involving changes in the location of the processing of immigrants in response to an unusual influx of immigration at the U.S. border, the Authority determined that "[e]ven if we were to consider that increase to be attributable to the Respondent, we would find, based on our precedent, that dismissal of the complaint is warranted because there was no change in unit employees' conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec.

But in that decision the Authority went on to say that "nothing in the record establishes that the Respondent changed the 'type' of aliens that were being processed, the type of work that bargaining unit employees performed or, <span class="Italic">in any manner, the processing of alien apprehensions</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). Here, on the other hand, to the extent the duties of the secondary area agents increased, that increase was caused by the change in procedure dictated by the Memo. Moreover, unlike <span class="Italic">CBP Tucson</span>, the Memo changed the inspection procedure in the primary and secondary areas--as noted earlier, agents were required to conduct inspections in the primary and secondary areas in ways different from those used before the Memo's issuance.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;On appeal, the Authority also relies on <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Headquarters, 96th Air Base Wing, Eglin Air Force Base, Fla. (Eglin)</span>, 58 F.L.R.A. 626 (2003), where the Authority concluded that <span id="page_486"></span>an instruction letter changing crew chief assignments at a U.S. Air Force base did not change any established practice (and thus the conditions of employment) because it found the agency had an established practice of modifying work assignments based on mission and workflow fluctuations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 630; <span class="Italic">see also CBP Tucson</span>, 60 F.L.R.A. at 174 (citing <span class="Italic">Eglin</span>, 58 F.L.R.A. at 626). Unlike <span class="Italic">Eglin</span>, where the agency changed the aircraft that engineers were assigned to work on, the Memo changed how agents conduct border inspections--i.e. their practice--in the primary and secondary areas, including how and where agents direct certain vehicles. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> the changes do not constitute changes in personnel policies, practices or matters that affect agents' working conditions, El Paso I fails to explain why they do not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Authority maintains that the Memo "did not change the <span class="Italic">nature of</span> or the <span class="Italic">type of</span> duties the officers performed." <span class="Italic">El Paso I,</span> 70 F.L.R.A. at 503. Relying on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A), (B), the Authority noted that supervisors have the responsibility and prerogative to direct how employees perform their jobs, concluding that "[a] supervisor does not have to negotiate with the union every time she adjusts or alters how employees will perform their duties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. What is missing from this analysis is any connection to the definition of conditions of employment in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14). In other words, the Authority does not explain how the nature of or type of duties performed is relevant under the statutory definition of conditions of employment.[5] After spending the bulk of its discussion emphasizing the importance of distinguishing conditions of employment from working conditions, the Authority fails to tie its analysis back to those terms under the Statute. Moreover, although the Authority cites 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A), (B) for the proposition that "management has the right to 'direct...employees,' 'assign work,' and 'determine the personnel by which agency operations shall be conducted,'" <span class="Italic">El Paso I,</span> 70 F.L.R.A. at 503 n.38 (quoting &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A), (B)), the very next subsection says that "[n]othing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating...procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section," &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2). The Memo in this case arguably goes beyond merely assigning work in that it changes the inspection procedures at border checkpoints, at least slightly, but to the extent it does involve assigning work and determining personnel, it would constitute the procedure which CBP management observe in making those decisions. As such, neither &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) or (B) appear to help the Authority here.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;And to the extent that the Authority relies on <span class="Italic">CBP Tucson</span> for this proposition, <span class="Italic">see El Paso II</span>, 71 F.L.R.A. at 51, as explained above, that case is distinguishable and the Authority fails to explain how the Memo in this case does not change "in any manner" the inspection procedures performed at border checkpoints. <span class="Italic">See CBP Tucson</span>, 60 F.L.R.A. at 174.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the Authority concludes that "the directions contained in the memorandum did not change anything and they did not impact a condition of employment." <span class="Italic">El Paso I</span>, 70 F.L.R.A. at 504. But the Memo plainly changed <span class="Italic">something</span>. What the Authority must make clear--and has not--is whether the change was a change in a personnel policy, practice or matter that affected working conditions. On its face, the Memo changes how and where certain inspections are performed at border checkpoints, which results in different instructions for agents in the primary area, more cars in the secondary area and the potential of increased risk to secondary area agents. The Authority fails to explain why these changes do not constitute a change in conditions of employment under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies reading <span class="Italic">El Paso I</span> are left wondering how the Authority reached its decision that the CBP was free to issue the Memo without bargaining in light of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14)'s language and so are we. Was it because the Memo did not affect working conditions? Was it because the Memo was not a personnel policy, practice or matter? Was it because of some other rule or exception? An agency decision that fails to answer such basic questions is not the product of "reasoned decisionmaking." <span class="Italic">See Tramont Mfg., LLC v. NLRB</span>, 890 F.3d 1114, 1119 (D.C.

<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;70 FLRA 501, 502 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Border patrol agents inspect individuals' immigration status and vehicles trying to enter the United States. The agents conduct inspections using "primary" and "secondary" inspection areas. The primary purpose of these inspections is to "apprehend illegal aliens and smugglers." Based on discovered deficiencies in primary lane inspections, the Agency issued an inspection memorandum (memo) that directed the agents to perform vehicle inspections in the secondary area when certain criteria were met. The Arbitrator found that the inspection memo constituted a change to a condition of employment that was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that the inspection memo changed the practice of referring vehicles to secondary inspection because it required agents to refer certain vehicles to the secondary inspection area instead of referrals based solely on agents' suspicions, changed the duties of primary inspection agents, decreased the number of primary area inspections, and increased the duties in the secondary area. Therefore, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute) and Article 3 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement when it failed to provide the Union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over the inspection memo.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">El Paso</span>, the Authority found that the Arbitrator erred by finding that the Agency had a duty to bargain over the inspection memo because the inspection memo did not constitute a change to a condition of employment.[13] In reaching this conclusion, the Authority emphasized that "'[c]onditions of employment' are...'personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, <span class="Italic">affecting working conditions</span>.'"[14] As such, the Authority held that the inspection memo did not constitute a change to a condition of employment because it did not affect working conditions.[15]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's finding that the inspection memo led to a more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> change to conditions of employment is based on numerous nonfacts.[19] The Authority has held that disagreement with an arbitrator's evaluation of evidence, including the weight to be accorded such evidence, does not provide a basis for finding that an award is based on a nonfact.[20] The Agency's nonfact exceptions merely constitute disagreement with the Arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence.[21] The Agency argues about the weight and value of evidence but fails to demonstrate that the Arbitrator's conclusions are based on nonfacts. Therefore, the exceptions fail to demonstrate how the Arbitrator's conclusions were based on nonfacts.[22] As such, we deny the Agency's nonfact exceptions.[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">a. <span class="Italic">The award is not contrary to law</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to law[24] because it is inconsistent with Authority precedent on conditions of employment. Specifically, the Agency argues the award is contrary to law because the inspection memo was not a change to a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;The Authority reviews questions of law <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv. V. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In conducting a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority determines whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings unless the excepting party established that they are nonfacts. <span class="Italic">NLRB Prof'l Ass'n</span>, 71 FLRA 737, 739 (2020) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP</span>, 68 FLRA 728, 731 (2015) (stating that in ULP cases, the Authority also defers to the arbitrator's factual findings)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Statute, an agency is obligated to provide the Union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over a change to a condition of employment.[26] The Authority asks two questions to determine whether there was a change to a condition of employment: (1) whether there was an actual, agency-initiated change to a personnel policy, practice or matter, and (2) whether the change affected working conditions.[27]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Space &#x0026; Missile Sys. Ctr., Detachment 12, Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M</span>., 64 FLRA 166, 173 (2009) (Member Beck concurring); <span class="Italic">see generally</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the first question is whether there was an actual, agency-initiated change to a personnel policy, practice, or matter. Here, the Arbitrator found that prior to the inspection memo, there was a "long-standing practice to refer vehicles to the secondary inspection area based upon suspicion," and that this past practice was part of the agents' training. The Arbitrator also found that the inspection memo changed this past practice by removing the "subjective duty of suspicion from the agent in the primary [inspection area]." As discussed above, the Agency does not demonstrate that these findings are nonfacts; therefore, we defer to these factual findings,[30] including that there was an actual change to a personnel practice.[31]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[30]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2338</span>, 71 FLRA 343, 344 (2019).

Inst., Miami, Fla</span>., 71 FLRA 660, 663-64 (2020) (Member Abbott concurring; Member DuBester dissenting). However, in this case, the Agency failed to make and support the arguments that would allow us to disturb the Arbitrator's findings. As such, we are constrained by the Arbitrator's findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[31]&#x2003;We note that this is consistent with the Court's finding in <span class="Italic">Local 1929</span>. <span class="Italic">See Local 1929</span>, 961 F.3d at 461 (finding that the inspection memo "plainly changed <span class="Italic">something</span>," because it "change[d] how and where certain inspections are performed..., which results in different instructions for agents in the primary area, more cars in the secondary area and the potential of increased risk to secondary area agents").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next question is whether the change to a personnel policy, practice or matter affects working conditions. Congress used "working conditions" to define "conditions of employment" when it enacted the Statute.[32] While the Statute defines "conditions of employment" as "personnel policies, practices, and matters...affecting working conditions,"[33] it does not provide a definition for "working conditions."[34] Because Congress left "working conditions" undefined in the Statute,[35] we find that Congress intended "working conditions" to have a definition consistent with case law developed by the Federal Labor Relations Council (the Council) under Executive Order No. 11,941.[36] This definition is also consistent with Authority precedent before 2009,[37] which is when the Authority erred in finding that "working conditions" and "conditions of employment" were synonymous.[38] Therefore, we find the term "working conditions" must be separately analyzed and we define "working conditions" as the circumstances or state of affairs attendant to one's performance of a job. Therefore, to determine whether the Agency had a duty to bargain, we must ask whether the change to a personnel policy, practice, or matter affects the circumstances or state of affairs attendant to one's performance of a job.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[32]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14). Our dissenting colleague is content to continue interpreting the Statute in a manner that defies its plain wording. Rather than try to reconcile why Congress used the phrase "working conditions" to define "conditions of employment," the dissent would have the Authority preserve an interpretation that finds different terms "synonymous." Dissent at 12. This interpretation runs afoul of the surplusage canon, as it would render the definition in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) to be circular and meaningless and would fail to give independent meaning to all the terms used in that section. <span class="Italic">Reiter v.

Indeed, there is no indication from the Statute's text or legislative history that Congress intended these <span class="Italic">different</span> phrases in the Statute to have <span class="Italic">identical</span> meanings. In fact, the dissent itself acknowledges that Congress endorsed a distinction between the phrases "working conditions" and "conditions of employment" by "replac[ing] the term 'working conditions' from Executive Order No. 11,941 with the term 'conditions of employment'" in the Statute. Dissent at 11 (quoting <span class="Italic">El Paso</span>, 70 FLRA at 506 (Dissenting Opinion of Member DuBester)).

The fact that the courts and Authority accorded "working conditions" a broad interpretation, does not justify a conclusion that the terms are synonymous.

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the inspection memo changed the practice of referring vehicles to secondary inspection based on suspicion to a practice of mandatory referrals of certain vehicles to the secondary inspection area, changed the duties of the primary inspection agents, decreased the number of primary area inspections, and increased the duties in the secondary area. As discussed above, the Agency does not demonstrate that these findings are nonfacts. Based on the Arbitrator's undisturbed findings that the inspection memo changed personnel practices, policies, or matters, and in light of the Court's findings about the effect of the inspection memo,[42] we find that the Agency made a change that affected the working conditions of the border patrol agents--i.e. the circumstances or state of affairs attendant to the performance of their duties. Thus, we are constrained to find that the inspection memo was a change to a condition of employment.[43]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[42]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Local 1929</span>, 961 F.3d at 460 ("[T]he [m]emo changed the inspection procedure in the primary and secondary areas--...agents were required to conduct inspections in the primary and secondary areas in ways different from those used before the [m]emo's issuance."); <span class="Italic">id</span>. At 461 ("On its face, the [m]emo changes how and where certain inspections are performed at border checkpoints, which results in different instructions for agents in the primary area, more cars in the secondary area and the potential of increased risk to secondary area agents.")</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[43]&#x2003;We note that the Agency did not argue in its exceptions that the award was contrary to law because the change was less than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. Exceptions Br. At 9-10. <span class="Italic">But see id</span>. At 10-11 (Agency arguing that the Arbitrator's conclusion that the change was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> was based on nonfacts). Therefore, we stop our analysis at whether the inspection memo was a change to a condition of employment. We further note that Education, which was not in effect at the time the Court made its decision, requires that a change must have a "substantial impact" to require bargaining. <span class="Italic">Education</span>, 71 FLRA at 971. Consequently, if the Agency had argued that the award was contrary to law because the changes were not sufficiently significant to trigger its bargaining obligations, then the Authority would have conducted the substantial-impact analysis that appears at the end of Part III. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the conclusion reached above is constrained by the law of this case, we take this opportunity to expand on the analysis for the benefit of the federal labor relations community and to give the appropriate meaning to "working conditions" moving forward. The Agency failed to argue that the award was contrary to law because the change was less than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. As such, we were not able to reach that question. Were we able to do so, we would have concluded that the Agency did not have a duty to bargain. The inspection memo was simply a supervisory exercise of the prerogative to provide additional instruction to employees regarding their job duties. Such a change is minimal, and therefore, not sufficiently significant to trigger bargaining obligations.[47] This conclusion is also supported by the fact that the Statute requires all provisions to "be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government."[48] It is a fundamental notion that a supervisor must be able to modify instructions based on changing circumstances, of which employees may or may not be aware, without a requirement to notify and engage in bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[47]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Education</span>, 71 FLRA at 971 ("[A]n agency will not be required to bargain over a change to a condition of employment unless the change is determined to have a substantial impact on a condition of employment.").</p>

<p class="noindent">Advancing marginally the attempt to distinguish working conditions and conditions of employment, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Educ., Office of Federal Student Aid and AFGE Council 252</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-210.html">71 FLRA 1105</a>, 1108 (2020) (Chairman Kiko dissenting), reviewing an arbitration award that determined an agency improperly, unilaterally changed the terms of a contract telework article, determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that it had no duty to bargain with the Union over the change because changing the number of days employees may telework was only a change to working conditions.&#x2003;However, that argument misses the point. The parties had negotiated a specific policy on telework into its CBA. Limiting the number of days in a manner not provided for in the agreement was most certainly a change to that policy, and thus, was a condition of employment over which the Agency was obligated to bargain. As the Arbitrator put it, the fourteen provisions set forth in the individual telework agreements were, in fact, a condition of employment. As already noted, the Arbitrator found that the decision to restrict telework to two days per week and to restrict the ability to work at alternative duty locations were changes in <span class="Italic">policy</span> because the parties' agreement provided that telework should be allowed "to the maximum extent possible." The Agency does not challenge these findings. Accordingly, the limitations imposed by the Agency were clearly changes in policy and those changes affected how <span class="Italic">employees would perform their jobs</span>. Without a doubt, the Agency changed the conditions of employment not just the working conditions of the employees who were working under telework agreements. For these reasons, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">If a proposal does not relate to working conditions, it is not within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 827 F.2d 814, 820 (D.C. Cir. 1987), involved what was determined to be a nonnegotiable proposal that agency travel facilities be made available to nonunit union representatives. The court determined that the duty to bargain over working conditions does not extend to everything that has an indirect or speculative effect on working conditions. But if a matter affecting working conditions, e.g., facilities for access to office space by disabled employees, is of incidental benefit to nonunit personnel or to agency clients, the matter remains negotiable. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, MSHA</span>, 27 FLRA 375, 381-82 (Proposal 6) (1987). The proposal remains negotiable if its purpose is to improve employment conditions, even though implementation of the proposal might cause the agency to take actions that involve matters other than working conditions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span>, 873 F.2d 1485, 1492-93 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (Proposal 3) (proposal that agency publish performance appraisal plans in its official gazette was negotiable, even though principal purpose of gazette was not dissemination of information for employees).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA occasionally finds that a proposal has so little effect on working conditions that it deems the proposal to be unrelated to working conditions and nonnegotiable. In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3006 and Idaho Army and Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 32 FLRA 785, 788 (1988), the union proposed that agency documents refer to unit employees as employees or technicians rather than as military technicians. Determining the proposal nonnegotiable, FLRA declared:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has not demonstrated, nor is it otherwise apparent, that the use of the terms "employee" or "technician" rather than the term "military technician" would change or affect any aspect of the job functions, job requirements, or any other incidents of employment of bargaining unit employees. In short, the Union has not shown that the proposal is "in any manner related to the work situation or employment relationship or is otherwise linked to" the unit employees' working conditions. <span class="Italic">Antilles Consolidated School System</span>, 22 FLRA 235, 238.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_489"></span>Past practice does not establish an adequate connection between the subject of a proposal and working conditions of unit employees. If management once negotiated a matter that FLRA later concludes is not a working condition, management may refuse future negotiations on the matter. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, MSHA</span>, 27 FLRA 375, 379 (1987) (Proposal 3); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1836 and Dept. of Air Force, Eielson AFB</span>, 62 FLRA 369, 371 (2008) ("an agency's previous agreement to a similar proposal is not relevant to a decision of whether a disputed proposal is within the duty to bargain"); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1917 and DOJ, INS</span>, 55 FLRA 228, 237 n.17 (1999) ("Contrary to the Union's argument, prior bargaining history does not render a proposal within the duty to bargain or preclude an agency from alleging that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain."). That the agency unilaterally provided a check cashing service in the past did not make it a condition of employment subject to the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Maritime Metal Trades Council and Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 17 FLRA 890, 891-92 (1985).
