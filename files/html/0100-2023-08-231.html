<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-228"><span class="space">11.</span> Insurance Programs</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has no jurisdiction to review OPM decisions involving enrollment in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program or in the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Program. <span class="Italic">Chamblin v. OPM</span>, 112 MSPR 266, 268-72 &#x00B6; 7-17, 2009 MSPB 180 (2009), summarized the law, allowing for some review authority in enforcement actions (discussed in <a href="0100-2023-23-001.html#sec16-1">Chapter 16</a>) and insurance-related offset or overpayment disputes in retirement appeals (discussed in <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec14-1">Chapter 14</a>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, claims concerning the federal employee life insurance and federal employee health insurance programs are beyond the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Richards v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 291, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2004); <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2001); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 186, 189 (1984). The Board has consistently reached this result in cases where an appellant has challenged OPM's determination that the appellant has received an annuity overpayment due to a retroactive election to participate in the federal life insurance or health insurance programs upon receiving an annuity."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, however, has also recognized several exceptions to the general rule that it lacks jurisdiction over OPM decisions concerning the administration of the health insurance and life insurance programs. One exception arises in petitions for enforcement. Indeed, the appellant relies upon such a case, <span class="Italic">Lua</span>, to support his jurisdictional claim. <span class="Italic">Lua</span> concerned whether OPM was in compliance with the final Board decision that ordered OPM to award the appellant a disability retirement annuity, when it failed to adequately explain its deduction of life insurance premiums from the appellant's annuity. <span class="Italic">Lua</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 108, &#x00B6; 1. There, the Board ordered OPM to award the appellant a disability retirement annuity, and the appellant then told OPM that she wished to continue her life insurance benefits during retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 5. The appellant later filed a petition for enforcement, alleging that OPM had not correctly paid her the disability retirement benefits to which she was entitled. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 6. The Board found that, while OPM had generally complied with the final Board order, it had not adequately explained its deduction of life insurance premiums from the appellant's annuity, and ordered OPM to submit evidence and argument on this issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In response, OPM argued, among other things, that the Board lacked jurisdiction to address federal employee group life insurance issues. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board disagreed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. It first noted that it has broad enforcement authority to order corrective action in cases of noncompliance in any matter within its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It then found that it had jurisdiction over appeals from OPM's final decisions administering the federal retirement systems, and that the case originated from a petition for enforcement of a Board decision reversing an OPM final decision that affected the appellant's rights or interests with regard to her retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the Board found that it "clearly" had jurisdiction over issues relating to the proper grant and payment of the appellant's disability retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board also noted that jurisdiction over life insurance benefits claims under the federal employee group life insurance program are statutorily placed in the United States district courts and Court of Federal Claims, rather than the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board found, however, that the appellant was not challenging her election under the program, and was instead questioning whether OPM's computation of her annuity correctly encompassed OPM's retroactive deductions of certain life insurance premiums from her annuity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board, therefore, concluded that it had jurisdiction over the appeal "as an issue of compliance from its final decision granting the appellant's disability retirement annuity." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Ogden v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 522, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (2002). Finally, it distinguished its holding in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, where it found jurisdiction lacking. <span class="Italic">Lua</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 108, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A second exception to the general rule that the Board lacks jurisdiction over claims concerning the life insurance and health insurance programs concerns requests for waiving repaying annuity overpayments caused by the retroactive application of premiums for those programs. In <span class="Italic">McIntosh v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 544 (2007), the Board found it had jurisdiction over a request for a waiver of an annuity overpayment caused by OPM's failure to properly deduct life insurance premiums from the appellant's annuity. In reaching this conclusion, the Board distinguished this circumstance from the situation in <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, by first noting that <span class="Italic">Miller</span> relied upon <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>. 104 M.S.P.R. 544, &#x00B6; 5. The Board then explained that <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> did not involve a request to waive recovery of an overpayment and only addressed the merits of OPM's decision that an overpayment had been made. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that the circumstances in <span class="Italic">McIntosh</span> more closely resembled those in <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 566 (2004), which also involved a request to waive repayment of an overpayment resulting from OPM's failure to withhold from an annuity the correct amount for the annuitant's life insurance premiums. 104 M.S.P.R. 544, &#x00B6; 6. The Board found in both cases that it has jurisdiction to review OPM's final decisions on requests that recovery of annuity overpayments be waived, even when it lacks jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the overpayment determination itself. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 12. The Board distinguished these cases from <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> because the annuitants had sought review of OPM's refusal to waive recovery of the overpayment, rather than simply contesting OPM's overpayment determination and remanded the case to the regional office for adjudication of the waiver issue. <span class="Italic">McIntosh</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 544, &#x00B6; 7. The Board, therefore, found that it had jurisdiction to review the appellant's claim that OPM should waive recovery of the overpayment at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's circumstances here do not fall under any of the exceptions to the general jurisdictional bar on claims regarding life insurance or health insurance. The appellant relies upon <span class="Italic">Lua</span>, but that case concerned a petition for enforcement while the present case does not. Indeed, the Board's reasoning that it had jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">Lua</span> was grounded in the Board's enforcement authority and the case's origins as a petition for enforcement. 102 M.S.P.R. 108, &#x00B6; 8. The Board also specifically noted that the appellant was not challenging her election under the life insurance program, thereby implying that such a challenge is beyond the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, however, the appellant is making this precise challenge--claiming that he did not make a valid election to participate in either the health insurance or life insurance program. We, therefore, find that <span class="Italic">Lua</span> does not support the conclusion that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The present case also differs from precedent that examines requests for waiving the repayment of overpayments caused by retroactive elections of life insurance or health insurance benefits. In order to request waiving repayment of an overpayment, there must first be an overpayment. 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart N. Here, however, the appellant has not received an overpayment, and OPM has not issued a final or reconsideration decision regarding an overpayment. Instead, OPM has deducted <span id="Page_373"></span>the required premiums from the appellant's lump-sum payment of retroactive benefits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We, therefore, conclude that the present case falls under the general rule that the Board lacks jurisdiction over claims regarding federal health and life insurance programs. To the extent the appellant's circumstances are analogous to the decisions discussed above, we find the present case most like <span class="Italic">Miller</span> and <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, where the appellants objected to the effect that their retroactive election for life insurance coverage had on their retirement benefits. Both the Board and the court held that these objections arose under the life insurance program, rather than the retirement statutes, and were, therefore beyond the Board's jurisdiction. We find that the same reasoning applies here. While we are sympathetic to the appellant's circumstances, including OPM's arguably inappropriate contacts with him, his remedy does not lie with the Board on the basis of his current claims. <span class="Italic">See Armachuelo v.

The appellant elected to accept OWCP benefits retroactive to the date he began receiving his disability retirement annuity, and he repaid all of the annuity payments he had received from OPM during this time. Contending that basic life insurance is provided at no cost to those receiving OWCP benefits, the appellant then applied to OPM for a refund of all of the basic life insurance premiums that he had paid while receiving his disability retirement annuity payments. In a January 4, 2005 letter, OPM denied the appellant's refund request because it had determined that deductions for basic life insurance were required for those receiving compensation for an injury occurring after January 1, 1990, and the appellant's "compensation date of injury" was May 8, 1992.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Mr. Kostishak's claim is that he should be entitled to a refund of insurance premiums withheld from his annuity pursuant to FEGLIA, jurisdiction properly lies with the United States district courts or the United States Court of Federal Claims and not with the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8715; <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 449 F.3d at 1381.

<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board does not generally have jurisdiction over life insurance issues, if an issue concerning life insurance deductions arises in the course of an annuity appeal within the Board's jurisdiction, then the life insurance coverage issue can be adjudicated, <span class="Italic">Lua v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we disagree with OPM that the Board is without authority to determine the FEGLI compliance issue in this appeal. It is axiomatic that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204(a)(1)-(2), the Board has a broad grant of enforcement authority to order corrective action in cases of noncompliance pursuant to any matter within its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts,</span> 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984).

Because this case originates from a petition for enforcement of a Board decision reversing the final decision of OPM that affected the appellant's rights or interests with regard to her retirement, the Board clearly has jurisdiction over issues relating to the proper grant and payment of the appellant's disability retirement annuity. Although the Board has stated that life insurance benefits paid under FEGLI are governed by Chapter 87 of Title 5, and that jurisdiction over claims based on Chapter 87 is expressly placed in the United States district courts and the Court of Federal Claims, <span class="Italic">Richards v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 291, &#x00B6; 6 (2004), here the appellant is not challenging her election under FEGLI. Rather she is questioning whether OPM's computation of her annuity correctly encompassed OPM's retroactive deductions of certain FEGLI premiums from her annuity during the period of time when she had been removed and was in a non-pay status. As in <span class="Italic">Ogden v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 522 (2002), the Board has jurisdiction over this matter as an issue of compliance from its final decision granting the appellant's disability retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">Cf.

OPM's decision denying Ms. Armachuelo's request for benefits under the FEHBP is not an action made appealable to the Board by law. As the administrative judge explained, OPM determinations concerning health plan enrollment are final and not reviewable by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Oppenheim v. Office of Pers.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 65-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978) ("CSRA"), Ms. Armachuelo asserts that the Board has jurisdiction to review any "significant action" taken by OPM. But the CSRA, which created both the Board and OPM, expressly limits the Board's jurisdiction to those actions made appealable by law, rule, or regulation. 92 Stat. at 1138, &#x00A7; 205. Although many OPM actions are appealable to the Board, decisions regarding FEHBP enrollment are not. The Board therefore did not err in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over Ms. Armachuelo's appeal. Because the administrative judge clearly stated why the Board lacked jurisdiction over her appeal and cited pertinent legal authority in support of that conclusion, we reject Ms. Armachuelo's contention that the Board dismissed her appeal without explanation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government notes that instead of appealing to the Board Ms. Armachuelo could have pressed her claim either in a district court or in the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8912. That section provides that the "district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal Claims, of a civil action or claim against the United States founded on" chapter 89, pursuant to which the FEHBP was created. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8912; <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 8903; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 890.107. Ms. Armachuelo objects that she is unfamiliar with the rules applicable to claims against the government and therefore did not know that the Board lacked jurisdiction over her appeal. In its final decision denying her request for enrollment in the FEHBP, however, OPM informed Ms. Armachuelo that she was not entitled to further administrative review of her claim. OPM therefore put her on notice that she could not appeal that decision either within OPM or to the Board. We note that the Board's dismissal of Ms. Armachuelo's appeal is without prejudice to her filing suit in an appropriate court under section 8912, although we make no determination as to whether such a claim would be timely or otherwise eligible for review under that section.

The Board explained that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d), an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States under "this subchapter" may be appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 9;<span class="Italic"> see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.110. "[T]his subchapter" of Chapter 83, Retirement, refers to subchapter III, the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), which is comprised of numerous sections addressing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, different types of retirement, different types of annuities, and payment of benefits. <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 68 &#x00B6; 9 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8336-8338, 8341-8344, and 8345). "Such benefits are paid from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8348).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant appeal involves an annuity under FERS, rather than CSRS. As pointed out in <span class="Italic">Richards v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 291 &#x00B6; 6 (2004), however, 5 U.S.C. 8461(e)(1) authorizes Board appeals from final decisions under Chapter 84 of Title 5 (FERS) in the same manner as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1) authorizes Board appeals from final decisions under Chapter 83 of Title 5 (CSRS). Thus, the Board is also deprived of jurisdiction over overpayment cases where the overpayment resulted from a change in the terms of the appellant's life insurance coverage and premiums therefor when the appellant is covered by FERS. <span class="Italic">See Richards</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 291 &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM assessed the appellant here, as it did in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, an overpayment of funds disbursed to her as an annuitant based upon the fact that OPM failed to withhold the proper amount of life insurance premiums. Generally, one who is assessed an overpayment has a right to appeal OPM's decision to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Campbell</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 68 &#x00B6; 10;<span class="Italic"> Tatum v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 96 &#x00B6; 7 (1999). Nevertheless, the Board in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> found that "the overpayment resulted, not from anything related to the computation of the appellant's retirement annuity, but rather from a change in the terms of his life insurance coverage and premiums therefor, as interpreted by OPM, an administrative action not covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)." <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 68 &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board further found that its "jurisdiction to review OPM overpayment determinations extends only to determinations that debts are owed to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund." <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 68 &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1301, 831.1302. No such determination was made in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, and the Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the record in this case indicates that the overpayment resulted from a change in the appellant's life insurance coverage and not from anything related to the computation of her retirement annuity. Therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction over issues regarding the existence and amount of the overpayment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's waiver request, the Board has held that it has <span id="Page_376"></span>jurisdiction to review OPM's decisions on waiver requests even where the overpayment allegedly resulted from errors in calculating or deducting life insurance benefits. <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 566 &#x00B6; 12 (2004). Thus, the fact that the Board may not review OPM's determination concerning the alleged overpayment in this matter does not preclude the Board from reviewing the appellant's waiver request. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recovery of an overpayment may be waived if the individual is without fault, and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8470(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.301. When recovery of an overpayment would cause financial hardship, it is against equity and good conscience. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.303(a); <span class="Italic">see James v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 211, 217 (1996). Nonetheless, when an individual is without fault in causing the overpayment, but accepts a payment she knows to be erroneous, she is expected to set aside the overpayment pending OPM's recoupment. <span class="Italic">James</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 217. Recovery by OPM in such circumstances is not against equity and good conscience, even if financial hardship results. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge correctly determined that OPM had expressly informed the appellant that an overpayment would be created and the amount of that overpayment when it gave her the opportunity to elect the amount of life insurance she wanted. The appellant elected the no reduction option knowing that it would create an overpayment. She cannot be said to be without fault and is therefore not entitled to waiver of the overpayment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An annuitant who is ineligible for waiver may nevertheless be entitled to an adjustment in the recovery schedule if she shows that it would cause her financial hardship to make payment at the rate scheduled. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.301. Pursuant to OPM's regulations, financial hardship may exist where the annuitant needs substantially all of her income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.304. In determining whether living expenses are "ordinary and necessary," the Board applies a reasonable person test, regardless of the individual's accustomed standard of living. <span class="Italic">Gulan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 16 &#x00B6; 12 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant never established that recovery would cause her financial hardship. Instead, she indicated that she did not know whether financial hardship would result, but that she believed it possibly could. She never submitted a Financial Resources Questionnaire or other evidence indicating that she needs substantially all of her income and liquid assets to meet her current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities. Accordingly, an adjustment to the recovery schedule is unwarranted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Affirming the Board, <span class="Italic">Miller v. OPM,</span> 449 F.3d 1374, 1377-81 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (Judge Dyk dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The jurisdiction of the Merit Systems Protection Board is confined to those matters assigned to it by statute, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Meeker v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 319 F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. Dep't of the Interior,</span> 153 F.3d 1348, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 1998); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a). The Board has jurisdiction over appeals arising from OPM's administration of the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act ("FERSA"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8401-79, but it does not have jurisdiction over appeals arising from OPM's administration of the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Act ("FEGLIA"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8701-16. The jurisdictional provision that governs review of disputes concerning annuity payments made under FERSA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1), provides that, subject to an exception not applicable here, "an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States under the provisions of [FERSA] administered by [OPM] may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board." The jurisdictional provision that governs review of disputes concerning FEGLIA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8715, provides that "[t]he district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal Claims, of a civil action or claim against the United States founded on [FEGLIA]." The question in this case is whether Ms. Miller's claim may be characterized as a challenge to an order affecting her rights under FERSA, as she contends, or whether it should be characterized as a claim founded on FEGLIA, as the Board held and as the Board and the United States argue in this appeal. We conclude that the dispute is properly characterized as one founded on FEGLIA, and that jurisdiction to review the overpayment determination lay in the district court or the Court of Federal Claims, not in the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dispute on the merits in this case is whether Ms. Miller should be required to make premium payments for the period 1991 to 2002, during which she was not receiving a retirement annuity but for which she was later awarded retroactive annuity payments. OPM's decision that she is required to make those premium payments was based on a construction of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8707(b)--a provision outside of the FERS laws--as Ms. Miller acknowledges. Ms. Miller's sole quarrel with OPM is that she disagrees with its assertion that the provisions of FEGLIA require it to deduct retroactive payments from her retirement annuity. She supports her arguments on the merits with references to various provisions of FEGLIA and corresponding regulations. If Ms. Miller's proposed construction of FEGLIA is correct, she will not have to make the back premium payments. If OPM's construction is correct, she will. The resolution of the dispute in this case thus depends on an interpretation of FEGLIA. Put another way, Ms. Miller's claim to have her annuity payments restored to their full, non-offset amount is "founded" on FEGLIA within the meaning of FEGLIA's review provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8715. While the mechanism for collecting the overpayment was through a reduction in Ms. Miller's annuity payments, the order requiring that reduction does not "affect [her] rights or interests" under FERS, within the meaning of the FERS review provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1). That is because the reduction in her annuity payments was merely the mechanism for recovering funds that OPM determined Ms. Miller owed under FEGLIA; the reduction was not based on any decision regarding a substantive right or interest under FERS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has consistently held that, when OPM seeks to offset an employee's salary or retirement benefits to collect a debt, the Board does not have jurisdiction over the merits of the underlying dispute that gave rise to the debt. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ramirez v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 211, 213 (2000); <span class="Italic">Lary v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 291, 298-99 (1994), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds, King v.

Mgmt.,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 360, 365 (1990). In <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 68 (2001), a case analogous to this one, an annuitant's decision to change his life insurance coverage resulted in an overpayment of his CSRS annuity, which OPM recovered by a reduction in his annuity payments. The annuitant argued, as Ms. Miller argues here, that OPM's retroactive assessment of premiums "would be collecting payments for coverage [he] did not have." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 70. The Board dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction because "the overpayment resulted, not from anything related to the computation of the appellant's retirement annuity, but rather from a change in the terms of his life insurance coverage and premiums therefor, as interpreted by OPM, an administrative action not covered by [the CSRS statutes]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 71. Similarly here, Ms. Miller's overpayment is due to OPM's assessment of her rights and responsibilities under the FEGLIA statutes, not the FERS statutes. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we are not bound by these decisions of the Board, they are consistent with our decision in <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 301 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2002). In that case, we held that an annuitant's challenge to OPM's refusal to permit him to purchase life insurance arose under FEGLIA, and was not within the Board's jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of OPM in administering the federal retirement systems. The underlying decision of OPM in this case is similar to the underlying decision in <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>: OPM has decided that Ms. Miller is entitled to purchase full life insurance coverage, but in order to do so she must pay the back premiums to 1991. That decision, like the decision in <span class="Italic">Lewis,</span> is a decision as to the scope of Ms. Miller's legal rights under FEGLIA, even though, as in <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, OPM would collect the additional premiums, if they are ultimately determined to be due, by reducing the amount of Ms. Miller's annuity payments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to the Board's approach, Ms. Miller argues that any reduction in a retiree's FERS annuity payments "affect[s]...the rights or interests" of the annuitant under FERSA, and that the merits of the dispute that led to the reduction are therefore reviewable by the Board. That theory, however, would give the Board very broad authority over a wide variety of substantive claims simply because of the mechanism used to collect the obligations stemming from those claims. We do not think that is what Congress intended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The approach that the Board has taken in such cases makes more sense of the statutory scheme. The reduction in Ms. Miller's annuity payments was merely one of several methods OPM could have used to recover the claimed back insurance premiums. Because recovering an overpayment by an offset against annuity payments, as in this case, is both more efficient and often less burdensome than other means of collection, OPM often employs such offset mechanisms to collect annuitants' debts. It would be curious to attribute to Congress the intention to direct review of a decision pertaining to the underlying obligation to different forums depending solely on the method used to collect the obligation. As the Board points out in its brief, if 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1) were interpreted to give the Board jurisdiction in every case in which an annuity payment is reduced in order to recover an asserted debt owed by the annuitant, the Board would assume the task of deciding the merits of a variety of disputes in different substantive areas, such as student loan obligations and tax law, that are far afield from the Board's expertise and are not subjects that Congress could plausibly have intended to assign to the Board for adjudication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The flaw in Ms. Miller's argument that any administrative offset that reduces a retiree's annuity falls within the Board's jurisdiction under section 8461(e)(1) is well illustrated by an examination of the administrative offset provisions of the Debt Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3716. In that Act, Congress authorized federal agencies (and even state <span id="Page_377"></span>instrumentalities under certain conditions) to collect a wide variety of claims by administrative offset. The scheme envisioned under the Act is for the collecting agency to provide a review mechanism through which to address the substance of the claim. If the claim is upheld, the agency may seek to collect it through an administrative offset, including an offset against federal annuity payments. 31 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 901.3(d). In such cases, the Office of Personnel Management is responsible for ensuring that the annuitant has had the proper due process procedures within the claimant agency,<span class="Italic"> see</span> 31 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 901.3(b)(4); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1803, and the failure to comply with those procedures can be appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Ramirez,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. at 214. But the Board has held that it does not have the authority to address the merits of the underlying claims, which can arise from an infinite variety of obligations that employees can incur during the course of their employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 193, 196-97 (2004) (no review of the merits of an administrative offset sought by the Office of Worker Compensation Programs); <span class="Italic">Cebzanov v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 562, 566 (2004) (no review of the merits of an administrative offset sought by Internal Revenue Service). Moreover, the government-wide regulations that governed Debt Collection Act offsets against employees' retirement funds, until the regulations were recently revised, provided that the setoff procedures did not "authorize the OPM or the MSPB to review the merits of the requesting agency's determination with respect to the amount and validity of the claim." 4 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 102.4 (2000); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1806(d)(3)(1) (in arranging setoffs of debts against employee retirement funds, OPM has no authority to review the merits of the claim against the employee).[1] Thus, we think it clear that under the Debt Collection Act Congress envisioned that the substantive claims giving rise to the administrative offset would be adjudicated in the respective agencies, not before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;When the government-wide regulations were revised and recodified at 31 C.F.R. Part 900, the provision referring to OPM and the MSPB was omitted, but the promulgating agencies' contemporaneous comments make clear that the change was not meant to have substantive effect. <span class="Italic">See</span> 62 Fed. Reg. 68,476, 68,482 (Dec. 31, 1997) (proposed rule); 65 Fed. Reg. 70,390, 70,392 (Nov. 22, 2000) (explaining reason for change).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same principle applies to the offset at issue in this case. As in the case of setoffs authorized by the Debt Collection Act, any reduction in the amount of a former employee's annuity payments can in a broad sense be said to affect the former employee's interests under FERSA, since an employee has an "interest" in receiving an annuity. The operation of the Debt Collection Act makes clear, however, that Congress did not intend for the term "administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual...under [FERSA]" in section 8461(e)(1) to encompass any order that would have the effect of reducing the amount of an annuity, either on one occasion or over a period of time. Instead, we agree with the Board that the reference to "rights or interests" in section 8461(e)(1) limits the Board to the adjudication of substantive claims created by FERSA. Contrary to Ms. Miller's contention, section 8461(e)(1) does not extend the Board's jurisdiction to encompass review of "all attempts to recover payments from a retiree's annuity benefits--regardless of the reason for the recovery or the source of the overpayment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Miller notes that decisions whether to invoke equitable waiver of the government's right to recover overpayments, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8470(b) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.301, are always reviewable by the Board, even though the underlying obligation may not be related to a right or obligation created by FERSA. <span class="Italic">See Mitchell v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 566 (2004). She argues that it would be highly inefficient to have questions relating to the substantive obligation reviewed in the Court of Federal Claims or in a district court, but to have the issue of the waiver of overpayments reviewed by the Merit Systems Protection Board, since it is possible that both claims will arise in connection with a single overpayment dispute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The possibility that a different regime would be more efficient does not justify our rejection of the system of review that Congress put into place, if we are persuaded that Congress has spoken clearly on the matter, as we are in this case. In any event, the specific concern raised by Ms. Miller is not implicated in this case, as the Board has already determined that OPM did not err by declining to waive the reimbursement requirement, and Ms. Miller has not sought further review of that issue. Therefore, we need not decide whether, in a case in which an annuitant challenges the merits of OPM's decision to offset her annuity to collect a debt external to her rights under the statutes creating the annuity and also seeks review of OPM's decision not to waive the debt, the annuitant would have to bring those claims in two different forums or whether the court addressing the overpayment decision could address the waiver issue as a matter of supplemental or pendent jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1367; <span class="Italic">Trek Leasing, Inc. v. United States,</span> 62 Fed. Cl. 673 (2004). If supplemental or pendent jurisdiction is available in such cases, the burden of requiring parties to litigate the two issues in different forums would, of course, be eliminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, Ms. Miller's challenge to the merits of the government's overpayment claim is not within the scope of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1), but falls instead under section 8715, which requires that her claim be brought either in a federal district court or in the Court of Federal Claims. We therefore affirm the Board's decision dismissing her claim that OPM erred in assessing an overpayment against her.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McIntosh v. OPM,</span> 104 MSPR 544, 545-47 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-7, 2007 MSPB 29 (2007), summarized distinctions between nonappealable matters involving insurance determinations and appealable decisions by OPM denying waiver of overpayment recovery involving insurance premiums deducted from annuity payments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is an annuitant under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) Offset. When she retired in August 1996, she completed Standard Form 2818, Continuation of Basic Life Insurance Coverage, electing no reduction in the amount of basic life insurance coverage after reaching age 65. OPM, however, processed her annuity on September 10, 1997, using a 75% reduction in coverage after age 65. When she received OPM's "birthday letter" dated June 18, 2005, informing her of the insurance options for annuitants age 65 and older, she selected no reduction in coverage for Option B (Additional) life insurance. In processing this election, OPM discovered its mistake for the basic coverage and informed her that it had failed to withhold the proper deductions from her annuity payments between August 13, 1996, and September 30, 2005. As a result, it found that she had been overpaid $5,336.34 and scheduled an installment plan for her to repay that sum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant requested reconsideration and asked OPM to waive the requirement that she repay the overpayment. OPM affirmed its initial decision, explaining that the coverage she selected had been in force from the time of her retirement owing to her valid written election of that coverage. OPM found that, because she did not notice its error in failing to withhold the premiums, she was "not completely without fault" for the overpayment, and thus she did not meet the eligibility requirements for waiver. The appellant filed this appeal with the Board, asking that it find that she qualified for a waiver. OPM moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction, arguing that the overpayment arose from an insurance matter, rather than overpayment of an annuity <span class="Italic">per se</span>. The administrative judge (AJ) ordered the appellant to submit argument and evidence on the jurisdictional issue and canceled the scheduled hearing. When she failed to respond, the AJ dismissed the appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We nonetheless reopen this case on our own motion under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118 because the issue of jurisdiction was wrongly decided. In finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction in this appeal, the AJ cited a recent Federal Circuit decision, <span class="Italic">Miller v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 449 F.3d 1374, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2006), for the proposition that the Board cannot decide appeals when they arise from OPM's collection efforts for insurance matters. He noted that the court in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> had relied upon <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 68 (2001), "a case similar to the one at bar."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As closely as the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> resemble the circumstances here, they differ in a major respect: The annuitant in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> had not asked OPM to waive recovery of an overpayment and only addressed the merits of OPM's decision that an overpayment had been made. <span class="Italic">See Campbell</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. at 70. In the case before us, the appellant did ask that OPM waive recovery, and OPM denied her request. For that reason, this appeal more closely resembles <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 566 (2004). <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> also involves an overpayment resulting from OPM's failure to withhold from an annuity the correct amount for the annuitant's life insurance premiums. As with the appellant, the annuitant had selected no reduction in his basic life insurance coverage. <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 2. Several months later, OPM informed him that it had inadvertently charged him premiums for insurance with a 75% reduction in coverage, and as a result, he had been overpaid. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 3. The annuitant requested reconsideration, arguing that OPM should have "'taken financial responsibility' for the error." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 4. He also alleged that the scheduled recovery would cause him extreme hardship. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM affirmed its previous findings and the annuitant filed an appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, the AJ in <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> found that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal and dismissed it. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 8. As it had done below, OPM contended in its PFR that the appeal fell within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 7. The Board vacated the ID, explaining that it has "jurisdiction to review OPM's final decisions on requests that recovery of annuity overpayments be waived," even when it lacks jurisdiction to "consider the propriety of the overpayment determination itself." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 12. The Board distinguished the annuitant's case from <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> because the annuitant had sought review of OPM's refusal to waive recovery of the overpayment, rather than simply contesting OPM's determination that he had been overpaid, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> &#x00B6; 10, and remanded the case to the regional office for adjudication of the waiver issue, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> &#x00B6; 13. Similarly, we find that the Board has jurisdiction <span id="Page_378"></span>to review the appellant's claim that OPM should waive recovery of the overpayment at issue in this case.</p>
