<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-84"><span class="space">a.</span> Destruction or Loss of Evidence; Spoliation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Dept. of Army</span>, 573 F.3d 1318, 1325-27 (Fed. Cir. 2009), considered an adverse inference as to a USERRA claim when the agency destroyed records material to the challenged nonselection of the appellant. The court remanded the case to the Board for further consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The other matter Mr. Kirkendall raised on appeal relates to the agency's knowing destruction of pertinent documents while the case was underway. This issue derives from Mr. Kirkendall's discovery request in September 2003, when he was first presenting his VEOA and USERRA claims to the board. He sought the applications from applicants whom the agency deemed were qualified to compete for the position, as well as all documents submitted in support of their applications. He argued that such documents were necessary to determine if he had valid VEOA and USERRA claims. Without such evidence, Mr. Kirkendall could not establish that he had been discriminated against on account of his status as a veteran, nor could he be assured that his VEOA rights had not been violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency failed to meet the board's October 3, 2003 deadline order for production of requested documents. Mr. Kirkendall then moved to compel production, and the board granted his request. The agency responded to the order by confessing that it had destroyed the applications and rating sheets for eight of the twelve applicants who responded to the same external recruiting bulletin as had Mr. Kirkendall. Further, the agency stated that it had destroyed all the applications, and all but one of the rating sheets, for the seven applicants who responded to an internal recruiting bulletin for the position. The person who ultimately won the position, Kenneth Black, applied pursuant to the internal recruiting bulletin. The agency averred that his application had been destroyed and that only his rating sheet survived. Among the destroyed applications and rating sheets were those from the non-veterans who had been rated eligible to compete for the job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the board, Mr. Kirkendall moved, in January of 2008, for sanctions for the document destruction. He asked for an adverse inference as a result of the destruction and a shift of the burden of proof to the agency to disprove his VEOA and USERRA claims. Faced with Mr. Kirkendall's motion and but a few days before the hearing, the agency finally produced the file of the winning candidate. Mr. Kirkendall emphasized the relevance of the missing files of the non-veteran candidates rated eligible to compete. Without those documents, Mr. Kirkendall was at a loss to determine whether, compared to the non-veteran competitors, his status as veteran had worked against him. With no explanation, the board denied Mr. Kirkendall's request for sanctions, stating that sanctions were "unwarranted under the circumstances."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Mr. Kirkendall argues that the agency's abuse of his discovery request entitles him to a sanction in the form of granting an adverse inference against the agency or shifting the burden of proof on his claims. He asks that we grant that relief, vacate the adverse holding on his USERRA claim, and remand that claim for further proceedings pursuant to the sanction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kirkendall makes a compelling case that the litigation of his USERRA claim was hampered, indeed perhaps imperiled, when the agency destroyed the evidence that might have shown a violation of his USERRA rights. He points out that there can be no legitimate excuse for destruction of the documents, as the agency's own document retention program requires retention of documents that are "under litigation," as the destroyed documents in this case were, to the knowledge of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency responds that Mr. Kirkendall cannot prevail on this issue absent a showing that the agency's destruction of the documents was in bad faith. The agency relies on <span class="Italic">Eaton Corp. v. Appliance Valves Corp</span>., 790 F.2d 874, 878 (Fed. Cir. 1986), a patent case which came to us from a district court in the Seventh Circuit. In deciding a sanction issue in that case, we relied on Seventh Circuit law, which makes bad faith a test for sanctions for document destruction discovery abuse. Our practice in reviewing patent cases is to apply regional circuit law to procedural issues. Thus, as Mr. Kirkendall correctly notes, the <span class="Italic">Eaton</span> case is not relevant to the test this court sets as a requirement for sanctions for discovery abuse at the board.[6] But we need not fashion a test for this circuit for application to discovery abuses at the board. This is so because the board has already set its own test, and we are free to hold the board to its own rules.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;We recently were presented with the question of whether negligent, as opposed to bad faith, destruction of documents can give rise to an adverse inference. The matter was raised in <span class="Italic">Jandreau v. Nicholson,</span> 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007), but was not decided in the case. In that decision, we noted that there is a conflict in the circuits as to whether more than mere negligence is required to support an adverse inference. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1376 n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;During the hearing, Mr. Kirkendall's counsel sought to explore the destruction of the non-veteran files. The agency's successful objection to Mr. Kirkendall's inquiry barred Mr. Kirkendall from exploring intent regarding the document destruction. Having stood in the way of Mr. Kirkendall's inquiry into faith, good or bad, in destruction of the documents, one might question the agency's good faith in mounting its inapt bad faith challenge here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1981, the board established that negligence can justify an adverse inference sanction for destruction of evidence. <span class="Italic">Natividad v. Dep't of Agric.,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 415, 418 (1981) ("[I]n the interest of fairness and justice, petitioner should not bear the burden of the agency's negligence in losing critical evidence...."). In this case, where the relevance of the destroyed documents is beyond doubt, the board should have applied the rule in <span class="Italic">Natividad</span> to Mr. Kirkendall's motion for sanctions for destruction of the documents. "[W]hen the Board takes a position inconsistent with its longstanding practice, without any explanation for the shift, the Board's action is not reasoned decision-making and is arbitrary." <span class="Italic">McCrary v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 459 F.3d 1344, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quotation marks omitted). Such arbitrary action amounts to an abuse of discretion. Under the circumstances of this case, the board should have drawn adverse inferences against the agency with respect to the documents destroyed. Failure to have done so is an abuse of discretion. Upon remand and further hearing on Mr. Kirkendall's USERRA claim, the agency must be burdened with adverse inferences concerning the destroyed documents. We leave it to the board in the first instance to determine to which of the destroyed documents an adverse inference must be drawn, and the scope and effect of each such inference.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant also argues that the administrative judge's denial of his motion for an adverse inference for spoliation of evidence constituted an abuse of discretion. We find that the administrative judge's ruling did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See Leseman v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6; 6 (2015) (recognizing that, absent an abuse of discretion, the Board will not reverse an administrative judge's determination regarding sanctions). In <span id="Page_1507"></span>their competing arguments, both parties suggested that an appropriate standard would require that the party seeking an adverse inference for spoliation establish the following: (1) the party having control over the evidence had an obligation to preserve it at the time it was destroyed; (2) the record was destroyed with a culpable state of mind; and (3) the destroyed evidence was relevant to the party's claim or defense such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the destroyed evidence would support that claim or defense. Under the plain language of that standard or even a lesser standard in which bad faith is not required, there must be some destruction of evidence. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 573 F.3d 1318, 1325-27 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Supreme Court has noted, "[d]ocument retention policies, which are created in part to keep certain information from getting into the hands of others, including the Government, are common in business.

United States</span>, 544 U.S. 696, 704 (2005) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Thus, "a party can only be sanctioned for destroying evidence if it had a duty to preserve it." <span class="Italic">Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC</span>, 220 F.R.D. 212, 216 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). The duty to preserve evidence begins when litigation is "pending or reasonably <span class="Italic">foresee</span>able." <span class="Italic">Silvestri v. General Motors Corp.</span>, 271 F.3d 583, 590 (4th Cir. 2001). <span class="Italic">See also West v. Goodyear Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co.</span>, 167 F.3d 776, 779 (2d Cir. 1999) (applying the same standard).

This is an objective standard, asking not whether the party in fact reasonably foresaw litigation, but whether a reasonable party in the same factual circumstances would have reasonably fore<span class="Italic">seen</span> litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When litigation is "reasonably <span class="Italic">foresee</span>able" is a flexible fact-specific standard that allows a district court to exercise the discretion necessary to confront the myriad factual situations inherent in the spoliation inquiry. <span class="Italic">Fujitsu Ltd. v. Fed. Express Corp.</span>, 247 F.3d 423, 436 (2d Cir. 2001). This standard does not trigger the duty to preserve documents from the mere existence of a potential claim or the distant possibility of litigation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Trask-Morton v. Motel 6 Operating L.P.</span>, 534 F.3d 672, 681-82 (7th Cir. 2008). However, it is not so inflexible as to require that litigation be "imminent, or probable without significant contingencies," as Rambus suggests. Rambus's proposed gloss on the "reasonably <span class="Italic">foresee</span>able" standard comes from an overly generous reading of several cases. <span class="Italic">See Burlington N. &#x0026; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Grant</span>, 505 F.3d 1013, 1032 (10th Cir. 2007) (noting that "[a] spoliation sanction is proper where (1) a party has a duty to preserve evidence because it knew, or should have known, that litigation was <span class="Italic">imminent</span>, and (2) the adverse party was prejudiced by the destruction of the evidence" (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Trask-Morton</span>, 534 F.3d at 681 (citing <span class="Italic">Burlington</span> for the proposition that "courts have found a spoliation sanction to be proper only where a party has a duty to preserve evidence because it knew, or should known, that litigation was <span class="Italic">imminent</span>," but holding that "Motel 6 had no reason to <span class="Italic">suspect litigation</span> until--at the earliest--Morton's attorney sent Motel 6 a demand letter" after the alleged spoliation (emphases added)). <span class="Italic">Burlington</span> merely noted that imminent litigation was sufficient, not that it was necessary for spoliation, and on the easy facts of <span class="Italic">Trask-Morton</span>, it was decided that the alleged spoliator did not even "suspect" litigation. This court declines to sully the flexible reasonably <span class="Italic">foresee</span>able standard with the restrictive gloss proposed by Rambus in light of the weight of contrary authority and the unnecessary generosity that such a gloss would extend to alleged spoliators. <span class="Italic">See Silvestri</span>, 271 F.3d at 591; <span class="Italic">West</span>, 167 F.3d at 779 ("Spoliation is the destruction or significant alteration of evidence, or the failure to preserve property for another's use as evidence in pending or reasonably <span class="Italic">foresee</span>able litigation."); <span class="Italic">Kronisch v. United States</span>, 150 F.3d 112, 126 (2d Cir. 1998) ("This obligation to preserve evidence arises when the party has notice that the evidence is relevant to litigation...as for example when a party should have known that the evidence may be relevant to future litigation."); <span class="Italic">MOSAID Techs. Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co.</span>, 348 F.

(internal citations omitted)). Moreover, it would make little sense to enjoin document destruction only when the party clears all the hurdles on the litigation track, but endorse it when the party begins the race under the reasonable expectation of clearing those same hurdles. Thus, the proper standard for determining when the duty to preserve documents attaches is the flexible one of reasonably <span class="Italic">foresee</span>able litigation, without any additional gloss.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]t is certainly true that most document retention policies are adopted with benign business purposes, reflecting the fact that "litigation is an everpresent possibility in American life." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Union Fire Ins. v. Murray Sheet Metal Co.</span>, 967 F.2d 980, 984 (4th Cir. 1992). In addition, there is the innocent purpose of simply limiting the volume of a party's files and retaining only that which is of continuing value. One might call it the "good housekeeping" purpose. Thus, where a party has a longstanding policy of destruction of documents on a regular schedule, with that policy motivated by general business needs, which may include a general concern for the possibility of litigation, destruction that occurs in line with the policy is relatively unlikely to be <span class="Italic">seen</span> as spoliation. Here, however, it was not clear error for the district court to conclude that the raison d'&#x00EA;tre for Rambus's document retention policy was to further Rambus's litigation strategy by frustrating the fact-finding efforts of parties adverse to Rambus....</p>

NASCO, Inc.</span>, 501 U.S. 32, 45-46 (1991)) ("The right to impose sanctions for spoliation arises from a court's inherent power to control the judicial process and litigation, but the power is limited to that necessary to redress conduct 'which abuses the judicial process.'").

<p class="Block-Quote2">i.&#x2003;Bad Faith</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To make a determination of bad faith, the district court must find that the spoliating party "intended to impair the ability of the potential defendant to defend itself." <span class="Italic">Schmid</span>, 13 F.3d at 80. <span class="Italic">See also Faas v. Sears, Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, 532 F.3d 633, 644 (7th Cir. 2008) ("A document is destroyed in bad faith if it is destroyed 'for the purpose of hiding adverse information.'")

Co. of Del., Inc.</span>, 489 F.3d 568, 579 (3d Cir. 2007) (noting that bad faith requires a showing that the litigant "intentionally destroyed documents that it knew would be important or useful to [its opponent] in defending against [the] action"); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.</span>, 862 F.2d 910, 925 (1st Cir. 1988) (finding bad faith "where concealment was knowing and purposeful," or where a party "intentionally shred[s] documents in order to stymie the opposition"); <span class="Italic">Gumbs v. Int'l Harvester, Inc.</span>, 718 F.2d 88, 96 (3d Cir. 1983) (noting that an adverse inference from destruction of documents is permitted only when the destruction was "intentional, and indicates fraud and a desire to suppress the truth") (citation omitted). The fundamental element of bad faith spoliation is advantage-<span class="Italic">seek</span>ing behavior by the party with superior access to information necessary for the proper administration of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the district court's analysis of bad faith follows its conclusion on spoliation and does not fully explain the factual underpinnings of its bad faith determination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">55.&#x2003;The court concludes that litigation was reasonably <span class="Italic">foresee</span>able no later than December 1998, when Karp had articulated a time frame and a motive for implementation of the Rambus litigation strategy. Moreover, because the document retention policy was discussed and adopted within the context of Rambus' litigation strategy, the court finds that Rambus knew, or should have known, that a general implementation of the policy was inappropriate because the documents destroyed would become material at some point in the future. Therefore, a duty to preserve potentially relevant evidence arose in December 1998 and any documents purged from that time forward are deemed to have been intentionally destroyed, i.e. destroyed in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Decision</span>, 255 F.R.D. at 150. A determination of bad faith is normally a prerequisite to the imposition of dispositive sanctions for spoliation under the district court's inherent power, and must be made with caution. <span id="Page_1508"></span>In determining that a spoliator acted in bad faith, a district court must do more than state the conclusion of spoliation and note that the document destruction was intentional. <span class="Italic">See Mathis v. John Morden Buick, Inc.</span>, 136 F.3d 1153, 1155 (7th Cir. 1998) ("That the documents were destroyed <span class="Italic">intentionally</span> no one can doubt, but 'bad faith' means destruction for the purpose of hiding adverse information.") (emphasis added). From the district court's sparse analysis, this court is unable to determine whether the district court applied the applicable exacting standard in making its factual determination that Rambus acted in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The district court's opinion alludes to several key items, including: (1) facts tending to show that Rambus's document retention policy was adopted within the auspices of a firm litigation plan rather than merely carried out despite the reasonable <span class="Italic">foresee</span>ability of such litigation, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Decision</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17, 53, 55 and n.29; (2) facts tending to show the selective execution of the document retention policy, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Decision</span> &#x00B6; 13 and n.23, 27; (3) facts tending to show Rambus's acknowledgement of the impropriety of the document retention policy, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Decision</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 38 and n.24, 47; and (4) Rambus's litigation misconduct, <span class="Italic">Decision</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 37-39. While these items may lead to a determination of bad faith, the district court did not make clear the basis on which it reached that conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"It is not our task to make factual findings," <span class="Italic">Golden Hour Data Sys., Inc. v. emsCharts, Inc.</span>, 614 F.3d 1367, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2010), and we will leave it to the district court's sound discretion on remand to analyze these, and any other, relevant facts as they apply to the determination of bad faith, <span class="Italic">see Thomas v. Capital Sec. Servs., Inc.</span>, 836 F.2d 866, 873 (5th Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) ("[T]he district court will have a better grasp of what is acceptable trial-level practice among litigating members of the bar than will appellate judges.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the district court applied a "knew or should have known" standard in its bad faith determination. On remand, the district court should limit its bad faith analysis to the proper inquiry: whether Rambus "intended to impair the ability of the potential defendant to defend itself," <span class="Italic">Schmid</span>, 13 F.3d at 80, without regard to whether Rambus "should have known" of the propriety of its document destruction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Litigations are fought and won with information. If the district court finds facts to conclude that Rambus's goal in implementing its document retention policy was to obtain an advantage in litigation through the control of information and evidence, it would be justified in making a finding of bad faith. If, on the other hand, the district court determines that Rambus implemented its document retention policy for legitimate business reasons such as general house-keeping, a finding of bad faith would be unwarranted. Without a finding either way, however, "the opinion explaining the decision lacks adequate fact findings, [and] meaningful review is not possible." <span class="Italic">Dennison Mfg. Co. v. Panduit Corp.</span>, 475 U.S. 809, 811 (1986). This court therefore remands for the district court to further assess the factual record in reaching a determination on bad faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">ii.&#x2003;Prejudice</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prejudice to the opposing party requires a showing that the spoliation "materially affect[s] the substantial rights of the adverse party and is prejudicial to the presentation of his case." <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.</span>, 561 F.2d 494, 504 (4th Cir. 1977) (internal quotation marks omitted). In satisfying that burden, a party must only "come forward with plausible, concrete <span class="Italic">suggestions</span> as to what [the destroyed] evidence <span class="Italic">might have been</span>." <span class="Italic">Schmid</span>, 13 F.3d at 80 (emphases added). <span class="Italic">See also Leon</span>, 464 F.3d at 960 ("[B]ecause any number of the 2,200 files could have been relevant to IDX's claims or defenses, although it is impossible to identify which files and how they might have been used...the district court did not clearly err in its finding of prejudice."). If it is shown that the spoliator acted in bad faith, the spoliator bears the "heavy burden" to show a lack of prejudice to the opposing party because "[a] party who is guilty of...intentionally shredding documents...should not easily be able to excuse the misconduct by claiming that the vanished documents were of minimal import." <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.</span>, 862 F.2d 910, 925 (1st Cir. 1988). <span class="Italic">See also Coates v. Johnson &#x0026; Johnson</span>, 756 F.2d 524, 551 (7th Cir. 1985) ("The prevailing rule is that bad faith destruction of a document relevant to proof of an issue at trial gives rise to a strong inference that production of the document would have been unfavorable to the party responsible for its destruction.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that Rambus destroyed between 9,000 and 18,000 pounds of documents in 300 boxes. The district court concluded that the destroyed documents were relevant to at least the following defenses, which would have been "illuminated by evidence of a non-public nature, e.g. by internal Rambus documents": "unenforceability due to patent misuse and violation of the antitrust and unfair competition laws (based in part on Rambus's conduct at JEDEC), as well as inequitable conduct." <span class="Italic">Decision</span>, 255 F.R.D. at 150-51. Documents relating to Rambus's conduct at JEDEC, together with documents reflecting Rambus's instructions to its patent prosecution counsel concerning its conduct at JEDEC, could have helped resolve Micron's claims relating to patent misuse, antitrust violations, and unfair competition. Documents reflecting Rambus's knowledge of relevant prior art references could have helped resolve Micron's inequitable conduct claims. On the other hand, because it is not clear what documents were destroyed, it may be, as Rambus argues, that all the documents destroyed were either redundant or irrelevant to the trial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proper resolution of this issue turns largely on whether Rambus has the burden to show lack of prejudice or Micron has the burden to show prejudice. As discussed above, this turns on whether the district court, on remand, concludes that Rambus was a bad faith spoliator. The question of prejudice is therefore also remanded.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The circuit rejected a spoliation claim, <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 656 Fed. Appx. 1000, 1002 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject Mr. Diaz's assertion that the Administrative Judge erred by failing to draw an adverse inference based on spoliation of evidence. The records were destroyed in the ordinary course of business. Moreover, Mr. Diaz had an opportunity to request the records during discovery but did not do so until the prehearing conference. Because Mr. Diaz failed to timely request the records, the Board did not abuse its discretion in affirming the Administrative Judge's decision not to draw an adverse inference based on spoliation of evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Spoliation was evaluated as to government records retention and destruction in VA benefits litigation, <span class="Italic">Alexce v, Shinseki</span>, 447 Fed. Appx. 175, 178 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no force to the argument that the destruction of duplicative materials constitutes spoliation of evidence or that there is anything improper in the DVA's practice of retaining only a single copy of particular medical records in veterans' claim files in an effort to maintain orderly records. The routine destruction of duplicative documents does not present the risk of denying an adversary access to relevant information, which is what the doctrine of spoliation is directed to. <span class="Italic">See Jandreau v. Nicholson,</span> 492 F.3d 1372, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that an adverse inference for spoliation of evidence requires proof that evidence was destroyed "with a culpable state of mind" and that it was "relevant to the party's claim or defense"); <span class="Italic">see also Kirkendall v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 573 F.3d 1318, 1325-27 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (spoliation found when agency destroyed relevant documents in violation its own document retention program and petitioner made a "compelling case" that his effort to prove his case was hampered by the destruction of the documents). There was no showing that the destruction of the duplicate records in this case was contrary to routine agency practice or was done to deprive Mr. Alexce of relevant evidence, and there is no showing that the absence of duplicate copies of records already found in the file in any way deprived Mr. Alexce of relevant evidence with which to support his claim. Like the Veterans Court, we therefore reject Mr. Alexce's theory of spoliation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for Mr. Alexce's argument that the destruction of his records deprived him of due process, Mr. Alexce did not make that argument until his motion for reconsideration in the Veterans Court; it was therefore not timely raised. In any event, there is no force to the argument. Due process ensures a party a meaningful right to be heard with respect to the denial of important governmental benefits, including veterans disability benefits. <span class="Italic">Cushman v. Shinseki,</span> 563 F.3d 1290, 1298-1300 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The routine destruction of duplicative medical records was not shown to have had any effect whatsoever on Mr. Alexce's right to be heard with regard to his claim for increased disability benefits. Absent any arguable effect on his ability to prove his right to those benefits, Mr. Alexce cannot demonstrate an impairment of his opportunity to be heard with respect to those benefits. We therefore sustain the decision of the Veterans Court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the agency should have retained some video records of an incident, but they were destroyed based on the agency's documentation requirements, <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> AT-0752-15-0471-I-1 (NP 3/11/2016), declined to require an adverse inference against the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We find that the appellant has not demonstrated that the administrative judge abused his discretion in declining to draw an adverse inference against the agency. <span class="Italic">See Leseman v.

There appears to be no dispute that the agency no longer had the audio and video recordings when the appellant asked for them through his union information request and that the appellant never requested the materials through discovery in his Board appeal, or timely moved to compel their production. In light of the agency's immediate awareness of the altercation between the appellant and the taxpayer and the resulting TIGTA investigation, the agency should have taken affirmative steps to preserve the audio and video recordings. However, we find no evidence to support the appellant's assertions that the agency deliberately destroyed the evidence to thwart his defense, as opposed to negligently allowing the evidence to be destroyed pursuant to routine policies. <span class="Italic">See Hidalgo v. Department of Justice</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 645, &#x00B6; 23 (2003) (denying a request for a negative inference against an agency where an agency investigator destroyed his notes of his interviews with <span id="Page_1509"></span>an appellant and testified that it was his practice to destroy his interview notes on completion of his investigatory reports).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the agency presented testimony from witnesses, including S.C. and J.G., with first-hand knowledge of the incident in question, afforded the appellant an opportunity to cross-examine those witnesses, and otherwise provided sufficient documentary and testimonial evidence to prove the charges by preponderant evidence. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to draw an adverse inference under the facts of this case, nor would an inference be sufficient to change the outcome here in view of the record as a whole. <span class="Italic">See Hidalgo,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 645, &#x00B6; 23 (finding that a negative inference based on destruction of evidence was not warranted where the agency presented testimony from a witness with first-hand knowledge of the facts at issue, afforded the appellant the opportunity to cross-examine the witness, and otherwise proved the charges by preponderant evidence).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to upset an AJ's decision not to sanction an agency for alleged spoliation of evidence, <span class="Italic">Pacious v. NASA,</span> DC-0752-10-0745-I-1 (NP 6/27/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency's failure to preserve the surveillance tape of the incident was not relevant and raises other arguments related to the surveillance tape. He appears to be reasserting part of the "spoliation" claim he made below by raising, in effect, a belated objection to the administrative judge's denial of his motion for sanctions against the agency for negligently failing to preserve and produce the surveillance tape of the March 25, 2010 incident at the agency's headquarters. The appellant has not shown based on the record that the administrative judge abused her discretion in denying his motion for sanctions. <span class="Italic">See generally Hodge v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</span>, 360 F.3d 446, 449-51 (4th Cir. 2004) (the imposition of an adverse inference sanction for spoliation of evidence is discretionary). There appears to be no dispute that the agency no longer had surveillance tape of the incident by the time the appellant made his untimely discovery requests. We find no evidence that the agency was dishonest and acted in bad faith by deliberately destroying evidence to thwart his defense. <span class="Italic">See Hildago v. Department of Justice</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 645, &#x00B6; 23 (2003) (denying a request for a negative inference in connection with an investigator who destroyed his notes of his interviews with the appellant and testified that it was his practice to destroy his interview notes upon completion of his investigatory reports). The administrative judge did not abuse her discretion under the facts of this case in declining to draw an adverse inference nor would an inference be sufficient to change the outcome here in view of the record as a whole.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A negative inference is not conclusive; it must be weighed against all evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cohen v. Austin</span>, 861 F. Supp. 340 (E.D. Pa. 1994). The Board may avoid the problem of a negative inference by recognizing the importance of some evidence that may be in the possession of the agency and directing the agency to attempt to locate that evidence and produce it for consideration by the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pagtakhan v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 75, 78 (1989) (OPM was directed to search for evidence of creditable federal service, an identification badge, that the appellant claimed he sent some years earlier to the Civil Service Commission); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hidalgo v. DOJ</span>, 93 MSPR 645, 656-57 &#x00B6; 23 (2003) (agency rebutted any negative inference arising from destruction of the investigator's interview notes by having that official testify concerning his report and by providing other documentary and testimonial evidence to support its misconduct charges).
