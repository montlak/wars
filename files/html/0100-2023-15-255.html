<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-253"><span class="space">d.</span> Employment Application</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Until <span class="Italic">Perez v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 503, 506 (1997), good performance was not a mitigating factor as to a falsified employment application. However, if the agency considered performance as a mitigating factor, "[t]he Board will not usurp the agency's primary role in selecting the penalty by ignoring those mitigating factors the agency itself relied upon." <span class="Italic">Beardsley v. DOD</span>, 55 MSPR 504, 511 (1992); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 484, 492 n.33, <span class="Italic">post</span> (noting some decisions involving falsified employment applications).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit at least suggested that mitigation could be appropriate for a removal based on a falsified employment application, but it determined that mitigation was inappropriate when the appellant's past record included misrepresentations. <span class="Italic">Carter v. SSA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1263); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Devine v. Sutermeister</span>, 724 F.2d 1558, 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (reviewing an arbitrator's award mitigating a removal, based on an OPM reconsideration petition: "OPM's contention that an appointment obtained through material misrepresentation is void or voidable borders on the whimsical. Nowhere in the CSRA can we find the statement or implication that a removal based upon an appointment obtained through material misrepresentation is to be treated differently from any other basis for an adverse action. The attenuated analogies offered by OPM provide scant basis for the conclusion that once the fact of material misrepresentation is proven, no review of the penalty imposed is possible."); <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 782 F.2d 975 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (analyzing intent concerning a charge that the appellant falsified an application).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Subsequently, <span class="Italic">Futrell v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 93-3450), directed mitigation of removal of a correctional officer charged with falsifying his SF-86 investigative form, "Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions," that asked whether he had been arrested, charged, or convicted of any offense and whether he had ever had a legal judgment against him for a debt. He was charged with failing to list criminal charges and failing to list a legal judgment of $56.20. The AJ determined that the agency did not prove that the appellant failed to list charges of the criminal offense, but the AJ determined that the appellant did fail to list the debt. The Board sustained the removal, but the court remanded for penalty reevaluation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the penalty of removal is within the range of permissible punishment specified by statute or regulation. However, agency tables of penalties should not be applied so inflexibly as to impair consideration of other factors relevant to the individual case<span class="Italic">. Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 307. A penalty may be excessive in a particular case even if within the range permitted by statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, 531 F.2d 505 (Ct. Cl. 1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, whenever the agency's action is based on multiple charges, careful consideration must be made as to whether the sustained charges merited the penalty imposed by the agency. Responsible judgment must be exercised. Selection of an appropriate penalty must involve a balancing of the relevant factors involved<span class="Italic">. Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 306. Here, we find that the penalty of removal was so harsh and disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion by the agency. <span class="Italic">Power</span>, 531 F.2d at 507.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot overemphasize that the amount at issue here was a mere $56.20 as to which there may have been good grounds for alleging he was not personally responsible for it. Additionally, that the Government's serious allegation that Mr. Futrell was charged with criminal offenses no less than five times was not sustained and the removal was instead sustained on the much less serious charge of failing to report the $56.20 judgment is also significant. Indeed, based on the record before us, attention consistently centered around the criminal charges, not the judgment. Additionally, the Board, in sustaining the removal penalty, relied on the testimony of the deciding official that removal was appropriate because Mr. Futrell's conduct raised questions about his honesty. However, the deciding official had, in addition to the specification regarding the judgment, sustained the specification for failure to report criminal charges which the Board found to have been not proven.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These facts lead us to conclude that the penalty of removal was not appropriate here and was an abuse of discretion. We note, finally, that this situation is unique and the general rule remains that the penalty imposed by the agency will be viewed as a matter within its discretion unless such discretion has been abused. This case represents an abuse of discretion. We accordingly reverse the decision of the Board with respect to the penalty and remand for consideration of an appropriate penalty. <span class="Italic">See Miguel v.

<p class="Body-Text">Reviewing an OPM-directed suitability removal for charges that included failing to list criminal convictions on an employment application, the Federal Circuit determined that the Board erred when it failed to consider in mitigation 28 years of government service, a good service record, several awards, testimonials to the employee's worthiness from supervisors and coworkers, and an explanation for the falsified entry. <span class="Italic">Shelton v. OPM</span>, 28 MSPR 389, 391 (1985), was remanded for imposition of a penalty less than removal. <span class="Italic">Shelton v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 86-543). On remand the Board directed the appellant's reinstatement, subject to a 120-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Shelton v. OPM</span>, 34 MSPR 356, 358-59 (1987) (decision limited to specific circumstances of case, to be of no precedential value in future cases).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit directed mitigation in <span class="Italic">McComb v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3077), involving a charge of false statement concerning a conviction in an employment application, coupled with a charge that the appellant falsified the starting time of a coworker. McComb failed to disclose a previous conviction for charges of fraudulent use of a credit card and third-degree burglary, leading to nine months served in a correctional facility. The time and attendance charge was that McComb clocked in a worker who was "late because of a nose bleed." The Board sustained removal, but the court did not:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the board found that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Falsification is a serious offense. And, regardless of the motivation for the falsification, the conduct goes to the core of the employer/employee relationship and impeaches the individual's reliability, veracity, trustworthiness, and ethical conduct. This is not to say that the imposition of a penalty less than removal is out of the question. For, clearly it is not. However, in this case, the appellant engaged in a second act of falsification after he was hired based upon a falsified application, albeit some 12 years later. Moreover, his criminal record involves not only fraud but also burglary. Thus, in spite of his approximately 26 years of satisfactory service with the Federal government, including 11 years with the agency, and his remorse for falsifying the timecard of a coworker, I find that the penalty of removal is within the bounds of reasonableness.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot agree that the penalty of removal is reasonable. Although falsification is a serious offense, the offense that triggered the investigation was minor and motivated by altruism. Also, McComb's falsification of his employment application took place more than a decade before he falsified his co-worker's time card. In the interim and during previous service with the federal government, McComb's service was satisfactory. The board's decision was not supported by substantial evidence. We reverse the decision and remand the case so the board may remand the case to the agency for imposition of a reasonable penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Perez v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 503, 506-07 (1997), abandoned the notion that long and good performance has no mitigating effect on a removal for a falsified employment application. It appears that the agency charged that the appellant, a supervisor of distribution operations, falsified his employment application when he failed to report that he was convicted of "conspiracy to burglarize," when the underlying criminal charge was "willful failure to appear." Replacing the removal with a reprimand, the Board explained that staunch adherence to inflexible rules contravenes the flexibility demanded by mitigation analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In some cases, the Board has considered mitigating factors in connection with charges of falsification of employment applications<span class="Italic">. See McCreary v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 27 MSPR 459, 462 (1985) (in a suitability appeal involving falsification of an employment application, the Board considered the employee's argument that he had the potential to be rehabilitated); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation,</span> 8 MSPB 97, 8 MSPR 410, 412-13 (1981) (the Board considered the employee's past work record when it affirmed removal for falsification of SF-171). In most cases, however, the Board has expressly declined to consider mitigating factors in cases involving falsification of employment documents. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. Department of Defense</span>, 55 MSPR 625, 631 (1992); <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 52 MSPR 45, 47 (1991), <span class="Italic">affd</span>, 980 F.2d 744 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table); <span class="Italic">Cadena v. Department of Justice,</span> 3 MSPB 390, 3 MSPR 304, 307 (1980). Such an inflexible standard is not consistent with the Board's penalty law requiring that all significant factors be considered in each case. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Parsons v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 21 MSPR 438, 446 (1984) (an agency cannot automatically impose removal for any offense involving dishonesty "and still give meaningful consideration to the requirements of...<span class="Italic">Douglas</span>"). Thus, we reject a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule (to the extent one has been implied in our caselaw) that removal is always warranted where an employee has falsified his or her employment application. <span class="Italic">See Wilcox v. US Postal Service</span>, 9 MSPB 128, 9 MSPR 493, 495 (1982) (falsification of an application for postal employment <span class="Italic">may</span> justify the employee's removal); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Gamble v. US Postal Service</span>, 6 MSPB 487, 6 MSPR 578, 582, n.6 (1981) (while the Board affirmed the employee's removal for dishonest conduct in failing to inform a state agency from which his wife was receiving welfare benefits that he was employed, the Board noted that removal is not necessarily warranted merely because there is the requisite nexus between the misconduct and the efficiency of the service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in the instant case had 15 years of federal service, 11 years of which were with the agency. The agency has not shown or claimed that the appellant has committed any offense involving dishonesty, or any offense at all, during his employment with the agency. In addition, while the agency initially charged that the appellant falsified his employment application when he failed to report that he had been convicted of "conspiracy to burglarize," it was discovered later that the underlying criminal charge was actually "willful failure to appear." In view of the foregoing mitigating factors, particularly the length of time that has elapsed with no further misconduct by the appellant, a suspension or demotion would be purely punitive rather than rehabilitative. Since, however, the appellant did falsify his employment application, his employment records should reflect that misconduct. In light of all of these factors, we conclude under the particular circumstances of this case that the removal should be mitigated to a written reprimand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Law that developed prior to <span class="Italic">Perez</span> was unforgiving. The occasional Federal Circuit decision notwithstanding, the Board generally declined to mitigate a removal for falsification of an SF-171. The bottom line was that "[t]he desire and need for a job cannot justify falsifying the employment application to obtain the job." <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. DOD</span>, 55 MSPR 625, 632 (1992) (omission of criminal convictions). An appellant's performance in a position had no relevance to the charge of falsification of an employment application, <span class="Italic">Kissner v. OPM</span>, 28 MSPR 392, 393-94 n.2 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Cadena v. DOJ</span>, 3 MSPR 304, 309-10 (1980)), and the fact that an appellant made no false statements in a current SF-171 did not "absolve him of culpability" for the false statements he made previously. <span class="Italic">Beardsley v. DOD</span>, 55 MSPR 504, 511 (1992); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Reed v. OPM</span>, 74 MSPR 616, 621 (1997) (as to a suitability determination: "[T]hat an employee later corrects false information on an employment document does not absolve him from previous false statements[.] "). The Board considered speculative and immaterial the statement of the individual who hired the appellant that the selection would still have been made had the falsification not occurred. <span class="Italic">DeAngelis v. OPM</span>, 28 MSPR 456, 458 (1985) (suitability removal). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Perry v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 81, 86 (1987) (reversing removal of employee who obtained VRA appointment without intent to defraud but on the basis of misrepresenting his educational level--a statement material to his eligibility for the VRA appointment). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">In re Spielman,</span> 1 MSPR 54, 60-61, 1 MSPB 50 (1979) (ALJ Decision) (individual who falsified an application for an administrative law judge position was suspended rather than removed because of the mitigating effects of an intervening excellent performance and presumed rehabilitation).
