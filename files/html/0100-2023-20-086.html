<p class="Body-Text">It is the use of a grievance procedure under a negotiated agreement that constitutes an election, not the use of an agency administrative grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See Basil v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-1221-21-0633-W-1 (NP 3/23/2023) ("Thus, by filing the administrative grievance, the appellant did not elect a remedy pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) that would preclude Board jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Mason v.

Department of Defense</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 229, &#x00B6; 16 (2006) (same)."); <span class="Italic">Mason v. DHS</span>, 116 MSPR 135, 138 n.1, 2011 MSPB 39 (2011); <span class="Italic">Garrison v. DOD</span>, 101 MSPR 229, 237 &#x00B6; 16, 2006 MSPB 38 (2006). [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-241.html#sec1-237">Effect of Collective Bargaining Contract Grievance or Related Procedures; 5 USC 7121</a>."] The Federal Circuit affirmed dismissal of a Board IRA appeal based on earlier resort to a contract grievance procedure, <span class="Italic">Louie v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/06-3320.pdf">211 Fed. Appx. 942</a>, 946 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3790"></span>Louie failed to make non-frivolous allegations that establish Board jurisdiction over several appealed claims. With respect to Louie's demotion, non-selection under vacancy announcement No. LA-96-170, his lowered performance rating, the dissemination of his appraisal, the alleged 1998 threats by his supervisor, and a 1998 admonishment letter, he is barred by &#x00A7; 7121(g) from requesting corrective action with OSC and filing an IRA at the Board. Under &#x00A7; 7121(g)(2), an employee that is covered by a collective bargaining agreement ("CBA") and who believes he has suffered reprisal for whistleblowing disclosures may elect only one of three remedies: an appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701; a grievance filed pursuant to the negotiated grievance procedure; or a request for corrective action with OSC, followed by an IRA appeal to the Board if OSC denies corrective action. <span class="Italic">Holderfield v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 326 F.3d 1207, 1210 (Fed. Cir. 2003). It is undisputed that Louie is an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement which includes a negotiated grievance procedure and that he already filed an appeal of his demotion directly to the Board in 2000. Since Louie already elected to pursue his personnel action claims regarding the demotion with an appeal to the Board under &#x00A7; 7701, he is barred from bringing those claims again under &#x00A7; 7121(g)(4). Likewise, earlier grievance filings regarding his non-selection under vacancy announcement No. LA-96-170, the lowered performance rating, the dissemination of his appraisal, the alleged 1998 threats by his supervisor, and an admonishment letter act as a bar to a subsequent IRA appeal of these same claims.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial filing with the Board, and in a later filing regarding jurisdiction, the appellant argued that his filing a written grievance should not be considered to be a binding election because he did not know that filing a grievance would preclude him from pursuing other remedies.

<p class="Body-Text">The 1998 <span class="Italic">Feiertag</span> decision was overruled in <span class="Italic">Agoranos v. DOJ,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/AGORANOS_PETER_J_CH_1221_11_0466_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_829963.pdf">119 MSPR 498</a>, 503-06 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-16, 2013 MSPB 41 (2013), determining that the agency must make the appellant aware of the election of remedies for a choice to bind the appellant in an action otherwise properly before the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that the appellate jurisdiction of the Board may be limited if a negotiated grievance procedure established pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement is in effect between the agency and its employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Greer v. Housing and Urban Development</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 90, 92 (1984). However, &#x00A7; 7121 contains three provisions giving employees other options with regard to avenues of relief other than the negotiated grievance procedure for certain personnel actions. Specifically, where an employee is affected by an action that is otherwise exclusively committed to the negotiated grievance procedure under &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1), but that may also be a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1), i.e., unlawful discrimination, the employee may "raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d)(1). Similarly, with regard to matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512, which are also covered by a negotiated grievance procedure, the employee may elect to pursue the contractual remedy or relief through the Board's appellate procedures, but not both. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1). In both instances, whichever remedy is sought first by an aggrieved employee is deemed an election of that procedure and precludes pursuing the matter in either of the other two forums.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The third alternative avenue of relief, which is applicable in this appeal, provides that pursuant to the 1994 amendments to the WPA, an employee who has been subjected to an action appealable to the Board and who alleges that he has been affected by a prohibited personnel practice other than a claim of discrimination under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), may elect to pursue a remedy through one, and only one, of the following remedial processes: (1) an appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701; (2) a grievance filed pursuant to the provisions of the negotiated grievance procedure; or (3) a complaint following the procedures for seeking corrective action from OSC under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1211-1222. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g); <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 423, &#x00B6; 8 (2011). Again, whichever remedy is sought first by an aggrieved employee is deemed an election of that procedure and precludes pursuing the matter in either of the other two forums. <span class="Italic">Feiertag v. Department of the Army</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 264, &#x00B6; 5 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For matters arising under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(d) and (e), the Board has long held in appeals that an agency's failure to provide proper notice of the "potential avenues of recourse" and of the limitations on those rights precludes finding that the employee has made a knowing and informed election and thus renders it invalid. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Johnson v. Department of Labor</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 447, 450 (1985) (RIF notice deficient insofar as it failed to notify employee of right to pursue statutory procedures where allegation of discrimination is made, and employee's subsequent filing of grievance was not an informed election such as to deprive the Board of jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Blanshan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 84, 86 (1984) (same); <span class="Italic">Miyai v. Department of Transportation</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 15, 20 (1986) (fact that employee first filed grievance over agency's putting him on enforced leave did not preclude Board jurisdiction over his suspension where agency failed to notify him of his right to file an appeal or any limitations on that right).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in <span class="Italic">Feiertag</span>, the Board departed from this longstanding approach of enforcing only a knowing and informed election of remedies when it held that an election of remedies made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) is binding regardless of whether the "individual is aware of all of his options, and of the effect that pursuing a particular option will have on his ability to pursue other options." 80 M.S.P.R. 264, &#x00B6; 7. The Board explained the decision by saying that nothing in the WPA amendments or legislative history indicates that only a knowing and informed election under that section is binding. However, the Board offered no explanation for construing the election provision in &#x00A7; 7121(g) so radically differently from those in &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(d) and (e) which likewise contain no express requirement that an election made thereunder be knowing and informed. We note that <span class="Italic">Feiertag</span> is factually distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Johnson, Blanshan</span>, and <span class="Italic">Miyai</span>, because the personnel action at issue there was a 6-day suspension without pay, which is not an adverse action appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C., chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Feiertag</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 264, &#x00B6; 2. Thus, the Board may have been reluctant to extend the "knowing and informed" requirement to elections under &#x00A7; 7121(g) because of the resulting burden on agencies to issue notice of election rights in effecting even <span id="Page_3791"></span>relatively minor personnel actions. In any event, we discern no basis upon which to conclude that Congress intended that the election of remedies requirement in one section of &#x00A7; 7121 have an entirely different meaning in another section of the very same provision. Rather, consistent with the general rules of statutory construction, we can presume that, in adding 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g), Congress was aware of the Board's interpretation of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(d) and (e) as requiring that any election thereunder be knowing and informed in order to be enforceable. <span class="Italic">Cf. Benifield v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 50, 53 (1989). If Congress had intended that a different interpretation be given to an election under &#x00A7; 7121(g), it could have expressed that intention when it enacted the amendments. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Its failure to do so supports the conclusion that Congress intended to extend the Board's requirement of a knowing and informed election of remedies to &#x00A7; 7121(g). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Such a conclusion is further buttressed by the fact that, in amending &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) to note the addition of &#x00A7; 7121(g), Congress framed the elections under the three sections as equivalent exceptions to the exclusivity of negotiated grievance procedures. Accordingly, we overrule <span class="Italic">Feiertag</span> to the extent that it applies a different rule to all elections under &#x00A7; 7121(g). Specifically, we now hold that for adverse actions appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512, an employee's election of remedies under subsection (g) must be knowing and informed, and, if it is not, it will not be binding upon the employee.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;However, for personnel actions that are not covered under 5 U.S.C. chapters 43 or 75, but for which the statute affords a remedy as contemplated under &#x00A7; 7121(g), we do not suggest that an agency has any statutory obligation with regard to issuing notice of appeal rights. Rather, as reflected in our new regulations, when an agency takes an action against an employee that is directly appealable to the Board, it must provide notice of the avenues of relief available to the employee and of the preclusive effect of first filing on the other remedial options. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Agoranos</span> was followed by <span class="Italic">Johnson v. VA</span>, 121 MSPR 695, 699-700 &#x00B6; 8, 2014 MSPB 82 (2014), determining that an IRA appeal (although precluded by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>), was not barred by a grievance when the appellant was not notified by the agency of his right to pursue his case through OSC and an IRA remedy:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the agency's decision letter appears to have complied with the Board's regulations in effect at that time regarding notice of appeal rights to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(a)(4) (2009). Those regulations were amended in November 2012 to provide that an agency that issues a decision notice to an employee on a matter that is appealable to the Board must provide the employee with, among other things, notice of any right to file a grievance or seek correction action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(d) (2013). Nevertheless, regardless of the nature of the notice provided to the appellant by the agency, the choice of remedy provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) has been in effect since the 1994 amendments to the WPA. <span class="Italic">See Edwards v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 307, &#x00B6; 12 (2013). The ultimate question is whether the appellant made a knowing and informed election. <span class="Italic">See Agoranos</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 16. There is no indication that the appellant was aware, when he elected to grieve his removal, that he could have instead sought corrective action from OSC and the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Agoranos</span> was again applied,<span class="Italic"> Castro v. Dept. of Army,</span> DA-0752-14-0660-I-1 (NP 3/9//2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the agency notified the appellant of his right to appeal his removal to the Board or file a request for corrective action with OSC. The agency, however, did not notify the appellant of the effect that electing to file a Board appeal would have before OSC. Similarly, the agency did not notify the appellant of the effect that electing to request corrective action with OSC would have before the Board. Therefore, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Agoranos</span>, the appellant has not made a knowing and informed election under section 7121(g) of either the Board appeal process or OSC procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although <span class="Italic">Agoranos</span> did not bar an IRA appeal when the agency did not fully inform the employee of elections of remedies in the removal decision, <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> barred the IRA case subsequent to an adverse action appeal, withdrawn with prejudice, that could have raised a whistleblowing reprisal defense. <span class="Italic">Bailey v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The first initial decision, a dismissal of the appellant's removal appeal as withdrawn, was issued by the Board, an adjudicatory body of competent jurisdiction. Although the appellant alleges on review that no hearing was held and that the merits of the removal action were not fully adjudicated, that dismissal was nonetheless a final judgment on the merits for purposes of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 10 (2006) (stating that dismissals with prejudice based on a withdrawal of an appeal generally are considered final decisions, and relitigating such appeals is barred by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>). In addition, notwithstanding the different theories of recovery arising from the appellant's removal, the same cause of action and the same parties were involved in both her initial appeal and her IRA appeal. Because <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> precludes the appellant from relitigating issues that were, or could have been, raised in the prior action, <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 9, the administrative judge properly dismissed this IRA appeal as barred under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> even though the appellant did not raise a whistleblower retaliation claim as an affirmative defense in her first appeal of her removal, because she could have raised that claim in her first appeal, <span class="Italic">Zgonc v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...This argument requires the Board to delve into the workings and alleged unfairness of the agency's negotiated grievance procedure. The Board lacks the authority to conduct such an inquiry. <span class="Italic">See Berry v. Department of Justice</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 676, 677-78 (1986).

DOD</span>, 77 MSPR 598, 600-01 (1998); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Shriver v.

<p class="Body-Text">An appellant may not use a contract grievance procedure to challenge agency actions and then bring the same actions to the Board through an IRA appeal but under a different theory, <span class="Italic">Holderfield v. MSPB</span>, 128 Fed. Appx. 109, 112 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree, however, with the Board that Holderfield's allegations of "personnel actions" are precluded from consideration in this appeal because of Holderfield's prior election of the grievance procedure. In the grievance procedure, Holderfield complained of numerous incidents of verbal abuse by Chambers, in addition to other incidents of rude and embarrassing behavior. The agency, in turn, offered, and Holderfield accepted, a settlement agreement that resolved the aforementioned complaints. Holderfield cannot now reassert the same alleged "personnel actions" to establish jurisdiction for a whistleblower IRA based on the same operative facts to obtain further relief. We also find that the Board did not err in disregarding two of Holderfield's allegations of "personnel actions" for referencing events that took place after the IRA appeal was filed at the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Holderfield</span> was not mentioned, but its underlying analysis was followed in <span class="Italic">Sherman v. DHS</span>, 122 MSPR 644, 652-54 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-17, 2015 MSPB 52 (2015), concluding that a grievance protesting a personnel action (a performance appraisal) barred a later IRA complaint and appeal even if the grievance did not assert whistleblowing reprisal, and also concluding that a grievance was timely filed when the agency effectively waived a timeliness objection by deciding the grievance on the merits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g), an individual who is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and who believes that he has suffered reprisal for making protected disclosures may elect not more than one of three remedies: (1) an appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701; (2) a grievance filed pursuant to the provisions of the negotiated grievance procedure; or (3) the procedures for seeking corrective action from OSC. <span class="Italic">McCarty v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 74, &#x00B6; 10 (2007). An employee shall be considered to have elected the negotiated grievance procedure if he timely filed a grievance in writing in accordance with the parties' negotiated procedure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Whichever remedy is sought first is deemed an election of that procedure and precludes pursuing the matter in either of the other two fora. <span class="Italic">Scalera v. Department of the Navy</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 43, &#x00B6; 9 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant elected to grieve his fiscal year 2013 performance evaluation, thereby foreclosing the Board's jurisdiction over that personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Giove v. Department of Transportation</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 560, &#x00B6; 10 (2001) (under section 7121(g), the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal of an employee who timely elected a negotiated grievance procedure), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 50 F. App'x 421 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Specifically, on November 18, 2013, December 30, 2013, and March 4, 2014, he filed grievances regarding his fiscal year 2013 evaluation. These filings were all prior to the appellant's June 11, 2014 OSC whistleblower complaint. Therefore, no matter on which of these dates the agency completed the performance evaluation, it is undisputed that the appellant first filed a grievance of that personnel action under negotiated grievance procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant admits that he grieved the performance evaluation before he filed his complaint with OSC. He argues, however, that this did not constitute an election of remedies for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) because he did not raise whistleblower reprisal as an issue in his grievance.[6] We disagree. The Board has not interpreted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) to allow an employee to escape the election requirement by basing his case in various fora on different theories. Rather, the Board looks to the forum in which the personnel action was first challenged, under whatever theory, to determine which election the employee made. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Delaney v. U.S. Agency for International Development,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 9 (1998) (the Board lacks jurisdiction over an appeal from a personnel action if the affected employee already has elected to challenge that action through another means under a statute requiring an election of just one avenue of redress); <span class="Italic">Peltier v. Department of Justice,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6; 13 (1998) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The appellant also appears to argue that his grievances challenged the performance evaluation processes and procedures, whereas his whistleblower complaint challenged his final rating. We find that this is a distinction without a difference because the appellant, in both cases, ultimately sought to change his rating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under a similar election provision in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), the Board found that, even when an appellant's prior grievance did not contain a discrimination claim, his filing of the grievance still constituted an election of remedies for purposes of that provision. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Justice</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 117, 119-20, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 983 F.2d 1088 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table); <span class="Italic">see generally Agoranos v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-16 (2013) (noting the similarity between the election provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121, subsections (d), (e), and (g)). Like 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) provides that "[A]n aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice" covered under this subsection may elect only one remedy. Both subsections list the applicable menu of remedies, and both provide that the timely filing of a grievance is an election of that forum. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), (g)(4)(B). There is no basis for us to interpret subsection (g) any differently than the Board interpreted subsection (d) in Jones. We find that, for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g), an employee may be deemed to have elected a remedy regardless of whether he raised a prohibited personnel practice in his filing. The operative question is not which prohibited personnel practices, if any, the employee raised in his first filing, but rather which personnel actions he challenged. To allow a single personnel action to be challenged in multiple fora under different theories would undermine the benefits of consistency and administrative efficiency that the election provisions provide.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleges that he did not conclude that he was being retaliated against for whistleblowing until after he filed his Step III grievance of his January 30, 2014 performance evaluation, when he suffered further mistreatment by management. We find that the factual circumstances underlying the appellant's whistleblower complaint were present and known to him when he elected to grieve his performance evaluation. The subsequent events that prompted the appellant's belated conclusion that he had been subjected to whistleblower reprisal do not invalidate his prior election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that, for an election of a grievance process under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) to be valid, the grievance must have been timely filed. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g)(3)(B), (4)(B). Although the agency denied the appellant's grievance in part as untimely, it nevertheless reached the merits of the grievance and denied it on substantive grounds as well. Under these particular circumstances, we find that the agency effectively waived the timeliness issue and that, notwithstanding the grievance's purported untimeliness, the appellant made a valid election. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Alvarez</span>, 898 F. Supp.2d 1057, 1062-63 (N.D. Ill. 2012) (finding that the exhaustion requirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 were met where the jail administration made substantive rulings on the merits of the plaintiff's prison grievance at each stage of review, effectively waiving the deadline); <span class="Italic">Continental Illinois National Bank &#x0026; Trust Co. of Chicago v. United States</span>, 39 F. Supp. 620, 623-24 (Ct. Cl. 1941) (by considering and deciding upon a claim for refund prematurely filed before payment of tax, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue effectively waived any objection which might have been made to its premature filing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reasoning of <span class="Italic">Sherman</span> was accepted in <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-2218.Opinion.3-5-2020_1545467.pdf">806 Fed. Appx. 992</a>, 994-95 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), determining that MSPB properly rejected an appeal as blocked by an earlier grievance, though arguably untimely, was addressed by the agency on the merits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the MLA, Article 36 &#x00A7; 8(A), an employee grievance must be filed within ten work days from the date of the decision notice. Here, the grievance email was sent thirteen working days after Mr. Baldwin's removal decision. But Article 36 &#x00A7; 10 of the MLA also provides that "[t]ime limits at any step of the grievance procedure may be extended by the mutual consent of the parties." And as the Administrative Judge cited in her decision, the Board has held that untimely filed grievances can effect valid elections under &#x00A7; 7121. <span class="Italic">Sherman v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 122 M.S.P.R. 644 &#x00B6; 17 (M.S.P.B. Sept. 11, 2015) (finding a valid election of the grievance process under &#x00A7; 7121(g), despite untimely filing, because the agency "reached the merits of the grievance and denied it on substantive grounds"). In granting the grievance meeting and then issuing a formal grievance response, the agency reached the merits of the grievance and denied it accordingly. The Administrative Judge did not err in finding <span id="Page_3793"></span>that the grievance email was a binding election despite being submitted three days late.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1994 amendments to &#x00A7; 7121(g) do not affect the Board's jurisdictional requirement that IRA appeals are only properly before the Board after OSC has had an opportunity to investigate the claimed reprisal for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Briley v. Nat'l Archives and Records Admin.</span>, 71 MSPR 211, 225 (1996). <span class="Italic">Augustine v. DOJ</span>, 50 MSPR 648 (1991), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and other cases predating the 1994 amendments requiring an election of remedies did not modify the requirement of initial resort to OSC if the Board did not have original jurisdiction over an appealable action. When the appellant filed a grievance concerning a downgrading and reassignment and then appealed to the Board from those actions, a whistleblowing allegation did not preserve Board jurisdiction on the reassignment issue without prior resort to OSC. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anton v. VA</span>, 56 MSPR 244, 247 (1993) (as to the downgrading: "[W]here an employee first elects to grieve an otherwise appealable action, he may nonetheless file an IRA appeal with the Board after he exhausts Special Counsel proceedings." (citing <span class="Italic">Augustine</span>, 50 MSPR 648, 651-53 (1991))); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Geyer v. DOJ</span>, 63 MSPR 13, 16 n.1 (1994) (following resort to OSC: "Despite the adverse arbitral award, the appellant nonetheless is not precluded from filing an IRA appeal from his removal alleging reprisal for whistleblowing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under law predating the 1994 amendments, resort to a negotiated grievance process, rather than initial resort to the Board or OSC, did not bar an IRA claim. <span class="Italic">Augustine v. DOJ</span>, 50 MSPR 648, 653-54 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Laity v. VA</span>, 61 MSPR 256, 260 (1994) (5 USC 7121(a)(1) did not preclude the Board's jurisdiction over an IRA appeal).<span class="Italic"> Moran v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 97-3241), decided the 1994 statutory election requirements to have retroactive effect, in the sense that they were imposed on a case that had its genesis prior to the amendments, in requiring the appellant to stick with a contract grievance he had earlier filed (and withdrew after the effective date of the amendments) and to preclude a subsequent Board appeal. The Federal Circuit was disinclined to characterize the amendments as retroactive. Instead, the court stated that the amendments "simply reduced the number of fora."</p>
