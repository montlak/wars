<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-253"><span class="space">1.</span> Membership Considerations</h4>
<p class="noindent">In the federal sector, the duty of fair representation springs in large part from 5 USC 7114(a)(1):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A labor organization which has been accorded exclusive recognition is the exclusive representative of the employees in the unit it represents and is entitled to act for, and negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering, all employees in the unit. An exclusive representative is responsible for representing the interests of all employees in the unit it represents without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is a breach of the duty of fair representation (DFR) and a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(b)(8) for a union to provide lower quality representation to nonmembers and to suggest to them that their grievances will fare better and stand a better chance for arbitration if the grievant joins the union. <span class="Italic">Tidewater Va. FEMTC, IAM Local 441 and Burns</span>, 8 FLRA 217, 230 (1982) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2437 and VAMC Dallas</span>, 53 FLRA 256, 263-64 (1997) (ALJ Decision) (violation of DFR for union representatives to suggest at orientation of new employees that union members would receive better or quicker assistance than nonmembers); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 and Vasquez</span>, 53 FLRA 1789, 1808 (1998) (ALJ Decision) (union was not to state or imply that failure to pay dues or maintain union membership will be a factor in determining whether arbitration of employee's grievance will proceed). Statements of the union will be reviewed on the basis of an objective standard; it is immaterial that no one complains to the union about the statements. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins AFB</span>, 35 FLRA 720, 724 (1990) (discussing statements in union newspaper suggesting prompt treatment of grievances relating to an overtime compensation case if those grievances were filed by union members). It is a violation for a steward to pressure an employee into joining a union by telling that individual that she will receive no representation unless she joins the union. The union is responsible for the acts of that steward, particularly when the improper statements are brought to the attention of other union officials and nothing is done to promptly remedy the problem. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 and DOD, Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB</span>, 28 FLRA 988, 100-02 (1987) (ALJ Decision). If the union offers representation in exchange for membership and then withdraws the representation when the employees do not become members, it violates the DFR. <span class="Italic">SEIU Local 556 and Paige</span>, 17 FLRA 862, 878-79 (1985) (ALJ Decision). When a union is not requested to represent an employee in a grievance, it cannot, because of the employee's nonmembership in the union, "deny his request for assistance in ascertaining why there had been a delay in management's response to [the] grievance." <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 11 FLRA 377, 378 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">A union violated &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1) by suggesting to employees that if they desired representation they either had to become members or sign an agreement to agree to defray union expenses in the course of representing them as nonmembers, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1778 and Dept. of Air Force, Hq., 438th Air Base Group, McGuire AFB</span>, 10 FLRA 346, 348-49 (1982):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute requires an exclusive representative to represent the interests of all employees in the unit without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership, and a union which fails to do so thereby violates section 7116(b)(8) of the Statute. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Tidewater Virginia Federal Employees Metal Trades Council/International Association of Machinist Local 441</span>, 8 FLRA No. 47 (1982), the Authority adopted the Judge's finding that the union's conduct in avoiding and then providing a bare minimum of help to a nonmember unit employee rather than actively assisting him in initiating a grievance "was done in accord with the well-entrenched policy of the union leadership not to initiate grievances for non-union members," and therefore was inconsistent with section 7114(a)(1) and violative of section 7116(b)(8) of the Statute. In the instant case, by contrast, the Authority concludes that the record fails to demonstrate that the Respondent Union had an established policy of discriminating against nonmember unit employees in the performance of its responsibilities as exclusive representative or that there was in fact disparate treatment of nonmembers by the Respondent in providing representation to bargaining unit employees. Thus, while the Respondent's representatives indicated that they "would like" to have nonmembers who sought union representation sign a Dues Deduction Authorization Form (SF 1187) or promise to defray the costs of representation, there was no evidence presented that nonmembers who refused to sign either document were denied representation on that basis....&#8197;However, in agreement with the Judge, the Authority concludes that the Respondent's conduct set forth above constituted a violation of section 7116(b)(1) of the Statute. Thus, by creating the impression that nonmembers seeking the Union's assistance might be denied representation if they did not agree to become members or to pay the expense of their representation, the Respondent interfered with, restrained, and coerced nonmember employees in the exercise of their protected right under section 7102 of the Statute to join or refrain from joining, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, the Respondent Union or any other labor organization.</p>
<p class="noindent">A union violates the DFR if, in response to an employee's request for grievance assistance or representation, a union official hands the employee a membership application and remarks are made to the employee to the effect that she would receive better representation if she were a member. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Dept. of Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins AFB</span>, 35 FLRA 563, 570-71 (1990) (ALJ Decision). Refusal to provide representation to an employee because the employee exercises his statutory rights and sponsors or assists a rival labor organization to try and unseat the union is a breach of the duty of fair representation. "A dissident unit employee is entitled to the same representation from its exclusive representative as a loyal unit employee." <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2477 and Bryant</span>, 22 FLRA 739, 754 (1986) (ALJ Decision). An isolated remark that tends to link presentation of a case to arbitration with union membership may be coercive and therefore a ULP. If the decision about whether to arbitrate the case is made by the membership or executive board of the union without knowledge of the grievant's membership status and consideration is fairly conducted, there is no ULP in the refusal of the union to pursue the case to arbitration. <span class="Italic">FEMTC and Fall</span>, 12 FLRA 276 (1983) (ALJ Decision). Remarks by a union representative that suggest a tie between union membership and a contract benefit (favorable consideration for a hardship reassignment) may violate the Statute, but the union will not be liable for the denial of the benefit if the union proves that the substantive determination on the benefit was made objectively and without consideration of union membership. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE and Emery</span>, 53 FLRA 1812, 1817-19 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">It was a ULP for a union to post notices stating that it would make attorneys available to union members but not to nonmembers, and for the union to implement that policy "by denying attorney representation to nonmember employees but providing such representation to members who were involved in removal actions." <span class="Italic">NTEU and Customs Serv.</span>, 10 FLRA 519, 520 (1982). That decision was reviewed and affirmed in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 721 F.2d 1402, 1406-07 (D.C. Cir. 1983):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the FLRA concluded that, by implementing a members-only attorney representation policy, NTEU breached its duty under section 7114(a)(1), interfered with employees' rights under section 7102, and thus committed an unfair labor practice in violation of sections 7116(b)(1) and (b)(8). We find that these conclusions are not only reasonable, but are compelled by the plain language of the Statute. Section 7114(a)(1), in particular, requires the Union to represent all <span id="page_1520"></span>bargaining unit employees "without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership" and means exactly what it says. Furthermore, there is absolutely nothing in the legislative history or in any case law construing the Statute to support the Union position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union attempts to defend its conduct by interpreting section 7114(a)(1) to codify the duty of fair representation as it has developed in the private sector, and by interpreting "fair representation" to be synonymous with "adequate representation." The Union first argues that it adequately represents all bargaining unit employees because nonmembers are furnished representation by competent chapter officials or stewards. The Union next asserts that it is not legally required to provide attorney representation for any employee, and that attorney representation for Union members is merely an internal Union benefit that need not be extended to nonmembers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that the duty of fair representation under section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute is identical to the duty of fair representation as it has developed in the private sector, the Union's arguments are patently meritless. The principle underlying the duty of fair representation in the private sector is that "the exclusive agent's statutory authority to represent all members of a designated unit includes a statutory obligation to serve the interests of all members without hostility or <span class="Italic">discrimination</span> toward any, to exercise its discretion with complete good faith and honesty, and to avoid arbitrary conduct." <span class="Italic">Vaca v. Sipes,</span> 386 U.S. 171, 177, 87 S. Ct. 903, 910, 17 L. Ed.2d 842 (1967) (emphasis added). This duty applies whenever a union is representing bargaining unit employees either in contract negotiations or in enforcement of the resulting collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The duty of fair representation does not establish an objective standard of "adequate representation" that the union must meet as a minimum, and that, once met, the union may use as a basis upon which to discriminate between members and nonmembers. Rather, under the duty of fair representation, a union may adopt virtually <span class="Italic">any</span> non-arbitrary standard for providing representation of individual employees, so long as the standard adopted is applied in a nondiscriminatory manner with respect to all unit employees, i.e., members and nonmembers alike.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is axiomatic that a union practice that principally looks to union membership or nonmembership to determine the type of representation that will be provided bargaining unit employees is discriminatory.&#x2003;In the present case, representation by attorneys, who are formally trained and certified in the practice of law, is demonstrably different from representation by chapter officers and stewards. Indeed, by referring to attorney representation as an "extra service," "representation over and above the level of adequacy," a "benefit," and an "incentive to membership," the Union acknowledges that representation by non-attorneys is not equivalent to representation by attorneys.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Union is incorrect in suggesting that the challenged policy merely reflects an internal Union benefit that is not subject to the duty of fair representation. Attorney representation here pertains directly to enforcement of the fruits of collective bargaining. Therefore, as exclusive bargaining agent, the Union may not provide such a benefit exclusively for Union members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA properly relied on the reasoning of the court in <span class="Italic">Del Casal v. Eastern Airlines,</span> 634 F.2d 295 (5th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 454 U.S. 892, 102 S. Ct. 386, 70 L. Ed.2d 206 (1981), in support of the position taken in this case. In <span class="Italic">Del Casal,</span> the Airline Pilots Association ("ALPA") refused to provide a pilot in the bargaining unit with a union staff attorney to represent him at an arbitration hearing because the pilot was not a member of the union. ALPA argued, as does NTEU in the present case, that it is not required by contract or law to furnish attorney representation, and that such representation is an internal union benefit like insurance that it permissibly can extend exclusively to members. The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that "ALPA has the authority to decide under what conditions an attorney will be supplied to a grievant," but stated that "the fact that the grievant is not a member of the union can play no part in that decision." 634 F.2d at 301. Thus, the court held that ALPA violated its duty of fair representation by refusing to provide an attorney to Del Casal solely because he was not a union member.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Treasury Employees Union argues that <span class="Italic">Del Casal</span> is distinguishable from the present case because in <span class="Italic">Del Casal</span> the union provided no representation at all to the employee, while in the present case NTEU allegedly provides competent representation to all employees. NTEU correctly characterizes <span class="Italic">Del Casal</span>, but the distinction drawn between that case and this one reflects a difference without meaning. The critical consideration in <span class="Italic">Del Casal</span> was not the mere <span class="Italic">fact</span> of nonrepresentation; rather, the court focused on the <span class="Italic">reason</span> for the union's refusal to represent the pilot. Indeed, the court in <span class="Italic">Del Casal</span> conceded that "a union may refuse to prosecute a grievance which it considers to be lacking in merit." 634 F.2d at 300. The issue, however, was</p>
<p class="noindent-2">whether a union may refuse to represent a member of the bargaining unit on the ground that he is not a member of the union without violating its duty of fair representation. Thirty-five years ago this court established the principle that a union may not discriminate against members of its bargaining unit on the basis of that person's status as a non-member of the union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The opinion in <span class="Italic">Del Casal</span> goes on to quote the language in <span class="Italic">Vaca v. Sipes,</span> 386 U.S. 171, 190, 87 S. Ct. 903, 916, 17 L. Ed.2d 842 (1967), that "[a] breach of the statutory duty of fair representation occurs only when a union's conduct toward a member of the collective bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith." 634 F.2d at 301. The opinion also re-affirms the proposition that "discrimination against nonmember employees who are part of the bargaining unit is impermissibly arbitrary if no relevant distinctions exist between the union and nonunion employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the rationale for the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Del Casal</span> is not that a union must provide <span class="Italic">adequate</span> representation to all bargaining unit employees, but that a union must provide <span class="Italic">nondiscriminatory</span> representation to all bargaining unit employees, i.e., representation without regard to union membership status. That rationale is equally applicable to and dispositive of the present case.</p>

<p class="noindent">The analytical framework for a DFR case involving mixed-motives, that is, a situation involving the combination of legitimate and unlawful motives for an action arguably constituting a union ULP, is taken from <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 and Vasquez</span>, 53 FLRA 1789, 1793-95 (1998), describing a shifting burden of proof and rebuttal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case involves an allegation that the Respondents violated section 7114(a)(1) by failing to represent the employee without regard to his AFGE membership status, when they canceled his arbitration hearing. The Respondents defended their action on the ground that the action was not based on his lack of AFGE membership, but rather on the ground that the grievant's case had no merit and the grievant would not have been successful at arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge applied the framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> [<span class="Italic">Army Depot</span>, 35 FLRA 113 (1990)], which establishes a "two-step burden shifting framework" for resolving alleged discrimination or retaliation by a respondent against an employee for engaging in union-related protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Midder v. FLRA</span>, No. 96-60371 (5th Cir. 1997), <span class="Italic">affirming Bureau of Engraving</span> <span class="Italic">and Printing, Western Currency Facility, Fort Worth, Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 1014 (1996) <span class="Italic">(Midder)</span>, slip op. at 5. Under the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework, the General Counsel must initially establish that the employee was engaged in protected activity and that the activity was a motivating factor in the treatment of the employee. Thereafter, a respondent may seek to establish an affirmative defense that there was a legitimate justification for its action and that the same actions would have been taken even in the absence of the protected activity<span class="Italic">. See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</span>, 52 FLRA 1390, 1400-01 (1997), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed</span>, No. 97-1414 (D.C. Cir.

<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework is consistent with the framework established in private sector labor law for addressing "dual motive" or "mixed motive" defenses.[4] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp.</span>, 462 U.S. 393, 395 (1983); <span class="Italic">Wright Line</span>, 251 NLRB 1083, 1083-84, 1089 (1980) <span class="Italic">(Wright Line</span>), <span class="Italic">enforced</span>, 662 F.2d 889 (1st Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 455 U.S. 989 (1982). The <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework also is consistent with the framework applied in a Title VII case alleging discriminatory treatment. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office and National Treasury</span> <span class="Italic">Employees Union, Chapter 243</span>, 52 FLRA 358, 362 (1996), citing <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973); <span class="Italic">Byrd v. Dalton</span>, 1994 WL 734781 (EEOC) (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The term "mixed motive" is often used interchangeably with the terms "dual motive" and "legitimate motivation." In a "mixed motive" case, both lawful and unlawful reasons (motives) for the respondent's actions have been established. This differs from a "pretext" case. A "pretext" case involves the finding that the proffered, lawful reason for respondent's actions did not, in fact, motivate the respondent, and that instead, the respondent's acts were motivated by considerations deemed unlawful under applicable law. <span class="Italic">See Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 119-20. In <span class="Italic">Midder</span>, the court stated that the distinction between these types of cases may be somewhat blurred, but because that case dealt only with "mixed motive, the court did not elucidate any distinctions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, slip op. at 6 n.6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has applied the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework in cases involving labor organization respondents. <span class="Italic">See American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, Local 1857</span>, 44 FLRA 959 (1992) (the judge applied the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework to the facts of the case and the Authority <span id="page_1521"></span>adopted the judge's decision to apply <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, without explanation). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1920</span>, 16 FLRA at 474-76 (the Authority applied the predecessor test for resolving dual motive cases, similar to and consistent with <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, that had been set forth in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 6 FLRA 96, 99 (1981) <span class="Italic">(IRS))</span>. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) also applies the same framework to cases against labor organizations that it applies to cases against employers. <span class="Italic">See Ashley</span>, <span class="Italic">Hickham-Uhr Co.</span>, 210 NLRB 32 (1974); 1 <span class="Italic">The Developing</span> <span class="Italic">Labor Law</span> 79-80, (3d ed. 1992). <span class="Italic">See also International</span> <span class="Italic">Longshoremen's Association, Local 20, AFL-CIO</span>, 323 NLRB No. 190 (1997); <span class="Italic">Millwrights Local No. 1102</span>, 322 NLRB 198, 203 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons discussed in <span class="Italic">Wright Line</span> and <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, application of a burden-shifting framework, such as that in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, in cases of alleged union discrimination against employees is warranted. This framework allows consideration of legitimate motives in cases involving alleged union discrimination against employees. In our view, it is appropriate to apply a <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework in this type of case to ensure: (1) fair and equitable treatment of unions and agencies in similar cases; and (2) the ability of a union to raise legitimate motives in its defense, if charged with discriminatory action by an employee. <span class="Italic">Cf. Mt. Healthy City</span> <span class="Italic">School District Board of Education v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274 (1977) (the Court affirmed the NLRB's adoption of a burden-shifting framework for dual motive cases in which the NLRB stated that the test accommodates the legitimate competing interests inherent in dual motivation cases, while at the same time serving to effectuate the purposes and policies of the National Labor Relations Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework, the Judge concluded that the General Counsel did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. The Judge determined that although the grievant exercised "his right to refrain from assisting" the Local Union, the General Counsel did not establish that this activity was a motivating factor in the Respondents' treatment of the grievant. In arriving at this conclusion, the Judge considered the credibility of the witnesses and their testimony....</p>
