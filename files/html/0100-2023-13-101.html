<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-100"><span class="space">c.</span> Disability Accommodation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schultz v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 159, 163 (1998), affirmed that the Rehabilitation Act may create an agency's obligation to extend light duty--an obligation that if disregarded may lead to a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 680, 692 (1996), we held that if an employee who initiated his own absence from work requests to return to work within certain medical restrictions, and if the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to such an employee, the employee's continued absence constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board if the agency fails to offer the employee any available light-duty work. This principle applies by analogy to the present case. As noted above, the appellant's absence after November 7, 1990, was voluntary. He requested to return to work within certain restrictions, and as of February 24, 1992, the agency was bound by statute--specifically, the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791--to accommodate his hand condition and to allow him to return. Accordingly, we hold that the appellant's absence became a constructive suspension on February 24, 1992.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schultz v. USPS</span>,<span class="Italic"> supra</span>, added that a back pay obligation created by improper enforced leave is negated by the appellant's of OWCP benefits for the same period, 78 MSPR at 163-64:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Normally upon finding that an employee was constructively suspended, the Board will order the employee "restored" as of the date the suspension began, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Rivas,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. at 131, but that approach is not appropriate here. The appellant informed the AJ that he has received "both medical benefits and wage replacement compensation" from the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) "for the entire period of absence." The agency then submitted corroborating evidence showing that the appellant received such OWCP benefits covering the period November 6, 1990, through April 29, 1996. The OWCP award covers the entire period of the constructive suspension, i.e., February 24, 1992, the date the agency should have allowed the appellant to return to work, through November 23, 1992, the day before the appellant was retroactively reinstated when the AJ issued his decision on the merits reversing the appellant's removal. The fact that the appellant has received OWCP wage replacement benefits for the entire period of his constructive suspension means that there is no further remedy available under the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-7512. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 31 M.S.P.R. 604, 606 (1986) (receipt of OWCP benefits for a period of enforced leave moots a constructive suspension claim).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The relation expressed in <span class="Italic">Schultz</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, between enforced leave, modified work assignments, and the Rehabilitation Act was reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">Dancy-Butler v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 80 MSPR 421, 425 &#x00B6; 4 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an employee who initiated his own absence requests to return to work within certain medical restrictions, and if the agency is bound by the Rehabilitation Act to accommodate the medical condition and to allow the employee to return, the agency's failure to reasonably accommodate the employee becomes a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Schultz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 159, 161-164 (1998). Such a suspension is appealable to the Board once it extends for more than 14 days. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2), 7513(d). When the agency does not make an express decision to suspend an employee for more than 14 days, the time in which the appellant may file a timely appeal begins to run when the appellant has been absent for more than 14 days. <span class="Italic">Greek v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 470, 474 (1998).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's absence for more than 14 days that results in a loss of pay may be a constructive suspension appealable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2) and 7513(d). <span class="Italic">Mojarro v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 10 (2010); <span class="Italic">Hamiel v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 497, &#x00B6; 4 (2007). The dispositive question in such a case is whether the employee or the agency initiated the absence; if the absence is involuntary, i.e., at the direction of the agency, then the employee has been constructively suspended. <span class="Italic">Mills v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 6 (2007). The appellant bears the burden of proof to show that her absence was involuntary and thus that there is a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Tardio v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A voluntary absence that exceeds 14 days may become a constructive suspension if an employee who is absent due to a medical condition asks to return to work with modified duties and the agency is legally obligated to offer the employee work within her restrictions but fails to do so. <span class="Italic">Tardio</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 24; <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 9 (2009). Such an obligation may arise from an agency policy, a regulation, a collective bargaining agreement, or the reasonable accommodation requirement under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. <span class="Italic">Mojarro</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 10;<span class="Italic"> Mills</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 6. Once an employee who was absent due to a medical condition makes nonfrivolous allegations that she was able to work within certain restrictions, that she communicated her desire to work, and that the agency prevented her from returning to work, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show that there was no work available within the employee's restrictions or that it offered such work to the employee and she declined it. <span class="Italic">Tardio</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 24. If the agency meets its burden, the appellant must present sufficient rebuttal evidence to meet her overall burden of proof. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's contention on petition for review that her absence was a constructive suspension merely because the agency did not permit her to return to work, and that it is irrelevant whether light duty was available, is without merit. An agency's failure to provide work within an employee's physical restrictions, resulting in an absence for more than 14 days, is a constructive suspension only if the agency has an obligation to provide such work and has not fulfilled its obligation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mojarro</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Simpson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6; 15 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the administrative judge correctly held that the agency met its obligation under the collective bargaining agreement to search for a light duty assignment for the appellant. The agreement does not guarantee that such work will be provided, but requires that careful consideration will be given to a request for light duty. Here, there is evidence that the comparative individuals cited by the appellant as receiving light duty assignments did not have her five-pound lifting restriction. Further, there is documentary evidence to support the Acting Plant Manager's testimony that the manual mail volume was greatly diminished.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends on petition for review that she could have done some portion of the work that was assigned to others with greater lifting ability and that this less demanding work therefore should have been first assigned to her. This contention is without merit. The Board has held that "it is axiomatic that an agency must determine what work is necessary and available to accomplish its mission." <span class="Italic">Chen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 292, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). Similarly, we believe that the agency may provide light duty work to individuals with greater flexibility to perform a wider range of duties. The agency is not required, as the appellant would seem to assert, to begin allocation of light duty work with the individuals with the greatest limitations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Availability of Reasonable Accommodation</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged disability discrimination in connection with her claim of constructive suspension. Therefore, it was incumbent on the administrative judge to consider also whether the agency met its obligation, if any, to provide reasonable accommodation to the appellant pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Mojarro</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 10. This inquiry is made for the purpose of determining if there is jurisdiction over the constructive suspension claim, since in such a case an agency's obligation to provide light duty work to an employee requesting it may arise under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Mills</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 6. The administrative judge did not conduct this analysis; however, the record is sufficiently developed for the Board to make this determination on review, and so it is unnecessary to remand the appeal for further proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Slater v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 419, &#x00B6; 12 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the enactment of the recent Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Amendments, a temporary or transitory medical condition did not fall within the definition of a disability. <span class="Italic">See Pinegar v. Federal <span id="Page_2101"></span>Election Commission</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 44 (2007). However, under the ADA Amendments, a condition of short duration may be considered a disability. <span class="Italic">See Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Regulations to Implement the Equal Employment Provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, 76 Fed. Reg. 16999, 17001, codified at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ix). "For example...if an individual has a back impairment that results in a 20-pound lifting restriction that lasts for several months, he is substantially limited in the major life activity of lifting, and therefore covered" by the definition of a person with a disability. <span class="Italic">EEOC Appendix to Part 1630, Interpretative Guidance on Title I of the ADA</span>, 76 Fed. Reg. at 17011. Here, the evidence shows that the appellant was off work for approximately 6 weeks due to her shoulder surgery and then was able to lift only five pounds for the next 5 weeks before she was able to return to full duty. Because she was thus incapacitated for more than 2 months, we will assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant had a substantial limitation in lifting and therefore was a person with a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1). We are satisfied, however, for the reasons discussed above with regard to the agency's obligation to provide light duty under the collective bargaining agreement, that no work was available within the appellant's significant lifting restriction; therefore, she was not denied a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record on appeal showed that in a few cases the agency provided work to individuals who had significant lifting restrictions because they were awaiting a determination from the District Reasonable Accommodation Committee (DRAC). The appellant asserts on petition for review that this factor should not be relevant to determining who receives light duty. However, regardless of whether the agency chose to provide "make work" to individuals awaiting a DRAC determination, the agency is not required to create light duty or another position for a person with a disability as a form of reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez-Acosta v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 13 (2010); <span class="Italic">Collins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6; 13 (2005).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's voluntary absence from work is not an action appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 8 (2009). If, however, an agency bars an employee from duty for more than 14 days, the employee's absence is considered a constructive suspension within the Board's appellate jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.; see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2), 7513(d). The dispositive question in such a case is whether the employee or the agency initiated the absence; if the absence is involuntary, i.e., at the direction of the agency, then the employee has been constructively suspended. <span class="Italic">Mills v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 6 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As relevant here, the Board has recognized that constructive suspension claims may arise when an employee who is absent from work for medical reasons asks to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies the request. <span class="Italic">Reed v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 3 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 198 F. App'x 966 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In this situation, when an employee requests work within his medical restrictions, and the agency is bound by policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available work to the employee, but fails to do so, his continued absence for over 14 days constitutes an appealable constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant appeal, which concerns the termination of the appellant's light duty assignment, falls within this scenario. <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 9. However, the termination of a light duty assignment is not, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, an adverse action appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512; <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 12. Rather, as stated above, an agency's failure to provide work within an employee's physical restrictions, resulting in an absence for more than 14 days, is a constructive suspension only if the agency has an obligation to provide such work and has not fulfilled its obligation. <span class="Italic">See Simpson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6; 15 (2010); <span class="Italic">Mojarro v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 10 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as the administrative judge recognized, the governing collective bargaining agreement does not guarantee that light duty will be provided, but requires that careful consideration be given to a request for light duty. <span class="Italic">See Carmack v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 128, &#x00B6; 10 (2005). The administrative judge correctly held that the agency met its obligation under the collective bargaining agreement to search for a light duty assignment for the appellant, but that no work was available within the employee's restrictions until he returned to work on August 12, 2010, working a light duty assignment for 4 or more hours per shift. Furthermore, the appellant's previous light duty assignment--sorting mail by hand--had significantly decreased due to mechanization. Although the agency referred to a list of vacant positions at the plant, the appellant was unable to apply for any of them because of his medical restrictions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends on review that his absence was involuntary because there was no real choice for him to make between going home or returning to his bid position, which he was not physically able to perform. This contention also lacks merit. Here the appellant was faced with the unpleasant alternatives of returning to work with duties outside his medical restrictions, or requesting leave. The appellant's decision not to return to his regular duties, however unpleasant, was nonetheless voluntary. <span class="Italic">See Moon v. Department of the Army,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. 412, 419-20 (1994). Therefore, the appellant did not suffer an appealable constructive suspension when the agency terminated his temporary light duty assignment due to the absence of productive work within his medical restrictions.[2] <span class="Italic">See Reed,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Moon,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. at 419-20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;On review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge erred in considering the merits of his constructive suspension claim as part of the jurisdictional analysis. The appellant is incorrect. The appellant bears the burden of proof to show that his absence was involuntary and thus that there was a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Mojarro</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Tardio v. Department of Justice</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 23 (2009). In constructive adverse actions, such as this, subject matter jurisdiction and the merits of the appeal are intertwined. <span class="Italic">Heath v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 366, &#x00B6; 6 (2007). Therefore, nonfrivolous allegations do not establish jurisdiction; rather, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that the act was involuntary to establish jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.; see Mojarro,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 11. Having reviewed the record, we find that the administrative judge applied the proper framework and correctly considered the merits of the appellant's constructive suspension appeal in determining whether he proved by preponderant evidence that the Board has jurisdiction over it. We similarly find that it was appropriate for the administrative judge to consider, and discuss, the agency's explanation for the lack of available work within the appellant's medical restrictions, particularly the economic situation facing the agency as well as the increased mechanization of tasks that the appellant had been performing as part of his former light duty assignment, to determine whether the appellant proved that the agency failed to fulfill its obligation to give careful consideration to his light duty request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is also a second period in which the appellant alleged a constructive suspension. As noted above, after the agency terminated the appellant's initial light duty assignment, he submitted to the agency another light duty request with different medical restrictions, the agency approved the request, and he returned to work on August 12, 2010, working a different light duty assignment for 4 or more hours per shift. Thus, the agency not only searched for a light duty assignment based on the appellant's new medical restrictions, it provided him with such an assignment. The appellant nevertheless contends on review, as he did below, that the alleged constructive suspension at issue continues to the present date, because even after he received his new assignment, there was additional work that he could have performed to extend his shift to 8 hours per work day. PFR File, Tab 1 at 7; IAF, Tab 23 at 2 ("Please be advised it is the appellant's contention that the constructive suspension is still in place, as the agency is requiring the appellant to leave work before the end of his shift every day."). During the hearing, the appellant, his supervisor Luther Trawick, Manual Distribution Clerk Valerie Claud, and Modified Clerk Marsha James all testified that there was additional work the appellant could perform to extend his shift to 8 hours per work day. The administrative judge, however, cited Richardson-Lanier's undisputed hearing testimony that the mail processing work identified by these witnesses amounts to "filler" work that is processed throughout the work day as needed, and that Claud and James would be entitled to perform the work at issue because, unlike the appellant, they are entitled to full-time work in their limited duty and bid positions. The initial decision on this point reflects that the administrative judge considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned conclusions. <span class="Italic">See Yang v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 112, &#x00B6; 12 (2010) (mere disagreement with the administrative judge's findings is insufficient to disturb the initial decision); <span class="Italic">see also Broughton v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 357, 359 (1987) (there is no reason to disturb the conclusions of the administrative judge when the initial decision reflects that the administrative judge considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned conclusions). Moreover, the Board has previously rejected claims that the agency is obligated to provide an employee in light duty status with a full 40-hour workweek. <span class="Italic">See Zysk v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 520, &#x00B6; 5 (2008); <span class="Italic">cf. Alves v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 587, &#x00B6; 17 (2004) (failure to provide a postal service employee 8 hours of light duty each day is not an appealable furlough within the Board's jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">see also Chen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 292, &#x00B6; 10 (2010) (stating that "it is axiomatic that an agency must determine what work is necessary and available to accomplish its mission").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the appellant alleged disability discrimination in <span id="Page_2102"></span>connection with his claim of a constructive suspension. It is therefore incumbent on the Board to also consider whether the agency met its obligation, if any, to provide a reasonable accommodation to the appellant pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act to determine if there is jurisdiction over his constructive suspension claim based on any agency obligation to provide him light duty work. <span class="Italic">Mojarro</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Mills</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 6.

Here, the evidence shows that the appellant's medical restrictions on July 2, 2010, placed limits on his ability to lift, carry, push, pull, stoop, squat, twist, walk, stand, bend repeatedly, climb steps or ladders, or operate power equipment. We will assume that the appellant had a substantial limitation in lifting and therefore was a person with a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, prior to assigning the appellant to his current light duty assignment, the agency searched for vacant positions within his medical restrictions and none were available. The only accommodation identified by the appellant for his current medical restrictions is his current light duty assignment, supplemented with other mail processing tasks that the appellant, Trawick, Claud, and James testified that he could perform to extend his shift to 8 hours per work day. It is well established, however, that an agency is not obligated to accommodate a disabled employee by permanently assigning him to light duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position. <span class="Italic">Mengine v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In connection with his constructive suspension claim, the appellant alleged that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate him. Therefore, the Board must consider whether the agency met its obligation, if any, to provide the appellant a reasonable accommodation pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">E.g., Mojarro v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). This inquiry is made for the sole purpose of determining if there is jurisdiction over the constructive suspension claim because a voluntary absence that exceeds 14 days may become a constructive suspension if the employee, who is absent because of a medical condition, asks to return to work with altered duties and the agency is legally obligated to offer the employee work within his medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">E.g., Mills</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 6.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's responsibility to pursue accommodation as an alternative to a nonwork status was noted in <span class="Italic">Scott v. USPS,</span> AT-0752-15-0097-I-1 (NP 6/30/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, while the record indicates that the agency may have informally accommodated the appellant's earlier restrictions, she never requested accommodation of her medical restrictions related to her feet, i.e., restrictions regarding standing and walking. Indeed, the record reflects that the agency previously instructed the appellant to submit updated medical restrictions with any request for light duty work. The appellant, however, refused to request reasonable accommodation and/or light duty for her medical condition, and she did not submit the additional necessary medical documentation, even though the agency repeatedly provided her with the proper forms to submit a request.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant appears to believe that, as a preference-eligible veteran, she is guaranteed a 40-hour work week as long as she does not request light duty, even if she cannot perform the full duties of her position. However, the appellant has cited no statutory or regulatory authority, and we have found none, which supports her claim that she will forfeit her 10-point veterans' preference "right" to be accommodated without requesting light duty if she submits a light duty request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's actions in requiring the appellant to either perform in her assigned duty or request light duty was not an improper action. In <span class="Italic">Bean,</span> the Board overruled <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 679 (2009), which found that the appellant's placement on leave was voluntary where the options presented were either taking leave or working outside of the medical restrictions. The Board found that the basic premise of an employee working outside of a medical restriction is not a viable option for federal employees. <span class="Italic">Bean,</span> 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 13. In this case, the appellant has medical restrictions which severely limit her ability to walk and stand and she has not shown that the agency's action in attempting to provide her with the proper avenue to ensure that she is not working outside of her medical restrictions is an improper action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the agency provided the appellant with a reasonable option of complying with agency policy and requesting light duty so as to receive accommodations for her medical restrictions. While the appellant may not like the choices presented her, she was given a meaningful choice between three options, and she refused to comply with either of the first two options and instead chose to go home. Thus, because the appellant voluntarily chose to absent herself from the workplace, she has not established a constructive adverse action. Accordingly, this appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The material facts in this case are largely undisputed. The preference eligible appellant started working as a Laborer Custodian at the agency's Houston Processing and Distribution Center in Texas on September 12, 1998. The appellant fractured his hip in 1989 and reinjured his hip in 2000. On June 13, 2001, the appellant provided the agency with a medical certificate form, completed by his doctor, which indicated that the appellant had a "PERMANENT" medical condition of "Right acetabulum fracture, Post traumatic arthritis Right hip." The medical certificate also indicated that the appellant had no limitations regarding the activities related to the performance of his duties but that "[t]he patient may be required intermittent resting of Right hip while performing his regular duties."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that, after submitting the June 2001 medical certificate to his supervisor at that time, the supervisor allowed him to sit from time to time; however, after his supervisor left in 2002, the agency began to harass him about his need to sit down to rest his hip. The record reflects that the appellant submitted Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) medical provider certifications regarding his hip condition to the agency in December 2008, February 2009, and February 2010. The agency did not respond to those submissions by requiring the appellant to remove the reasonable accommodation request to intermittently sit and rest his hip, provide a more detailed explanation of the accommodation that he needed to rest his hip, or submit a written request for light duty. Further, the agency acknowledged that, although it sent the appellant a March 9, 2011 letter informing him that he was required to submit a written <span id="Page_2103"></span>request for "light duty," the appellant nonetheless "continued to report for duty and work 8 hours/day through March 23, 2011."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that, because of the agency's harassment when he would sit to rest his hip, he requested FMLA leave to deal with his hip pain on March 24-25, 2011. While the appellant was on leave, the agency sent him a March 24, 2011 letter indicating that the agency had received an FMLA Form 380 from his physician on March 4, 2011, stating that the appellant was restricted to walking/standing for 15 minutes per hour. The letter informed the appellant that the "Houston District Policy on light duty states that all requests for light duty must be in writing." Acting Maintenance Supervisor Louis Thomas and the appellant testified that, when the appellant reported for work on March 26, 2011, he submitted the same medical documentation that he had submitted in the past and that Thomas informed him that he would not be permitted to work again until he either submitted new medical documentation without the restriction that he be able to rest his hip or submitted a written request for light duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant reasserts on review that the agency constructively suspended him from March 26, 2011, through August 19, 2011, because his initially voluntary absence for medical reasons on March 24-25, 2011, became involuntary when he reported for work on March 26, 2011, and the agency refused to continue to afford him a reasonable accommodation for his disabling hip condition. The appellant contends that the agency instead told him that he would not be permitted to return to work unless he either provided updated medical evidence that removed the condition that he be permitted to intermittently rest his hip while performing the duties of his regular position or submitted a request for light duty. The appellant asserts that the agency's refusal to allow him to return to work with his existing reasonable accommodation constituted disability discrimination and, thus, a constructive suspension. Therefore, he asserts that the administrative judge erred in dismissing this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's involuntary absence for more than 14 days that results in a loss of pay or forces an employee to take leave that he did not intend to use is a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2) and 7513(d). <span class="Italic">Zygas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 16 (2011); <span class="Italic">Minnis v. Veterans Administration</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 460, 462 (1989). Constructive suspension claims arise in two situations. The first occurs when an agency places an employee on enforced leave pending an inquiry into his ability to perform. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6; 5 (2000). In that situation, the key question is whether the agency or the appellant initiated the absence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Second, if an employee who initiated his own absence requests to return to work within certain medical restrictions, and if the agency is obligated to offer available light-duty work or is bound by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to accommodate the medical condition and to allow the employee to return, the agency's failure to offer available light-duty work or reasonably accommodate the employee becomes a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">McFadden v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 18, &#x00B6; 16 (1999). We find that the appellant has proven a constructive suspension under both of the above situations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The undisputed facts in this appeal demonstrate that the agency barred the appellant from returning to his position pending his submission of new medical documentation or a request for light duty. First, we note that an employee absent on FMLA leave has a right to return to the same position he held when leave commenced. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.214. While an employer may require a medical certification from such an individual upon return to duty, it must first provide the employee with a list of the essential functions of the job and must request that the certification address the employee's ability to perform those functions. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.312(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, contrary to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.214, the agency did not reinstate the appellant to the position that he held prior to his taking FMLA leave. Nor did it properly request a return to duty certification. In this regard, if an employee's medical provider certifies that the employee can perform the essential functions of the position in a return to duty certification, which happened here, the employer may seek clarification from the provider, but, under the FMLA, the employer may not delay the employee's return to duty while this clarification is sought. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.312(b). By demanding additional medical information from the appellant's physician before allowing him to return to duty, the agency improperly delayed his return to duty under FMLA-mandated procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the agency improperly demanded that the appellant request a light duty assignment before allowing him to return to duty. The agency's Employee and Labor Relations Manual indicates that light duty is for an employee who cannot perform the essential functions of his position. The appellant has shown that he can perform the essential functions of his position with a reasonable accommodation. The agency, therefore, inappropriately demanded that he request light duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find that the agency initiated the appellant's absence pending further inquiry into his ability to perform and, therefore, constructively suspended him under the first scenario noted above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we find that the record supports finding that the agency constructively suspended the appellant under the second scenario. In <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 159, 163 (1998), the Board held that an agency's obligation to return to duty within his medical restrictions an employee who was previously voluntarily absent for medical reasons includes the duty to provide reasonable accommodation in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and that an agency's failure to do so constitutes a constructive suspension.[2] Here, it is undisputed that the appellant was able to fully perform the essential functions of his position from June 13, 2001, until March 26, 2011--almost 10 years--with the reasonable accommodation of allowing him to intermittently rest his hip, when the agency refused to allow him to return to work unless the reasonable accommodation was removed or he submitted a written request for light duty. HCD, testimony of the appellant. The appellant testified that he would sometimes need to sit down for 2-3 minutes to rest his hip. HCD, testimony of the appellant. When the appellant returned to work on March 26, 2011, and submitted the same medical documentation he had submitted in the past, indicating that he could perform his full duties provided he intermittently sit and rest his hip, he was again requesting to return to the full duties of his position with medical restrictions, regardless of the agency's previous work arrangements. We find that a preponderance of the evidence in this case establishes that the agency failed to continue to provide him with a reasonable accommodation for his hip condition, that his absence became a constructive suspension from March 26, 2011, through August 19, 2011, and that the Board therefore has jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Board held in <span class="Italic">Moon v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 412, 419-20 (1994), that, because an employee's absence was voluntary, it lacked jurisdiction over the constructive suspension appeal and also lacked jurisdiction over the appellant's allegation of disability discrimination raised in connection with such an appeal. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Moon</span> is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Schultz</span>, this holding in <span class="Italic">Moon</span> is overruled. <span class="Italic">See McFadden</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 18, &#x00B6; 16 (if an employee who initiated her own absence requests to return to work within certain medical restrictions, and if the agency is bound by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to accommodate the medical condition and to allow the employee to return, the agency's failure to reasonably accommodate the employee becomes a constructive suspension).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having found, for the reasons set forth above, that the agency constructively suspended the appellant and that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal, we further find that the constructive suspension must be reversed because the agency effected it without affording the appellant minimum due process. <span class="Italic">See Lohf v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 81, 86 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the appellant's claim of disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pledger v. Department of the Navy</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 325, 330-31 (1991) (reversing the appellant's constructive suspension because the agency effected it without affording him minimum due process and then addressing his disability discrimination claim). As explained below, preponderant evidence establishes that, during the period of the appellant's constructive suspension, the agency unjustifiably withdrew a reasonable accommodation for the appellant's disabling hip condition and that the agency therefore committed disability discrimination in violation of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ADAAA prohibits discrimination "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a). The ADAAA defines "qualified individual," in part, to mean "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8). The ADAAA defines "disability" to mean: "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (3))." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1)(A)-(C). "Major Life Activities" include, but are not limited to, "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC's ADAAA regulations provide that the term "'substantially limits' shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADAAA. 'Substantially limits' is not meant to be a demanding standard." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(i). "An impairment is a disability within the meaning of this section if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major <span id="Page_2104"></span>life activity as compared to most people in the general population. An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of this section." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). "The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Accordingly, the threshold issue of whether an impairment 'substantially limits' a major life activity should not demand extensive analysis." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). "The comparison of an individual's performance of a major life activity to the performance of the same major life activity by most people in the general population usually will not require scientific, medical, or statistical analysis. Nothing in this paragraph is intended, however, to prohibit the presentation of scientific, medical, or statistical evidence to make such a comparison where appropriate." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(v). "An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active." 42 U.S.C. 12102(4)(D). The term "reasonable accommodation" includes job restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; reassignment to a vacant position; acquisition or modification of equipment or devices; appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials, or policies; the provision of qualified readers or interpreters; and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(9)(B); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(2)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's testimony and medical evidence establish that he was a qualified individual with a permanent right hip disability that substantially limited his ability to stand and walk and that he had requested a reasonable accommodation for his disability that would allow him to fully perform the essential functions of his Laborer Custodian position. <span class="Italic">[S]ee</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12102(1)(A)-(C), (2)(A), (4)(C), 12111(8), (9)(B); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(i)-(vii), (o)(1)(i)-(ii), (o)(2)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By refusing to allow the appellant to return to work on March 26, 2011, with the same reasonable accommodation he had for approximately 10 years, the agency committed disability discrimination by failing to continue to provide a reasonable accommodation to a qualified individual with a disability in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a), (b)(5)(A). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Durden v. Department of the Navy</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 373, 374-76 (1983), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Price v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 107, 110 (1991); <span class="Italic">see also Edwards v. Department of Transportation</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 82, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-15 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject the agency's assertion and the administrative judge's finding that the agency refused to allow the appellant to return to work because his physician's April 1, 2011-indicated reasonable accommodation--that appellant be allowed to rest his hip due to pain--was "immeasurable and that in order for a restriction to be valid, it must contain measurable instructions so management can determine if an employee can work. <span class="Italic">See Zygas</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the agency had already refused to allow the appellant to return to work on March 26, 2011, several days prior to the allegedly vague April 1, 2011 physician's note. Moreover, preponderant evidence established that the agency repeatedly instructed the appellant that, in order to return to work, he "must" submit a written request for "light duty" or, alternatively, submit new medical documentation that removed the reasonable accommodation request that he be allowed to rest his hip. These instructions did not indicate that the appellant needed to provide measurable instructions to obtain a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Campbell testified that management provided her with the April 1, 2011 note from the appellant's physician for the purpose of determining if it qualified as a "full release" to duty and that she informed management that it was not a full release to duty because of the condition following the word "but" in the note. Campbell's testimony demonstrated that, because the note was not a full release to duty, her assessment that the "restriction" in the physician's note was "immeasurable" and that a restriction must contain measurable instructions so that management can determine if an employee can work, was an assessment as to the sufficiency of a "restriction" under the Houston District Policy on light duty, not an assessment of a request for a reasonable accommodation. Indeed, Campbell's testimony clearly established that the agency had not provided Campbell with information regarding the appellant's medical history and that Campbell's entire focus was on the Houston District Policy on "light duty." Moreover, the April 1, 2011 physician's note contained no more detail than did the original June 13, 2001 physician-provided medical document indicating the need for the reasonable accommodation of allowing the appellant to rest his hip while fully performing his regular duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, Campbell's testimony also established that, after reviewing the April 1, 2011 physician's note, she spoke to the appellant, and, after discussing his need to rest after working approximately 3 hours and that his normal schedule only required him to work for 2 hours before he would have a 15 to 30 minute break, she determined that he would be able to do his job and accommodate his need to rest his hip within his normal work schedule. Thus, the appellant provided any needed clarification of his ability to fully perform the essential functions of his position with his requested reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency's assertion regarding the vagueness of the April 1, 2011 physician's note is unavailing because the agency received on March 31, 2011, an FMLA Form 380, completed by the appellant's physician on March 30, 2011, in which the physician indicated in response to question 4: "Patient is able to perform full duties, but must be able to rest right hip during the day due to pain"; and in response to question 3: "Patient must be able to sit down when needed periodically throughout the day due to hip pain. Thus, we find that the agency had adequate information regarding the appellant's reasonable accommodation even before the physician's April 1, 2011 note.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above, we find that the appellant proved that his initially voluntary absence on March 24-25, 2011, became involuntary for the period from March 26, 2011, through August 19, 2011, that the agency constructively suspended him for more than 14 days without affording him due process, and that the agency discriminated against him based on his disability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Interweaving the light duty requirements of the ADA with agency policies or negotiated agreements, <span class="Italic">McFadden v. DOD</span>, 85 MSPR 18, 25 &#x00B6; 20 (1999), stated that an employee need not be accommodated by permanently assigning her to light duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency would be bound by the Rehabilitation Act to accommodate the appellant's medical condition only if she showed that she was a qualified disabled employee under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(6). 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(c). A qualified disabled employee is, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a disabled employee who, with or without accommodation, can perform the essential functions of her position, without endangering the health and safety of herself or others. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(6); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Fox v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 81 MSPR 522 &#x00B6; 8 (1999). An agency is not obligated to accommodate a disabled employee by permanently assigning her to light-duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mengine v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 MSPR 123, 8 (1999); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 77 MSPR 486, 492 (1998). Thus, because with or without accommodation she could not perform the essential functions of her position, the appellant has not shown that the agency was bound by the Rehabilitation Act to accommodate her medical condition.</p>
