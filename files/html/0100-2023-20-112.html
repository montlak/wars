<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-108"><span class="space">p.</span> Experts and Consultants; Personnel Appointed Outside Title 5</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Statutory authority is provided to some agencies to appoint special experts or consultants--generally employees with specialized scientific or other skills and are generally paid at rates higher than the General Schedule pay scale. NIH is one employer of experts and consultants, appointed without regard to the competitive requirements of Title 5. The issue arose in <span class="Italic">Fishbein v. DHHS</span>, 102 MSPR 4, 6-14 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-18, 2006 MSPB 96 (2006), whether individuals appointed outside the Title 5 process were covered by whistleblower protections written into Title 5. The Board answered in the affirmative and explained the their coverage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On or about July 13, 2003, the appellant entered on duty as Associate Director, Office for Policy in Clinical Research Operations, Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services. Initial He received an indefinite appointment under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f), subject to the completion of a two-year trial period. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Section 209(f) states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with regulations, special consultants may be employed to assist and advise in the operations of the [Public Health] Service. Such consultants may be appointed without regard to the civil-service laws.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f). By memorandum dated April 7, 2004, the Director of the Division of AIDS informed the appellant that he would be terminated effective May 29, 2004, for unsatisfactory performance. The agency has apparently delayed implementation of the termination pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant subsequently filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), claiming that he was terminated in reprisal for whistleblowing. After OSC notified him that it had terminated its investigation, he filed this individual right of action (IRA) appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge advised the appellant that the Board might not have jurisdiction over his IRA appeal because special consultants under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) are appointed "without regard to the civil-service laws" and he did not appear to be an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105 entitled to file an IRA appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221. The administrative judge ordered the appellant to file evidence and argument to prove that he is an individual entitled to file an IRA appeal with the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation.<span class="Italic"> Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Because the WPA is remedial legislation, the Board will construe its provisions liberally to embrace all cases fairly within its scope, so as to effectuate the purpose of the Act. <span class="Italic">Glover v. Department of the Army</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 534, &#x00B6; 8 (2003); <span class="Italic">see</span> Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 &#x00A7; 2, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1201 note (stating that the purpose of the WPA "is to strengthen and improve protection for the rights of Federal employees, to prevent reprisals, and to help eliminate wrongdoing within the Government")....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) does not preclude the appellant4s IRA appeal</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The exemption from the application of the civil-service laws under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) specifically applies to the "appoint[ment]" of special consultants. Section 409(f) clearly distinguishes between "employ[ment]" and "appoint[ment]." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) ("[S]pecial consultants may be <span class="Italic">employed</span> to assist and advise in [the Public Health Service's] operations.... Such consultants may be <span class="Italic">appointed</span> without regard to the civil-service laws.") (emphasis added). Thus, we find that section 209(f) does not bring every aspect of special consultants' employment outside the coverage of title 5.[3] Rather, we agree with the parties that this statute appears intended to provide the agency with flexible hiring authority to meet its specialized needs free from the appointing procedures and requirements of title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 78-1364 (1944), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1944 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1211, 1218 (stating that the exemption in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) was enacted "merely [to] confirm[] the present situation" with regard to the "exemption from the civil service and classification laws"); <span class="Italic">In re Masse</span>, 2001 WL 1478431 (G.S.B.C.A.

In this regard, we note that the agency's regulation concerning the appointment of special consultants refers to the use of this hiring authority "[w]hen the Public Health Service requires the services of consultants who cannot be obtained when needed through regular Civil Service appointment or under the compensation provisions of the Classification Act of 1949." 42 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 22.3(a).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in section 209(f) expressly exempts appointees under that section from coverage under the WPA. Consistent with the liberal construction that the Board employs when deciding questions of WPA coverage, we do not construe the provision of section 209(f) providing that "consultants may be <span class="Italic">appointed</span> without regard to the civil-service laws" as implicitly precluding a section 209(f) appointee, such as the appellant, from bringing an IRA appeal based on his termination from employment if he otherwise meets the statutory requirements for doing so. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Glover</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 534, &#x00B6; 8.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) (emphasis added). The administrative judge found that, because the appellant was appointed under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) "without regard to the civil-service laws," he was not "appointed in the civil service" and thus was not an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a). We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "civil service," as that term is used in title 5, "consists of all appointive positions in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of the Government of the United States, except positions in the uniformed services." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101(1). The appellant appears to meet this broad definition as an appointee in the executive branch. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The federal civil service is broadly divided into three main classifications: (1) the "Senior Executive Service" generally consisting of employees occupying high-level positions in an executive agency, but for whom appointment by the President and confirmation by the Senate is not required; (2) the "competitive service" generally consisting of all other employees for whom nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate is not required, and who are not specifically excepted from the competitive service by statute or by statutorily authorized regulation; and (3) the "excepted service" consisting of the remaining civil service employees who are in neither the competitive service nor the Senior Executive Service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2101a, 2102, 2103, 3132(a)(2); <span class="Italic">Hamlett v.

We find that, for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(B), the appellant's appointment under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) would place him in the excepted service.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2103(a); <span class="Italic">see also Dodd v.

Thus, the appellant may have been "appointed in the civil service" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a)(1), notwithstanding his appointment under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we cannot determine based on the existing record whether the appellant meets all parts of the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a). To be an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105, an individual must have been (1) appointed in the civil service by a named federal official acting in his official capacity, (2) engaged in the performance of a federal function under authority of law or executive act, and (3) under the supervision of a named federal official while engaged in the performance of the duties of his position. <span class="Italic">Simmons</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 380, &#x00B6; 6. Although the parties agree that the appellant was appointed under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) and claim he is an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105, there is no further information in the record regarding the appellant's appointment. In particular, the parties have not specifically alleged, and there is no record evidence establishing, that the appellant was appointed by or subject to the supervision of an individual named under section 2105(a)(1) and was engaged in the performance of a federal function under authority of law or executive act. Thus, on remand, the administrative judge shall, after affording the parties the opportunity to submit evidence and argument on this issue, determine whether the appellant meets the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming that the appellant has been properly appointed to his excepted service position, we agree with the parties that the appellant is in a "covered position" under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A) &#x0026; (B). A "covered position" is:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">any position in the competitive service, a career appointee position in the Senior Executive Service, or a position in the excepted service, but does not include any position which is, prior to the personnel action--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;excluded from the coverage of this section by the President based on a determination by the President that it is necessary and warranted by conditions of good administration....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(B). The parties have not argued, and we do not find any indication in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) and its legislative history, that Congress excepted the appellant's position from the competitive service because of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. <span class="Italic">See O'Brien v. Office of Independent Counsel</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 192, 203-04 (1997). Rather, as discussed above, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) appears intended to provide the agency with flexible hiring authority. Further, the parties have not identified and we are not aware of any act of the President excluding the appellant's position from coverage of the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(B)(ii). Thus, the appellant's position appears to be a "covered position" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(B).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's other claims.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge properly determined that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's claims that his termination violated the agency's Performance Manual, was based on sex and age discrimination, and was effected in retaliation for his prior EEO activities. The plain language of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) provides that the appellant's position is not subject to the appointing provisions of title 5. Thus, he lacks the right to bring an adverse action appeal concerning the termination of his appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12) (adverse action appeal rights are not afforded to an employee whose "position has been excluded from the appointing provisions of title 5, United States Code, by separate authority in the absence of any provision to place the employee within the coverage of chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code"); <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 590, 593-94 (1994) (the Board lacked jurisdiction over removal appeal where the appellant's position had been excluded from the appointing provisions of title 5 by separate statutory authority in the absence of any provision placing the appellant within the coverage of 5 U.S.C. ch. 75); <span class="Italic">Cummings v. General Services Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 47, 48-49 (1981) (the Board lacked jurisdiction over appeal challenging the alleged abolishment of the appellant's position under a reduction-in-force and alleging race discrimination, as the appellant was appointed "without regard to the civil-service laws").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3845"></span>Further, IRA appeals under the WPA are not subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 or &#x00A7; 7702. Thus, the Board lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the personnel action at issue in an IRA appeal and lacks the authority to decide, in conjunction with an IRA appeal, the merits of an appellant's allegation of prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Marren v.

DHHS</span>, 116 MSPR 383, 388-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13, 16, 2011 MSPB 54 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that the "without regard to the civil-service laws" language in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(g) does not affect his right to file an IRA appeal over the agency's decision, whether it is characterized as a decision to not appoint him to a second term, to not re-appoint him, to not renew or extend his appointment, or to let his appointment expire. In <span class="Italic">Young v. Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 99, &#x00B6; 8 (2002), the Board considered 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 172(b), which similarly provided that the agency "may, without regard to the provisions of the civil service laws, appoint such conciliators and mediators as may be necessary to carry out the functions of [the agency]." There, the Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Office of Personnel Management has written that when an agency is authorized to make appointments without regard to the civil service laws, the agency is thereby empowered to make such appointments "without regard to the usual competitive or civil service laws, <span class="Italic">including veterans' preference.</span>" 58 Fed. Reg. 13,191, 13,192 (Mar. 10, 1993) (explaining regulations implementing the Civil Service Due Process Amendments) (emphasis added). This statement is a common-sense gloss on statutory language permitting appointment without regard to civil service laws, and we follow it here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 8. Further, in <span class="Italic">Dodd v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 770 F.2d 1038, 1040 (Fed.

Thus, the Board and the court have interpreted this phrase, consistent with the appellant's arguments reiterated in his petition for review, PFR at 9-14, to refer to matters concerning the method by which an applicant's qualifications for appointment to a position should be determined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, we find that the appellant would not be precluded from bringing an IRA appeal even if the "without regard to the civil-service laws" language in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(g) and <span class="Italic">Fishbein</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 4, are interpreted to preserve such a right only for "personnel actions" occurring before the stated expiration of a temporary or term appointment....</p>
