<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tyler v. Dept. of Army,</span> DC-0752-10-0401-I-1 (NP 1/5/2011), rejected a defense of alcoholism to misconduct related to conduct leading to the appellant's removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the conduct unbecoming charge, the record shows that the appellant admitted to driving while intoxicated, and such behavior is unbecoming a federal police officer....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that he is an alcoholic and states that he has a disease--an argument he also made in his appeal. Both below and on review, the appellant's assertions are vague and he does not request an accommodation other than to be returned to duty. In any event, even if the appellant was attempting to claim that he has a disability and raise an affirmative defense, an agency may hold an employee who engages in the illegal use of drugs or who is an alcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior that such entity holds other employees, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the drug use or alcoholism of such employee. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12114(c)(4); <span class="Italic">Humphrey v. Department of Army</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 519, 525 (1997); <span class="Italic">Kimble v. Department of Navy</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 617, 621 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See SSA v. Boini</span> CB-7521-13-0192-T-1 (NP 2/22/2016) (alcoholism: "an agency is never required to excuse a disabled employee's violation of a uniformly-applied, job-related rule of conduct, even if the employee's disability caused the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 4 (2000)"); <span class="Italic">Wyrick v. Dept. of Transp</span>., SF-0752-12-0524-I-3 (NP 5/21/2014) ("In any event, even if the appellant suffered from alcoholism at the time of his misconduct, an agency is never required to excuse a disabled employee's violation of a uniformly-applied, job-related rule of conduct, even if the employee's disability caused the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 4 (2000).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilber v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 42 MSPR 582, 586-89 (1989), considered disqualifying involvement of a criminal investigator in an accident involving a government car he drove while intoxicated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board recently reconsidered some of its prior decisions with regard to the affirmative defense of discrimination on the basis of the handicapping conditions of alcoholism and drug abuse<span class="Italic">. See e.g. McCaffrey v. United States Postal Service,</span> 36 MSPR 224 (1988); <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 37 MSPR 682 (1988); <span class="Italic">Hougens v. United States Postal Service,</span> 38 MSPR 135 (1988). These cases have modified and, in some instances, reversed prior Board decisions dealing with issues concerning the affirmative defense of discrimination on the basis of the handicapping condition of alcoholism and drug abuse. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hougens,</span> 38 MSPR at 144 n.10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As found by the administrative judge, the appellant has met his burdens of establishing that he suffers from the handicapping condition of alcoholism and that his alcoholism caused the fatal accident. However, the administrative judge issued his initial decision in this appeal before the Board issued <span class="Italic">Hougens.</span> Contrary to the appellant's assertions in his petition for review, the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> is precedent applicable to this appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fairall v. Veterans Administration,</span> 33 MSPR 33, 39 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> is distinguishable on its facts because the agency in this case was equally responsible for the appellant's conduct. He bases this claim on the assertion that, for the last 10 years, agency officials were on notice that the appellant had a serious drinking and driving problem, and they failed to refer the appellant for counseling or offer him reasonable accommodation. We disagree that <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> is inapplicable here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the agency officials were aware that the appellant was an alcoholic prior to the fatal accident, we find that <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> applies whenever an appellant raises the affirmative defense of handicap discrimination because of alcoholism or drug abuse. 29 CFR, &#x00A7; 1613.704(a) requires an agency to accommodate "the known physical or mental limitations of a <span class="Italic">qualified handicapped applicant or employee</span>...." (Emphasis supplied.) Thus, the Board has held that no duty to accommodate arises if the agency did not know or have reason to know of an employee's handicap. <span class="Italic">See Brink v.</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration,</span> 4 MSPB 419, 4 MSPR 358, 363 (1980). However, it is clear from the language of the regulation that the question of an agency's knowledge of an employee's handicap is a separate question from whether or not the employee is a qualified handicapped individual.[*] Thus, an employee may not bootstrap his proof regarding the first requirement--the agency's knowledge of his handicapping condition--to establish the second requirement--that he is a qualified handicapped individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;The appellant's reliance on <span class="Italic">Ferguson v. U.S. Department of Commerce</span>, 680 F. Supp. 1514 (M.D. Fla. 1988), to establish that the agency has "unclean hands" is misplaced. The court has vacated and withdrawn the memorandum opinion which the appellant cites. <span class="Italic">Ferguson v. U.S. Department of Commerce</span>, 694 F. Supp. 1541, 1542 (M.D. Fla. 1988). Accordingly, the district court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Ferguson</span> is not viable precedent. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1B J. Moore, J. Lucas, &#x0026; T. Currier, Moore's Federal Practice, para. 0.402[2] n.3 (2d ed. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We note that, even if <span class="Italic">Ferguson</span> were reliable precedent, the court did not explicitly consider whether the appellant's conduct was so egregious under the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Richardson v. United States Postal Service,</span> 613 F. Supp. 1213, 1216 (D.D.C. 1985), that the appellant was disqualified from the federal service. In <span class="Italic">Hougens,</span> 38 MSPR at 142-43, we adopted and applied the <span class="Italic">Richardson</span> standard. In this regard, we note that the appellant's misconduct in <span class="Italic">Ferguson</span> was excessive absenteeism, rather than the type of egregious misconduct, discussed <span class="Italic">infra</span>, that is at issue in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, the appellant has not established that the agency bears responsibility for his conduct on the night of August 26, 1987. The appellant did not exhibit erratic work performance, but, on the contrary, his work performance was highly regarded by his supervisor. We note that the appellant's most recent previous accident involving a government vehicle occurred in 1980 and that the agency investigated his conduct with regard to drinking and driving in 1981 and found no basis for discipline. We find that these incidents are too remote in time to create any agency responsibility for the appellant's fatal accident in 1987.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that his supervisor's conduct on the night of August 26, 1987, does not render <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> inapplicable to the appellant's case. Both the appellant and his supervisor were off duty when they were drinking together that evening. His supervisor did offer to drive the appellant home, an offer the appellant declined. We find that the supervisor's off-duty conduct of drinking with the appellant does not establish agency knowledge of, or culpability for, the appellant's subsequent actions. As we stated previously, the question of an agency's knowledge of an employee's handicapping condition is a separate issue from the question of whether that employee is a qualified handicapped individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hougens,</span> the Board held that there are certain acts of misconduct which, when committed by an employee who is an alcoholic or drug addict, take that employee outside the scope of the protecting legislation because the misconduct renders that person not a "qualified" handicapped individual. <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>, 38 MSPR at 142; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also Alex v. United States Postal Service,</span> 38 MSPR 605, 610 (1988). The Board further identified the type of misconduct that would disqualify an employee as serious misconduct "which, by its very nature, strikes at the core of the job or the agency's mission, or is so egregious or notorious that an employee's ability to perform his duties or to represent the agency is hampered." <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>, 38 MSPR at 144. [Footnote omitted.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's misconduct in this case, which resulted in the death of a 2-year old child, is disqualifying, egregious misconduct as discussed in <span class="Italic">Hougens.</span> The agency is responsible for enforcing and administering firearms, arson, and explosives laws, in addition to laws governing the production, use, and distribution of alcohol and tobacco products. Its special agents engage in independent travel and undercover work and work in cooperation with agents of other federal <span id="Page_3549"></span>and international law enforcement authorities. The special agents carry guns and badges, drive government vehicles, and have arrest authority. Therefore, by its very nature, the appellant's misconduct struck at the core of the agency's mission and his duties as a law enforcement officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the agency has demonstrated that the appellant's misconduct was extremely notorious in the community, as shown by the extensive adverse publicity generated in the local media. There is also evidence that Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) has taken an interest in this case, indicating the possibility that the adverse publicity extends beyond the local area. The newspaper articles and letters-to-the-editor contained in the record identified the appellant by name and frequently identified him as an agent of ATF. The community reaction, as indicated by the articles and letters, was consistently hostile to the appellant. Thus, the agency has established, by preponderant evidence, that the appellant's misconduct precipitated a public outcry and therefore hampered his ability to represent the agency and perform his duties. <span class="Italic">See Hougens</span>, 38 MSPR at 144. Consistent with our decision in <span class="Italic">Hougens,</span> we find that the appellant's misconduct here is egregious and disqualifies him from federal service, Accordingly, we find that the appellant is not a qualified handicapped individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency is required to provide reasonable accommodation for a qualified handicapped individual. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704(a); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 36 MSPR 162, 167 (1988) (to meet the burden of proof in a handicap discrimination case, an appellant must establish that he is a qualified handicapped individual). Since the appellant is not a qualified handicapped individual, in this case it is not necessary for the agency to prove that it would be an undue hardship to provide accommodation for his handicap. Accordingly, there is no merit to the appellant's contention that the agency failed to meet its burden of proof concerning undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Scofield v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 179, 186-88 (1992), a GS-12 BATF Special Agent, was removed on a charge that he physically assaulted his girlfriend during an altercation at her apartment. The appellant pleaded no contest to a battery charge. He was fined and sentenced to three years of probation with conditions. The Board concluded that the agency had no duty to accommodate the appellant's alcoholism because his conduct "strikes at the core" of both the appellant's position and the agency's mission of law enforcement. The misconduct was "inconsistent with the fundamental expectation that a law enforcement officer may be relied on to exercise his authority in a responsible manner." It made no difference that the agency suspended action on the charges until the appellant entered into and completed an in-patient rehabilitation program for alcoholism:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's conduct on October 21, 1988, strikes at the core of both the appellant's position and the agency's mission of law enforcement. The agency is responsible for enforcing and administering the firearms, arson, and explosives laws, in addition to laws governing the production, use, and distribution of alcohol and tobacco products. Its Special Agents engage in independent travel and undercover work, and they work in cooperation with agents of other Federal and international law enforcement authorities. The Special Agents carry guns and badges, drive government vehicles, and have arrest authority....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In [<span class="Italic">Hodge v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 174 (1988)], the Board applied its holding in <span class="Italic">Chaplin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 639, 641 (1987), that, regardless of whether an employee was entitled to accommodation of his addiction under the Rehabilitation Act, once an agency offered accommodation and the employee accepted the offer, the agency was required to provide the employee with a reasonable period of time to demonstrate successful rehabilitation before taking adverse action for alcohol-related problems. This holding was based on the public policy prohibiting discrimination in employment based on alcohol abuse and encouraging the prevention and rehabilitation of alcoholism within the Federal government....&#8197;In <span class="Italic">Chaplin</span> and <span class="Italic">Hodge</span>, however, the Board was not addressing situations in which the employees' misconduct or other factors disqualified them from their positions. In those situations, the public policy to which the Board referred in <span class="Italic">Keels</span> may be outweighed by other considerations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, in this case, that the public policy mentioned in <span class="Italic">Keels</span> is outweighed by the agency's need to ensure that its Special Agents are reliable and do not themselves pose a danger to the public. Accordingly, we find that the agency's providing the appellant with an opportunity to rehabilitate himself in January 1989 does not preclude it from removing him later that year.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The problem of the threatening employee was discussed in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 60 MSPR 92, 94-95 (1993), extending <span class="Italic">Scofield</span> to include conduct that threatens the security of the workplace without regard to the agency mission or the particular elements of the appellant's position. The Board declined to require accommodation for an appellant charged with making statements "that he was prepared to bring a gun to the workplace and to kill certain individuals if the circumstances of his working environment did not change":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not reach the issues of whether the appellant was provided with a "firm choice" or whether he was offered rehabilitation on June 1, 1992, when he was placed in a nonduty pay status, because we find that the administrative judge erred in his determination that the appellant was a qualified handicapped employee; thus, there was no requirement to offer the appellant either accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that there are certain acts of misconduct which, when committed by an employee who is an alcoholic or drug addict, take that employee outside the scope of protecting legislation because the misconduct renders that person not a qualified handicapped individual. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hougens v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 135, 142 (1988). The type of misconduct described would be that which, standing alone, by its very nature strikes at the core of the employee's job or the agency's mission, or is so egregious or notorious that an employee's ability to perform his duties or to represent the agency is hampered. Thus, whenever the agency proves such misconduct, the Board will sustain the agency's disciplinary action absent a rehabilitation offer because the agency no longer has this obligation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alex v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 605, 610 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge sustained the charge that the appellant was involved in multiple instances of uttering threats directed at his supervisor and coworkers. These included statements that he was prepared to bring a gun to the workplace and kill someone. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that the appellant's misconduct in this case is disqualifying, egregious misconduct as discussed in <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>. We find that it struck at the core of his duties inasmuch as it directly affected his supervisor, coworkers, and the workplace in general. Accordingly, we find that the appellant is not a qualified handicapped individual. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>, 38 MSPR at 151; <span class="Italic">Wilber v.

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 179, 186 (1992) (the appellant's assaultive behavior against his girlfriend renders him not a qualified handicapped employee under <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> criteria).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The risk entailed in maintaining a drug abuser in a position involving great responsibility for the safety of life and property disqualified the appellant from accommodative protection, <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 245, 252-53 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the appellant did establish a causal connection, though, we find that he has not shown he is a qualified employee with a disability, entitled to an accommodation for his condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was responsible for operating a shipboard crane. He loaded all kinds of materials, including bombs, into the hold of ships. The explosive content of the material loaded at anchorage is so great that the materials must be loaded at a distance from the naval base or any inhabited area. Because of the sensitive nature of the appellant's position, the position was a drug testing-designated position. Deciding official Sidnia Etherington testified that she needed to have confidence in the appellant's ability to contribute to a safe working environment in his "special position." She further stated that there were no other positions to which the appellant could be reassigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be a qualified employee with a disability entitled to a reasonable accommodation for his condition under the law and regulations, the appellant must establish, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that with or without reasonable accommodation he can safely perform the essential functions of his position or a vacant position to which he could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Trammell v. VA</span>, 60 MSPR 79, 84 (1993); <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPR 637, 647 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant worked in a position where safety concerns are paramount. There is little margin for error when one is hoisting an explosive device with a crane into the hold of a ship. The acceptable level of tolerance for the appellant's substance abuse problems is inversely proportional to the safety interest that must be safeguarded by the agency. Accordingly, we find the agency was not required to allow the appellant, an admitted abuser of mind-altering drugs, to remain on the job while he attempted to rehabilitate his condition. The appellant therefore failed to show that he could be safely accommodated while employed as a shipboard crane operator....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we find that the type of misconduct in which the appellant engaged disqualified him from consideration as a qualified disabled employee. The appellant was employed in a position requiring him to submit to random drug testing because any condition that might impair the appellant's ability to operate the shipboard crane in a safe manner could have potentially disastrous consequences. Under these circumstances, the act of ingesting illegal, mind-altering drugs struck at the core of the appellant's duties because it directly affected many individuals as well as the workplace in general. For this reason also, the appellant is not "qualified." <span class="Italic">See Williams v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept.</span> <span class="Italic">of the Air Force</span>, 60 MSPR 92, 95 (1993); <span class="Italic">Hougens v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 135, 144 (1988) (accommodation not required when the misconduct strikes at the core of the employee's job <span id="Page_3550"></span>or the agency's mission or is so egregious or notorious that an employee's ability to perform his duties or to represent the agency is hampered).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to conduct that is contrary to the agency mission, <span class="Italic">Thompson v. DOJ</span>, 51 MSPR 43, 49-50 (1991), determined as disqualifying incidents of off-duty driving under the influence, reckless driving, and possession of two marijuana cigarettes by a recreational specialist working at a federal correctional institution:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge rejected the agency's assertion that, under the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Hougens v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 135 (1988), the appellant is disqualified from holding the position of Recreational Specialist because of the inherent contradiction of his misconduct and his responsibility for the rehabilitation of inmates. The administrative judge based this finding on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Kruger v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 32 MSPR 71, 75 (1987), where the Board held that the off-duty possession and use of marijuana by correctional officers, while antithetical to the agency's mission, did not preclude those appellants from returning to their positions following a 60-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the "qualified handicapped employee penalty mitigation" analysis in <span class="Italic">Kruger</span> is inapplicable to the question presented in accommodation cases under the 1973 Rehabilitation Act. The factors analyzed are different. In <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>, the Board considered the employee's misconduct in light of the agency's mission, and determined that there was certain misconduct that, by its very nature, strikes at the core of the job or the agency's mission, or is so egregious or notorious that an employee's ability to perform his duties or to represent the agency is seriously hampered. <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>, 38 MSPR at 144. Such misconduct takes the employee in question outside the scope of the legislation protecting alcoholic and drug abusing employees because such a person is consequently "not a 'qualified' handicapped individual." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 142. Such misconduct, however, does not necessarily require that the employee be removed from Federal service. This determination is to be based upon long-settled mitigation principles, beyond the misconduct itself, set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, we find that the appellant's DWI conviction and possession of an illegal drug (marijuana) renders him "disqualified" for accommodation because these offenses strike at the core of his job and the agency's mission. As a Recreation Specialist, employed by the Federal Prison System, the appellant is considered a law enforcement officer, has frequent and direct contact with prison inmates, and supervises their recreation and leisure time programs. These responsibilities for the security of the prisoners while assisting their rehabilitation necessitates that persons in such a position not violate laws against drunken driving or possession of illegal drugs. The essential integrity of the personnel in the Federal Prison System is flatly compromised whenever an employee violates Federal and state laws. We, therefore, conclude that the agency was not required to offer the appellant accommodation in the form of drug or alcohol rehabilitation before proposing his removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Fourth Circuit merged the "serious misconduct" concept into an analysis of whether the employee meets basic job standards, a result that precludes accommodation requirements for some employees, such as law enforcement officers, whose jobs require mental and physical fitness. At issue in <span class="Italic">Little v. FBI</span>, 1 F.3d 255, 258-59 (4th Cir. 1993), was the termination of an FBI agent found to be an alcoholic but who was not required to be accommodated because, as an alcoholic, he did not meet the fitness standards of the FBI:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The application of the Rehabilitation Act, especially in the context of termination after misconduct, is illuminated by its implementing regulations. In developing regulations to implement Section 504 in 1977, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (later Health and Human Services) solicited the opinion of the Attorney General as to whether an alcoholic or a drug addict is a "handicapped individual" under the Act. While the Attorney General concluded that both alcoholics and drug addicts are handicapped individuals for purposes of Title V of the Act, which includes Sections 501 and 504, he made clear that the Act does not protect alcoholics or drug addicts from the consequences of their misconduct. Specifically, the Attorney General stated that the Act does not "prevent the application to persons suffering from alcoholism or drug addiction of reasonable rules of conduct, such as prohibitions against the possession or use of alcohol or drugs" at the location of the employment or the federally assisted project. 43 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 12, 1977 WL 17999 at *1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Civil Service Commission cited the Attorney General's opinion in promulgating regulations implementing Section 504, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 Fed. Reg. 22,686 (1977), and Section 501, <span class="Italic">see</span> 43 Fed. Reg. 12,294 (1978), respectively. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare specifically stated that the employer "may hold a drug addict or alcoholic to the same standard of performance and behavior to which it holds others, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the person's drug addiction or alcoholism." 42 Fed. Reg. 22,686 (1977). The Secretary also noted that the various behavioral manifestations of the employee's condition may be considered by the employer, and "rules prohibiting the possession or use of alcohol and drugs in the workplace" may be enforced against all employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Equally pointed is the Civil Service Commission commentary to the effect that an alcoholic employee may be terminated "if there is a nexus between such abuse or use and the nature of the employment or if the symptoms resulting from the use of these substances may be so severe that such use, in and of itself, will be sufficient to justify an adverse suitability determination." 43 Fed. Reg. 12,294 (1978). While these agency statements are not binding authority, we accord them considerable deference....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the provisions of the FBI's Manual of Administrative Operations and Procedures ("MAOP") bear clearly on the resolution of this appeal. The MAOP established a program for the prevention and treatment of alcoholism and the rehabilitation of alcoholic employees within the FBI. However, the MAOP recited that "this program should not be construed as a relaxation of FBI standards of conduct. FBI policy continues to require that <span class="Italic">employees should never cause themselves to be mentally or physically unfit for duty</span>." MAOP 15-3.3(2). The next subsection of the MAOP provided that while it is generally required that "rehabilitative efforts be made before disciplinary action for unsatisfactory job performance can be taken," those efforts "do not preclude agency action if...other actions or activities are present and constitute employee misconduct." MAOP 15-3.3(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, a number of cases decided since the adoption of the Rehabilitation Act have considered the issue of misconduct as distinct from status as an alcoholic or drug addict. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Taub v. Frank</span>, 957 F.2d 8 (1st Cir. 1992) (alcoholic Postal Service employee discharged because of criminal conduct). One case similar to this case involved a police officer who was found to have been a user of illegal drugs, and therefore not "otherwise qualified," because his unlawful behavior in the use of illegal drugs violated "an essential function of the officer's position to enforce the laws." <span class="Italic">Copeland v. Philadelphia Police Dept.</span>, 840 F.2d 1139 (3d Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 490 U.S. 1004, 109 S. Ct. 1636, 104 L. Ed.2d 153 (1989). In a more severe case, an alcoholic Postal Service employee was held not to be protected by the Rehabilitation Act where he committed assault with intent to kill. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Richardson v. USPS</span>, 613 F. Supp. 1213 (D.D.C. 1985) [discussed, <span class="Italic">post</span>].As Judge Gesell noted in his opinion, the plaintiff in that case "was discharged for his criminal conduct, not because of alcoholism or poor job performance due to alcohol." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1215.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing authority--the agency regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act, the provisions of the FBI's MAOP, and the judicial opinions just discussed--and based on no lesser authority than common sense, it is clear that an employer subject to the Rehabilitation Act must be permitted to terminate its employee on account of egregious misconduct, irrespective of whether the employee is handicapped.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the record before us, it plainly appears that the appellant was fired because of his misconduct, not because of his alcoholism. The "Notification of Personnel Action" of January 17, 1991, indicated that Little's dismissal was "taken in view of his inability to conform to the FBI's established standards that special agents must remain mentally and physically fit for duty at all times." Although the notice fails to give any more specific basis for Little's termination, the only permissible inference from the allegations of the complaint is that Little was fired because he was intoxicated while on duty on May 16, 1990. Little's superiors had knowledge of his previous alcohol-related incidents, particularly the December 1989 driving-while-intoxicated charge, but the FBI did not terminate him. It is notable that Little's previous alcohol-related incidents all occurred while Little was off-duty. Rather than being terminated, Little was referred for outpatient treatment, and, after completing that treatment, he was reinstated to full duty. It was only after Little was intoxicated while on duty on May 16, 1990, and only after he admitted such during an interview by his superiors, that the FBI asked him to resign and ultimately, when he did not resign, terminated him. Without attempting to recite in detail the duties of an FBI special agent, it is certain that being intoxicated while on duty will undoubtedly prevent an FBI special agent from being "mentally and physically fit for duty at all times."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant is correct that ordinarily the district court must undertake an "individualized inquiry" into the facts, there is no such requirement where the allegations of the complaint fail to state a claim. Although the appellant made the conclusory allegation in his complaint that he was fired because of his alcoholism, that allegation is simply not supported by the other allegations of the complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, we agree with the district court that Little was not "otherwise qualified" to be an FBI special agent. However, we also rest our decision on a different portion of the statute, a portion virtually ignored by the parties. The Rehabilitation Act applies only where the "otherwise qualified handicapped individual" is subjected to adverse action taken "solely by reason of his handicap." 29 USC 794. In this case, it is manifest that Little was not terminated "solely by reason of his handicap." Therefore, on that basis, too, Little fails to state a claim under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3551"></span>Because Little falls outside the protection of the Rehabilitation Act, he cannot avail himself of this circuit's five-step procedure to be followed by federal agencies in dealing with alcoholic employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Lehman</span>, 869 F.2d 253, 259 (4th Cir. 1989). In any event, we need not decide whether that procedure applies to the FBI.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Little</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Newland v. Dalton</span>, 81 F.3d 904, 906 (9th Cir. 1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Rehabilitation Act does not immunize Newland from the consequences of his drunken rampage. <span class="Italic">See Collings v.

Alcoholism is a recognized handicap, <span class="Italic">Fuller v. Frank</span>, 916 F.2d 558, 561 (9th Cir. 1990), but the majority of courts have held that while the Rehabilitation Act ("Act") protects employees from being fired solely because of their disability, they are still responsible for conduct which would otherwise result in their termination. <span class="Italic">See Maddox</span>, 62 F.3d at 848 (employers subject to Act permitted to discipline for egregious or criminal conduct, including off-duty drunk-driving, regardless of disability); <span class="Italic">Despears v. Milwaukee County</span>, 63 F.3d 635, 637 (7th Cir. 1995) (alcoholic employee responsible for off-duty drunk driving arrest because alcoholism did not compel driving the car); <span class="Italic">Little v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">These courts have concluded that firings precipitated by misconduct rather than any handicap do not violate the Act<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Little</span>, 1 F.3d at 259. While there is precedent suggesting that if the misconduct is causally related to the disability it cannot be grounds for termination, <span class="Italic">Teahan v. Metro-North Commuter R.R.

Ed.2d 24 (1992), we have adopted the approach of the <span class="Italic">Little</span> court. <span class="Italic">Collings</span>, 63 F.3d at 833. In <span class="Italic">Collings</span>, after citing <span class="Italic">Little</span>, we concluded that a termination based on misconduct rather than the disability itself was valid. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. While <span class="Italic">Collings</span> involved an Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") claim, Section 501(g) of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 USC 791(g), incorporates ADA standards for claims alleging "nonaffirmative action employment discrimination."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Newland recognizes, as he must, that he was terminated for his conduct. <span class="Italic">See Collings</span>, 63 F.3d at 833. His termination was not in retribution for his alcoholism but rather was in response to his attempt to fire an assault rifle inside a bar. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Thus the termination did not violate the Act. Attempting to fire a weapon at individuals is the kind of egregious and criminal conduct which employees are responsible for regardless of any disability. <span class="Italic">See Maddox</span>, 62 F.3d at 848; <span class="Italic">Little</span>, 1 F.3d at 259.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board came close to establishing a <span class="Italic">per se</span> bar to a rehabilitation defense for an employee removed for work-related drunk driving and for failure to maintain his government driving privileges in <span class="Italic">Coates v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 74 MSPR 362, 368-71 (1997), sustaining removal of a maintenance worker:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination based on alcoholism, the appellant must prove (1) that he is a qualified disabled person, and (2) that his disability caused his misconduct or that the misconduct was entirely a manifestation of his disability. <span class="Italic">See Kye v. DLA</span>, 64 MSPR 570, 573 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">King v. Erickson</span>, 89 F.3d 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The AJ found, and it is undisputed, that the appellant was disabled by alcoholism during the pertinent times. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 245, 251 (1994). To establish that he was a "qualified" disabled person entitled to reasonable accommodation, however, the appellant must further establish that, with or without reasonable accommodation, he could safely perform the essential functions of his position or a vacant position to which he could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 252. In this regard, certain types of misconduct disqualify the employee from being a qualified disabled person entitled to reasonable accommodation by the agency, as discussed below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hougens v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 135, 144 (1988), the Board stated that a claim of disability discrimination based on alcoholism "does not shield Federal employees from uniformly applied discipline for breaches of the public trust of sufficient severity and type to disqualify them from Federal public service or service in their position...." The Board stated that "[t]he type of misconduct that, standing alone, disqualifies a Federal employee from his position is that which, by its very nature, strikes at the core of the job or the agency's mission, or is so egregious or notorious that an employee's ability to perform his duties or to represent the agency is hampered." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board further stated that "where criminal or other serious misconduct relates directly to a fundamental requirement of his position, the employee is no longer otherwise qualified, and the discipline imposed cannot reasonably be regarded as handicap discrimination...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 145. The Board thus concluded that Hougens' misconduct of pointing his automatic pistol at four unarmed persons and firing it at a fleeing person struck at the core responsibility of his Postal Inspector position and constituted disqualifying misconduct<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 149.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Wilber v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 42 MSPR 582, 588-89 (1989), the Board relied on <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> to hold that Wilber's off-duty misconduct of driving while intoxicated and consequently causing the death of a child was disqualifying misconduct because it struck at the core of the agency's mission and his duties as a law enforcement officer. <span class="Italic">Cf. Malbouf v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 43 MSPR 588, 591-92 (1990) (DUI was disqualifying misconduct because the resultant loss of the appellant's driver's license rendered him "technically" disqualified to perform his essential duties).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Several U.S. Courts of Appeals have recently held that intoxication while on duty or DUI constitutes disqualifying misconduct. In <span class="Italic">Little v. Federal Bureau of Investigation</span>, 1 F.3d 255, 258 (4th Cir. 1993), the alcoholic employee was terminated for intoxication while on duty. The court held that the employee was not entitled to reasonable accommodation because such misconduct took him beyond the protection of the disability discrimination laws. The court noted that an employer "must be permitted to terminate its employees on account of egregious misconduct, irrespective of whether the employee is handicapped [i.e., disabled]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 259. In <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Univ. of Tennessee</span>, 62 F.3d 843, 848 (6th Cir. 1995), the employee was terminated from his position for off-duty DUI. In rejecting the employee's claim of disability discrimination based on alcoholism, the court stated that an employer should not be forced to accommodate all behavior of an alcoholic which could in any way be related to his use of alcohol, "behavior that would be intolerable if engaged in by a sober employee or, for that matter, an intoxicated but non-alcoholic employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 847. The court further stated that "[e]mployers subject to the Rehabilitation Act and ADA must be permitted to take appropriate action with respect to an employee on account of egregious or criminal conduct, regardless of whether the employee is disabled." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 848. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Despears v. Milwaukee County</span>, 63 F.3d 635, 636-37 (7th Cir. 1995) (the criminal law recognizes that alcoholism may contribute to, but does not compel, DUI, and "[t]o impose liability under the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Rehabilitation Act in such circumstances would indirectly but unmistakably undermine the laws that regulate dangerous behavior"); <span class="Italic">cf. Newland v. Dalton</span>, 81 F.3d 904, 906 (9th Cir. 1996) (attempting to fire an assault rifle at individuals in a bar constituted disqualifying misconduct); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Widnall</span>, 79 F.3d 1003, 1007 (10th Cir. 1996) (threats against coworkers and supervisors constituted disqualifying misconduct).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the cases discussed above, we find that the appellant's misconduct involving an on-duty DUI in a government van, which damaged government property and resulted in physical injury to himself and endangered others, constituted disqualifying misconduct precluding any right to reasonable accommodation by the agency<span class="Italic">. But cf. Hulsey v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 57 MSPR 473, 476 &#x0026; n.4 (1993) (the Board did not disturb the AJ's finding that the appellant was a qualified disabled person with respect to DUI and other charges).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The circumstances surrounding the DUI in <span class="Italic">Hulsey</span> are unclear, and we find it unnecessary to resolve here the issue whether a DUI, in itself, constitutes disqualifying misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant was a qualified disabled person, we find that he is not entitled to the type of accommodation that he requested and that the AJ found the agency was obligated to provide. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) provides that a covered employer "may hold an employee who engaged in the illegal use of drugs or who is an alcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior that such entity holds other employees, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the drug use or alcoholism of such employee." 42 USC 12114(c)(4); <span class="Italic">Kimble v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 617, 621 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act was amended in 1992 to incorporate the standards applied under Title I of the ADA and sections 501 through 504 and 510 of the ADA to complaints of disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-569, 106 Stat. 4360, 4428 (codified at 29 USC 791(g)). <span class="Italic">Kimble</span>, 70 MSPR at 621-22. In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Babbitt</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03940100 (Mar. 28, 1996), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) stated that the effect of the 1992 amendments was that "employers do not have to excuse the violation of uniformly-applied conduct or job performance standards as a form of reasonable accommodation." The EEOC then held that, because the previously required accommodation of providing an alcoholic employee with a "firm choice" between treatment and discipline effectively excused the violation of uniformly applied job performance or standards, agencies were no longer required to provide it. The Board has adopted this holding in <span class="Italic">Johnson. See Kimble</span>, 70 MSPR at 622.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The articulated accommodation here--pairing the appellant up with an apprentice to drive him to worksites or assigning him to a clerical position, in lieu of removal--would have the effect of excusing him from the disciplinary action that the agency otherwise would impose for violation of uniformly applied conduct or job performance standards. We therefore find that the agency was not required to provide such accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One view on the ability of an agency to discipline an employee who claims <span id="Page_3552"></span>alcoholism as a defense to criminal conduct leading to dismissal was offered by Judge Gesell in <span class="Italic">Richardson v. USPS</span>, 613 F. Supp. 1213, 1215 (D.D.C. 1985), as to a discrimination claim based on the theory that the employee had been an alcoholic, that at the time of the crime he had been drinking, and that, had he received proper accommodation through the agency's insistence that he obtain treatment, he might not have committed the crime:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The nexus between the crime (assault with intent to kill) and the alcohol is, of course, highly conjectural. But even if events of 1978 and earlier were to be examined to untangle the reasons underlying Richardson's mental difficulties and alcohol use and Richardson's alcoholism was shown to be a substantial cause of his criminal conduct, it would not benefit Richardson here. Richardson was discharged for his criminal conduct, not because of alcoholism or poor job performance due to alcohol. He does not claim otherwise. The Rehabilitation Act only protects against removal "solely because of alcohol abuse." 29 USC 794. It does not prohibit an employer from discharging an employee for improper off-duty conduct when the reason for the discharge is the conduct itself, and not any handicap to which the conduct may be related....&#8197;The Act does not create a duty to accommodate an alcoholic who is not "otherwise qualified," i.e., commits an act which standing alone disqualifies him from service and is not entirely a manifestation of alcohol abuse. Nor does it provide any remedy for an employee who has been discharged for nondiscriminatory reasons and alleges that the employer failed to fulfill the duty to accommodate sometime in the past. The criminal acts that Richardson committed are disqualifying acts under the rules and policy of the Postal Service and he was properly discharged.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may be permitted, under 42 USC 290dd(b)(2)(E) [formerly 42 USC 4561(c)(2)], to avoid accommodative responsibilities under the Rehabilitation Act if the employee's position is designated as sensitive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Peru v. DOJ</span>, 22 MSPR 52, 55 (1984) (noting but not depending upon the statutory provision in the removal appeal of a border patrol agent).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In pre-<span class="Italic">Hougens</span> appeals, the Board evaluated disability defenses to actions based on severe misconduct by determining whether retention of the employee would impose an undue hardship on agency operations. It was not discriminatory to remove an alcoholic employee whose violent behavior with a vehicle at the agency premises created overriding concerns about safety of agency operations and personnel. <span class="Italic">Cavallaro v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 20 MSPR 701, 706 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Averill v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 327, 331 (1986) (mobile equipment servicer; drugs) (citing <span class="Italic">Mantolete v. Bolger</span>, 767 F.2d 1416 (9th Cir. 1985)); <span class="Italic">Noe v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 86, 90 (1985) (letter carrier; alcohol); <span class="Italic">Kulling v.

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 26 MSPR 376, 378 (1985) (criminal investigator who carried a firearm should have been accommodated through an opportunity to complete rehabilitation when he had a good prognosis for recovery and a demonstrated capability of controlling stress when not drinking), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Friel v.
