<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-291"><span class="space">a.</span> Nonretroactive Substantive Application</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">USERRA became effective on October 13, 1994. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Army</span>, 83 MSPR 109, 111-17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-15 (1999), determined that, because the statute created new causes of action based on discrimination that was not prohibited <span id="Page_495"></span>by prior statutes, USERRA did not authorize the Board to adjudicate claims for actions or inactions not prohibited before the statute's effective date:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue presented is whether the Board has the authority to adjudicate actions prohibited by USERRA, but which arose prior to its effective date. USERRA prohibits, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the denial of initial employment of a person who "is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service" because of that "membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation." 38 USC &#x00A7; 4311(a). This provision became effective upon its enactment on October 13, 1994. USERRA, Pub. L. No. 103-353, &#x00A7; 8(b), 1994 USCCAN (108 Stat.) 3149, 3175-76. Section 4324 of title 38 of the United States Code addresses enforcement of rights with respect to federal executive agencies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to 1994, section 2021 of title 38 of the United States Code, the predecessor to section 4311, provided, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]ny person who [is employed by the federal government or a state or a political subdivision thereof] shall not be denied hiring, retention in employment, or any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment <span class="Italic">because of any obligation as a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 2021(b)(3) (1988) (emphasis supplied).[1] In 1994, Congress enacted USERRA, which, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, replaced section 2021(b)(3). This new legislation substantially expanded the scope and coverage of the prior discrimination provision. Specifically, it now provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, <span class="Italic">has performed</span>, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Section 2021 was part of chapter 43 of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-508, 88 Stat. 1578, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1974 USCCAN 1818, 1837. Chapter 43 is commonly referred to as the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act (VRRA). The provisions of the VRRA were codified at 38 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4307 (as chapter 43) immediately prior to October 13, 1994, after their renumbering by the Veterans' Benefits Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-568, 1992 USCCAN (106 Stat.) 4320, from 38 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2021-2027 (also as chapter 43), where they were originally codified when enacted as section 404 of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974<span class="Italic">. See</span> Historical and Statutory Notes following 38 USCA Chapter 43 Table (West Supp. 1998). Thus, references to the VRRA include its predecessor statutes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 4311(a) (emphasis supplied). Thus, while section 2021(b)(3) barred employment discrimination only on the basis of an individual's obligations as a military reservist, section 4311(a) now also bars discrimination, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, on the basis of prior military service and application for membership in such service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, section 2021(b)(3) prohibited discrimination "because of any obligation as a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces." In response to the Supreme Court's interpretation of this language as having the "significant but limited purpose of protecting the employee-reservist against discriminations...<span class="Italic">motivated solely</span> by reserve status," <span class="Italic">see Monroe v. Standard Oil Co.</span>, 452 U.S. 549, 559 (1981) (emphasis supplied), Congress enacted section 4311(b) of USERRA eliminating the "because of" language of section 2021(b)(3) and expressly disavowing this "sole motivation" standard. Congress specifically explained that its intent was, and always had been, to adopt a mixed-motive burden-shifting scheme. <span class="Italic">See Petersen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 71 MSPR 227, 239-40 (1996). Thus, the House Report accompanying H.R. 995, which eventually became USERRA, stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Section 4311(b) would reaffirm that the standard of proof in a discrimination or retaliation case is the so-called "but for" test and that the burden of proof is on the employer, once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established. This provision is simply a reaffirmation of the original intent of Congress when it enacted current section 2021(b)(3)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">This standard and burden of proof is applicable to all cases brought under this section regardless of the date of accrual of the cause of action</span>. To the extent that courts have relied on dicta from the Supreme Court's decision in Monroe...that a violation of this section can occur only if the military obligation is the sole factor...those decisions have misinterpreted the original legislative intent and history of 38 USC &#x00A7; 2021(b)(3) and are rejected on that basis.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, Congress amended USERRA by enacting the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998 (VPEA). As a result, section 4324(c) now provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Merit Systems Protection Board shall adjudicate any complaint brought before the Board pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(A) or (b), <span class="Italic">without regard as to whether the complaint accrued before, on, or after October 13, 1994</span>. A person who seeks a hearing or adjudication by submitting such a complaint under this paragraph may be represented at such hearing or adjudication in accordance with the rules of the Board. 38 USC &#x00A7; 4324(c), as amended by VPEA, Pub. L. No. 105-368, &#x00A7; 213, 1998 USCCAN (112 Stat.) 3315, 3331 (effective November 11, 1998) (1998 additions in italics).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now address the effect of the 1998 amendment with respect to the Board's adjudicatory authority. Regulations first issued in 1975 by the Civil Service Commission and continued in effect by Office of Personnel Management, have long authorized appeals to the Board by individuals claiming failure to restore or improper restoration following military service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.301.[2] In addition, under 38 USC &#x00A7; 2014(b)(1)(D) (added in 1984), an individual terminated during the first year of a veterans readjustment appointment was given the same right to appeal the termination to the Board as a career or career conditional appointee has during the first year of employment. In contrast, the Board was not authorized to adjudicate other denials of rights under chapter 43 of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-508, 88 Stat. 1578, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1974 USCCAN 1818, 1837, commonly referred to as the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act (VRRA). <span class="Italic">See McNeil v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 12, 15 (1991) (agency's placement of employee on AWOL during time that he was on properly documented military leave not appealable).[3] <span class="Italic">See also Antolin v. Department of Justice</span>, 895 F.2d 1395, 1397 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (denial of retention due to reserve membership in violation of 38 USC &#x00A7; 2021(b)(3) not appealable to the Board). Thus, except for allegations of improper restoration, there was no law, rule or regulation which gave the Board the authority to hear other veterans' related appeals such as an agency's failure to select a person for a position on account of his military service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">See generally Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 886 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary. Absent specific statutory authorization, claims of unlawful conduct in the selection process ordinarily are not appealable to the Board.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Board has given a broad construction to "improper restoration." <span class="Italic">See Andrews v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 233 (1991) (denial of promotion that employee would have received while on military leave appealable as an improper restoration).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Board has jurisdiction, of course, to review an agency's denial of military leave in an appeal of an adverse action based on unauthorized absence during the period of military service<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Jeffrey v. Department of the Navy</span>, 25 MSPR 697 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 1998 amendment is found in subchapter III, which is entitled "Procedures for Assistance, Enforcement, and Investigation." The language of the provision can be given two different interpretations: (1) to provide the Board authority to adjudicate those kinds of complaints that accrued before October 13, 1994, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, complaints under the USERRA predecessor statute (VRRA), or (2) to make retroactive the substantive law of USERRA. For the following reasons, we find that the 1998 amendment gives the Board the authority to hear and adjudicate claims arising under the predecessor statute (VRRA), but does not authorize the Board to adjudicate claims of discrimination that were not prohibited prior to the passage of USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point for statutory interpretation is the plain language of the statute in question. S<span class="Italic">wentek v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 76 MSPR 605, 610 (1997). Here, the amendment to USERRA clearly extends the Board's authority to adjudicate cases that are based on <span class="Italic">events</span> which happened before October 13, 1994. However, the amendment refers to the <span class="Italic">procedure</span> by which the complaint is brought to the Board, not to any <span class="Italic">substantive right</span> under which the claim is brought. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 4324(a)(2)(A) and (b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where the language of a statute is ambiguous, it is appropriate to consult the legislative history to determine Congressional intent. <span class="Italic">Martin J. Simko Construction, Inc. v. United States</span>, 852 F.2d 540, 542-43 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The legislative history of the amendment to section 4324(c)(1) supports our conclusion. Section 213(a) of the VPEA amended the first sentence of paragraph (1) of 5 USC &#x00A7; 4324(c) by adding "without regard as to whether the complaint accrued before, on, or after October 13, 1994." There is no mention of this provision in either of the committee reports for the VPEA.[4] When the amendment was passed by the House as part of H.R. 3213, the USERRA Amendments of 1998 (with wording identical to the final version), the House report stated that section 3 of the bill would amend section 4324(c) to clarify that the Board has jurisdiction to hear complaints brought under section 4324 without regard to when the complaint accrued. H.R. 448, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1998).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the committee reports do not expressly address the question here, persuasive evidence concerning the amendment's purpose is provided by the comments on the floor of Rep. Lane Evans, a cosponsor of H.R. 3213, during consideration of that bill. Noting that H.R. 3213 provided the Board authority to hear certain complaints regardless of when they arose, he stated that the basis for the legislation was a case which had involved an employee charged with AWOL due to his participation in military training after his agency refused his request for military leave. Even though the alleged violations were prohibited under the VRRA, the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) had determined that it could not represent the employee concerning an alleged violation that occurred before the effective date of USERRA because the VRRA did not provide for OSC enforcement. The Congressman explained that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The provisions of this bill will allow for representation by the Office of the Special Counsel of persons before the Merit Systems Protection Board for pre-USERRA causes of action which are alleged to be violations of the VRRA statute. Jurisdiction of the Merit Systems Protection Board is extended to all claims filed with the Board after October 13, 1994 regardless of whether the action complained of occurred before, on, or after that date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">144 Cong. Rec. H1398 (daily ed. Mar. 24, 1998).[7] In light of this history, we believe the amendment is most reasonably interpreted as extending the Board's jurisdiction to adjudicate pre-USERRA claims which arose under the VRRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Rep. Evans' understanding of the amendment was shared by Assistant Secretary of Labor Espiridion Borrego, who testified at the hearings cited above that "we do support Section 3 which ensures that an enforcement mechanism exists for federal employees with respect to certain violations of the predecessor Veterans' Reemployment Rights law...." Hearings, <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 5, at 95.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to these affirmative reasons for interpreting the amendment to permit the Board to adjudicate pre-USERRA claims, we also note the jurisprudential concerns militating against the retroactive application of substantive rights. Generally, retroactivity is not favored in law. <span class="Italic">See Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, 511 U.S. 244, 265 (1994) ("[T]he presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic."). In <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, the Supreme Court discussed the principles for determining whether a statute should apply retroactively, depending on whether the legislation is substantive, or is merely procedural in nature. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 275, 280. With regard to the former, the Court found that, when a case implicates a Federal statute enacted after the events at issue, the court must first determine whether Congress, in the statute, expressly prescribed whether it should be applied retroactively. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 280. The Court further found that, if the statute does not contain such an express command, the court must then determine whether the retroactive application of the statute would "impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Court noted that it would apply the "traditional presumption" against retroactivity if retroactive application would have such results<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Nevertheless, the Court also stated that changes in procedural rules could be applied to matters arising before their enactment because rules of procedure regulate secondary rather than primary conduct of the parties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 275.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the USERRA statute specified its temporal reach by stating that the discrimination provisions set forth at 38 USC &#x00A7; 4311(a)-(b) would be effective on the date of enactment (October 13, 1994). <span class="Italic">See</span> USERRA, Pub. L. No. 103-353, &#x00A7; 8(b), 1994 USCCAN (108 Stat.) 3149, 3175-76. As noted above, while section 2021(b)(3) barred employment discrimination on the basis of an individual's obligations as a military reservist, section 4311(a) now also bars discrimination, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, on the basis of prior uniformed service, membership in such service, and even application for such service. Because the new legislation creates new causes of action based on discrimination that was not prohibited under the prior statute, retroactive application of this section would have the impermissible effect of increasing the agency's liability for past conduct, and imposing on it new duties with respect to transactions already completed. <span class="Italic">See Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 280.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the appellant alleges that he was discriminated against because of his veteran status when he was denied a job in 1984. As previously set forth, the VPEA, enacted in 1998, gave the Board the authority to adjudicate any complaint <span class="Italic">without regard as to whether the complaint accrued before, on, or after October 13, 1994</span>. However, an examination of the law as it existed in 1984, <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000-2026 (1982, Supp. I 1983, Supp. II 1984, &#x0026; Supp. III 1985), indicates no provision upon which the appellant could base a claim of discrimination because of his veteran status. Therefore, no complaint accrued which the Board could presently adjudicate. We therefore dismiss the appellant's appeal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Higgins v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 64, 68-69 &#x00B6; 8 (1999), reconfirmed that USERRA is not retroactive:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal, the appellant raised a claim under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), alleging that the agency discriminated against him on the basis of his status as a veteran. Although the administrative judge adjudicated the merits of this claim, since the issuance of the initial decision in this appeal, the Board has ruled that it does not have the authority to adjudicate claims of discrimination related to an appellant's status as a veteran which were not prohibited prior to the October 13, 1994 passage of USERRA<span class="Italic">. See Williams v. Department of the Army,</span> 83 MSPR 109 &#x00B6; 9 (July 26, 1999). In 1992, at the time of the appellant's alleged constructive suspension and involuntary retirement, the predecessor of USERRA's anti-discrimination provisions prohibited discrimination solely on the basis of any obligation a person might have had as a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 2021(b)(3) (1988); <span class="Italic">Williams,</span> 83 MSPR 109 &#x00B6; 5. Because the law at that time did not prohibit discrimination on the basis of a person's status as a veteran, the appellant did not raise a claim which the Board could presently adjudicate. We therefore dismiss the appellant's USERRA claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Matthews v. USPS</span>, 93 MSPR 109, 114 &#x00B6; 12 (2002) (in 1991, the law did not prohibit discrimination on the basis of a person's status as a veteran); <span class="Italic">Harris v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 159, 161 &#x00B6; 6 (2000) (Board does not have authority to adjudicate claims of discrimination related to an appellant's status as a veteran that were not prohibited prior to the October 13, 1994, passage of USERRA); <span class="Italic">Venters v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's position in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> when it reviewed the Board's conclusion in <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. Dept. of Army</span>, 84 MSPR 550, 552-53 &#x00B6; 4 (1999), involving dismissal of a claim for living quarters allowance that predated USERRA, <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. Dept. of Army</span>, 234 F.3d 553, 555-57 (Fed. Cir. 2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next turn to the issue of whether Fernandez has stated a claim before the Board upon which relief can be granted when the acts that he alleges are prohibited by the USERRA, namely the denial of his requests for living quarters allowances during 1979 through 1991, took place prior to the effective date of that Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The USERRA was enacted by Congress in 1994 to expand the scope and coverage of the VRRA in a number of important ways. One of those ways was to extend the reach of the act to cover not only reservists but all members of the uniformed services. Specifically, section 2021 of the VRRA provided, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that: "[a]ny person [employed by the federal government] shall not be denied hiring, retention in employment, or any promotional or other incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation as a member of a <span class="Italic">Reserve</span> component of the Armed Forces." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(b)(3) (1988) (emphasis added). That section was replaced by section 4311(a) of the USERRA, which provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a <span class="Italic">uniformed service</span> shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 USC &#x00A7; 4311(a) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1998, Congress again amended the USERRA by enacting the Veterans Program Enhancement Act of 1998 ("VPEA"). Under Section 4324(c) of the VPEA: "The Merit Systems Protection Board shall adjudicate any complaint brought before the Board pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(A) or (b), without regard as to whether the complaint accrued before, on, or after October 13, 1994." 38 USC &#x00A7; 4324(c), as amended by VPEA, Pub. L. No. 105-368 &#x00A7; 213, 1998 USCCAN (112 Stat.) 3315, 3331 (effective November 11, 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the MSPB properly noted in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the VPEA can be given two different interpretations: "(1) to provide the Board authority to adjudicate those kinds of complaints that accrued before October 13, 1994, i.e., complaints under the USERRA predecessor statute (VRRA); or (2) to make retroactive the substantive law of USERRA." <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 83 MSPR at 114.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_497"></span>The Board in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> determined that "the 1998 amendment gives the Board the authority to hear and adjudicate claims arising under the predecessor statute (VRRA), but does not authorize the Board to adjudicate claims of discrimination that were not prohibited prior to the passage of USERRA." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In other words, the Board concluded that the temporal reach of the USERRA was limited and not retroactive. The Board came to this conclusion by first examining the plain language of the statute, then undertaking an analysis of the legislative history to determine Congressional intent, and concluding by commenting briefly on jurisprudential factors<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 114-15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Looking first at the plain language of the statute, the Board in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> (citing 38 USC &#x00A7; 4324(a)(2)(A) and (b)) observed that while the amendment to the USERRA clearly extended the Board's authority to the adjudication of cases based on events which happened before October 13, 1994, and set forth clear procedures by which a complaint is brought to the Board; it did not refer specifically to any substantive right under which the claim may be adjudicated<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 114. The Board thus found ambiguity in the statute and looked to the legislative history for guidance. What the Board did not recognize was that the USERRA directly addressed this issue and clearly specified at the time of its passage that the provisions of section 4311(a) "shall become effective on the date of enactment of this Act [October 13, 1994]." <span class="Italic">See</span> USERRA &#x00A7; 8(b), 1994 USCCAN (108 Stat.) at 3175-76.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> went on to examine the legislative history and found support for its conclusion of prospectivity in the temporal extent of the amendment. The Board referred specifically to comments on the floor of the House of Representatives by Rep. Lane Evans, who explained that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The provisions of this bill will allow for representation by the Office of Special Counsel of persons before the Merit Systems Protection Board for pre-USERRA causes of action which are alleged to be violations of the VRRA statute. Jurisdiction of the Merit Systems Protection Board is extended to all claims filed with the Board after October 13, 1994 regardless of whether the action complained of occurred before, on, or after that date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 83 MSPR at 115 (citing 144 Cong. Rec. H1398 (daily ed. Mar. 24, 1998)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> concluded by expressing jurisprudential concerns, which it considered to militate against the retroactive application of substantive rights under the USERRA. Specifically, the Board noted the presumption against retroactive application of legislation depending on whether it is substantive or merely procedural in nature and whether, if it is substantive and implicates events taking place before enactment of the statute, Congress has expressly prescribed that the statute be applied retroactively<span class="Italic">. See Landgraf v. USI Film Prods.</span>, 511 U.S. 244, 265-75, 280 (1994). The Board observed that if the statute does not contain such an express command, the court must then determine whether retroactive application of the statute would "impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Moreover, the Board observed that while section 2021(b)(3) barred employment discrimination based upon an individual's obligations as a military reservist, section 4311(a) now also bars discrimination based upon prior uniformed service, membership in such service, or application for such service. The Board then concluded that because section 4311(a) thereby extends substantive rights to all members of the uniformed services, not only to those in the reserves, retroactive application of section 4311(a) would have the impermissible effect of increasing the agency's liability for past conduct and imposing new duties on the agency with respect to transactions already completed<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 280).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent discussed above, we agree with the reasoning of the Board in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> and its interpretation of the VPEA. We hold that the VPEA gave the MSPB the authority to hear and adjudicate claims arising under both the USERRA and its predecessor statute, the VRRA, without regard to whether the complaint accrued before, on, or after October 13, 1994, but did not make retroactive the substantive provisions of the USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the merits of the case before us, the question thus becomes whether Fernandez has stated a claim for which relief can be granted under the VRRA, which was the only relevant law in effect at the time his claim accrued. In this regard, the Board stated, "[a]lthough USERRA prohibits the denial of employment benefits based on an employee's prior service in the uniformed services, the VRRA itself provided no such protection." <span class="Italic">Fernandez</span>, 84 MSPR at 553. Although the Board's statement is not a model of clarity, it recognizes that section 2021(b)(3) of the VRRA only applied to reservists and that all members of the uniformed services were not given coverage under the act until passage of section 4311(a) of the USERRA in 1994. Because Fernandez has not alleged that he was a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces prior to the years 1979 through 1991, the time period during which he was denied a living quarters allowance, he was not covered by the VRRA and could not have stated a claim under section 2021(b)(3) of the VRRA.</p>
