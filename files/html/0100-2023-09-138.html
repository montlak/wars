<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-136"><span class="space">d.</span> Prior Law; Disability Retirement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The discussion that follows provides the Board law interpreting the effect of retirement on appeals filed before the effective date of legislation preserving the right to appeal a removal (or similar action) irrespective of the date of retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee applied for disability retirement and if that retirement application was granted with an effective date preceding the effective date of a removal (a situation that could occur because of delays resulting from OPM review or MSPB adjudication of the disability application), the adverse action appeal was moot. <span class="Italic">Sutherland v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 21 MSPR 89, 90 (1984);<span class="Italic"> see Ballentine v. DOJ</span>, 39 MSPR 543, 546-47 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 89-3193) ("[A] voluntary retirement results in an employee's complete separation from the service and that the employee is not entitled to rescind his voluntary retirement because he subsequently prevails in an appeal of an adverse action before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Collier v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 MSPR 38, 42 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 795 F.2d 1019 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (table)....&#8197;In <span class="Italic">Collier</span>, the Board specifically found, <span class="Italic">citing to</span> <span class="Italic">Kestner v. Department of the Interior</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 772 (1982), that, under such circumstances, an employee is not entitled to reinstatement."). A Board appeal was moot if disability retirement was granted for the period of AWOL that led to the removal. <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Nat'l Endowment for Humanities</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 83-1303). An involuntary resignation appeal was mooted by a retroactive disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Gaylor v. Dept. of Army</span>, 31 MSPR 432, 433 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sarginson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 21 MSPR 764, 765 (1984) (retroactive grant of a disability retirement mooted the appeal from removal that was effective after the retirement date). In <span class="Italic">Malone v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 458, 459 (1985), the Board lacked jurisdiction over an appeal of a removal when the appellant's voluntarily initiated disability retirement application was granted retroactively to a date before the effective date of the removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before a retirement mooted an appeal, the agency had to change its records to show that the retirement, and not an adverse action, was the reason for the employee's removal. The removal appeal became moot once the employee's retirement application was effected retroactive to the date of the removal action and once the agency canceled the removal action in its entirety. <span class="Italic">Hill v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 585 (1990). Under early decisions, if a federal employee voluntarily retired after a RIF action took effect, the employee was not entitled to back pay and reinstatement even if the RIF action was improper. Voluntary <span id="Page_1078"></span>retirement, like resignation, resulted in the employee's complete separation from the federal service. After it became effective, the separation could not be revoked or withdrawn at the employee's option. A decision to retire after the adverse action or RIF, though unpleasant, did not make the decision to retire involuntary. <span class="Italic">Brewster v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1983 NP No. 83-957); <span class="Italic">Kestner v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 772 (1982); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. United States</span>, 219 Ct. Cl. 86, 591 F.2d 688 (Ct. Cl. 1979); <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPR 316, 317, 6 MSPB 269 (1981). But retirement following the effective date of a removal did not moot the appeal. <span class="Italic">Clay v. DOJ</span>, 29 MSPR 553 (1985) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Dobratz v. DHHS</span>, 53 MSPR 9 (1992), the appellant was removed under Chapter 43 and he filed for and was granted a discontinued service annuity based on his years of service, age, and the nature of his separation from the service. The appellant was removed on January 2, 1988. On May 23, 1988, the AJ filed an initial decision reversing the removal. The agency filed a PFR. On June 24, 1988, OPM granted a retirement application effective on January 2, 1988, the date of the removal. MSPB denied the agency PFR on September 7, 1988. The appellant sought reinstatement and back pay. The agency sought to dismiss the PFR as mooted by the retirement. The Board declined to do so, reasoning that the retirement was predicated, in part, on the nature of the removal action. Once the removal was reversed, there was no basis for discontinued service retirement, so the retirement was invalid. The agency was directed to reinstate the appellant. Chairman Levinson, dissenting, argued that once OPM approved the retirement, subsequent events could not invalidate the retirement that was valid at the time of the OPM approval.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Twine v. DHHS</span>, 36 MSPR 388, 391-92 (1988), the employee was removed effective March 16 and a disability retirement application was granted retroactive to March 17. The appeal was not moot:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency did not indicate whether the appellant's records had been changed to show that his separation from the federal service was by disability retirement rather than by removal action. The agency informed the Board in a supplemental submission...that the removal action remains a part of the appellant's record, despite the granting of the disability retirement annuity by the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the effective date of the appellant's disability retirement occurred after the effective date of the agency's removal action. Unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Najjum</span> [post], whose disability retirement was retroactive to a date before the removal action, the appellant's separation from the federal service is by removal and not by disability retirement. Therefore, his removal action is not moot. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 12 MSPB 334, 14 MSPR 181, 184-85 (1982) (the agency did not effect a divestiture of the Board's jurisdiction over the appeal where although the appellant's removal was purportedly canceled when his application for disability retirement was granted, the agency made it clear that it did not intend to cancel the underlying decision to remove him).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee who voluntarily retired based on disability while an appeal of a demotion was pending was not entitled to rescind that retirement when he subsequently prevailed on the demotion appeal. <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 89-3193) (affirming <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. DOJ,</span> 39 MSPR 543 (1989)) ("As the board correctly recognized, however, a federal employee who voluntarily retires while an appeal of an adverse action is pending is not entitled to rescind that retirement if he subsequently prevails on that appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kestner v. Department of the Interior</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 772, 774-75 (1982); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. United States</span>, 591 F.2d 688, 690 (Ct. Cl. 1979)."). If the retirement application was granted after an adverse action was successfully appealed, the employee was then officially separated by disability retirement; that retirement could not be withdrawn, assuming that it was voluntarily initiated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Collier v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 38, 42 (1985) ("Appellant's voluntary retirement was a discrete, intervening factor limiting appellant's right to reinstatement. In this respect, we find it similar to a subsequent resignation or to an agency action which constitutes an independent basis for appeal to the Board and is not cancelled by a Board order reversing a preceding agency action.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The correlation between disability retirement and appellate jurisdiction was explored in <span class="Italic">Najjum v. GSA</span>, 27 MSPR 87 (1985). The appellant was removed for AWOL, but the initial decision of the Board reversed the removal. The agency filed a PFR, and during its pendency, the Board ordered OPM to grant appellant's application for disability retirement. The Board then asked the appellant to show cause why the initial appeal on the removal should not be vacated and the case dismissed as moot. The appellant opposed the dismissal, contending that he should receive the difference between his monthly disability pension and his monthly wage for the position he lost. The appellant argued that but for the agency's failure to accommodate his disabling condition, he could have continued working. The appeal was moot. Under the disability law then in effect, 5 USC 8331(6) (1980), the appellant proved that he was totally disabled for useful and efficient service in the grade or class of position last occupied by demonstrating entitlement to an annuity. The annuity was granted retroactive to a date preceding the removal. The Board reasoned that, because the appellant was effectively retired at the time of his removal, the removal did not become effective, therefore rendering the adverse action appeal moot. The Board discerned no basis for recovery on a discrimination claim, reasoning that an employee who is not ready, willing, and able to work is not entitled to pay. It also determined, however, that although a retirement application was granted and then became retroactive to a date preceding an appellant's removal, a question could exist concerning the effect of the OPM determination of disability as to allegations of disability discrimination.<span class="Italic"> But see</span> <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, CH07528110441 (Mar. 22, 1985) (unpublished order) (citing <span class="Italic">Watson v. United States</span>, No. 84-216 (D.D.C. Jan. 17, 1985) (also apparently unpublished) (grant of an employee's request for a disability retirement subsequent to removal did not preclude a challenge to removal based on disability discrimination)). <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> left uncertain the status of a mixed case appeal if retirement was granted retroactively. That issue was partially resolved, or disregarded, in <span class="Italic">Parrish v. Dept. of Army</span>, 28 MSPR 498, 499 (1985). The Board ignored the problem of racial discrimination allegations, dismissed the employee's appeal as mooted by what amounted to a retroactive grant of a disability retirement, and notified him of his right to file an appeal with the Federal Circuit; no advice of appeal rights was provided concerning EEOC or U.S. District Court. According to <span class="Italic">Parrish</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In previous opinions dealing with very similar fact patterns, the Board has held that because the disability retirement was effective retroactive to a date prior to the removal, the appeal of that removal became moot. <span class="Italic">Najjum v. General Services Administration</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 87 (1985); <span class="Italic">Sarginson v. Department of the Army</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 764 (1984) ("Since appellant was effectively retired at the time of his removal, the removal did not become effective and the instant appeal is moot")....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Parrish</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 125, 127 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...When the Office of Personnel Management grants an application for a disability retirement annuity to commence before the date of an employee's removal, the removal does not, in fact, become effective. Therefore, the Board has consistently dismissed employees' appeals of such removals as moot. <span class="Italic">See Parrish v. Department of the</span> Army, 28 MSPR 498 (1985); <span class="Italic">Najjum v. General Services Administration,</span> 27 MSPR 87 (1985); and <span class="Italic">Sarginson v.
