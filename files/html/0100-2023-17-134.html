<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-132"><span class="space">1.</span> Defining the Issue</h4>
<p class="noindent">If the parties stipulate their issue(s) to the arbitrator, FLRA holds the arbitrator to the course chosen by the parties. If, however, the parties cannot or decide not to agree on a stipulated issue and instead allow the arbitrator to frame the issue, FLRA defers to the arbitrator's reasonably chosen path. The parties need to carefully frame issues for the arbitrator. "In determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his or her authority, FLRA accords an arbitrator's interpretation of a stipulated issue the same substantial deference that it accords an arbitrator's interpretation and application of a collective bargaining agreement." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 712, 715 (2012). The letter from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service that notifies an arbitrator of his appointment to the case and provides a brief statement of the nature of the issue does not define the issue that will be submitted to the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Adjutant Gen., Oklahoma Air Nat'l Guard and AFGE, Will Rogers Air Nat'l Guard Local 3953</span>, 8 FLRA 112, 113 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator exceeds his authority by resolving an issue not submitted to arbitration, but an arbitrator does not exceed his authority when he resolves an issue or issues an affirmative order that is within the scope of the matter submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Honolulu Dist. Office and AFGE Nat'l INS Council</span>, 43 FLRA 927, 934-35 (1992) (remanding to arbitrator for clarification of basis for issuing affirmative order directing agency to rescind suspension and provide back pay).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See VA Pershing VAMC and AFGE Local 2338</span>, 72 FLRA 656 (2022) (Member Abbott concurring; Chairman DuBester dissenting in part) (sustaining an award mitigating a suspension but setting aside a finding of a WPA violation when whistleblowing reprisal was not part of the stipulated issue before the arbitrator and was not an issue that needed to be resolved to determine if just cause existed for the suspension).</p>
<p class="noindent">"Arbitrators exceed their authority when they fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregard specific limitations on their authority, or award relief to persons who are not encompassed within the grievance." <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA, Southern California Region</span>, 51 FLRA 993, 995 (1996); <span class="Italic">see Dept. of Army, Womack Army Med. Ctr. and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 65 FLRA 969, 974 (2011) ("the issue of the waiver of the money the grievant owed was not before the Arbitrator. Rather, the only issue before her was whether the promotion was proper. Therefore, by deciding an issue not submitted to arbitration, the Arbitrator exceeded her authority. <span class="Italic">See EPA</span>, 63 FLRA at 479 (the arbitrator exceeded his authority by considering a different issue after resolving the stipulated issue)."); <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE Local 3911,</span> 63 FLRA 476, 478-79 (2009) (arbitrator resolved stipulated issue; there was nothing more to decide and he exceeded his authority by addressing another claim raised by union);<span class="Italic"> Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 60 FLRA 584, 587 (2005) (when arbitrator clearly and unambiguously formulates issues before him, FLRA will set aside portion of award that orders remedy concerning issues not submitted; "this is not a case in which the manner in which the parties jointly argue the issue before the arbitrator expands the matters they are submitting to the arbitrator for resolution"); <span class="Italic">PTO and POPA</span>, 15 FLRA 990, 991-92 (1984) (as to a ground rules dispute with no submission agreement or stipulation of issues, the arbitrator has wide latitude and considerable discretion to resolve an impasse over ground rules).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 916, 919-20 (2010), described the arbitrator's authority to define the issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Authority will find that arbitrators exceed their authority when they resolve an issue that was not submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Mint, Denver, Colo.</span>, 60 FLRA 777, 779 (2005) (then-Member Pope dissenting as to application) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Mint</span>).

The grievances also did not request any remedy pertaining to newly hired CBPOs. The testimony of the Union's sole witness at the arbitration hearing never addressed the newly hired CBPOs. Likewise, the newly hired CBPOs were not addressed in any of the briefs that the parties submitted to the Arbitrator. In particular, in its post-hearing brief, the Union's arguments were directed solely to the Agency's alleged repudiation of various provisions of the legacy agreements that address "union institutional benefits[.]" In that brief, the Union set forth its understanding of the term "Union institutional benefits[,]" as used in the issue stipulation. The Union described these benefits as specific organizational benefits to the former exclusive representatives or procedures by which the former exclusive representatives and former agencies agreed to manage their relationships.<span class="Italic"> </span>The Union also identified the provisions of the legacy agreements allegedly repudiated as pertaining to official time, dues withholding, and agency-provided facilities and equipment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This record demonstrates a mutual understanding of the parties that the stipulated issue did not encompass newly hired CBPOs.&#x2003;In these circumstances, the parties did not authorize the Arbitrator to address the issue of the Agency's treatment of newly hired CBPOs. Moreover, it was not necessary for the Arbitrator to address the Agency's treatment of newly hired CBPOs to decide the stipulated issue, and the issue of the Agency treatment of newly hired CBPOs did not necessarily arise from the stipulated issue. Consequently, the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by deciding a matter that was not before him. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Mint</span>, 60 FLRA at 779-80; <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 34 FLRA at 1128.</p>

Here, the Arbitrator framed the relevant issue as, "[w]as the [MLA] between [the Agency] and [the Union] violated when the [Agency] moved [the grievants] from one building/warehouse to another and/or [were] the appropriate procedures followed to accomplish said move?" The Arbitrator determined that the relocations did not meet the definitions of reassignment or reorganization as provided by the MLA, but that the Agency had violated the parties' established past practice when relocating the grievants. As such, the Arbitrator resolved the issue that she framed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">DOJ </span>is misplaced. That case concerns exceptions claiming that an arbitrator exceeded his authority based on his award of relief to non-grievants, which is not the case here. <span class="Italic">DOJ, </span>17 FLRA at 278. Here, the Arbitrator decided and remedied only the issue as she framed it. As we defer to the Arbitrator's formulation of the issue, and as the Arbitrator resolved the issue accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator did not exceed her authority in this regard and deny the Agency's exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the award is deficient because "the [A]rbitrator improperly failed to address whether the [A]gency's action was an unfair labor practice." We view this as a contention that the award is deficient because the Arbitrator exceeded her authority. Arbitrators exceed their authority when, among other things, they fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE Local 1367, </span>60 FLRA 187, 190 (2004)<span class="Italic"> </span>(Chairman Cabaniss dissenting).<span class="Italic"> </span>In this case, we agree with the Union that the Arbitrator did not address whether the Agency's actions constituted unfair labor practices under the Statute. However, we conclude that<span class="Italic"> </span>the Union fails to establish that in not addressing whether the Agency committed any unfair labor practices, the Arbitrator exceeded her authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties in this case were unable to stipulate the issues for resolution.&#x2003;After reviewing the parties' proposed statements of issues, the Arbitrator found that "[a]t the heart of this case is a dispute over the interpretation and application of the language of the Parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement." Accordingly, the Arbitrator framed the issues in this case, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Did the Agency violate the Collective Bargaining Agreement when it issued a new smoking policy...?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If so, what should the remedy be?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award is precisely a resolution of these issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, the Arbitrator properly confined herself to determining whether the Agency violated the agreement. In the absence of a stipulation that also included the issue of whether the Agency committed any unfair labor practices, the Arbitrator was not obligated to address and resolve whether the Agency's actions violated the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 1367, </span>60 FLRA<span class="Italic"> </span>at 190 (where, in the absence of a stipulation of issues by the parties, the arbitrator framed the issue in terms of a violation of the collective bargaining agreement, the arbitrator was not obligated to address whether the agency's actions violated law). Moreover, because the Arbitrator was not obligated to address and resolve whether the Agency's actions violated the Statute, the Union's claim that the Agency's conduct constituted unfair labor practices provides no basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(Authority determined that union failed to show how award confined to interpreting the parties' agreement was contrary to law).</p>
<p class="noindent">In its reconsideration decision, <span class="Italic">ACT New York State Council and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau New York Div.</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-134.html">61 FLRA 664</a>, 664-66 (2006), FLRA declined to create a special rule governing ULP issues that arise in arbitration if the parties do not stipulate the issue:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2003, the New York State Clean Indoor Air Act was amended to prohibit smoking indoors in the workplace. As a result, the Adjutant General of the New York Army and Air National Guard issued a new smoking policy that prohibited smoking in all facilities occupied by the New York Army and Air National Guard. The Union filed a grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties were unable to stipulate the issues for resolution by the Arbitrator.&#x2003;While noting the Union's allegation that the Agency's "action was an unfair labor practice[,]" the Arbitrator determined that "[a]t the heart of this case is a dispute over the interpretation and application of the language of the Parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement." Accordingly, in framing the issue to be resolved in the absence of a stipulation of the issue by the parties, the Arbitrator framed the issue as only a contractual one: whether the Agency violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement when it issued a new smoking policy and, if so, what should the remedy be. The Arbitrator denied the grievance. She found that the Agency did not violate the parties' collective bargaining agreement when it issued the new smoking policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed two exceptions to the award, and the Authority denied both exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Union contended that the award was deficient because "the arbitrator improperly failed to address whether the agency's action was an unfair labor practice." 60 FLRA at 891 (quoting Exceptions at 8). The Authority viewed this contention as a claim that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority by failing to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration. The Authority ruled that the Arbitrator did not fail to resolve an issue submitted. In this regard, the Authority concluded that as the parties did not stipulate that this case involved an unfair labor practice claim, the Arbitrator was not obligated to address and resolve whether the Agency's actions violated the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Because the Arbitrator was not obligated to address and resolve whether the Agency's actions violated the Statute, the Authority found that the Union's claim that the Agency's conduct constituted an unfair labor practice provided no basis for finding the award deficient. Accordingly, the Authority denied this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its motion for reconsideration, the Union does not directly challenge the Authority's practice of deferring to an arbitrator's formulation of the issues to be decided, in the absence of the parties' stipulation of the issues. Instead, the Union argues that the failure of the Arbitrator and the Authority to decide the unfair labor practice claims in this case was contrary to &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute. In the Union's view, &#x00A7; 7116(d) provides the Union not only with a unilateral right to raise unfair labor practice allegations under a negotiated grievance procedure, but also entitles it to a resolution of those allegations by the arbitrator along with a right of review of the award by both the Authority and a United States court of appeals to determine whether the resolution of the allegations was consistent with the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we reject this claim and conclude that &#x00A7; 7116(d) does not provide a basis for reconsidering the application of the Authority's practice of deferring to an arbitrator's formulation of the issues for resolution in the absence of a stipulation, even where a party alleges an unfair labor practice before the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority has repeatedly acknowledged, &#x00A7; 7116(d) is an election-of-remedy provision and its purpose and effect is to prevent relitigation of an issue in another forum after a selection of forum in which to raise the issue has been made by the aggrieved party. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Council 170, Local 2128, </span>58 FLRA 316, 317 (2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons</span>, 18 FLRA 314, 316 (1985)). By its language, &#x00A7; 7116(d) confirms that issues that can properly be raised as an unfair labor practice or as a grievance may in the discretion of the aggrieved party be raised under the negotiated grievance procedure or the statutory unfair labor practice procedure, but not under both procedures. It is similar to other choice-of-forum provisions in the Statute, such as &#x00A7; 7121(d).[2] The essential feature of these choice-of-forum provisions in the Statute is the confirmation that certain claims can be pursued under a negotiated grievance procedure or another statutory procedure and that aggrieved parties must choose only one procedure under which to pursue their claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Section 7121(d) provides that complaints of employment discrimination that are not excluded from the applicable negotiated grievance procedure may be raised as a grievance or as a statutory equal employment opportunity complaint, but not both</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has pointed to no wording in the Statute or other authority establishing that in addition to mandating an election of forums for the purpose of preventing relitigation, &#x00A7; 7116(d) also mandates a merits resolution of the unfair labor practice allegation by the arbitrator if a grievance is filed, as well as Authority and judicial review of the resolution of the allegation. We note, in this regard, that if an aggrieved party elects under &#x00A7; 7116(d) to file an unfair labor practice charge with the Authority and the Authority's General Counsel determines that an unfair labor practice issue is not presented and decides not to issue a complaint, <span id="page_1900"></span>then &#x00A7; 7116(d) does not entitle the party to a resolution by the Authority of whether an unfair labor practice was committed. Thus, adopting the Union's approach would provide those who chose to use the grievance procedure, rather than the procedures of &#x00A7; 7118 of the Statute, to litigate alleged unfair labor practices with an inequitable advantage. This same inequity would extend to judicial review by a United States court of appeals under &#x00A7; 7123 of the Statute,[3] which is not available with respect to a determination of the General Counsel that no unfair labor practice was presented. <span class="Italic">See Turgeon v. FLRA, </span>677 F.2d 937 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (a determination not to issue an unfair labor practice complaint is not reviewable by the Authority and generally is not reviewable by a court).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Section 7123(a) provides that the Authority's decision resolving exceptions to an arbitration award under &#x00A7; 7122 of the Statute is not judicially reviewable "unless the order involves an unfair labor practice under &#x00A7; 7118[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Without any textual or other support for the Union's argument that &#x00A7; 7116(d) requires arbitrators to always address and resolve alleged unfair labor practice allegations that a party may raise, we decline to impose such a requirement. Instead, in our view, aggrieved parties elect the forum as it is constituted under the provisions of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, no other basis has been established for fashioning a special rule under the Statute solely for unfair labor practice allegations submitted to arbitration. That is, we see no basis for treating such allegations different from other contrary-to-law allegations, or any grievable issue for that matter. Under the definition of grievance set forth in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9) of the Statute, claims based on alleged violations of law, as well as claims based on other grounds, are all grievable under the Statute. The Union provides no basis on which to support its contention that statutory unfair labor practice grievances warrant special consideration under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv.</span>, 63 FLRA 198, 200-01 (2009), determined it was appropriate for the arbitrator to frame and resolve an issue even though the union cast its arguments in statutory rather than contract terms:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrators exceed their authority when they fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Ashland, Ky.</span>, 58 FLRA 137, 139 (2002). In assessing whether an arbitrator failed to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration in cases where the parties do not stipulate the issue for resolution, the Authority accords the arbitrator's formulation of the issue to be decided the same substantial deference that the Authority accords an arbitrator's interpretation and application of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>When the formulation of the issue is not unreasonable and the award is directly responsive to the formulated issue, the Authority denies exceptions contending that arbitrators exceeded their authority by failing to resolve an issue submitted. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE Local 3134</span>, 56 FLRA 1055, 1056 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties in this case did not stipulate the issues for resolution.&#x2003;Accordingly, the Arbitrator formulated the issue. The Union does not contend that the Arbitrator's formulation of the issue was unreasonable or that the award is not directly responsive to the issue as the Arbitrator formulated it. Instead, the Union argues that it had a "statutory right" to a resolution of its claims that the Agency committed ULPs and violated the ground rules agreement and understanding on negotiations. As noted by the Agency, the Authority specifically rejected such an argument in <span class="Italic">ACT </span>and<span class="Italic"> ACT II</span>. In particular, in <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, the Authority noted that the parties failed to stipulate the issues for resolution, that the arbitrator framed the merits issue as whether the agency violated the collective bargaining agreement, and that, in her award, the arbitrator resolved precisely this issue. 60 FLRA at 891. In these circumstances, the Authority concluded that the arbitrator was not obligated to address and resolve whether the agency committed ULPs. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Subsequently, the Authority denied the Union's motion for reconsideration, which contended that the failure of the arbitrator to resolve the ULP claims was contrary to the Statute. <span class="Italic">ACT II</span>, 61 FLRA at 665-66.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons set forth in greater detail in <span class="Italic">ACT II</span>, we reject the Union's arguments. Consistent with precedent, we defer to the Arbitrator's formulation of the issue for resolution and deny this exception. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 3134, </span>56 FLRA at 1056.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l VA Council 53 and VAMC Reno</span>, 67 FLRA 415, 416 (2014) ("Thus, as we defer to the Arbitrator's formulation of the issue, and because the issue that the Union claims the Arbitrator failed to resolve is not the issue that he framed, we find that the Arbitrator did not exceed his authority, and we deny the Union's exception."); <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 215 and SSA ODAR</span>, 66 FLRA 771, 774 (2012) ("The Union contends that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority by failing to address whether the Agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a) of the Statute.

In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the Authority concluded that the arbitrator was not obligated to address and resolve whether the agency committed ULPs under &#x00A7; 7116(a) of the Statute where the parties failed to stipulate the issues for resolution and the arbitrator framed and resolved the merits issue as whether the agency violated the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 200.").</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA will not give much credence to an argument that, the parties having asked the arbitrator to frame an issue, he exceeded his authority by adjudicating a particular issue one party felt went beyond the open-ended submission to the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 3412</span>, 24 FLRA 442, 444-45 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">The parties may stipulate an issue, and the arbitrator still retains discretion to determine the remedial authority inherent in the stipulation, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and POPA</span>, 60 FLRA 869, 878-79 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrators exceed their authority when they resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration, fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, disregard specific limitations on their authority, or award relief to persons who are not encompassed by the grievance. Arbitrators do not exceed their authority by addressing any issue that necessarily arises from issues specifically included in a stipulation of issues. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Indian Head Div., </span>60 FLRA 530, 532 (2004) (<span class="Italic">Naval Surface Warfare Ctr.</span>). In addition, the Authority, like the federal courts, accords an arbitrator's interpretation of a stipulation of issues the same substantial deference accorded an arbitrator's interpretation and application of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Air Force Space Division, Los Angeles Air Force Station, Calif., </span>24 FLRA 516, 518 (1986). Similarly, both the Authority and federal courts have consistently emphasized the broad discretion to be accorded arbitrators in determining what remedies are appropriate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., </span>60 FLRA at 532.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Clearly, a stipulation of issues or submission agreement is well suited to the definition or specification of an arbitrator's remedial authority. <span class="Italic">See </span>Marvin F. Hill, Jr. &#x0026; Anthony V. Sinicropi<span class="Italic">, Remedies in Arbitration</span> 65 (2d ed. 1991) (<span class="Italic">Remedies</span>). In fact, to avoid litigation on remedial authority, many arbitrators make it a practice to have the parties stipulate to their view of the arbitrator's remedial authority. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>The remedy power<span class="Italic"> </span>in arbitration has often been considered from two standpoints: (1) whether the arbitrator has the power to issue a remedy; and (2) whether an ordered remedy is deficient in a particular case. <span class="Italic">See Elkouri &#x0026; Elkouri, How Arbitration Works </span>390 (Marlin M. Volz &#x0026; Edward P. Groggin eds., 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In<span class="Italic"> Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel and Car Corp., </span>363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960), the Supreme Court addressed the remedial power of arbitrators and observed that when arbitrators are commissioned to interpret and apply collective bargaining agreements, they are expected to bring their informed judgment to bear in order to reach a fair solution of the grievance presented. Consequently, parties typically go to arbitration to resolve disputes and obtain remedies, as appropriate; they typically do not go to arbitration for declaratory judgments. Although the power to formulate a remedy seems implicit in an arbitrator's authority to resolve a dispute, any stipulation of the parties must be examined because the parties are free to revise that authority by a carefully drafted submission agreement. <span class="Italic">See Remedies </span>at 66.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the parties stipulated the following issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Do the parties have a term agreement?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Did Management repudiate that agreement?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;If the Parties have a term collective bargaining agreement, are the ground rules for mid-term bargaining contained in Article 14 binding for the term of the agreement?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In their stipulation, the parties specified the issues for resolution. They did not expressly address their view of the Arbitrator's remedial authority. The Agency contends that the Arbitrator was not authorized to issue a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy because his remedial authority was implicitly limited to the Article 14 ground rules. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the stipulated issues, the Arbitrator found that the parties have a collective bargaining agreement and that the Agency repudiated the agreement. Once the Arbitrator made these findings, the issue of the Arbitrator's remedial authority necessarily arose from the parties' failure to stipulate to the Arbitrator's authority and necessitated the Arbitrator's interpretation of the stipulation. Implicit in the award is the Arbitrator's determination that the stipulation authorized him to award a remedy for the Agency's repudiation of the agreement. Granting substantial deference to this interpretation of the stipulation, per <span class="Italic">Naval Surface Warfare Ctr.</span>, we reject the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator was not authorized to award a remedy for the repudiation of the agreement or that the third stipulated issue confined his remedial authority to Article 14. In addition, because the discretion to fashion a remedy is accorded the Arbitrator, he was not confined in determining the effective date of the agreement to choosing a date asserted by either party.</p>
<p class="noindent">If it is clear from the award and the record that the issue before the arbitrator is addressed and resolved, regardless of how it is phrased in the award, then there is no basis for a finding that the arbitrator exceeded his authority. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 5 FLRA 258, 261 (1981). An arbitrator will be permitted to extend his award to "issues that necessarily arise from the issues specifically <span id="page_1901"></span>included in a submission agreement or the arbitrator's formulation of the issues submitted in the absence of a stipulation by the parties." <span class="Italic">Air Force Space Div., Los Angeles Air Force Station and AFGE Local 2429</span>, 24 FLRA 516, 519 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award will not be overturned because an arbitrator examines a particular provision in the agreement that was not relied on by the union and that results in a determination against the union on the grievance. Although an award may be set aside if the arbitrator exceeds his authority by deciding an issue not included in the subject matter submitted to arbitration, the award is not deficient because the arbitrator looked at the agreement as a whole as an aid in interpreting the specific provision before him to determine if that provision had been violated. <span class="Italic">Fed. Aviation Science and Tech. Ass'n Local No. 291 and FAA, Ft. Worth Air Route Traffic Control Ctr., Southwest Region</span>, 3 FLRA 545, 548 (1980). Unless there is a submission agreement or a specific exclusion in the contract, the statutory definition of a grievance is broad, and it encompasses, for example, violations of agency regulations. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Louisville Dist. and NTEU</span>, 36 FLRA 375, 380 (1990) (regulations concerning selections for vacant positions; FPM did not preclude grievances involving nonselections). Issues submitted to the arbitrator may be broadly construed. When one of the issues submitted was whether the grievance was arbitrable, the arbitrator properly considered the timeliness of a grievance involving events spanning a period of six years. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-100 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Submarine Base, New London</span>, 51 FLRA 1500, 1503 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">Distinguished from an issue decided that was not identified in the grievance or by stipulation or by determination of the arbitrator is an argument raised in arbitration concerning a designated issue, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 3307</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-171.html">71 FLRA 895</a>, 897 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
