<p class="Block-Quote1">Evidence that a letter was sealed, properly addressed, and deposited in the mail stream with postage prepaid gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the letter reached the addres<span class="Italic">see</span> in due course of the mails. <span class="Italic">Foust v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 80 MSPR 477 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (1998), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> No. 99-3140, 1999 WL 232029 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 25, 1999) (Table). The presumption is invoked by direct evidence, which may consist of a document or testimony from someone who "'actually saw, heard, or touched the subject of questioning.'" <span class="Italic">Walsh v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 MSPR 494, 498 (1998) (citation omitted). If this presumption is invoked, the opposing party must provide evidence sufficient to rebut it. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 500-01. We find that Mrs. Enzian's affidavit constitutes documentary evidence sufficient to invoke the presumption that a signed SF-2801 was mailed to OPM on March 8, 1994, and that it reached OPM in the due course of the mails. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. We also find that OPM has not rebutted the presumption. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Foust v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 80 MSPR 477, 480 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8 (1998), relied on in <span class="Italic">Enzian</span>, stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge stated, evidence that a letter was sealed, properly addressed, and deposited in the U.S. Mail with postage prepaid gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the letter reached the addres<span class="Italic">see</span> in due course of the mails<span class="Italic">. See</span>...<span class="Italic">Stracquatanio v. Walkama</span>, 54 MSPR 529, 532 (1992)). Direct evidence, however, is required to invoke the presumption of delivery and receipt<span class="Italic">. Pogue v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 41 MSPR 693, 697 (1989). Direct evidence may be in the form of a document or testimony<span class="Italic">. Walsh v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 MSPR 494, 498 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the agency's sworn affidavit is sufficient evidence to raise the presumption of delivery and receipt. We do not, however, agree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to provide sufficient evidence to rebut the agency's presumption. The appellant made a sworn declaration that she did not receive the decision letter until May 4, 1998, and further certified to the truthfulness of this statement when she signed her name on the appeal form<span class="Italic">. See Ford v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 MSPR 73, 76 (1995) (Board considered appellant's signature on appeal form as evidence of the truthfulness of her claim that her untimeliness was due to the delayed delivery of the Office of Personnel Management's reconsideration decision); <span class="Italic">Connelly v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 35 MSPR 614, 616 (1987) (Board found appellant's claim that he did not receive the initial decision until a certain date was corroborated by his affidavit and an undated letter). With her petition for review, the appellant submits a letter stating that she "did not receive [the] removal papers until [she] came back to work and [her] union steward went to Labor Management Relations, in which they said they had mailed [her] a copy." She states, however, that the letter was mailed to an old P.O. Box rather than her new address, an address which her manager allegedly had a copy of in her employee folder. The agency has not rebutted the appellant's argument that it had a copy of her new address.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the address used on the removal decision letter, as well as the proposed removal notice, is that of the appellant's place of employment. There is no evidence of mailing to the address of record as asserted in the agency's affidavit. Although the record does not reflect whether the appellant was on duty from March 23, 1998 (the date the decision letter was allegedly mailed) to May 4, 1998, the agency has not alleged that the appellant should have received the decision letter earlier at her place of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the totality of the record, we find that the appellant has submitted sufficient evidence to overcome the agency's presumption of delivery and receipt.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...When a nonfrivolous allegation is made that OPM has not sent the mandatory notice as required by statute, the burden of going forward (or the burden of production) falls to OPM. The statute itself supports this statement, for it is the statute that places the initial burden on OPM to send the statutorily mandated notice of election rights to retirees. Further, OPM carries the ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue [of] whether it sent the mandatory notice. OPM's ability to show that it sent the statutorily mandated notice is an essential element of its case. In addition, OPM is in a position to have knowledge of the particular facts necessary to support its position that it sent notice.[26] The Board's statement that Mrs. Brush did not show that notice was not sent places the burden of production on the wrong party. The Board's statement is contrary to common sense. The burden cannot be upon the petitioner in the first instance to prove a negative. OPM presumably has access to the pertinent records, as well as to the people who deal with those records. Thus, the ultimate burden must be on OPM to show that the notice was actually sent.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with the statutory mandate, OPM must show two things when attempting to prove that it has met its burden of providing retirees with the notice here in issue. First, OPM must attempt to prove that the notice was actually sent. Such evidence must be more than a bare allegation that notice was sent.[27] Second, OPM must offer proof as to the contents of the annual notice. This must be so, because the statute clearly directs OPM to notify annuitants of all elections available under sections 8339(j) and (k)(2).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the event that OPM is able to establish through credible evidence that it is more probable than not that the annual notice was sent, the burden of going forward falls upon the petitioner. The petitioner, if able to do so, must put forth such credible testimony or other evidence tending to support the contention that the annuitant in question did not receive the annual notice. The Board must then decide whether it will credit the applicant's testimony, and whether that testimony overcomes the presumption that the notice was received.[29] As in other cases before the Board, evidence regarding the annuitant's conduct (in this case, Mr. Brush) is probative evidence regarding the question whether the annuitant would have made the election in question.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Although "direct evidence" is required to establish the components of mailing necessary for the presumption of receipt to operate, the Board has relied on a second presumption that a government official properly sealed and stamped an envelope and placed it, or caused it to be placed, into the U.S. mails on the date stated by the official. This presumption is based on the notion that public officials, at least those with no stake in the outcome of a case, are presumed to do their jobs properly and in good faith.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Pfaff v.

Id</span>. In another case, the Board found that no presumption of delivery arose where the appellant presented uncontradicted testimony that her husband told her he had written to OPM to notify OPM of his election of a survivor annuity, but she could not provide any particulars showing that the election was placed in an envelope that was properly sealed, stamped, addressed, and mailed to OPM<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Standing alone, the appellants' evidence of mailing is insufficient to raise the presumption of receipt in due course. Ms. Statum did affirmatively state in her letter to Susan Stracquatanio that she mailed the SF-2808 to OPM, at the correct address, on August 5, 1989. This assertion is supported by Ms. Statum's contemporaneous worksheet notation that she forwarded the form to OPM on that date for appropriate action. Neither of these documents, however, specifically indicates that the letter to OPM was properly sealed or stamped, nor do they include any particulars as to how and where the letter was placed into the United States mails.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite these deficiencies, the instant case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Pogue</span> and <span class="Italic">Harris</span> in that the letter to OPM was mailed by a government official, not by a private citizen. We therefore have occasion to consider a second presumption--that public officials are presumed to do their jobs properly and in good faith<span class="Italic">. See Griffin v. Department of the Army</span>, 23 MSPR 657, 662 n.4 (1984). If Ms. Statum was performing her job properly and in good faith on August 5, 1989, when she says she mailed the designation form to OPM, there is thus a basis for presuming that she properly sealed and stamped the envelope, and that she placed it or caused it to be placed into the United States mails on that date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although using one presumption to prove the facts necessary to establish a second presumption is generally to be avoided,[10] we think it is appropriate to do so here. Unlike the appellants or the intervenor, Ms. Statum had no personal stake in the outcome of this appeal, and had no discernible motive to say that she mailed the SF-2808 to OPM on August 5, 1989, if she did not in fact do so. In addition, we are troubled by OPM's practice of discarding the envelopes containing designation of beneficiary forms. These envelopes would in most instances contain all the information necessary to establish--or refute--the presumption of receipt in due course, without resort to other evidence or another presumption, because they would show the address, postage, and postmark date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;A leading treatise states that "[T]heoretically, there is no reason why the basic facts of a presumption cannot be proved...by the use of another presumption...." <span class="Italic">McCormick on Evidence</span> 344, at 973 n.3 (Edward W. Cleary ed., 3d ed. 1984). It notes, however, that a presumption is, by definition, a standardized inference, and that using one presumption to establish a second presumption runs counter to the "rule" that an inference may not be based upon another inference. It states that the response to this is that the "rule" cited should not be viewed as a rule at all, but rather as a warning against the use of inferences that are too remote or speculative<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. For the reasons discussed below, we do not believe the inference here is too remote or speculative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellants established that the SF-2808 executed on July 25, 1989, was mailed to OPM on August 5, 1989, and that the document can therefore be presumed to have been received by OPM "in due course of the mails." A letter mailed that date from one Federal agency in Washington, D.C., to another Federal agency in Washington, D.C., would have been received in "due course" well before August 21, 1989<span class="Italic">. See Smith v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 789 F.2d 1540, 1542 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (even today, 16 days is far more than the "due course of the mails"); 5 CFR 1201.4(1) (if no legible postmark date appears on a mailing to the Board, a submission is presumed to have been mailed five days before its receipt).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next consider whether OPM's August 25, 1989, date stamp on the designation form in question was sufficient to rebut the presumption of receipt in due course. In <span class="Italic">Legille v. Dann</span>, 544 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir. 1976), the court found that the Patent Office successfully rebutted a presumption of timely receipt in due course where its date stamp was supported by evidence that its mail-handling procedures were designed to ensure that all parcels of mail were stamped with the date of actual receipt.[12] Unlike the case in <span class="Italic">Legille</span>, however, OPM has not presented evidence that its procedures are designed to ensure that the date stamp placed on incoming mail is the date of actual receipt.[13] Because OPM date stamps mail only after the mail has been routed from its main mail room to the appropriate processing office, its date stamp is only an approximation of the actual delivery date. We therefore find that OPM has not rebutted the presumption of receipt in due course, and that the SF-2808 naming the appellants as beneficiaries of a lump-sum benefit was received by OPM before Mr. Isaacson's death on August 21, 1989.</p>

Although the decisions of the former U.S. Court of Claims are binding precedent for the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and hence for the Board, unless overruled by the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">see South Corporation v. United States</span>, 690 F.2d 1368, 1370-71 (Fed.

We need not decide whether <span class="Italic">Charlson</span> represents binding precedent, however, because the evidence regarding OPM's mail-handling procedures does not rise to the level found sufficient to rebut the presumption of timely receipt in <span class="Italic">Legille</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge found that because there were no witnesses to the actual mailing, there was no direct evidence to invoke the presumption of receipt. However, contrary to the administrative judge, we find that the evidence of record does contain direct evidence of mailing. Although Walsh is deceased and cannot provide testimony that he mailed the letter before the filing deadline, the appellant testified that prior to the filing deadline, she saw her husband leave the house with a stamped envelope addressed to OPM. She further testified that, although she did not read the letter, her husband said that it was a simple one page letter stating that he had remarried and that he was requesting a survivor annuity for her. Even though the administrative judge found no evidence that the postage on the envelope was sufficient, the appellant testified that she clearly remembers looking at the envelope and verifying that it was "properly" stamped, addressed to OPM, and had their return address boldly marked on it. She also testified that the envelope was not returned to them. Based on this testimony, the direct evidence establishes that the envelope was properly addressed and stamped. Thus, the administrative judge's finding in this regard was incorrect<span class="Italic">. Pogue v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 41 MSPR 693, 697 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, Walsh stated in his petition for appeal that, prior to the expiration of the two-year filing period, he mailed a letter requesting a survivor annuity. He asserted that he waited a reasonable period of time and then telephoned OPM to follow up on his request, at which time he was informed by OPM that it had no record of his letter. He stated further that he mailed a second letter, but it was late. Walsh also asserted that OPM committed "harmful procedural error" by not acknowledging receipt of his first letter which caused him to miss the filing deadline.</p>

Further, his statements, if believed, are direct evidence that he mailed a letter requesting a survivor annuity prior to the filing deadline, i.e., Walsh asserted the specific words which constituted the precise fact to be proved and no inference is necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has provided corroborating evidence to support Walsh's statements that he mailed the letter in a timely fashion. Specifically, the record includes the uncontroverted testimony of two witnesses who were told by Walsh that he had mailed a request for a survivor annuity to OPM within the time limit for doing so, and that he was concerned that OPM had not yet reduced his annuity to provide for it. As noted by the administrative judge, Helen Douglas testified that, in late March or early April 1995, she heard Mr. Walsh say that he had elected a survivor annuity for his wife, but was concerned because he had not received confirmation of that election from OPM. The administrative judge also described the testimony of Sandra J. Baker, who stated that Mr. Walsh told her in March 1995 that he had written a letter the month before requesting that his annuity be reduced to provide a survivor benefit for the appellant, but that he was anxious because he had not received a reply. Although such evidence may be hearsay evidence, the Board has long held that hearsay evidence is admissible in its administrative proceedings<span class="Italic">. Langford v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 73 MSPR 129, 139 (1997); <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Department of Justice</span>, 5 MSPR 77, 83-87 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, Walsh's conduct prior to his death is consistent with a finding that he timely mailed his election to OPM. The evidence of record includes a dated telephone bill reflecting a long distance call from Walsh's address to the OPM retirement information telephone number. As the administrative judge found, the telephone bill was "uncontroverted evidence of record" reflecting that Walsh "eventually contacted OPM by telephone regarding this matter on June 26, 1995, and was told that there was no record of his election of a survivor annuity for the appellant." In response to this telephone call, Walsh wrote to OPM two days later again requesting survivor benefits for his wife. When that request was found to be untimely, he appealed to the Board. It was while this appeal was pending that he died. These actions are consistent with his statements in his petition for appeal and with the corroborating testimony, and show that this is not a case of an after-the-fact attempt by a surviving spouse to obtain a benefit not intended by the deceased employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, based on the specific circumstances of this case, the appellant has established a rebuttable presumption that Walsh effected an election of a survivor annuity prior to April 7, 1995, by showing that the letter was properly sealed, stamped, addressed, and deposited in the United States mails and therefore presumed to reach OPM and be received by it in due course of the mails<span class="Italic">. Reynolds</span>, 63 MSPR at 193.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once evidence of mailing is produced, the presumption of mailing is rebutted only through probative evidence demonstrating that an item was likely not mailed, as <span class="Italic">Walsh</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, explained, 77 MSPR at 500-01:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next consider whether OPM's denial of receipt of an election of survivor annuity is sufficient to rebut the presumption of receipt in due course. Presumption has been defined as "a rule of law, statutory or judicial, by which finding of a basic fact gives rise to existence of a presumed fact, until presumption is rebutted." <span class="Italic">Wilner v. United States</span>, 24 F.3d 1397, 1411 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Bennett, dissenting), quoting <span class="Italic">Black's Law</span> <span class="Italic">Dictionary</span> 1185 (6th ed. 1990). Further, it has been found that a presumption "can only be destroyed or overcome by convincing and uncontradicted evidence to the contrary which clearly and distinctly establishes a fact so that reasonable minds can draw but one inference." <span class="Italic">Charlson Realty Company v. United States</span>, 384 F.2d 434, 444 (Ct. Cl. 1967). To "overcome the strong presumption of the arrival of a letter in due course of the mails, the countervailing evidence must show the contrary to be true by direct and positive proof of affirmative facts." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this connection, the Board has found that lesser evidence is required to raise a presumption of due delivery and receipt than is required to overcome that or a similar presumption<span class="Italic">. Blue</span>, 65 MSPR at 375.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, OPM provides no evidence to support its assertion that Walsh did not file a timely request for a survivor annuity for the appellant. Although the record evidence includes an affidavit from OPM officials that sets forth its routine business practice of mailing notices that advise annuitants of the deadline for requesting survivor annuities, OPM did not provide any evidence of its business practice with regard to the receipt of mail. OPM's bare assertion, that the appellant is not entitled to a survivor annuity because the record does not include a timely filed request, fails to meet the requirements for overcoming the presumption of receipt. Accordingly, we find that Mr. Walsh filed a timely election of survivor benefits for the appellant with OPM. OPM's reconsideration decision therefore is not sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1513"></span>The Federal Circuit was critical of the use of presumptions in cases involving timeliness of Board appeals--particularly when the appellant is not allowed a fair chance to rebut the presumptions imposed by the AJ, <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. MSPB</span>, 75 F.3d 639, 646-47 (Fed. Cir. 1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, it was not until the AJ's Order entering dismissal that the appellant could know that the AJ simply presumed the appealed decision was received by the employee five days after the date it bears. We reject the AJ's reliance on a double-barreled presumption: first, that a decision is mailed on the date it was signed and, second, that it was received by the employee within five days. Appellant then was cut off from attacking the AJ's presumption because the AJ had closed the record. Dismissal because of failure to anticipate with exactitude the problems and solutions in the mind of the AJ is not the process which is due an appellant. The AJ should have at least afforded Hamilton a further opportunity to reply.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's contention on petition for review that he did not receive the administrative judge's timeliness show-cause order is not sworn, or in affidavit form, it is not evidence. <span class="Italic">See Gerber v.

Nor has the appellant provided any other evidence to support this contention. <span class="Italic">See Gerber</span>, 57 MSPR at 575; <span class="Italic">Vincent</span>, 32 MSPR at 269. We therefore find that the appellant has failed to rebut the presumption of due delivery and receipt....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Caponio v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 73 MSPR 671, 679 (1997) (citing decisions for the proposition that a "general, unsworn statement of an agency individual with no firsthand knowledge of the facts asserted was insufficient evidence to show that notification was sent").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant's signed appeal, disclaiming receipt of an adverse action proposal notice, when coupled with the agency's failure to prove delivery of certified mail, rebutted the presumption of mailing of that notice that arose from an agency's mail log (or testimony concerning the agency's mailing practices), <span class="Italic">Geier v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 90 MSPR 186, 189-90 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]ssuming for the sake of analysis that the mail log and the appellant's stipulation were sufficient to invoke the presumption of receipt in due course of the mails, the appellant has rebutted that presumption in favor of the agency. Specifically, the appellant explicitly stated in his petition for appeal that he never received the proposal letter.... He certified to the truthfulness of these statements when he signed the appeal form, and the statements must therefore be given weight. <span class="Italic">Foust v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 477 &#x00B6; 6 (1998) (giving weight to statement in appeal form, which the appellant certified to be true by signing, concerning the date she received a letter), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 194 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table). We also note that, although the appellant promptly responded in August 1999 when he was first contacted by investigators in the Employee Tax Compliance Program, he did not respond to the notice of proposed removal. In addition, the agency's mail log shows that the notice was sent by certified mail, yet the agency offered no proof of delivery. It is unclear whether the agency requested a return receipt. However, even so, according to the U.S. Postal Service web site, certified mail "[p]rovides the sender with a mailing receipt. A delivery record is maintained by the USPS."<span class="Italic">...</span> Thus, even if the agency did not request a return receipt, it could have produced a copy of the delivery record maintained by the U.S. Postal Service to establish delivery. <span class="Italic">See Douglass v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 54, 57 (1996) (in finding that the agency failed to prove that a reconsideration decision was delivered to the appellant, the Board noted that the agency did not present a certified mail receipt or affidavit to show that the decision was delivered to the appellant); <span class="Italic">Ford v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 73, 76 (1995) (noting that the agency did not submit any evidence to controvert the appellant's claim of delayed delivery even though it very likely had in its possession the only documentary evidence of the delivery date).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's statements in his appeal form that he did not receive the notice of proposed removal, coupled with the circumstantial evidence of non-receipt (the appellant did not respond to the notice and the agency did not produce evidence of delivery), were sufficient to overcome the presumption of receipt in due course of the mails, assuming that it would be proper to invoke the presumption in the first place. Accordingly, we find that the appellant never received the notice of proposed removal prior to being removed....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Dean v. OPM</span>, 93 MSPR 520, 524 n.2 (2003) (OPM's contemporaneous business records were sufficient to invoke the presumption of mailing and receipt of the item mailed).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant notifies the agency of an address change, the presumption of proper mailing and receipt of a document is inapplicable if the agency does not demonstrate that it properly used the later address. <span class="Italic">Baker v. Dept. of Navy,</span> SE-0752-92-0220-X-1 (NP 5/26/2011), addressed a change of address involving a petition for enforcement of a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency first argues that the petition for enforcement is untimely as it should be presumed that the appellant received the mailed copy of the SF-50 in 1992. The agency asserts that its normal practice would have been to send the appellant a copy of the SF-50 documenting the fact of his resignation, that the SF-50 was signed on October 2, 1992, and mailed sometime thereafter to the appellant at the address of record, 123 Redwind Drive, Sequim, Washington, and that the address of record should be presumed correct. Given the date of the SF-50, the agency argues that it was error for the administrative judge to rely on the appellant's assertion that he changed addresses four times between December 11, 1989, and October 2, 1992, as a change of address during those periods would not be relevant. The agency also questions the veracity of the appellant's statement that he did not recall <span class="Italic">seei</span>ng the SF-50 in question until December 16, 2009, and argues that the administrative judge improperly failed to find unreasonable delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's argument regarding the presumption that the appellant's address of record is correct suggests that it is relying on the presumption of receipt rule that arises where there is direct evidence that a document was properly addressed, stamped and mailed. <span class="Italic">See Blue v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 370, 374 (1994). In this case, however, the address on the SF-50--123 Redwind--is not the address provided by the appellant in his September 29, 1992 letter to the agency offering his resignation. In that letter the appellant specifically notes his address change and provides the street address as 123 <span class="Italic">Redwing</span> Drive, not 123 <span class="Italic">Redwind</span> Drive, the forwarding address listed on the SF&#8209;50 in question. Accordingly, because the agency has not presented evidence that the document was properly addressed, stamped and mailed, there is no presumption of receipt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the agency's claim that it is most unlikely that the appellant would have been content to wait 17 years to receive a copy of the SF-50 given that he was both "attentive and suspicious in how he handled the settlement of his removal appeal," does not defeat the appellant's claim of lack of knowledge of the offending language for this period of time. We find that the same argument, the appellant's concern with the agency's action, supports the appellant's claim that he would have challenged the SF-50 if he had <span class="Italic">seen</span> it prior to December 2009. Additionally, contrary to the agency's argument, we do not find that testimony from the now deceased individual who prepared the SF-50 regarding the events related to the appellant receiving the SF-50 would be particularly useful given the incorrect address on the SF-50. Accordingly, we concur in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant filed his petition for enforcement within a reasonable time of when he learned of the breach.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the subject of delivery of checks, the Board sometimes draws an adverse inference without explaining what it is doing. In a deferred annuity claim case, an appellant claimed that he did not receive an OPM refund of his retirement contributions many years before. OPM was in no position to refute the claim through production of a canceled check. But the Board discredited the appellant's evidence, essentially drawing an adverse inference based on the delay in the appellant's claim of nonreceipt of the refund check, <span class="Italic">Rint v. OPM</span>, 48 MSPR 69, 72 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that normal office records, compiled in the ordinary course of business, are admissible and are entitled to substantial weight. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Willey v. DHHS</span>, 16 MSPR 275, 278 (1983). As detailed above, OPM's routine records establish application for a refund and issuance of the voucher for the refund check. In addition, there is no evidence showing that the check was not issued to the appellant by the Department of the Treasury. Nor has the appellant introduced any probative evidence showing nonreceipt of his retirement contributions for the period from October 19, 1945-April 13, 1981.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant first communicated doubts that he had received a refund of his retirement contributions to OPM by letter of November 22, 1988. Under the circumstances of this case, where there is a delay of over 37 years in raising a claim, and the only definitive record of actual payment, the cancelled Treasury check, is not available, we find that OPM's ability to defend has been impaired. We, therefore, find that OPM would be unduly prejudiced were we to require that it produce definitive proof of the appellant's actual receipt of the check<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 n.3 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we conclude that the appellant has failed to overcome the evidence to the contrary and prove, by preponderant evidence, that he did not receive a refund of his retirement contributions.</p>
