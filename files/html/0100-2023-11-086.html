<p class="noindent">For there to be a duty to disclose information, the information must exist. It is not a ULP to deny access to nonexistent data. <span class="Italic">Div. of Military and Naval Affairs, New York and New York State Council of ACT</span>, 8 FLRA 307, 320-21 (1982) (ALJ Decision). But the agency must inform the union that it has nothing to give. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">EEOC and AFGE Local 3230</span>, 18 FLRA 173, 173 n.* (1985) (ALJ decision) ("Respondent was under no obligation to honor the Union's request for non-existent data and its failure to furnish such data was not violative of the Statute"). If a union requests information and management finds that it does not exist, management is required to reply to that effect to the union. <span class="Italic">Naval Supply Ctr., San Diego and AFGE Local 1399</span>, 26 FLRA 324, 326-27 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">SSA and IFPTE Assn. of ALJs</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-132.html">60 FLRA 674</a>, 679 (2005) ("The Authority has consistently held that a failure to respond to such an information request is an independent violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute."); <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, New York Region and AFGE Local 3369</span>, 52 FLRA 1133, 1149-50 (1997) ("Section 7114(b)(4) requires that an agency respond to a information request, even if the response is to tell an exclusive representative that the agency does not maintain the information which the exclusive representative seeks."); <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 3314</span>, 28 FLRA 260, 266 (1987) ("the fact that the information sought did not exist or was not readily available did not relieve the Respondent of an obligation to so inform the Union"). The Statute requires the agency to respond to a data request. The agency must advise the union if it does not maintain the information sought. <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1164</span>, 39 FLRA 650, 656 (1991). If a union is determined to be entitled to data, the availability of that data is left to compliance proceedings. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 23 FLRA 239, 240 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency should raise the claim that information is not reasonably available when it responds to the union's information request, not for the first time in ULP proceedings, <span class="Italic">PBGC v. Indep. Union of Pension Employees for Democracy &#x0026; Justice</span>, 69 FLRA 323, 330 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_342"></span>...An agency denying a request for information under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) must assert and establish any anti-disclosure interests at or near the time of the union's request.[107] Conclusory or bare assertions do not satisfy the agency's burden.[108] An agency also fails to timely raise an anti-disclosure interest when the agency could have raised that anti-disclosure interest any time after receiving the request, but does so for the first time in its answer to the complaint.[109]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not challenge the Judge's conclusion that it did not inform the Union that it believed the requested information was not reasonably available at the time that the information was requested. Accordingly, it is not necessary for us to consider the Agency's argument that the Judge erred when he nonetheless concluded that the Agency failed to demonstrate that the phone logs were not reasonably available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even if the Agency had informed the Union, at the time of the request, that the phone logs were not reasonably available, the Agency does not show how much time or resources would be required to retrieve the data. For example, the Agency claims that determining which calls took place outside normal working hours "would take an exorbitant amount of time" because the Agency would have to "cross-match" the call data against employees' time and attendance records. But the Agency does not provide even a rough estimate of the number of calls that would have to be checked against other records to comply with the request. Accordingly, the Agency has not substantiated its claim that the phone logs are not reasonably available.[113]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Respondents contend that the Judge erred in determining that the information is reasonably available because he improperly relied on Authority precedent that has been criticized by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA. </span>Under that Authority precedent, the statutory requirement that data be "reasonably available" would exclude data that is available only through "extreme or excessive means." <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social</span> <span class="Italic">Security Administration, </span>36 FLRA 943, 950 (1990). In <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA, </span>the court found that the appropriate standard for reasonably available should be something "near[&#8197;] the middle" of a spectrum between "readily available" and "available only through 'extreme or excessive means.'" 991 F.2d at 291.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent to the Court of Appeals decision, the Authority has not been presented with an opportunity to revisit its standard for adjudicating whether data requested under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute is "reasonably available." Although it is necessary to resolve in this case whether the data requested is reasonably available, we need not reexamine the appropriate standard to do so because the record shows that, under any legitimate standard, the data requested is reasonably available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the General Counsel presented record evidence demonstrating the means through which the data could be located and retrieved. On the other hand, and as found by the Judge, the Respondents "introduced <span class="Italic">no evidence at all </span>into the record concerning how long it would take, or how costly it would be, to retrieve and furnish the requested information." At the hearing, officials of the Respondents interposed no objection concerning the availability of the requested information. On the contrary, Respondents' officials agreed that the data could, in fact, be obtained from the agency components. The Respondents only claim, in this regard, was that the requested information was not necessary. For example, when the Deputy Regional Director was asked if she could have obtained copies of disciplinary actions in response to the Union's request, she responded: "I'm sure--I mean we could do that, sure. If we considered it relevant, but, again, we did not consider that relevant." In fact, the branch chief in charge of labor-management relations for the Bureau, who denied the Union's request at the Bureau level, testified that he "never" even considered whether the information was reasonably available. The branch chief conceded that if need be, the Bureau could obtain this type of information via a message "to every institution and have them look through their files." Given their superior knowledge of the costs and burdens required to retrieve the data in question, it was incumbent on the Respondents here to produce evidence of the costs and burdens required to retrieve the data in question. <span class="Italic">See Lindahl v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management, </span>776 F.2d 276, 280 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It was not until the filing of their post-hearing brief and exceptions that the Respondents raised the reasonable availability issue. By failing to present any evidence on, or even address, this matter until after the hearing had concluded, the Respondents neglected to develop the record in support of their position on this issue. In light of these circumstances, we conclude that the preponderant evidence supports the General Counsel's assertion that the data was reasonably available<span class="Italic">. See Trident Seafoods, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 101 F.3d 111, 116-17 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (affirming National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) rejection of an argument that respondent raised in a post-hearing brief but did not fully and fairly litigate at hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our dissenting colleague disagrees with our weighing of the evidence, finding that the branch chief's statement: "god knows how long it would take" to search for the data requested constitutes probative rebuttal evidence.[8] However, the branch chief's vague and conclusory opinion does nothing to illuminate how much time and resources would be required to locate the data. In that regard, Respondents' nebulous proffer here stands in stark contrast with the substantial evidence put forth by the agency in <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA--</span>the case relied on heavily by Respondents and the dissent. In <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA, </span>the agency established that the union's request encompassed between 5,000 and 6,000 documents, located in numerous locations. 991 F.2d at 288. Further, many of the documents were organized and filed in a manner that rendered search difficult. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition, and as specifically noted by the court, agency witnesses testified in detail with respect to the time and staff resources that would be required to "find, collect, duplicate and sanitize" the data requested. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. For example, in that case an agency witness testified as to the extensive amount of time it took one employee just to locate a small portion of the requested information<span class="Italic">. Id. </span>This comparison not only leads us to disagree with our dissenting colleague, but also serves to distinguish this case from <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Our dissenting colleague also describes the General Counsel's evidence as "thin." Whether this evidence is sufficient depends on the existence and weight of contrary evidence<span class="Italic">. See Greenwich Collieries v. Director, Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Workers' Compensation Programs, </span>990 F.2d 730, 736 (3d Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd, </span>512 U.S. 246 (1994) (preponderance of the evidence is "evidence which is of greater weight or more convincing than the evidence which is offered in opposition to it"), (internal quotes omitted). In light of the absence of any contrary evidence, the General Counsel's evidence meets this standard. <span class="Italic">See Black's Law Dictionary </span>1201 (7th ed. 1999) (preponderance of evidence is the stronger evidence, "however slight the edge may be").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For all the aforementioned reasons, including the complete absence of evidence concerning the resources and effort required to furnish the data, we conclude that this finding is sufficient to support the determination that the data was reasonably available within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4)(B) of the Statute.[9]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Statute requires an agency to provide data which is reasonably available.&#x2003;Consistent with this requirement, an agency is not required to provide data which is available only through "extreme" or "excessive" means. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration</span>, 36 FLRA 943, 950 (1990).

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Judge found that the record contained "some suggestions" from the Respondent's counsel and the supervisor that providing certain reports would be burdensome, the Judge concluded that the record contained insufficient "details" concerning the extent of the burden....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the record reflects that the Respondent presented only the testimony of the second-line supervisor...to support its contention that the retrieval of the requested data would be burdensome. In this regard, the Respondent's supervisor testified that there would be some difficulty in retrieving the...forms....&#8197;The record contains no other evidence concerning the nature or extent of the alleged burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_343"></span>The Respondent has failed to establish that the requested information was available only through extreme or excessive means.</p>
<p class="noindent">Various decisions concerning the burden of producing information were summarized in <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Border Patrol, El Paso and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 40 FLRA 792, 805 (1991), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 41 FLRA 259 (1991), with the observation: "There is no indication that the Respondent's primary mission or budget were adversely affected by that effort [to obtain some but not all of the documents], which is a significant indicator of the work necessary to retrieve the requested documents for the full twelve months." <span class="Italic">Border Patrol</span> was reviewed, however, and enforcement was denied by a circuit court in <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d 285, 291-92 (5th Cir. 1993). The court explained that FLRA must develop a better test to assess burden:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In this case, the FLRA held that the information was reasonably available because Border Patrol had "failed to establish that the requested information was available only through extreme or excessive means." Furthermore, in one of Marren's previous information requests, the FLRA found that the information was reasonably available because the Border Patrol had not shown that its "primary mission or budget were adversely affected" by its efforts to retrieve the documents that the union had requested. <span class="Italic">Border Patrol II</span>, 40 FLRA at 805.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA, we think, is off the mark in its fashioning of a "reasonably available" standard; it practically ignores the "reasonableness" quotient that the statute requires. If, for example, the availability of documents were considered along a continuum with documents that are readily available at one end, and documents that are available only through "extreme or excessive means" at the other end, the FLRA has fashioned a standard that places "reasonably available" at the far end of that spectrum. We think that the "reasonably available" standard certainly implies something more moderate--something nearer the middle of the spectrum. Furthermore, the FLRA's previous articulation of a standard--"primary mission or budget not affected"--is no better. It suggests that documents are reasonably available as long as the documents can be provided without additional funds from Congress to carry out the agency's primary mission. Both of these interpretations of the statute are contrary to Congress's stated goal of promoting efficient government. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 7101(b). In the case before us, the Border Patrol would have to remove several employees from their regularly assigned duties for several weeks to search for, collect, collate, and redact thousands of pages of documents in various locations around the world. By any objective standard, this information was not reasonably available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we do not, nor do we think that we should, establish a bright line rule for determining when information is "reasonably available." It is up to the FLRA to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether information is reasonably available. We do think, however, that the requirement that documents be reasonably available is a separate and distinct requirement from a determination of whether data is "necessary," and that it must be considered separately and independently when evaluating a union's demand for data. We acknowledge that it may sometimes be appropriate to consider the importance of the purpose of the documents in order to weigh the reasonableness of the effort required to provide the requested information. Nevertheless, in evaluating the reasonable availability of documents, the FLRA should focus primarily on the efforts required to make the documents available, including costs and displacement of the agency's workforce. Finally, we think that when evaluating the workforce requirements and the other related costs needed to produce the data, the FLRA should at all times keep in mind Congress's stated goal of maintaining effective and efficient governmental operations; otherwise the FLRA is unfaithful to this express congressional directive.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 3302</span>, 36 FLRA 943, 950-52 (1990), considered the burden of an information request, construing the phrase material "reasonably available" in the context of a request for information concerning employee travel and reimbursement. The agency unsuccessfully contended that the request was unreasonable because it would take about three weeks of time to compile it:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A] finding that requested information is available does not, alone, satisfy the requirement of section 7114(b)(4) that the information be reasonably available....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute does not require an agency to provide all data that exists or is accessible, however. Instead, only that data which is reasonably available must be provided.

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we are unable to conclude that the requested information was available only through extreme or excessive means.
