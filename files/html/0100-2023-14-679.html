<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-680"><span id="page_1122"></span><span class="space">1.</span> Leave of Absence</h4>
<p class="noindent">Union officials may seek leaves of absence while they serve in full-time positions with local or national unions. FLRA considered unpaid leaves of absence negotiable as arrangements in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 39 FLRA 27, 46-49 (1991) (Provisions 6, 7, 8, 9):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 13, Sections 1(A), (B), (C), and (D) would require the Agency to grant leaves of absence, without pay, to employees who wish to serve the Union in elected or appointed positions. Sections A and B require the Agency to approve leaves of absence for any employees elected to Union positions as national officers and for one elected local chapter officer to enable these employees to serve full-time in the elected positions. Section C requires that the leaves granted to employees under Sections A and B be concurrent with the officers' terms of office and be automatically renewed by the Agency upon notification in writing if the employees are reelected. Section D requires that the Agency approve 2-year leaves of absence for two employees, with not more than one employee from any one work unit, to permit these employees to serve the Union full-time in appointed positions. Additionally, Section D would require the Agency to grant one 2-year extension to individuals who serve in appointed positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sections 1(A), (B), (C), and (D) grant employees an absolute right to leaves of absence if the specified conditions are met. Proposals which leave management no discretion to deny requests for leaves of absence regardless of the necessity for employees' services directly interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.... Inasmuch as Sections 1(A), (B), (C), and (D) leave the Agency no discretion to deny requests for leaves of absence when the conditions described in the sections are met, we conclude that these provisions directly interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that Article 13, Sections 1(A), (B), (C), and (D) are intended to be appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. The Union asserts that these sections are intended to mitigate the adverse effects of management's exercise of its right to deny leaves of absence. For the following reasons, we conclude that these sections constitute negotiable appropriate arrangements....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we find that Sections 1(A), (B), (C), and (D) are arrangements for adversely affected employees under section 7106(b)(3). The Union asserts that the exercise of management's right to deny leaves of absence to employees who wish to serve in full-time positions with the Union would adversely affect employees by "den[ying] their rights under [section] 7102 to form, join and assist a labor organization." Additionally, the Union argues that "employees can be effectively denied their right to be represented should the agency not release the available union official." In response, the Agency argues that "[t]he mere possibility that leave might be denied does not make a provision totally abrogating the management right to make this decision into an arrangement for adversely affected employees."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we note that it is reasonably foreseeable that bargaining unit employees would be adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to deny leaves of absence if part-time Union representatives are unavailable to assist employees in protecting their section 7102 rights. Moreover, in our view it is reasonably foreseeable that employees wishing to serve the Union would be adversely affected by management's exercise of the right to deny leaves of absence.... An Agency denial of a leave of absence to an employee who wishes to serve the Union in a full-time capacity would adversely affect the employee's ability to exercise the right to assist a labor organization which is granted by section 7102 of the Statute. Although official time is available under the conditions described in Article 39, Section 2 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement (Provision 19), under the agreement an employee could not serve the Union in a full-time capacity unless a leave of absence was approved or the employee resigned from Federal service. Consequently, we will consider Article 13, Sections 1(A), (B), (C), and (D) as "arrangements" under section 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether the proposed arrangements are "appropriate," within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3), we must examine whether the negative impact on management's right to assign work is disproportionate to the benefits the arrangements confer on employees.... That is, we must decide whether Sections A, B, C, and D excessively interfere with the right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sections A, B, C, and D would require that the Agency grant leaves of absence, without pay, to employees who meet specified conditions to enable these employees to serve the Union full-time. The Agency does not argue that implementation of these sections would negatively affect its operations. However, it is obvious that the Agency would be obligated to reassign the work of a departing employee and to assign work to the returning employee when the leave expires. Furthermore, if an employee who desires a leave of absence has skills which are not readily available elsewhere within the organization, management's operations might be less efficient until a substitute is found.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, an employee's right to assist the Union is protected by section 7102 of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Union that Sections A, B, C, and D would facilitate employees' exercise of their right under section 7102 to assist a labor organization. Of course, employees may assist the Union part-time on official time or on their personal time. However, if an employee, who wishes to work for the Union full-time, is denied a leave of absence, the employee must choose between foregoing his or her section 7102 rights or resigning employment in the Federal service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The need for time to perform union representational functions is recognized in section 7131(d) of the Statute, which provides that a union may negotiate for official time.... An employee performing representational functions on official time is in a pay status. In contrast, an employee on a leave of absence granted under Sections 1(A), (B), (C), and (D) would be in a nonpay status when performing Union representational functions. As the Union notes, "[i]t would be absurd to have a situation where the Union could bargain that the employee could serve the position with pay, but not on leave."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, there are substantial benefits in providing employees with the opportunity for leaves of absence to serve the Union full-time. Under section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute, the Union is "responsible for representing the interests of all employees in the unit it represents without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership." Full-time Union representatives will assist the Union in meeting this statutory obligation. Furthermore, employees who seek representation will benefit from the availability of Union representation and from having full-time Union representatives who have had the opportunity to develop expertise and familiarity with issues confronting unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also benefits from full-time representation because Union representatives will be available for such matters as collective bargaining and grievance adjustment.... Additionally, the Agency benefits from leaves of absence to the extent that a Union representative on leave without pay may perform functions which would otherwise be performed on official (paid) time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the Office of Personnel Management recognizes that assistance to a union is an appropriate reason for extended leave without pay (LWOP). The Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) states that one of the "instances in which approval of extended LWOP would be proper[ ]" includes LWOP "[t]o serve as an officer or employee of a union representing Federal employees...." FPM chapter 630, 12-2.b.(3)(h) (July 24, 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 39 FLRA 27, 50-51 (1991) (<span class="Italic">vacated in part and remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073-75 (D.C. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">on remand</span>, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 45 FLRA 1256, 1262 (1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>), Provision 10, concerning restoration rights of union officials following leaves of absence, was nonnegotiable to the extent that the agency was required to attempt to place the employee back in the position held prior to leave, but the proposal was negotiable to the extent that it requested the agency to place the employee in a similar position following his return from leave. As to the negotiable portion of the proposal, the Authority read a qualification into it that a "similar" position must be one using the employee's knowledge, skills, and abilities.</p>
<p class="noindent">The analysis in <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span> of the LWOP proposal was found wanting on judicial review, and the court remanded to FLRA for reconsideration, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073-75 (D.C. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third proposal, which would oblige the IRS to grant leaves of absence for employees elected or appointed to union offices...obviously interferes with management's ability to assign work; an employee on leave is not available for assignment. The Authority, however, held that this proposal also falls within paragraph (b)(3), because if the leaves of absence were <span class="Italic">denied</span>, the workers who requested them and other bargaining unit employees would be adversely affected: a denial would frustrate the statutory right of the denied employee to "assist a[ ] labor organization," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102, and it would deprive other bargaining-unit members of representation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. at 47-48.... [W]e think the Authority's reasoning is circular. The employee's dilemma is caused by his or her election or appointment to the union. The union has proposed a benefit (leaves of absence for its officials), and the denial of that benefit purportedly produces the requisite adverse effects. Under that sort of rationale, there is virtually no demand that cannot be made to fit into the adverse effect exception. Once management refuses the demand, presto: we have the adverse effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Treasury also argues that both the second and third proposals interfere "excessively" with management rights. The Department complains that the second proposal prevents management from employing short-duration details when they are most necessary-that is, when the agency must save money. But the Authority reasoned that the agency is not <span id="page_1123"></span>precluded from exercising its right to use short-duration details, because such details can still be used for any non-economic reason (for example, the Authority's brief suggests, when an employee's services are needed elsewhere in the organization). We afford considerable deference to the FLRA's balancing of management and employee interests under its "excessive interference" test, <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Patent Office</span>, 873 F.2d at 1487, 1491, and we see no principled ground for not accepting its determination here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not clear to us, however, why the third proposal's infringement on management's right to assign work is not "excessive."... It all depends on how one defines the right.... If this means only that management retains discretion to institute work schedules for the organization as a whole, then the proposal's impact may well be trivial; it seems unlikely that many employees will be elected national officers of the union, and the proposal specifically limits the number of leaves granted to elected local chapter officers and appointed officials to one and two, respectively. But if the right to assign work implies the right to assign the duties of <span class="Italic">each</span> individual worker, then the encroachment on management's prerogative could not be more severe: with regard to those employees whose leave requests satisfy the proposal's conditions, the agency's discretion is eliminated entirely. The FLRA has directed us to no authority for, nor has it given adequate explanation of, its conclusion that the right to assign work is not excessively interfered with here. It is not that we object to the FLRA's balancing, it is that we cannot determine how it defines the management right in the equation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It seems rather obvious that the FLRA is seeking to stretch the adverse effects exception to the statutory reservation of management rights, but it simply cannot be that any benefit that the union seeks--and that implicates management rights--can be extracted from those rights simply by the linguistic trick of describing management's refusal to accept the union's demand as having created an adverse effect. We do not think the Authority has explained why the second and third proposals, rather than merely seeking benefits for employees, compensate for adverse effects that flow from the exercise of management prerogatives. Nor is the scope of management's right to assign work sufficiently clear. Accordingly, we affirm the Authority's negotiability determination and grant its cross-petition for enforcement with respect to the first clause but vacate its conclusions with respect to the second and third clauses and remand for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 45 FLRA 1256, 1262 (1992), FLRA concluded that the leave of absence provision was nonnegotiable. The proposal was not negotiable as an arrangement, because no adverse impact of management action, other than denial of the requested privilege, was asserted. The proposal interfered with management's right to assign work, for that right encompasses the right to grant or deny a request for a leave of absence. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Blaylock v. MSPB</span>, 851 F.2d 1348, 1352-54 (11th Cir. 1988) (ramifications of federal employees who engage in political activities while they are on LWOP to serve as union officials). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 170 and DCMA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-237.html">71 FLRA 1259</a> (2020) (Member DuBester concurring) (proposal was negotiable calling for conditional return rights to billet for union official returning from 100% official time: agency offered no substantive argument challenging negotiability).</p>
<p class="noindent">Contested in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, BATF</span>, 45 FLRA 339, 381-85 (1992), was Provision 17, requesting agreement to a proposal that "[t]he Employer agrees to authorize annual leave or leave without pay to Union officers and to any national officer of the Union for attendance at any Union-sponsored conventions or meetings unless authorization would cause a severe work interruption." FLRA distinguished its treatment of official time proposals and proposals concerning the conduct of internal union business, and determined the proposal nonnegotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we reject the Union's argument that this provision requires that we carve out section 7120 as an exception to the exercise of management's rights. In this regard, the exercise of management's rights does not have the same effect on the obligations set forth in section 7120 as it does on the rights to negotiate for official time that are embodied in section 7131(d).... [A] strict application of section 7106(a) to provisions seeking to negotiate official time would eviscerate section 7131(d). In contrast, provisions requiring that annual leave or leave without pay be granted for the purpose of carrying out responsibilities under section 7120 leaves that section intact. That is, while the express purpose of section 7131(d) is to authorize the negotiation of official time for use in certain circumstances, section 7120 contains no reference to the use of leave and its requirements can be complied with regardless of whether a specific grant of annual leave is negotiated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have previously found, proposals that place restrictions on an agency's ability to deny requests for leave directly interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B). This is true with respect to both annual leave and leave without pay. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Army Information Systems Command</span>, 42 FLRA at 1126. By requiring that requests for annual leave or leave without pay be granted unless a severe work interruption would result, this provision directly interferes with management's right to assign work and is nonnegotiable unless it constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that this provision constitutes an arrangement, we conclude that it is nonnegotiable because it excessively interferes with management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Denying an employee's request to take leave for the purpose of attending a Union-sponsored convention or meeting would preclude that employee from engaging in a particular exercise of his or her right to form, join, or assist a labor organization. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, United States Border Patrol, San Diego Sector, San Diego, California</span>, 38 FLRA 701, 712 (1990), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Immigration and Naturalization Service v. FLRA</span>, No. 91-70078 (9th Cir. Jan. 28, 1991) (holding leadership positions within a union is one of the many ways that employees can exercise their right to form, join, or assist a labor organization). For employees who wish to attend Union-sponsored conventions or meetings, the impact of being denied leave that is for that purpose is significant. However, insofar as the conventions or meetings are not directly related to activities undertaken on behalf of employees as part of the collective bargaining relationship but, rather, concern the internal business or institutional needs of the Union, the impact of the denial of leave on the conditions of employment of employees as a whole would be indirect and incidental. That is, while we recognize that the ability of the Union to accomplish its internal business and satisfy institutional needs may affect the Union's ability to represent employees, such activities generally do not involve the actual representation of employees. Therefore, the effect on bargaining unit employees as a whole of the denial of requests by Union officers for leave to attend Union-sponsored conventions and meetings is limited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, although the benefits afforded to the employee requesting the leave are significant, the benefits afforded by the arrangement to employees as a whole are limited in that the activities for which the leave is requested generally have only an indirect bearing on the conduct of the collective bargaining relationship and the unit employees' conditions of employment. Provision 17 would require the Agency to grant leave even though it had a legitimate need for an employee's services unless that need involved a severe work interruption. Although Provision 17 would not require the Agency to suffer a severe work interruption, it nevertheless would require that the Agency undergo any lesser degree of work disruption that might result. In our view, this places a substantial burden on the Agency that outweighs the benefits to employees who desire leave to attend Union conventions and meetings. Moreover, adding in the limited benefits that the provision affords employees as a whole does not serve to offset this burden. We find that, on balance, the benefit to employees is outweighed by the burden on the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that in our view a critical distinction exists between this provision and Provisions 2, 6, and 7. The latter three provisions involve absences from work in which the time would be spent in activities that are directly related to the representation of employees and the collective bargaining relationship. By contrast, Provision 17 involves absences from work to engage in activities that are related for the most part to the internal business and institutional needs of the Union. Thus, the level of benefits afforded to employees as a whole by the two groups of provisions is quite different and this difference is critical insofar as offsetting the burden placed on management's rights is concerned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For similar reasons, this provision is distinguishable from Provisions 6, 7, 8, and 9 in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 39 FLRA 27 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>), <span class="Italic">remanded sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, v. FLRA</span>. In <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, we concluded that Provisions 6, 7, 8 and 9, which related to approving leaves of absence for employees elected to union office, constituted appropriate arrangements that were negotiable under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. In so concluding, one of the factors that we found determinative was the benefit that the provisions afforded to employees seeking representation. 39 FLRA at 49. In this case, Provision 17 affords the employees who are represented by the Union, as contrasted with those who are acting as representatives, only indirect and limited benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Provision 17 excessively interferes with management's right to assign work and does not constitute an appropriate arrangement that is negotiable under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
