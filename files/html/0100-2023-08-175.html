<p class="Body-Text">Retirement eligibility cases aside, discussed in <span class="Italic">Cash v. CIA, post</span>, The Board does not adjudicate appeals by CIA employees. Under the National Security Act, 50 USC 403(c) [now &#x00A7; 3036(e)], the Director of the CIA may, in his discretion, terminate the employment of any person whose retention is incompatible with the best interests of the United States, notwithstanding provisions of other statutes protecting the rights of government employees in dismissal cases. The Reform Act does not include the CIA as an agency subject to the prohibited personnel practice sections of the Act. 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii)(I); <span class="Italic">Neely v. CIA</span>, 2 MSPR 371, 373, 2 MSPB 534 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Magueresse v. CIA</span>, DC-3443-15-0894-I-1 (NP 1/19/3016) ("The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the Board has previously determined that it lacks jurisdiction to review CIA personnel actions under the provisions of the National Security Act of 1947. The administrative judge further found that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, which creates the Board's jurisdiction over most Federal employees, explicitly excludes coverage of CIA employees under &#x00A7; 7511(b)(7)."); <span class="Italic">Cook v. CIA</span>, 58 MSPR 542, 543 (1993). Judicial review of CIA employment decisions may be obtained on constitutional grounds and under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Webster v. Doe</span>, 108 S. Ct. 2047 (1988). For information concerning the employment status of personnel serving CIA proprietary firms, refer to <span class="Italic">Watts v. OPM</span>, 814 F.2d 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1987). As to retirement issues, under <span class="Italic">Cash v. CIA</span>, AT-844E-16-0508-I-1, n.3 (NP 4/14/2022) (also noting that MSPB lacked jurisdiction over an associated disability discrimination claim against CIA):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 50, U.S. Code, chapter 38, authorizes the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director to administer various aspects of retirement for CIA employees, including participation in the FERS. 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2011(c), 2155(a). The CIA Director is required to prescribe regulations regarding applying FERS to CIA employees, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2156. Regarding FERS, agency employees are subject to 5 U.S.C. chapter 84, 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2151(a), and certain CIA employees, like the appellant, have recourse to the Board from an unfavorable agency retirement decision. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e); 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2155.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 7511(b)(8), an employee who is not a preference eligible may not appeal an adverse action to the Board if the employee's position was "within...an intelligence component of the Department of Defense [DoD] (as defined in section 1614 of title 10), or an intelligence activity of a military department covered under subchapter I of chapter 83 of title 10...." <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 106 MSPR 640, 646 &#x00B6; 14, 2007 MSPB 233 (2007), concluded after extensive statutory analysis that the Board has no adverse action appellate jurisdiction over a nonpreference eligible in the Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]n employee of "an intelligence activity of a military department" is excluded from coverage under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8) if her position was covered by a personnel system established under the authority of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1601. We hold further that she is excluded from coverage under those circumstances even if her position is not included in a DoD "intelligence component," as that term is defined at 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1614(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see Conley v. DOD</span>, SF-1221-15-0580-W-1 (NP 5/2/2022) (as to IRA jurisdiction, discussed in Chapter 13: "However, to the extent the agency is arguing that the appellant is not entitled to bring an IRA appeal because he was appointed under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1601...such an argument is unavailing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The application of &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8) was developed in <span class="Italic">Rice v. MSPB</span>, 522 F.3d 1311, 1314-16 (Fed. Cir. 2008), determining that the exclusion applied to Office of Naval Intelligence employees without regard to particular statutory references in the directives establishing the exclusion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, Ms. Rice argued that, as an excepted service employee who had completed more that two years of continuous service in the same position, she was entitled to appeal her removal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). She argued that section 7511(b)(8) did not exclude her from the Board's jurisdiction because, under the rationale of <span class="Italic">Czarkowski v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 390 F.3d 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the Navy had failed to show that the Secretary of Defense had explicitly designated the Office of Naval Intelligence as an intelligence component of the Department of Defense.... Finally, Ms. Rice contended that her appeal rights to the Board were preserved under the "grandfather" clause of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1612(b)(1). That provision, she alleged, affords an employee appeal rights if the employee's transfer into an excepted service position in an intelligence unit was immediately preceded by a position within the same agency that was subject to Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Rice argues that the Office of Naval Intelligence does not qualify as an intelligence component of the Department of Defense under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8), and that she was therefore not excluded from the definition of an "employee" for purposes of adverse action appeals. The Board, however, correctly ruled that an order issued by the Department of Defense, Directive 5240.1, establishes that the Office of Naval Intelligence is an intelligence component of the Department of Defense within the meaning of section 7511(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As she did before the Board, Ms. Rice bases her argument on this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Czarkowski.</span> She interprets Czarkowski to mean that in order for an agency to qualify as an "intelligence component of the Department of Defense" within the meaning of section 7511(b)(8), the document designating the agency as having that status must specifically reference the two statutory provisions, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8) and 10 U.S.C. <span id="Page_289"></span>&#x00A7; 1614(2), that render inapplicable the provisions of title 5 governing adverse action appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We decline to read <span class="Italic">Czarkowski</span> so broadly. The statute at issue in <span class="Italic">Czarkowski</span> required the President or his delegate to decide that a particular agency had as its "principal function" the "conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities." <span class="Italic">Czarkowski,</span> 390 F.3d at 1349, <span class="Italic">quoting</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii). This court rejected the government's argument that the Board could make that determination for the President by reviewing documentary evidence suggesting that an agency has been determined to have the principal function of conducting such activities. The court pointed out that many agencies have some authority to conduct intelligence activities, but that the statute "assigns to the President the task of identifying which agencies meet the 'principal function' test." <span class="Italic">Czarkowski,</span> 390 F.3d at 1350. That determination, the court added, "surely is a delicate call in some circumstances, and it certainly is a call that Congress has left to the President or his delegate." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court then set forth its ruling as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The statutory language does not suggest that the Board can effectively make a determination for the President by reviewing documentary evidence that may suggest an agency has been determined to have the principal function of conducting foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities. Documents that suggest to the Board that a Presidential determination should or could have been made cannot stand as a proxy for an actual Presidential determination that references the statute. The burden is on the agency to show that the President, or his delegate, has explicitly exempted an agency or unit thereof under section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Seizing on the reference in the portion of the <span class="Italic">Czarkowski</span> opinion quoted above to "an actual Presidential determination that references the statute," Ms. Rice argues that Department of Defense Directive 5240.1 was insufficient because it failed to cite 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8) and 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1614(2). However, nothing in section 7511(b)(8) or section 1614(2) requires that the determination by the Secretary of Defense that an agency is an intelligence component of the Department of Defense be accompanied by a citation to the pertinent statutes or else be deemed insufficient. Section 7511(b)(8) requires only that the employee's position be within "an intelligence component of the Department of Defense (as defined in section 1614 of title 10)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8). Section 1614 defines "intelligence component of the Department of Defense" to include any "component of the Department of Defense that performs intelligence functions and is designated by the Secretary of Defense as an intelligence component of the Department of Defense." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1614(2)(D). The determination that the Naval Intelligence Service is an intelligence component of the Department of Defense was made in <span class="Italic">haec verba</span> in Department of Defense Directive 5420.1. In particular, Directive 5240.1 designates the Office of Naval Intelligence as one of the named Department of Defense "Intelligence Components" and identifies it as a component of the Department of Defense that "conduct[s] intelligence activities." The Directive therefore explicitly identifies the Office of Naval Intelligence as a designated intelligence component of the Department of Defense that performs intelligence functions. Finally, Directive 5240.1 was issued by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the lawful delegate of the Secretary of Defense. That is all that is required by section 7511(b)(8) and section 1614(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that the court in <span class="Italic">Czarkowski</span> stated that "an actual Presidential determination that references [section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii)] " would suffice to satisfy the statutory exemption, while "[d]ocuments that suggest to the Board that a Presidential determination should or could have been made" would not. 390 F.3d at 1350. While the court clearly indicated that a determination that included a statutory reference would be sufficient, it did not hold that an express Presidential determination would be invalid absent an explicit reference to section 2302. Because there was no Presidential determination at all in <span class="Italic">Czarkowski,</span> it was not necessary for the court to decide whether a statutory reference is a <span class="Italic">sine qua non</span> of such determination. At least in the context of the determination referred to in section 7511(b)(8), which merely requires a statement that the agency in question is an intelligence component of the Department of Defense, we hold that such a statutory reference is not required. Just as in <span class="Italic">Czarkowski</span> the critical question was whether the President or his delegate "has explicitly exempted an agency or unit thereof under section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii)," 390 F.3d at 1350, the critical question in this case is whether the Secretary of Defense or his delegate has designated the agency as an intelligence component of the Department of Defense under sections 7511(b)(8) and 1614(2). That determination was plainly made, and an express reference to the pertinent statutes would add nothing of substance to that determination. Accordingly, we hold that the Board properly ruled that Ms. Rice's position fell within 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8) and that she was not an employee who would be entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) to appeal an adverse action to the Board.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The administrative judge decided this case based on her conclusion that the Office of Naval Intelligence is "an intelligence component of the Department of Defense (as defined in section 1614 of title 10)." Neither the administrative judge nor the parties have discussed whether the Office of Naval Intelligence would also qualify for inclusion within section 7511(b)(8) as "an intelligence activity of a military department covered under subchapter I of chapter 83 of title 10." For that reason we do not rest our decision on that ground.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board lacked jurisdiction over an adverse action appeal from an employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (formerly National Imagery and Mapping Agency), appeal rights applied to an employee who worked at the Defense Mapping Agency and moved to NIMA without the opportunity to make an informed decision on whether to accept the reassignment if acceptance meant a loss of Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clarke v.
