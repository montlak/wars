<h5 class="h5" id="sec11-88"><span class="space">a.</span> Extension Request</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant or his union representative must request any desired postponement of an oral reply. <span class="Italic">Kays v. FAA</span>, 15 MSPR 62, 69 n.12 (1983). The burden is on the employee to assure timely receipt by the employer of a request for an extension of time to reply to a proposed adverse action; should an employee complain that an extension was improperly denied, the employee can show harmful error only by a demonstration of a substantial defense to the proposed action. <span class="Italic">Porrazzo v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 19 MSPR 496, 497 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Roseman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 76 MSPR 334, 344-45 n.8 (1997) (no harmful error occurred when an extension for a reply was not granted; a prior extension was granted and the evidence the appellant would have offered would not have changed the result of the case); <span class="Italic">Allmon v. FAA</span>, 16 MSPR 645, 648 (1983) (after the agency failed to extend the time for receiving an oral reply, the appellant failed to show how any error in the oral reply process substantially impaired the appellant's ability to defend against the agency action). If an employee seeks a last-minute extension to an otherwise reasonable reply period, the appellant cannot legitimately object because the extension was denied and he took no steps to determine if was granted. <span class="Italic">Pawlak v. FAA</span>, 40 MSPR 546, 550 (1989). But if the agency grants an extension and then does not consider a reply submitted within the allowed time, there may be a constitutional due process error. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alford v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ALFORD_LEROY_DC_0752_09_0770_I_4_OPINION_AND_ORDER_757739.pdf">118 MSPR 556</a>, 559-60 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7, 2012 MSPB 110 (2012), <span class="Italic">supra.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pumphrey v. DOD</span>, 122 MSPR 186, 188-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-11, 2015 MSPB 10 (2015), declined to engraft a constitutional due process--rather than harmful error--analysis onto the agency's failure to extend the statutory or regulatory reply period:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency denied him due process by failing to grant his requests for use of official time and for an extension of time to reply to the notice of proposed furlough. He claims that, had he been afforded this time, he might have been able to incorporate into his reply, among other things, information from an inspector general's report that is obtainable by internet search.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge considered these arguments as allegations of harmful error under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A). In his petition for review, the appellant specifically claims that the agency denied him due process, and his allegations before the administrative judge similarly referenced and implicated due process concerns. Although the harmful error and due process issues are intertwined in this case, separate considerations are involved. <span class="Italic">See Ray v. Department of the Army</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 13 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 176 F. App'x 110 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Therefore, we supplement the analysis in the initial decision as follows.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). For purposes of this decision, we assume that the appellant has a property interest at stake based on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(5) and 7513(a), which generally create a legitimate claim of entitlement to retention in a pay status that conditions the furlough of an employee for 30 days or less on such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Gajdos v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (2014). In this context, minimum due process of law requires prior notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14, 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant admits that he received the agency's written notice of proposed furlough on May 28, 2013, as indicated by his signature and acknowledgment on the proposal notice. The proposal notice set forth the agency's reasons for the furlough and stated that supporting materials could be reviewed on an agency website or in designated Furlough Reading Room locations. The proposal notice informed the appellant that he could respond orally and/or in writing within 14 calendar days from his receipt of the notice. The appellant asserts that the agency issued its final decision on July 2, 2013. Thus, he received a pre-decisional opportunity to respond to the proposed furlough, and he remained entitled to a full post-furlough hearing before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, the Supreme Court clarified that if a tenured public employee is entitled to a full post-decisional hearing, such as a hearing before the Board, a pre-decisional trial-type hearing is not required and fundamental due process requirements are satisfied if the employee has a pre-decisional opportunity to present, either in person or in writing, reasons why the proposed action should not be taken. <span class="Italic">Ray</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 22 (citing <span class="Italic">Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. at 546). Such opportunity "need not definitively resolve the propriety of the [action]," but rather "should be an initial check against mistaken decisions--essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action." <span class="Italic">Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. at 545-46. Although the appellant would have preferred additional time and/or official time, apparently to gather evidence, before responding to the agency, the 14-day reply period allowed him a meaningful opportunity and reasonable time to respond consistent with <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and was constitutionally sufficient, <span class="Italic">see Ray,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 22; <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 685-86 (1991). Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the appellant did not establish that the agency violated his due process rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency's conduct did not constitute a constitutional violation, we must still decide whether the agency committed a harmful procedural error. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1281-83 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A), the Board will not sustain an agency decision if the appellant "shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision." The record does not support a finding that the agency committed a procedural error in not granting the appellant's requests for official time and an extension of time to reply to the proposal notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, even assuming that the agency should have granted these requests, the appellant has failed to demonstrate any prejudice to his substantive rights. The Board may not assume that an employee has been harmed by a procedural error in the adverse action process; rather, the appellant bears the burden of proving harm. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1281-82; <span class="Italic">Handy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 754 F.2d 335, 337-38 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 31 (2012). A procedural error is harmful where the record shows that the error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 31; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims that he might have presented evidence of an inspector general's report or that the agency continues to grant a "free hour to certain employees before every holiday." Even assuming that the appellant's failure to incorporate these matters into his reply is due to the agency's denial of his requests,[3] he has not shown that this report or his allegations likely would have caused the agency to reach a different conclusion. He further speculates that he might have been able to raise "numerous" other unidentified issues had the agency granted his requests. He has not explained why he would have been able to raise additional issues had the agency granted his requests for additional time in 2013 when he has not identified any such issue even at this later date. The appellant's speculation is insufficient to meet his burden of establishing harm. <span class="Italic">See Stephen</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 682-83 (noting that an appellant must provide proof of actual harm resulting from any agency procedural error, which requires more than the possibility that the same evidence presented to the Board might have been viewed differently by the agency); <span class="Italic">Mack v. Department of the Navy</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 288, 290-91 (1985) (finding that the appellant failed to show any harmful error in the agency's failure to rule on his request for an extension of time to prepare a response to a proposed adverse action); <span class="Italic">Robinson v.

<p class="Body-Text">To determine whether the denial of an extension is reasonable, the underlying circumstances must be examined. The interest of counsel in taking a vacation is not a sufficient reason to hold that an agency wrongfully denied an extension of the reply period. <span class="Italic">Gamble v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 11, 14 (1984). Nor, under <span class="Italic">Gamble</span>, was appellant's stress and depression sufficient to extend the reply period when she was able to converse about her case.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The removal action here is based on a single charge of failure to maintain a required security clearance, and we find no indication that the matters to be addressed in a reply were particularly numerous or complex.

Dept. of Transp.</span>, 19 MSPR 47, 49 (1984), involved an employee who alleged the employer should have permitted an extension of a reply period so that he could obtain and introduce a medical report. The Board applied the harmful error standard: to establish error, the appellant must demonstrate that the submission would have made a difference in the outcome. As to the appellant who claimed that the oral reply should have been extended so he would not suffer prejudice in pending criminal proceedings, there was no error: the appellant had not introduced evidence of what information he would have provided to the agency had the reply been extended. <span class="Italic">Redfern v.

Dept. of Army</span>, DE-0752-12-0126-I-1 (NP 11/20/2013), concluded there was no reversible error when the appellant was granted an extension for a reply, he provided a written reply, but he was denied a further extension to consult with counsel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The essential requirements of due process...are notice and an opportunity to respond." <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). This means that "[T]he tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This does not include a full evidentiary hearing at the predecisional stage. <span class="Italic">Ray v. Department of the Army</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 22 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 176 F. App'x 110 (Fed. Cir. 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the limited amount of time available to the appellant, and the restrictions imposed upon him in getting and adducing witness statements and other evidence, we find that he had a meaningful opportunity to "present his side of the story." As the administrative judge observed, the appellant's written response addressed each of the six specifications of misconduct, including his version as to what did and did not transpire. The appellant not only had the opportunity, but in fact did "present his side of the story" regarding each of the allegations of misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant might have desired to provide a fuller and more detailed reply, including written statements from subordinates and co-workers, procedural due process does not require that he have sufficient time and opportunity to adduce such evidence at the predecisional stage. Nor does due process require that the appellant have sufficient opportunity to retain an attorney to assist him in responding to the proposed removal. Moreover, the appellant did not have a due process right to both a written reply <span class="Italic">and</span> an oral reply. Due process requires that the employee have the "opportunity to present reasons, <span class="Italic">either</span> in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken." <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546.[5] Ultimately, the appellant made a voluntary choice that, under the circumstances, he would rely on his written response and not avail himself of the opportunity to present an oral response as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;As noted in footnote 4, an employee has a statutory right "to answer orally and in writing," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2), but this statutory right is not synonymous with Constitutional due process. If statutory procedures were violated, they would be subject to harmful error analysis under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an adverse action reply extension was arguably unreasonably denied, in <span class="Italic">Ray v. Dept. of Army</span>, 97 MSPR 101, 110-16 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-22 (2004), the Board determined that the error was not a violation of constitutional due process and, under the circumstances, was not harmful error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A), the Board may not sustain an agency's decision regarding an adverse action taken against an employee with appeal rights to the Board, even if the decision is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, if the employee shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision. However, harmful error under section 7701(c)(2)(A) cannot be presumed; an agency error is harmful only where the record shows that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Stephen v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991). The appellant bears the burden of showing that the error caused substantial harm or prejudice to his rights. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)]. Among the procedural rights a federal employee with appeal rights to the Board has with respect to a proposed adverse action is "a reasonable time, but not less than 7 days, to answer orally and in writing and to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant's allegations also implicate due process concerns because the right to respond to notice of an agency's charges is not only guaranteed by the procedures set forth in chapter 75 of Title 5, United States Code; it is also a fundamental due process requirement in a case involving a tenured public employee, as stated by the Supreme Court of the United States in<span class="Italic"> Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985) (an agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond). While the due process requirements entitle the tenured public employee to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 546, the Supreme Court has noted that "due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands," <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Homar</span>, 520 U.S. 924, 930 (1997); <span class="Italic">see Rawls v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 614 &#x00B6; 21 (2003) (the appellant's pre-termination right to file a grievance coupled with his post-termination right to file a Board appeal were all the procedures <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> required in terms of minimum due process). Thus, while the due process requirements are well-defined, the question as to whether the agency met these requirements in a particular situation must be resolved by considering the surrounding circumstances. In a case such as this, where the appellant's harmful error claim involves an allegation that the agency's error implicated one of the due process requirements, such as the opportunity to respond, the harmful error and due process claims are intertwined. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 789 F.2d 1540, 1545 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant established that the agency committed procedural error by unreasonably refusing to extend the reply period by an additional two weeks. The administrative judge noted that the requested extension was not great and that the reasons offered by the appellant's representative were compelling, including the number and complexity of the charges, the volume of supporting evidence, the difficulties imposed by distance, and the scheduling constraints concerning an oral reply. In addition, the administrative judge stated that there was no evidence that the agency would have been unduly prejudiced by an additional two weeks' delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After finding that the agency did not provide the appellant with a reasonable time in which to respond to the agency's charges, the administrative judge also determined that the appellant established that this error was harmful. To support this finding, the administrative <span id="Page_3239"></span>judge noted that on appeal the appellant submitted a detailed rebuttal to each of the specifications against him that would have been helpful to the agency in reaching its decision. He also noted that the appellant's demeanor at hearing weighed significantly in his decision not to sustain two of the most serious specifications, i.e., specifications 7 and 8 regarding false statements, but the deciding official, COL Gilmore, did not have the opportunity to assess the appellant's demeanor since the appellant did not present an oral reply. The administrative judge found this particularly significant in light of the fact that COL Gilmore did not know the appellant personally and testified that he did not consider a lesser penalty because "without a response" the evidence warranted removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency contests the administrative judge's findings and conclusions regarding the appellant's harmful error defense. First, the agency argues that the administrative judge improperly placed the burden on the agency to show cause why the additional two-week extension was properly denied. The agency also notes that it originally afforded the appellant 14 days to respond to the notice of proposed removal, granted the appellant an additional 15 days to respond after the appellant's representative requested an extension, and provided the appellant with an additional two days to submit matters after COL Gilmore denied the appellant's request for an additional extension. The agency also points out that the appellant waited until near the end of the original reply period to retain counsel located in the United States, despite the fact that legal counsel was available on Okinawa, and that the appellant had ample time to obtain and consult with counsel in preparing a meaningful reply as the appellant was on administrative leave during the entire reply period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that the appellant failed to show that any error the agency might have committed was harmful because the appellant did not identify specific evidence that he would have presented to the agency, nor articulated the argument that he would have made, that would have likely changed the agency's decision to remove him. The agency further argues that the appellant presented no evidence that the agency's decision would have been different if the appellant submitted an oral or written response to the charges and that the detailed rebuttal the appellant submitted before the Board did not contain any significant new evidence or argument that was not already included in the materials considered by the deciding official. Finally, the agency argues that the appellant had the opportunity to present a reply to the deciding official but simply failed to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon consideration of the agency's arguments and review of the record, we find that the appellant failed to establish that the agency committed harmful error by failing to provide the appellant with a reasonable time in which to reply to the notice of proposed removal. First, the record evidence does not support the conclusion that the time the agency provided for the reply was unreasonable. We recognize that the appellant may have encountered some difficulty in obtaining counsel due to the fact that he was stationed on Okinawa, but the appellant did not explain why it took him almost two full weeks to obtain counsel to represent him. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Brothers v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 377, 379-80 (1984) (that an appellant has a right to select a representative of his own choosing does not diminish his responsibility to select a representative in such a timely manner that the representative is able to prepare the appellant's case and represent him at the hearing). In addition, when the appellant's representative requested that the deciding official provide an additional extension, he did not provide specific information to justify the extension. For example, when requesting the extension, the appellant's representative stated that he had just received additional information to help him with the appellant's reply, but he did not explain the nature of the new information nor explain why receipt of such information required additional time to prepare the appellant's response. In addition, the appellant's representative stated that he had been trying to contact more witnesses that he needed to interview, but he did not identify those witnesses or explain why he was unable to contact them earlier. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. 102, 104 (1981) (in finding that the agency did not commit an error in denying the appellant's request for an extension, the Board noted that the deciding official advised the appellant of the failure to cite any reason and/or extenuating circumstances to support an additional extension of time).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that there is no evidence to suggest that the agency denied the appellant the opportunity to make an oral reply. Rather, the evidence establishes that the agency allowed the appellant to submit input to the deciding official through May 17, 2002, but the appellant simply failed to do so. While it may have been inconvenient for the appellant's counsel to attend an oral reply presented on or prior to this date, the appellant offered no evidence to show that he was unable to be present at an oral reply nor to show that his representative could not have meaningfully participated in the appellant's oral reply by some other means, such as by telephone or video conference. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Department of the Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (the procedures an agency followed in suspending an employee, which included a meeting in which the employee met with government officials while his counsel participated via telephone, provided the employee with ample opportunity to persuade the government that its concerns were ill-founded). Furthermore, the appellant has not established that the agency failed to provide him with sufficient time to prepare and present a written response. We note that the appellant's representative submitted the "detailed rebuttal," which the administrative judge stated would have been helpful to the agency in reaching its decision, only 20 days after the administrative judge issued the order requiring its submission. The agency provided the appellant with 29 full days in which to make a reply to the deciding official. Based on the considerations set forth above, we find that the appellant failed to establish that the agency committed a procedural error by failing to provide him with a reasonable time to submit an oral and/or written reply to the notice of proposed removal. Accordingly, we also find that the appellant failed to prove his affirmative defense of harmful error because he failed to establish the threshold fact necessary to support a finding of harmful error, i.e., that the agency committed an error in the application of its procedures in arriving at its decision. <span class="Italic">See Stephen</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 685.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, even assuming that the agency erred by denying the appellant a reasonable time to respond to the notice of proposed removal, the appellant has failed to show that the error caused substantial harm to his rights, i.e., that the agency was likely to reach a different result in the absence of the error. The administrative judge found that the agency's error was harmful because the deciding official did not have the opportunity to assess the appellant's demeanor due to the fact that the appellant did not present an oral reply, and because the appellant was unable to submit a detailed rebuttal to the specifications included in the notice of proposed removal. Thus, it is apparent that the administrative judge essentially concluded that the agency's error was harmful because, if the appellant had been given a reasonable time to submit either an oral or written response, the deciding official may have chosen to believe the appellant's version of the events.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is true that the deciding official might have chosen to believe the appellant if he had presented a response, the appellant did not present sufficient reasons to support the conclusion that it was likely that the deciding official would have done so. Neither the appellant, nor the administrative judge in the initial decision, identified specific evidence that the appellant would have presented to the agency, or argument that he would have made, that was likely to have changed the agency's decision to remove him. <span class="Italic">See Trammell v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 79, 89 (1993); <span class="Italic">Baracco v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 112, 124 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Adams</span> <span class="Italic">v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation</span>, 735 F.2d 488 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 469 U.S. 1018 (1984). Furthermore, the fact that the administrative judge found the appellant more credible than the agency witnesses with respect to particular specifications does not necessarily support a finding that the deciding official was likely to reach the same conclusion if the appellant had presented an oral reply. The administrative judge's credibility findings were made after a lengthy hearing at which the administrative judge had the opportunity to hear the live testimony and assess the demeanor of the appellant, as well as the other witnesses, after direct questioning and cross-examination by the parties' representatives. The statute which entitles an employee to reply orally and in writing to a proposed adverse action allows the employee to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer, but it does not entitle the employee to present live testimony or to cross-examine witnesses that may have made statements against him. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2). Thus, an administrative judge's credibility findings are generally based on much more evidence than would normally be available to a deciding official who is considering a proposed action against the employee. Without pointing to specific evidence that the appellant would have presented to the deciding official that would have likely persuaded the deciding official to find the appellant more believable than the affiants whose sworn statements the deciding official considered in reaching his decision, it would be purely speculative to presume that, if the appellant had presented an oral reply, the deciding official would have reached the same conclusion as the administrative judge regarding the appellant's credibility. Therefore, despite the fact that the administrative judge found the appellant more credible than the agency witnesses with respect to particular specifications, we find that the appellant has failed to establish that any error the agency may have committed in failing to provide him a reasonable time to reply to the notice of proposed removal was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, much of the reasoning set forth above applies with equal force to the appellant's due process claim. As described above, the agency provided the appellant with at least 29 full days in which to make some type of reply before the deciding official rendered his decision. Although the appellant and his representative may have preferred an extension <span id="Page_3240"></span>of time to interview additional witnesses and to allow the appellant's representative to appear on the appellant's behalf at an in-person oral reply before the deciding official, <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> makes clear that, where the employee is entitled to a full post-termination hearing, such as a hearing before the Board, a pre-termination trial-type hearing is not required and fundamental due process requirements are satisfied where the appellant has the opportunity to present, either in person or in writing, reasons why the proposed action should not be taken. The Court stated, "To require more than this prior to termination would intrude to an unwarranted extent on the government's interest in quickly removing an unsatisfactory employee." <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546. In this case, the evidence of record does not establish that the agency denied the appellant either the opportunity or a reasonable time to provide an oral or written reply. Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, we find that the agency did not violate the appellant's due process rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Failure of an agency to extend a reply period did not deprive the appellant of due process or constitute harmful error in <span class="Italic">Woods v. USPS,</span> DC-0752-10-0300-I-1 (NP 11/7/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition, the appellant reiterates an affirmative defense he made below, i.e., that the agency committed procedural error by failing to afford him the opportunity to make an oral response to the notice of proposed removal. Where, as here, the appellant's harmful error claim involves an allegation that the agency's error implicated one of the due process requirements, such as the opportunity to respond, the claims of harmful error and due process are intertwined. <span class="Italic">See Ray v. Department of the Army</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 13 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 176 F. App'x 110 (Fed. Cir. 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court of the United States has found that an agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). While the due process requirements entitle the tenured public employee to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 546, 105 S. Ct. 1487, the Supreme Court has also noted that "due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands," <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Homar</span>, 520 U.S. 924, 930 (1997); <span class="Italic">see Rawls v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 21 (2003) (the appellant's pre-termination right to file a grievance coupled with his post-termination right to file a Board appeal were all the procedures <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> required in terms of minimum due process). Furthermore, while the due process requirements are well-defined, in determining whether to find a due process violation, the Board must consider the facts and circumstances of each particular case. <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the record reflects that the notice of proposed removal afforded the appellant 10 days to respond. He requested a 30-day extension, and the agency granted his request. On the last day of the extension period, the appellant submitted a written response to the notice in which he also requested an opportunity to make an oral response. The core of due process is the right to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Erickson</span>, 522 U.S. 262, 266 (1998). We find that, under the circumstance, the agency's failure to afford the appellant an additional delay to make an oral response did not deny the appellant's due process rights of notice and an opportunity to reply. Much of this reasoning applies with equal force to whether the agency committed harmful error by not affording him an oral reply. First, the record evidence does not support the conclusion that the time the agency provided for the reply was unreasonable. Also, there is no evidence to suggest that the agency denied the appellant the opportunity to make an oral reply within the 40 days allotted to him to respond to the notice of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There was no harmful error when a reply extension may have been inappropriately shortened, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0432-13-4620-I-1 (NP 9/8/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the July 16, 2013 notice of proposed removal advised the appellant of her right to respond to the proposed action within 14 calendar days and provided the deciding official's name and contact information. On July 24, 2013, the appellant's union representative requested an 8-day extension of time to furnish a response to the proposed removal on the appellant's behalf. The deciding official granted a 6-day extension, allowing the appellant until the close of business on Monday, August 5, 2013, to provide a response to the proposed removal. Neither the appellant, nor her union representative, made an oral or written response within that period. On the morning of August 6, 2013, the union representative emailed the deciding official, asking permission to submit a response by close of business. The deciding official denied his request and issued a decision letter that same day imposing the proposed removal effective August 17, 2013. In the afternoon on August 6, 2013, the union representative emailed the deciding official a brief response to the proposed removal. However, the deciding official did not consider the late response in reaching his decision to impose the removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As described in the preceding paragraph, the administrative judge found, and the appellant does not dispute on review, that the agency afforded the appellant 20 days to respond to the proposed removal but she did not submit a response within that timeframe. We find that 20 days is a reasonable amount of time to respond to the proposed action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 685-86 (1991) (finding that a 5&#8209;day period to respond to a notice of proposed separation afforded the appellant minimum due process). The appellant's assertions on review that the deciding official acted unreasonably in denying her requested extensions are inapposite to this finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the deciding official erred by granting only 6 of the 8 additional days requested or by denying the appellant's second request to submit a response out-of-time by close of business on August 6, 2013, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant has failed to establish that any such error was harmful. On review, the appellant argues that it is "possible" that the deciding official would have reached a different conclusion if the appellant had received an extension to the response period. However, to establish that a procedural error is harmful, the appellant must show by preponderant evidence that the error was <span class="Italic">likely</span> to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error, not merely that it was <span class="Italic">possible</span>. <span class="Italic">See Towne</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 239, &#x00B6; 24. The appellant has failed to allege, much less show by preponderant evidence, that the deciding official likely would have reached a different conclusion on the proposed removal if the appellant had received the requested extensions. Accordingly, we find no basis to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to establish her affirmative defense.</p>
