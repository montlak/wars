<h3 class="h3" id="sec13-177"><span class="space">E.</span> OSC CORRECTIVE ACTION PETITION</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 1214(b)(2)(B), the Office of Special Counsel, upon an investigative determination that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is about to occur, reports that determination along with recommendations for corrective action to the Board, the agency involved, and OPM. OSC may also report the findings and recommendations to the President. If, after what OSC deems a reasonable period of time, the recommendations are not implemented, a petition for corrective action against the agency can be filed by OSC with the Board. OSC's request for corrective action may be broadly stated to include "appropriate corrective action," in addition to specific action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 1214(b) provides the requisite components of the OSC corrective action case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)(A)(i)&#x2003;Except as provided under clause (ii), no later than 240 days after the date of receiving an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice under paragraph (1), the Special Counsel shall make a determination whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; If the Special Counsel is unable to make the required determination within the 240-day period specified under clause (i) and the person submitting the allegation of a prohibited personnel practice agrees to an extension of time, the determination shall be made within such additional period of time as shall be agreed upon between the Special Counsel and the person submitting the allegation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(B)&#x2003;If, in connection with any investigation, the Special Counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken which requires corrective action, the Special Counsel shall report the determination together with any findings or recommendations to the Board, the agency involved and to the Office of Personnel Management, and may report such determination, findings and recommendations to the President. The Special Counsel may include in the report recommendations for corrective action to be taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(C)&#x2003;If, after a reasonable period of time, the agency does not act to correct the prohibited personnel practice, the Special Counsel may petition the Board for corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(D)&#x2003;If the Special Counsel finds, in consultation with the individual subject to the prohibited personnel practice, that the agency has acted to correct the prohibited personnel practice, the Special Counsel shall file such finding with the Board, together with any written comments which the individual may provide.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(E)&#x2003;A determination by the Special Counsel under this paragraph shall not be cited or referred to in any proceeding under this paragraph or any other administrative or judicial proceeding for any purpose, without the consent of the person submitting the allegation of a prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;Whenever the Special Counsel petitions the Board for corrective action, the Board shall provide an opportunity for--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(A)&#x2003;oral or written comments by the Special Counsel, the agency involved, and the Office of Personnel Management; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(B)&#x2003;written comments by any individual who alleges to be the subject of the prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)(A)&#x2003;The Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate, if the Board determines that the Special Counsel has demonstrated that a prohibited personnel practice, other than one described in section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), has occurred, exists, or is to be taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(B)(i) Subject to the provisions of clause (ii), in any case involving an alleged prohibited personnel practice as described under section 2302(b)(8)or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), the Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate if the Special Counsel has demonstrated that a disclosure or protected activity described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken against the individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; Corrective action under clause (i) may not be ordered if, after a finding that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor, the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board determines the specific relief to order under its original jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 62 MSPR 26 (1994). "Corrective action generally requires cancellation of the improper action and a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>." <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

In <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, the Board avoided directing a posting on the theory that everyone already knew about the agency's First Amendment violations as a result of "numerous published court opinions." <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel and Hubbard v. EPA</span>, 79 MSPR 542, 555 n.8 (1998) (reiterating the reasons for not issuing a cease and desist order). The Federal Circuit considered it of significance in the EPA litigation that OSC did not seek the posting (it was sought by Mr. Hubbard, the victim of the prohibited personnel practice). Whatever the corrective action recommended, only the Special Counsel <span id="Page_3945"></span>has the role of obtaining voluntary compliance or of initiating enforcement (corrective action) litigation. Employees do not have a private right of action to enforce Special Counsel recommendations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Patrick v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 6 MSPR 247, 250-51, 6 MSPB 213 (1981) ("Appellant has presented no statutory or regulatory basis to support her contention that the recommendations of the Special Counsel should have been treated as limitations on the agency's discretion to conduct the RIF.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are several distinctions between an OSC corrective action and a disciplinary action. First, in a disciplinary action, OSC seeks punitive measures against the person or persons responsible for committing the alleged prohibited personnel practice. In a corrective action, in contrast, the relief sought by OSC can include restoration of the wronged employee and a change in agency procedures to prevent future occurrences. Second, in a disciplinary action case, the respondent is the employee who has recommended, taken, or approved the alleged prohibited personnel practice. In a corrective action case, the respondent is the agency. Corrective action may also be substantially broader than a specific personnel action; systemic abuses may be remedied. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. MSPB</span>, 205 F.3d 1315, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Congress intended to provide the Board with broad discretion in the type and scope of the corrective action ordered, if any); <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR 163, 1 MSPB 159, 197-98 (1979) ("Our finding that a prohibited personnel practice was committed by the Marshals Service with respect to Robert Frazier requires us to address the issue of whether and to what extent corrective action is warranted. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; l206(c)(l)(B) provides that the Board 'may order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate.' Words such as 'may' and 'consider appropriate' show a clear Congressional intent to provide the Board with broad discretion in the type and scope of the corrective action ordered, if any."). Third, in a disciplinary case, should OSC not prevail against the respondent employee, that employee may seek a counsel fee award against the employing agency under 5 USC 1204(m)(1). (Before 2012 those fees could be assessed against OSC.) A corrective action case by OSC against an agency does not provide the prevailing agency the opportunity to seek a counsel fee award against OSC. Additionally, while an OSC disciplinary case must be heard by an ALJ, a corrective action case may be heard by an ALJ or it may be heard by an administrative judge.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;PROCEDURES GOVERNING CORRECTIVE ACTION CASES</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn, then, to the merits. The provisions of the CSRA governing corrective actions lack both the detail and the historical background of other sections of the Act. Accordingly, we must begin by briefly exploring the purposes of this new type of proceeding. In that effort, we are guided not only by our usual policy of deferring to an agency's interpretation of its enabling act, but especially by the requirement that we pay heed to the "contemporaneous construction of a (new) statute by (those) charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion, of making the parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are yet untried and new."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Nature of the Proceeding</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While petitioners seem to view the Special Counsel as both "public defender" for federal employees and the final judge of whistleblowing claims, the Board conceives the Special Counsel more as a prosecutor charged with vindicating the Act's goal of achieving a fair, efficient, and lawfully-conducted Civil Service. The Board thus draws a significant distinction between the purpose of a corrective action proceeding and that of a Chapter 77 appeal. While appeals concern personal employment disputes, the Board argues, the "thrust (of corrective action petitions) is toward systemic, not individual problems in the federal merit system...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's analysis of the Special Counsel's role is supported by the language and legislative history of the Act. It is evident on the face of the statute that the Special Counsel may seek to remedy prohibited practices that do not aggrieve any particular employee. Moreover, even in cases initiated by a complaining employee, the Special Counsel can apparently make compromises with the agency involved, seek corrective action short of that requested by the complainant, and, we assume, refuse to pursue the case at all.[41] Quite clearly, then, the duties of the Special Counsel are not equivalent to those of an employees' advocate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[41]&#x2003;We express no view on whether employees have a right to challenge the Special Counsel's decision not to bring a corrective action petition or to settle a case with the agency involved...NLRB, 626 F.2d 354 (4th Cir. 1980), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 449 U.S. 1080, 101 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, the authors of the CSRA apparently expected the Special Counsel to act as an ombudsman responsible for investigating and prosecuting violations of the Act.[42] The Special Counsel was modeled after the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) who performs an independent prosecutorial role with respect to employment relations in the private sector.[43] Furthermore, the reports and debates concerning the CSRA are replete with characterizations of the Special Counsel as a "prosecutor" or "watchdog" of merit system abuses.[44] In short, if Chapter 77 appeals can be analogized to civil proceedings in which the immediate interests are personal to the litigants, corrective action petitions are comparable to criminal prosecutions designed to vindicate the <span class="Italic">public</span> interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[42]&#x2003;The Special Counsel may, for example, seek disciplinary action against individual employees by bringing a complaint to the Board.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On this view of the Act, the principal recourse for individual employees who have suffered cognizable injury from a personnel action is to a Chapter 77 appeal--and not to the office of Special Counsel. But <span class="Italic">see</span> note 41 <span class="Italic">supra</span>. There will, of course, be many instances in which the interests of the Special Counsel and of a particular employee converge. An individual improperly discharged for whistleblowing, for example, could presumably seek the assistance of the Special Counsel in a Chapter 77 appeal[45] or forego that route entirely and rely on the Special Counsel to remedy the separation through a corrective action petition. Moreover, the Board may possess authority to merge corrective action and Chapter 77 appeals when they arise from the same set of facts.[46] Even in situations like those posited, however, the roles of the individual employee and the Special Counsel may differ. While the former seeks personal restoration, the latter is fundamentally concerned with the integrity of the merit system. As the Senate Report explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Special Counsel should not passively await employee complaints, but rather, vigorously pursue merit system abuses on a systematic basis. He should seek action by the Merit Board to eliminate both individual instances of merit abuse and patterns of prohibited personnel practices.[47]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[45]&#x2003;Section 1206(i) grants the Special Counsel the right to "intervene or otherwise participate in any proceeding before the Merit Systems Protection Board...." Reassignments are not among the personnel actions explicitly made appealable to the Board by statute or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[46]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also</span> section 7701(f) (permitting the Board to consolidate appeals if that would allow cases to be "processed more expeditiously and would not adversely affect any party"). In the event of such a merger, the Board could not, of course deprive an employee of the procedural safeguards to which he or she would be entitled under Chapter 77.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">B. <span class="Italic">The Evidentiary Hearing</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having established the nature of the new corrective action proceeding and the role of the Special Counsel, we can now consider petitioners' various challenges to the procedures employed by the Board. Petitioners' first claim is that the Board exceeded its authority in conducting an evidentiary hearing on the facts underlying the deputies' allegations. Instead, they argue, the Board was bound by the legal and factual conclusions of the Special Counsel and was limited to determining the appropriate remedy. In response, the Board contends that the authority of the Special Counsel extends only to investigation and prosecution and that all adjudicatory power is lodged in the Board itself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board. As outlined above, the language and history of the Act consistently describe the Special Counsel in terms that suggest a prosecutor rather than a judge. The same sources clearly assign adjudicatory functions to the Board. Section 1205(a)(1) of the Act, for instance, grants the Board comprehensive power to hear and adjudicate <span id="Page_3946"></span>all matters within its purview.[48] With respect to petitions brought by the Special Counsel, section 1208 gives the Board final authority to issue stays and section 1207 requires the Board to conduct a hearing when the Special Counsel's complaint is directed at an individual. <span class="Italic">See</span> note 42 <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[48]&#x2003;Section 1205(a)(1) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003; The Merit Systems Protection Board shall--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;hear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or adjudication, of all matters with the jurisdiction of the Board under this title, section 2023 of title 38, or any other law, rule, or regulation, and, subject to otherwise applicable provisions of law, take final action on any such matter....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the corrective action section itself is cast in terms that evoke a prosecutor-judge relationship between the Special Counsel and the Board. When the Special Counsel finds "<span class="Italic">reasonable grounds</span> to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken," he or she "may request" action by the Board. Section 1206(c)(1)(A) &#x0026; (B) (emphasis added). The Board correctly points out that these phrases are typically employed in defining the standard for bringing an enforcement action.[49] Together with the constant references in the legislative history to the Board's "quasi-judicial" role,[50] the Act's language undermines petitioners' argument that the Special Counsel's determinations are binding on the Board.[51]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[49]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 42 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000a-5 &#x0026; 2000e-6 (authorizing Attorney General to bring civil action when he or she has "reasonable cause to believe" a pattern or practice of discrimination exists); 7 USC &#x00A7; 2305(b) (permitting Secretary of Agriculture to request that Attorney General bring civil action when Secretary has "reasonable cause to believe" that there has been a violation of section 2303); 42 USC &#x00A7; 2824(d) (instructing Director of Community Services Administration to hold hearing when he or she has "reasonable cause to believe" that state agencies are violating the law).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[51]&#x2003;Another indication that Congress intended the Board to evaluate the Special Counsel's determinations is found in the history of the provision granting the Special Counsel authority to seek stays of personnel actions. The Senate version required the Special Counsel to petition the Board for a stay while the House version allowed the Special Counsel to order a stay for up to 30 days without consultation with the Board. In conference, the Senate's approach was adopted because of a belief that "the Board, as a quasi-judicial body, is the appropriate authority to issue the stay." Conference Report at 133, U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, p. 2866, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> II Legislative History at 1975. Both the Senate and the conference reports instructed the Board to give "great weight" to the Special Counsel's findings in support of stay. Senate Report at 30, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> II Legislative History at 1975. Clearly, then, the Special Counsel's determinations were not meant to bind the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of its broad responsibility to adjudicate merit system disputes, the Board certainly has authority to conduct evidentiary hearings in appropriate cases. As previously noted, section 1205(a)(1) allows the Board to "hear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or adjudication, of all matters within (its) jurisdiction...." While the corrective action sections do not require a hearing when the respondent is an agency rather than an individual,[52] we have often emphasized that agencies may "adopt procedures beyond the minima explicitly prescribed by statute." <span class="Italic">FTC v. Brigadier Industries Corp.</span>, 613 F.2d 1110, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 1979). <span class="Italic">See also Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v.

In light of the serious factual disputes and credibility issues raised by the Special Counsel's petition, we believe the Board acted reasonably in ordering a hearing in this case.</p>
