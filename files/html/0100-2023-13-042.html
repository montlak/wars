<h2 class="h2" id="sec5-43"><span class="space">V.</span> PERMISSIVE SUBJECTS OF BARGAINING; EXECUTIVE ORDERS 12871, 13522, 13,836, 14,003</h2>
<p class="noindent">The Statute gives management the right not to bargain about some subjects, with the exception that management may, for some of those subjects, bargain if it elects to do so. 5 USC 7106(b)(1). Under 5 USC 7106(b)(1), the agency need not bargain, unless it so chooses, on the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty, or on the technology, methods, and means of performing work. Under <span class="Italic">FOP Lodge 1F and VAMC Providence, R.I.</span>, 57 FLRA 373, 376 (2001), a proposal requiring negotiation of permissible subjects of negotiation is itself negotiable at the election of the agency.(Proposal 1(c)). Discussion of permissive, or elective, bargaining issues most frequently develops as to objections by agencies to union bargaining proposals (or ULP charges asserting bargaining failures). Some bargaining proposals advanced by agencies may be objected to by unions that decline to bargain over matters that infringe unions' statutory rights. An example is a proposal that a union waive midterm bargaining. The union may agree to the proposal (or its equivalent, a zipper clause), but because a statutory right to bargain is involved, the agency's proposal involves an area of permissive and not mandatory bargaining. <span class="Italic">See AFGE v. FLRA,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20220128086">24 F.4th 666</a> (D.C. Cir. 2022) (discussed in the section of Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-718.html#sec6-719">Reopener, Zipper Clauses</a>.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The recent history of permissive bargaining is largely written in executive orders.</p>
<p class="noindent">President Biden's Executive Order 14,003 of January 22, 2021, directed agencies to bargain permissive matters:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 4. Ensuring the Right to Engage in Collective Bargaining. The head of each agency subject to the provisions of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, shall elect to negotiate over the subjects set forth in 5 U.S.C. 7106(b)(1) and shall instruct subordinate officials to do the same.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_540"></span>How FLRA will construe that provision will be seen, for the Order has limitations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 7. General Provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. </p>
<p class="noindent-2">I &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x2003;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. </p>
<p class="noindent">On March 5, 2021, OPM issued <a href="https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidance-implementation-executive-order-14003-protecting-federal-workforce">Guidance for Implementation of Executive Order 14003--Protecting the Federal Workforce</a>, in part providing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ensuring the Right to Engage in Collective Bargaining</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4 of the EO provides that "[t]he head of each agency subject to the provisions of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, shall elect to negotiate over the subjects set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) and shall instruct subordinate officials to do the same."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These subjects cover the numbers, types and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty, and the technology, methods and means of performing work. A failure by agency managers to engage in bargaining over the subjects covered by 5 U.S.C. 7106(b)(1) would be inconsistent with the President's Directive. Therefore, in order to carry out the policy decision of the President reflected in the EO, agencies must commence bargaining in good faith over all of these subjects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Bargaining over &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) subjects should occur with the following principles in mind:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1)&#x2003;Agency and union representatives will bargain over &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) subjects in good faith with the objective of reaching an agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2)&#x2003;In the event the parties are unable to reach an agreement, either party may seek the assistance of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) as well as any other mutually agreed-upon dispute resolution process in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119(a). Every effort should be made to reach agreements that address the interests of both parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3)&#x2003;If FMCS assistance does not result in an agreement, either party may, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119(b), take the impasse to the Federal Service Impasses Panel to resolve the impasse or to an arbitrator agreed upon by the parties to resolve the impasse under procedures approved by the Panel.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4)&#x2003;In the event of an agency head review of a Panel-ordered resolution, the agency may not disapprove the Panel-ordered resolution because it is a &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) subject. </p>
<p class="noindent-2">5)&#x2003;In order to implement the policies of the Executive Order, agencies shall agree to bargain over the substance of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) subjects, whether at the union's request (e.g. midterm bargaining request) or as the result of a proposed agency action (e.g. union responding to an agency notice of a pending change subject to collective bargaining).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because bargaining over these subjects has most recently been at the discretion of the agency, it may be a new experience for some management and union representatives, and OPM is available to provide technical assistance to support implementation of this policy.</p>
<p class="noindent">Additional comments were offered by OPM in its memo for human capital officers of July 23, 2021, <a href="https://www.chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/CPM%202021-17%20Additional%20Guidance%20on%20Post-Reentry%20Personnel%20Policies%20and%20Work%20Environment.pdf">Additional Guidance on Post-Reentry Personnel Policies and Work Environment</a>, involving telework-related negotiations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Q 30.&#x2003;How does the EO 14003 direction to bargain over permissive subjects contained in 5 USC 7106(b)(1) impact agency plans to return workers to their official office of record?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Agencies are reminded that Section 4 of Executive Order (EO) 14003 provides that "[t]he head of each agency subject to the provisions of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, shall elect to negotiate over the subjects set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) and shall instruct subordinate officials to do the same." OPM's guidance regarding implementation of EO 14003 is found here: <a href="https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidance-implementation-executive-order-14003-protectingfederal-workforce">https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidance-implementation-executive-order-14003-protectingfederal-workforce</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The subjects set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) include:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022;&#x2003;the numbers, types, and grades of employees assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022;&#x2003;the technology, methods, and means of performing work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Through various decisions, the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) has provided some explanation of these subjects over the years:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022;&#x2003;"Numbers, types, and grades" concerns the establishment of agency staffing patterns, or the allocation of staff, to agency subdivisions, work projects, or work shifts;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">&#x2022;&#x2003;"Numbers" refers to the number of employees or staff to be assigned duties (to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty);</p>
<p class="noindent-3">&#x2022;&#x2003;"Types" refers to distinguishable classes, kinds, groups or categories of employees or positions that are relevant to the establishment of staffing patterns (for any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty);</p>
<p class="noindent-3">&#x2022;&#x2003;"Grades" refers to the grades of employees to be assigned duties (to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty)[1];</p>
<p class="noindent-3">&#x2022;&#x2003;"Organizational subdivision" refers to the organizational structure;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">&#x2022;&#x2003;"Work project" means a particular job or task;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">&#x2022;&#x2003;"Tour of duty" refers to periods when employees are on duty or hours of work shifts;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022;&#x2003;"Technology" has been construed to refer to the technical method an agency will use in accomplishing or furthering the performance of its work; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022;&#x2003;"Method" has been construed to refer to the way in which an agency performs its work;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022;&#x2003;"Means" has been construed to refer to any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[1]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(14) excludes "the classification of any position" from "conditions of employment" for determining when matters are subject to collective bargaining. Generally, "numbers, types, and grades" are considered together when discussing establishment of agency staffing patterns. For example, a union may seek to negotiate that a certain "type" of employee be assigned to a "work project." Typically, a specific 'type' of employee has a position description containing the duties of the job along with the job title and occupational series. Based on those duties, the job has already been classified by the agency at a particular grade level.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consistent with the direction by the President to agencies, there may be any number of topics unions may raise in the collective bargaining process that fall under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) and that agencies must collectively bargain over pursuant to the direction by the President. Examples include, but are not limited to proposals concerning:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022;&#x2003;Agency staffing patterns or the allocation of staff-this may be relevant to determining how many or the types of employees to assign work on specific work assignments or during a particular work shift; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022;&#x2003;Technology-a union may seek to negotiate over the agency providing a particular type of technology to assist employees in accomplishment or performance of their work.</p>
<p class="noindent">In accordance with EO 14003, agency and union representatives will bargain over these subjects in good faith with the objective of reaching an agreement or request assistance of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and Federal Service Impasses Panel to resolve the impasse.</p>
<p class="noindent">By the now-revoked Executive Order 13,836 of May 25, 2018, at <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11913/developing-efficient-effective-and-cost--reducing-approaches-to-federal-sector-collective-bargaining">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11913/developing-efficient-effective-and-cost--reducing-approaches-to-federal-sector-collective-bargaininging</a>, "Developing Efficient, Effective, and Cost-Reducing Approaches to Federal Sector Collective Bargaining," President Trump precluded agencies from negotiating over permissive subjects:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 6. Permissive Bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The heads of agencies subject to the provisions of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, may not negotiate over the substance of the subjects set forth in section 7106(b)(1) of title 5, United States Code, and shall instruct subordinate officials that they may not negotiate over those same subjects.</p>
<p class="noindent">Portions of the 2018 executive order were successfully challenged in district court, enjoining operation of Section 6. <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Trump</span>, 318 F.

The decision was appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That court vacated the district court's decision.

<p class="noindent">In 1993 the President issued Executive Order 12871, "Labor-Management Partnerships," [58 Fed. Reg. 52201-52203, <span class="Italic">post</span>]. Exec. Order 12871 was revoked on February 17, 2001, by Executive Order 13203 [66 Fed. Reg. 11227]. Section 3 of Exec. Order 13203 provides that agency heads shall move to rescind order, rules, or policies enforcing Exec. Order 12871. Section 4 of Exec. Order 13203 provides that "[n]othing in this order shall abrogate any collective bargaining agreements in effect on the date of this order." EO 12871 is discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Permissive bargaining becomes important when it is conducted, often at a local level, and the agency then seeks to disapprove provisions though agency head review under 5 USC 7114. If an agency elects to bargain over matters that are permissive, FLRA will not entertain a negotiability challenge based on an argument that the provision is contrary to a management right. When a local activity bargains over permissive matters, the agency is bound by that choice, unless there is an inconsistency with law or regulation. The D.C. Circuit explained this in <span class="Italic">ACT, Montana Air Chap. No. 29 v. FLRA</span>, 22 F.3d 1150, 1153-56 (D.C. Cir. 1994), involving the disapproval of a contract clause permitting civilian technicians to wear standard civilian attire in place of a uniform:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plain language of the statute provides that the agency head "shall" approve an executed agreement "if the agreement is in accordance with the provisions of applicable law, rule, or regulation." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7114I(2). The word "shall" generally indicates a command that admits of no discretion on the part of the person instructed to carry out the directive....&#8197;So here, too, the statute clearly orders that unless the agreement is unlawful or in violation of a rule or regulation, the head of the agency shall approve the agreement and permit it to go into effect. The agency head, then, is not given free reign to prune collective bargaining agreements where local negotiators have come to legally viable arrangements.</p>
<p class="noindent">[Refer to Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-12-024.html#sec4-25">Permissive Subject</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-12-022.html#sec4-23">Disapproval of Agreement by Agency Head</a>," for permissive bargaining and agency head review of locally negotiated agreements.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Disapproval at the national level of permissively bargained subjects notwithstanding, most of the law on permissive subjects of bargaining was developed under Exec. Order 12871. Section 2(d) of that Order directed the head of each agency to "negotiate over the subjects set forth in 5 USC 7106(b)(1)" and "instruct subordinate officials to do the same." With the caution that the law that follows must be considered in conjunction with the revocation resulting from Exec. Order 13203, and the revocation, noted earlier by Exec. Order 13812, Exec. Order 12871 is set out below:</p>

Labor-management partnerships will champion change in Federal Government agencies to transform them into organizations capable of delivering the highest quality services to the American people.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that, by precluding it from assigning dental assistant duties to lab technicians and otherwise limiting its discretion to determine which employees should perform, and/or should be hired to perform, such duties, all the proposals interfere with its rights, under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute, to hire, direct employees, assign work, and determine the personnel by which its operations are conducted. The Agency contends that Proposal 3 also interferes with its right under section 7106(a)(1) to determine its mission because it "would determine the Dental Service hours of operation for this aspect of patient care."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Union</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that the proposals would relieve GS-8 lab technicians from performing lower-graded dental assistant duties. The Union argues that each of the proposals involves a matter that is encompassed by section 7106(b)(1). In the Union's view, the Agency is required to bargain over the proposals under Executive Order 12871.[5] The Union contends that it does not intend that dental assistant duties could never be assigned to lab technicians and that the Agency has misrepresented the intent of the proposals in this regard.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Introduction</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear from the submissions in this case that, in addition to disagreeing about whether the proposals are negotiable under the Statute, the parties disagree about which provision of the Statute governs this negotiability determination. In particular, the arguments advanced by the Agency and the Union focus on different provisions of the Statute relevant to the scope of Federal sector collective bargaining. According to the Agency, each of the proposals fits squarely within the terms of, and is thereby precluded from negotiation by, various provisions in section 7106(a) of the Statute. The Union, on the other hand, contends that the proposals fit squarely within the terms of section 7106(b)(1) and, therefore, are negotiable at the election of the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the confusion apparent in the parties' submissions concerning which provision of the Statute governs the negotiability of these proposals, we take this opportunity to clarify how the statutory provisions invoked by each party relate to one another. In particular, the parties' disagreement over whether these proposals are governed by section 7106(a) or section 7106(b)(1) raises a threshold question as to the circumstances, if any, under which proposals need to be analyzed under both provisions. This would be required, for example, if proposals that are negotiable at the election of an agency under section 7106(b)(1), as the Union contends is the case with each of the proposals at issue here, are nevertheless precluded from negotiation if they also affect the exercise of authority by Agency management to take actions enumerated in section 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Relationship Between Sections 7106(a) and 7106(b</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Statutory Language</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our analysis begins, as it must, with the language of the Statute itself. Section 7106 of the Statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x00A7; 7106.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Management rights</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;Subject to subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;to determine the mission...; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;in accordance with applicable laws--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(A)&#x2003;to hire...;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(B)&#x2003;to assign work...</p>
<p class="noindent-3">I &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x2003;with respect to filling positions, to make selections for appointments....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;Nothing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;at the election of the agency, on the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty, or on the technology, methods, and means of performing work;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(3)&#x2003;appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under this section by such management officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to this provision, an agency's authority to exercise the rights enumerated in section 7106(a) is expressly made "subject to" section 7106(b). Thus, the section setting forth the authority of agency management begins with the statement that such authority is limited by subsection (b). Consistent with the statement of this limitation in section 7106(a), section 7106(b) begins with the statement that "[n]othing in [section 7106] shall preclude an agency" from negotiating over the matters set forth in the three subsections that follow. This language compels the conclusion that, where a proposal concerns a matter encompassed within section 7106(b), it is negotiable, consistent with the terms of subsections (b)(1), (2), or (3), even though it may also affect the exercise of authority by a management official to take actions enumerated in section 7106(a). This would mean that, where a proposal addresses matters that come within the terms of both sections 7106(a) and 7106(b)(1), it is subject to negotiation at the election of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Legislative History</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history surrounding the enactment of the Statute supports this interpretation.&#x2003;The language enacted as subsection (b)(1) was first introduced in the so-called "Udall substitute," which became the final House version of H.R. 11280. The sectional analysis of the Udall substitute makes clear the intent "that nothing in the 'Management rights' section shall preclude any agency and any [union] from negotiating [the matters enumerated in subsection (b)(1)]." 124 Cong. Rec. 29,183, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> <span class="Italic">Legislative History of the</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, Title VII</span> <span class="Italic">of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</span> (Comm. Print 1979) (<span class="Italic">Legislative History</span>) at 925. Similarly, Congressman Ford explained that, as part of the balance Congress struck between "management rights" and collective bargaining, agencies were given the ability to elect to negotiate on the subjects contained in subsection (b)(1). 124 Cong. Rec. 29,195, <span class="Italic">reprinted in Legislative History</span> at 949. Thus, rights reserved to management under section 7106(a) were made "[s]ubject to" such election. <span class="Italic">See Overseas Education</span> <span class="Italic">Association, Inc. v. FLRA</span>, 876 F.2d 960, 965 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">OEA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Judicial Interpretations</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">This construction of section 7106 is consistent not only with the express terms of the Statute and our reading of the legislative history, but also with the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians, Montana Air Chapter</span> <span class="Italic">No. 29 v. FLRA</span>, 22 F.3d 1150, 1155 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (<span class="Italic">Montana</span> <span class="Italic">ACT</span>). In that case, the court relied on the statutory language in subsections (a) and (b)(1) set forth above--language which the court found "could not have been expressed more clearly...<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The court reversed the Authority's contrary conclusion, reached without explanation, in <span class="Italic">National Guard Bureau</span>, <span class="Italic">Alexandria, Virginia</span>, 45 FLRA 506 (1992). For the reasons stated in this decision, we agree with the court. Accordingly, insofar as <span class="Italic">National Guard</span> Bureau is inconsistent with this decision, it will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, as the court in <span class="Italic">Montana ACT</span> noted, this interpretation of section 7106(b)(1) is also consistent with court decisions addressing the relationship between section 7106(a) and section 7106(b)(2) and (b)(3). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1155. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit had established, prior to <span class="Italic">Montana</span> <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, that it viewed section 7106(a) management rights as subordinate to the provisions of section 7106(b). In analyzing section 7106(b)(2) and (b)(3), the court found it "clear that a proposal advancing either a procedure or an appropriate arrangement for adversely affected employees falls within the scope of an agency's duty to bargain, <span class="Italic">notwithstanding that implementation of the proposal would</span> <span class="Italic">affect the enumerated managerial rights</span> [in section 7106(a)]<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923 v. FLRA</span>, 819 F.2d 306, 308 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (emphasis added)). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, the court, holding that employees were "adversely affected" by management's exercise of a reserved management right under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, stated that "section 7106(b) authorizes bargaining over proposals in either of three categories <span class="Italic">notwithstanding</span> <span class="Italic">some intrusion on [s]</span> <span class="Italic">ection 7106(a) prerogatives."</span> 876 F.2d at 962 (emphasis added). <span class="Italic">See also Overseas Education Association</span> <span class="Italic">v. FLRA</span>, 961 F.2d 36, 39 (2d Cir. 1992). The court in <span class="Italic">Montana ACT</span> concluded that it knew "of nothing supporting the conclusion that while matters <span id="page_544"></span>negotiable under subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) may pertain to subsection (a), subjects negotiable under subsection (b)(1) may not." <span class="Italic">Montana</span> <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, 22 F.3d at 1155.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude, in agreement with the D.C. Circuit, that "&#x00A7; 7106(b) <span class="Italic">is</span> indisputably an exception to &#x00A7; 7106(a)<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analytical Framework for Determining the Negotiability of Proposals Raising Issues Under Section 7106(a) and Section 7106(b)(1</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the foregoing conclusion that matters encompassed by the terms of section 7106(b)(1) constitute exceptions to the rights set forth in section 7106(a), a determination that a proposal is negotiable at the election of the agency under section 7106(b)(1) obviates the need to also analyze the proposal under section 7106(a). Therefore, where, as in this case, parties disagree about which of these sections govern the negotiability of a particular proposal, the Authority will determine initially whether the proposal concerns matters within the subjects set forth in section 7106(b)(1). If it does, we will not address contentions that those matters also affect the exercise of management's authorities under section 7106(a).[10] Conversely, if we conclude that a proposal does not concern matters within the subjects set forth in section 7106(b)(1), we will then proceed to analyze it under the appropriate subsection of section 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;We will, of course, continue to address, as necessary, other agency arguments regarding the negotiability of a proposal, including arguments that the proposal conflicts with other sections of the Statute or a law other than the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal concerns a matter within the subjects set forth in section 7106(b)(1), we will analyze whether the proposal falls within one of the two categories stated in that section. The first category relates to: i) the numbers, types, and grades; [11] ii) of employees or positions; iii) assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty. The second category relates to the technology, methods, and means of performing work. The case now before the Authority involves proposals asserted to be within the subjects in the first category.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;Although this phrase is written in the conjunctive, the Authority has consistently interpreted it to mean that a matter is included within section 7106(b)(1) if it relates to numbers, types, <span class="Italic">or</span> grades of employees or positions. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 66 and Internal Revenue Service, Kansas City Service Center</span>, 1 FLRA 927, 929-30 (1979).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, section 2424.10(b) of the Authority's Regulations pertinently provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If the Authority finds that the duty to bargain extends to the matter proposed to be bargained only at the election of the agency, the Authority shall so state and issue an order dismissing the petition for review of the negotiability issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with this regulation, we will dismiss the petition for review as to any proposal that is found negotiable at the election of the Agency under section 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 2</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">Move Full Time Employee Equivalent (FTEE) (temporarily) to provide coverage of the Dental Assistant[']s duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2 requires the Agency to move an FTEE to the Dental Service, which the record establishes is an organizational subdivision. As such, the proposal would add one position to that organizational subdivision. It is clear from their supplemental statements that both parties understand the proposal to mean that the new position will be filled, thus also adding one employee. This construction is consistent with the language of the proposal, which expressly states that the position will be relocated to "provide coverage" of the dental assistant duties. Under this interpretation, the proposal concerns the <span class="Italic">numbers</span> of <span class="Italic">employees and positions</span> assigned to an <span class="Italic">organizational subdivision</span>. As such, it concerns a matter within the first category of subjects set forth in section 7106(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Bureau of Indian Affairs Council and Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs</span>, 31 FLRA 3, 6 (1988). Consequently, we find that Proposal 2 is negotiable at the election of the Agency and we do not reach the Agency's contentions as to section 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 3</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">Extend part-time Dental Assistant[']s hours to provide coverage of the Dental Assistant[']s duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Negotiability of Proposal 3 Under Section</span> <span class="Italic">7106(b)(1</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 3 seeks to extend the hours of work of the part-time dental assistant to permit that employee to perform the same duties he or she is now performing, but for a longer period of time. As the same employee would be performing the dental assistant work, nothing in the proposal would affect either the type or the grade of the employee to whom those duties would be assigned. Similarly, as the dental assistant is already assigned to the Dental Service, nothing in the proposal would affect either the number, types, or grades of employees or positions assigned to an organizational subdivision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the proposal would expand the number of hours worked by that employee. The hours of an employee's workday or workweek are defined by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.102(h) as the employee's "tour of duty." Specifically, "tour of duty" means "the hours of a day (a daily tour of duty) and the days of an administrative workweek (a weekly tour of duty) that constitute an employee's regularly scheduled administrative workweek<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The Authority has relied on this definition, <span class="Italic">for example, Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Base</span>,<span class="Italic"> Illinois</span>, 33 FLRA 532, 541-43 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd as to other</span> <span class="Italic">matters</span>, 893 F.2d 380 (D.C. Cir. 1990), to hold that proposals mandating changes in the hours of individual employees' work shifts are within the ambit of section 7106(b)(1) because they increase the number of employees assigned to the new tour of duty and correspondingly decrease the numbers assigned to the prior tours. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">Accord</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2145 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Hunter Holmes McGuire Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia</span>, 48 FLRA 53, 59 (1993); <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R12-33 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Pacific Missile Test Center, Point Mugu, California</span>, 40 FLRA 479, 484-85 (1991) and cases cited therein.[16]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;We recognize that in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local RI-109 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Newington, Connecticut</span>, 38 FLRA 211, 220 (1990) the Authority concluded that a proposal requiring the agency to use full-time, rather than part-time, employees to perform work on certain tours of duty was not encompassed by section 7106(b)(1) because it did not affect the <span class="Italic">types</span> of employees assigned to a tour of duty. However, in that case, it was not argued that the proposal affected the <span class="Italic">numbers</span> of employees assigned to a tour of duty, and the Authority did not address that issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, one part-time dental assistant is currently assigned to an established tour of duty. Under Proposal 3, that dental assistant would be removed from his or her present tour of duty, as defined above, and assigned to a different tour of duty consisting of longer hours. Thus, the number of employees assigned to the original tour of duty would be reduced by one and the number of employees assigned to the new tour of duty would be increased by one. As this proposal seeks to change the <span class="Italic">number</span> of <span class="Italic">employees</span> assigned to both <span class="Italic">tours of duty</span>, consistent with Authority precedent, we conclude that it concerns a matter within the subjects set forth in section 7106(b)(1), and therefore is negotiable at the election of the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In establishing employees' basic workweeks and work schedules, agencies are governed by the provisions set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency correctly points out, 5 C.F.R. 610.121(b)(1) requires agencies to "schedule an employee's regularly scheduled administrative workweek so that it corresponds with the employee's actual work requirements." However, nothing in that provision or in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3) restricts an agency's discretion to establish what those work requirements will be. We have determined above that the Agency can elect to bargain over this proposal because it concerns a matter within the subjects set forth in section 7106(b)(1). If the Agency agrees to extend the hours of a part-time dental assistant to cover additional dental assistant duties, that dental assistant's administrative workweek would then presumably correspond with his or her work requirements. In these circumstances, and as the Agency makes no claim that there is insufficient work for which a part-time dental assistant is qualified, there is no basis on which to conclude that the proposal is inconsistent with the requirement that an employee's regularly scheduled administrative workweek correspond with the employee's actual work requirements. <span class="Italic">Cf. American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2022 and U.S. Department of the Army</span>, <span class="Italic">Headquarters, 101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell</span>, <span class="Italic">Kentucky</span>, 40 FLRA 371, 384-97 (1991) (Member Armendariz concurring) (if agency agreed to assign the work of cleaning up to employees, cleanup time would constitute compensable work for purposes of legal and regulatory provisions relating to hours of work).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Agency's argument concerning increased costs, the Agency relies on a phrase--"where costs would be substantially increased"--that appears in both 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a). However, the Agency has taken the phrase out of context. Under the plain wording of both the statute and the regulation, this phrase defines an exception to various requirements governing assignments to tours of duty, including notice periods, specific days during which work may be scheduled, and limits on the basic workweek <span id="page_545"></span>and basic nonovertime workday. Proposal 3 addresses a different matter: a change in a part-time employee's tour of duty to be scheduled by the Agency at its discretion. Therefore, we reject the Agency's argument that the phrase regarding costs serves to render this proposal in conflict with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a).</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1336 and SSA</span>, 52 FLRA 794, 798-801 (1996), followed up on <span class="Italic">VAMC</span> <span class="Italic">Lexington</span> by attempting to explain how FLRA would determine whether a nonseverable, multiple-component proposal constituted a permissive subject of bargaining. FLRA concluded it would be best to characterize the proposal for purposes of negotiability analysis by considering the dominant theme of the proposal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span>, the Authority set forth the approach that it would apply in negotiability disputes where parties disagree whether a proposal comes within the terms of section 7106(a) or 7106(b)(1). The Authority concluded that section 7106(b)(1) is an exception to section 7106(a). Consequently, where a proposal comes within the terms of both sections, it is subject to negotiation at the election of the agency. Under the approach articulated in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span>, the Authority first examines a contention that a proposal is electively bargainable under section 7106(b)(1). If the proposal concerns subjects set forth in section 7106(b)(1), the Authority does not address contentions that the proposal also affects the exercise of management's authorities under section 7106(a). If, however, a proposal is not encompassed by section 7106(b)(1), the Authority proceeds to analyze it under the appropriate subsection of section 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As was the case in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span>, the parties here disagree whether these proposals come within the terms of section 7106(a) or 7106(b)(1); however, these proposals are unlike those addressed in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span>. Although the proposals addressed in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span> were claimed to have ramifications with respect to more than one management right, they imposed a single requirement. In this case, by contrast, the proposals, as written and explained by the Union, impose two inseparable requirements: each proposal calls for the Agency to create an organizational subdivision; each also dictates the staffing assigned to the subdivision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the fact that each of these proposals has two distinguishable but inseparable requirements, the question becomes which of the two requirements the Authority should examine to determine whether the proposal addresses subjects set forth in section 7106(b)(1). In view of the analysis articulated in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span>, under which no inquiry is made as to section 7106(a) management rights once a proposal is determined to concern a section 7106(b)(1) subject, this question may be pivotal to disposition of the negotiability issue. In the interests of avoiding arbitrary decision making, and giving guidance to the parties, we describe here how we will determine the negotiability of a proposal that establishes two or more requirements that are not severable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering this case, we recognize that mechanical application of the principles articulated in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span> could lead to a determination that any proposal establishing a requirement encompassed by section 7106(b)(1) would be electively negotiable under that section, regardless of how central, or tangential, that particular requirement is to the intended operation of the proposal as a whole. This outcome would not only distort the <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span> framework, but would also disregard the balance Congress intended to strike between preserving genuine managerial prerogatives and "allow[ing] the flexibility that is the hallmark of a successful labor-management program." 124 Cong. Rec. 29199 <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> in Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, House of Representatives, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., <span class="Italic">Legislative History</span> <span class="Italic">of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</span> (Comm. Print 1979), at 956 (<span class="Italic">Legislative History); see also</span> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 153-54 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> <span class="Italic">Legislative History</span> at 821-22 (Conference Committee discussion of section 7106(a) and (b)(1)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consonant with this congressional intent, we approach the determination of the negotiability of proposals that intermingle two or more inseparable requirements with the understanding that we must preserve managerial prerogatives that are recognized in section 7106(a). At the same time, we continue to adhere to the principle set forth in <span class="Italic">VAMC</span>, <span class="Italic">Lexington</span> that section 7106(b)(1) is an exception to section 7106(a). Adopting an approach that permits section 7106(a) rights to prevail in all instances over section 7106(b)(1) when two or more requirements are inseparable could substantially deprive <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span> of meaning as well as deprive the Statute of its intended flexibility. Thus, we must reconcile the statutory purposes of section 7106(a) and 7106(b)(1), and we must do so in a manner that provides practitioners with an approach that is understandable and workable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where, as here, the parties disagree whether the negotiability of a proposal that has distinguishable requirements is governed by section 7106(a) or section 7106(b)(1), we will identify the requirements of the proposal. Consistent with Authority precedent, we will do so by considering the wording of the proposal as well as its meaning and the context in which it would apply. If severance is possible and requested, we will do so and analyze each requirement separately. If severance is not possible, we will then determine which requirement dominates the operation of the proposal. For purposes of determining the negotiability of a proposal, we will rely on the requirement that has been identified as dominant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine which of multiple, inseparable requirements is dominant, we will examine the interrelationship among the different requirements. We will identify as dominant that requirement on which the other requirements addressed by the proposal depend for their viability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having identified the proposal's dominant requirement, we will then analyze the proposal, as construed, under section 7106(b)(1). If, based on its dominant requirement, the proposal is encompassed by section 7106(b)(1), the proposal will be electively negotiable under that section, without regard to whether one or more of the other requirements is encompassed only by section 7106(a). If, on the other hand, based on its dominant requirement, the proposal does not concern section 7106(b)(1) but, on further analysis, involves a management right set forth in section 7106(a), the proposal will not be electively negotiable under that section, even though it may involve other requirements that are encompassed by section 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2910 and DHUD</span>, 54 FLRA 171, 177-78 (1998), modified <span class="Italic">VAMC Lexington</span> by assuring parties of a negotiability determination when the union asserts that a proposal is bargainable as a procedure or arrangement and alternatively advances the proposal as a subject of permissive bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span>, the Authority held that section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute constitutes an exception to section 7106(a). In addition, the Authority set forth the sequence of analysis it would follow in resolving negotiability disputes where parties disagree whether a proposal comes within the terms of section 7106(a) or 7106(b)(1). Under the approach set forth and applied in <span class="Italic">VAMC</span>, <span class="Italic">Lexington</span>, the Authority first examines the contention that a proposal is electively bargainable under section 7106(b)(1). If the proposal concerns a subject set forth in section 7106(b)(1), then the Authority does not address contentions that the proposal also affects the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a). However, if the proposal is not encompassed by section 7106(b)(1), then the Authority proceeds to analyze it under section 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span>, the union did not dispute the agency's assertion that the proposals at issue interfered with management's rights under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B)<span class="Italic">. VAMC, Lexington</span>, 51 FLRA at 396-97. In contrast, the Union in this case expressly argues that the proposal does not affect the Agency's right to make selections under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. In addition, as in <span class="Italic">VAMC</span>, <span class="Italic">Lexington</span>, the Union argues that the proposal is encompassed by section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute, under which, according to the Union, parties may negotiate at an agency's election over "positions assigned to any organizational subdivision[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_546"></span>The consequence of the Union's prevailing on either of these two distinct arguments is decidedly different under the Authority's regulations. In this regard, a finding that a proposal does not affect management's rights under section 7106(a) results, in the absence of other valid claims that the proposal conflicts with other law or regulation, in a finding that the proposal is within the duty to bargain and an order to bargain. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.10(b)<span class="Italic">. See also, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Education Association, Overseas Education</span> <span class="Italic">Association, Fort Bragg Association of Educators and U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, Department of Defense Domestic</span> <span class="Italic">Dependents, Elementary and Secondary Schools, Fort Bragg</span>, <span class="Italic">North Carolina</span>, 53 FLRA 898, 911-12, 919-21 (1997). In contrast, a finding that a proposal concerns a subject set forth in section 7106(b)(1) results in dismissal of the negotiability appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.10(b)<span class="Italic">. See also</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., VAMC, Lexington</span>, 51 FLRA at 401-02.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, this case makes evident an anomaly not present in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span> or the cases in which <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span> has been applied: adhering to the sequence of analysis established in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span> could result in dismissal of a negotiability petition in a case where the disputed proposal would be found within the duty to bargain if the parties' dispute over section 7106(a) were resolved. This would encourage additional litigation (where a section 7106(b)(1) claim was not raised) to determine whether a bargaining order were warranted, a result that does not further the purposes of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For this reason, we have determined that adherence to the sequence of analysis that the Authority established in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span> is not appropriate in cases where, as here, an agency's assertion that a proposal affects a management right or rights under section 7106(a) is disputed by the union. Accordingly, we will address and resolve this claim even though the union also asserts that the proposal is electively bargainable under section 7106(b)(1).[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;Inasmuch as a union's assertion that a proposal is within the duty to bargain under section 7106(b)(2) and/or (b)(3) similarly could result in a bargaining order, we also will address and resolve such assertion even where the union also asserts that the proposal is encompassed by section 7106(b)(1).</p>

If the proposal does not affect management's rights under section 7106(a), or if it constitutes a procedure or an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(2) or (b)(3), respectively, then the Authority will direct the parties to bargain over that proposal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, if the Authority finds that the proposal affects management's rights under section 7106(a), and does not constitute a (b)(2) or (b)(3) matter, then the Authority will address whether the proposal concerns matters encompassed within section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>[4] If the proposal concerns matters negotiable at the Agency's election under section 7106(b)(1), then the Authority will dismiss the petition for review. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Prison Locals, Local 171 and U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution, El Reno, Oklahoma</span>, 52 FLRA 1484, 1495 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>). As the Union in the instant case disputes the Agency's contention that the proposal affects management's rights, we apply the <span class="Italic">HUD Council of Locals</span> analysis herein.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;However, we note that if a union does not raise section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute, then we will not address whether the proposal concerns a (b)(1) matter.</p>

Where an agency claims that a proposal affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a), and a union disagrees or claims that the proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and/or (3), as well as being electively negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), the Authority will first resolve those claims that would determine if a proposal is within the duty to bargain, and then, if necessary, address those claims that would determine if a proposal is electively negotiable<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent">For FLRA to consider the negotiability of a provision under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), the union must offer more than a bare assertion of negotiability, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC Newington</span>, 53 FLRA 403, 408 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span>, the Authority set forth the approach for resolving negotiability disputes where parties disagree whether a proposal comes within the terms of section 7106(a) or 7106(b)(1).
