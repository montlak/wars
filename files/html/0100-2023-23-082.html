<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-81"><span class="space">8.</span> Bonus or Award; Differential; Relocation Expense</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Of claims to remedial bonus payments as a component of back pay, the Board may consider agency policy and practice, <span class="Italic">Edwards v. USPS</span>, NY-0752-09-0137-C-2 (NP 7/18/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In arguing that he is entitled to the bonus, the appellant relies on a statement in the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Galatis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 9 (2009), that, under the Back Pay Act, an appellant is entitled to a bonus if all comparably situated employees received them unless some other circumstances disqualifies him. The parties stipulated that all eight employees who encumbered the position the appellant had encumbered prior to his improper demotion received an average FY 2009 PFP rating of 5, and that, if he had received that rating, he would have received a bonus equal to a 3% increase in pay. In <span class="Italic">Galatis</span>, the Board found that the agency had cited no authority for disqualifying the appellant from receiving the bonus and ordered the agency to award it to him. <span class="Italic">Galatis</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 12. In this case, however, as set forth above, the agency did cite authority for disqualifying the appellant from receiving the FY 2009 PFP bonus, specifically, its FY 2009 PFP Rules and the appellant's evaluator's determination that his misconduct, which the Board determined was punishable by a 60-day suspension, was conduct clearly unacceptable to the organization. <span class="Italic">Cf. Clark</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 342, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-14 (where the Board mitigated the appellant's demotion and 60-day suspension to a still significant 30-day suspension, the agency was in compliance with the Board's order when it denied him an Exemplary Performance Award reserved for the agency's top employees). Therefore, <span class="Italic">Galatis</span> does not support the appellant's position but rather supports the agency's position, properly upheld by the administrative judge, that the appellant's misconduct disqualified him from receiving the FY 2009 PFP bonus.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board described the burdens of proof in enforcement proceedings involving bonuses and quality step increases in <span class="Italic">Clark v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 111 MSPR 477, 480-82 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-13, 2009 MSPB 98 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant reasons that he should have received an Exemplary Performance Award (EPA) "2 step pay increase in June 2005, which would have made [him] a GS-13, step 6" and a Quality Step Increase (QSI) on May 14, 2006, but that both actions were held in abeyance pending the outcome of the Merit Systems Protection Board appeal. According to the appellant, these step increases should have been granted to him when the "adverse action was reversed." He concludes that, if the agency had properly promoted him to the GS-13, step 6 level and then subsequently to the GS-13, step 7 level, he would have been placed at the GS-14, step 4 level in April 2006.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the EPA 2 step increase, the agency disagrees with the appellant's contention and argues that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the claim because the appellant filed a formal equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint alleging discrimination based on his failure to receive the EPA. According to the agency, in response to a show cause order issued by the United States District Court in the appellant's EEO litigation, the parties agreed that the Merit Systems Protection Board lacked jurisdiction over the denial of the EPA. While the Board generally lacks jurisdiction over an appeal of a denial of a performance related award, such as an EPA or QSI, the Board's authority to restore an individual to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> following the reversal of an unwarranted personnel action is broad. <span class="Italic">James v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 504, 509 (1994) (stating that "[t]he Board has jurisdiction to consider an appellant's claim of agency noncompliance with a Board order, and broad authority to enforce compliance with that order."); <span class="Italic">see Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (the Board has jurisdiction to consider an appellant's claim of agency noncompliance with a Board order). Accordingly, the Board has the authority to determine the <span id="Page_4873"></span>appellant's entitlement to an EPA as part of the remedy in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that, even if the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's claim of entitlement to an EPA, the Board should not order the agency to award the appellant such a benefit because the appellant engaged in misconduct, which was sustained by the administrative judge. Specifically, the agency argues that, because of the appellant's misconduct in 2004, which was sustained by the administrative judge, there was no basis to award the appellant an EPA in June 2005.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held in the context of performance bonuses, which are similar to the performance-based step increases at issue here, that if an employee would have, in fact, received a performance award he is entitled to one as part of Board-ordered <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief. <span class="Italic">Bullock v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 217, &#x00B6; 10 (2003); <span class="Italic">Payne v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 97, 100-01 (1997). Here, the agency asserts that the appellant would not have received an EPA in June 2005 because of his misconduct in the previous year, but the agency has provided nothing to support this assertion. Nor has the appellant provided anything showing that he would have received the EPA despite the misconduct sustained by the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be in compliance regarding this issue, the agency must submit evidence regarding the appellant's entitlement or lack of entitlement to an EPA. Such evidence would include any agency policies regarding the awarding of EPAs, how the agency treats EPAs with regard to employees similarly situated to the appellant, and any evidence addressing the appellant's circumstances and his entitlement or lack of entitlement to an EPA. <span class="Italic">See Bulluck</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 217, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's entitlement to a QSI on May 14, 2006, the agency asserts that, pursuant to its policies, only employees at or above the step 4 level qualify for a QSI. The agency states that, because the appellant was retroactively placed in a GS-14, step 2 position effective April 16, 2006, he would not have been entitled to a QSI the following month. The appellant provides nothing showing that the policy identified by the agency is inapplicable to his situation. Accordingly, we find the agency in compliance with regard to the appellant's entitlement to a QSI on May 14, 2006.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-09-0604-C-1 (NP 4/9/2015), rejected a bonus sought in enforcement proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board has held that a bonus awarded in the routine and ordinary course of employment may properly be considered part of a back pay award, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Coffey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 281, 285 (1998), we find no evidence in the record establishing the appellant's <span class="Italic">per se</span> entitlement to an additional $5,000 relocation bonus under the facts of this case. On review, the agency has submitted the Department of Defense's policy for the award of recruitment and relocation bonuses, which reflects that a relocation bonus of "up to 25 percent of basic pay may be offered to certain current employees who must relocate to accept a position in a different commuting area." The appellant, however, has submitted no evidence establishing a pattern of such awards, and we find no basis in the record to conclude that she would have received an additional $5,000 relocation bonus but for her wrongful reduction in grade and pay....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams-Tatis v. USPS,</span> AT-0752-10-0096-X-1 (NP 8/3/2012) (exploring methodology for calculating postmasters' bonus payments); <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 342, 347 &#x00B6; 14, 2009 MSPB 167 (2009) (employee whose demotion and suspension were mitigated to a 30-day suspension for negligent performance of supervisory responsibilities and making false statements was not entitled to an award reserved for the agency's top employees demonstrating exceptional performance).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Back Pay Act supports payment of entitlements other than basic pay only if those entitlements are authorized by statute, regulation, or, presumably, collective bargaining agreement. The Board explained as to a claim for travel, per diem, and associated costs in a RIF appeal considered under both the Back Pay Act and Postal Service regulations, <span class="Italic">Campbell v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 273, 278-79 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Act, an employee who has been subjected to an unwarranted personnel action is entitled, upon its correction, to receive "an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable, which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred...." 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A). Per diem and commuting expenses are not covered by the phrase "pay, allowances or differentials" under either the Act or its implementing regulations, found at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805. Absent such express authority, reimbursement for these types of expenses cannot be imputed to the Act. <span class="Italic">See Morris v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States</span>, 219 Ct. Cl. 452, 595 F.2d 591, 594 (1979); <span class="Italic">see also Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 30 MSPR 288, 291 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, it is at once clear that it cannot be said of the payments they seek that the appellants "normally would have earned or received" them but for their demotions, for if the agency had properly determined the appellants' RIF rights in 1992-1993, they would have been permanently assigned to their best offer position at all times since then. Having failed to so assign them, however, the agency nonetheless did not cause them additional travel or per diem expenses during their improper demotions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hurley v. United States</span>, 624 F.2d 93, 95 (10th Cir. 1980) (relying on the similar situation and holding in <span class="Italic">Morris</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>). Moreover, we note both that under the Act an appellant's right is to be returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, or as nearly as possible to it, but not to be placed in a better position as a result of the now-corrected personnel action, <span class="Italic">Smith v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 MSPR 417, 423 (1994), and that in <span class="Italic">Kopp v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 434, 437 (1988), we held that the Board may not authorize reimbursement for other consequential expenses incurred as a result of improper personnel actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board recently held that where an appellant covered by the Back Pay Act was improperly assigned to a new duty station outside his commuting area, the agency was liable for any relocation expenditures it caused. <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of Justice</span>, 74 MSPR 289, 293-94 (1997). In the instant appeals, it is clear from the records that the appellants were paid relocation expenses incurred as a result of their 1993 demotions, and were informed that they could receive such expenses again in 1995 upon the cancellation of those demotions. In the absence of any mention in <span class="Italic">Russell</span> of any additional payments due the appellant, we find no basis for an award of the payments the appellants seek here because any such award would place them in a better position than <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> and constitute consequential damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Board is not authorized by the Back Pay Act to order reimbursement for the incidentals such as per diem and travel expenses claimed by the appellants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the bulk of their claim is advanced by the appellants under the agency's own requirements. While preference eligibles are entitled to back pay under the terms of the Back Pay Act, we find no indication that they are restricted to such a claim where they assert that the agency provides for additional payments. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Andress</span>, 56 MSPR at 507 (the statute establishing the Postal Service was intended to maintain the rights of veterans under then-existing laws). An agency is required to act in accordance with the procedures it adopts for itself, and the Board will enforce employee rights derived from such rules, regulations, and collective bargaining agreements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dwyer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 32 MSPR 181, 185 (1987). Accordingly, we see no basis for limiting the appellants' claims to consideration under the Back Pay Act, to the extent that any relief available to them is not inconsistent with the Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only regulation to which the appellants specifically refer states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Where the GM/PM determines it is cost effective and operationally sound a qualified employee covered by these procedures may be temporarily assigned to a different installation within the MSC area or, if needed, within the field division. If the temporary assignment is outside the employee's commuting area, the gaining installation pays the employee's travel and per diem expense....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employee and Labor Relations Manual, Section 354.262.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This provision, however, and the context in which it is found, make it clear that an employee is entitled to per diem and mileage only when he is "temporarily assigned" to a location that is not his official duty station. Here, we find, no such temporary assignments occurred....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Per diem is recoverable as part of back pay under <span class="Italic">Greco</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> only if the appellant would normally have received that allowance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morris v.

<p class="Body-Text">For the record, <span class="Italic">Scott v. USDA</span>, 108 MSPR 177, 181-82 &#x00B6; 12, 2008 MSPB 41 (2008), defined "locality pay":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Locality pay is an entitlement pursuant to statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5304, and regulations, 5 C.F.R., Part 531. An employee's locality pay is the difference between the employee's locality rate and the employee's scheduled annual rate of pay. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.602(2). The first step in ascertaining an employee's locality rate is to determine her "official worksite," which means the official location of an employee's position of record as determined by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.605. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.602. The general rule <span id="Page_4874"></span>is that an employee's position of record is "where the employee regularly performs his or her duties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 531.605(a). Here, it is undisputed that the appellant performs her duties at her home in Kentucky, rather than at the agency's office in Denver. Furthermore, the regulation provides that an employee covered by a telework agreement who does not report at least once a week on a regular and recurring basis to the regular worksite for the employee's position of record is deemed to have her official worksite at the location of her telework site. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.605(d)(1) &#x0026; (2). Thus, pursuant to these rules, the appellant's official worksite is in Kentucky.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bullock v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 93 MSPR 217, 220-21 &#x00B6; 10 (2002), explained that it is possible to obtain a monetary performance award as a component of a back pay remedy, but there is no automatic entitlement to the award:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Only if some provision of law mandates the payment of an award or if it is clearly established that the appellant in fact would have received the award would the agency be required to provide that award in his back pay award<span class="Italic">. Blackmer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 624, 631 (1991). The law does not mandate the payment of a performance awards; rather, it leaves that matter to the agency's discretion. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4505a(a)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 451.104(a)(3). Nonetheless, if the appellant would in fact have received a performance award, he is entitled to one as part of the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Payne v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 97, 100-01 (1997) (appellant entitled to Christmas bonus that all her peers received). The agency has not addressed whether the appellant would in fact have received a performance award. In order to be in compliance on this issue the agency must submit evidence showing the appellant's performance rating for the relevant period and whether similarly situated employees who received the same performance rating received awards. If the agency determines, based on this evidence, that the appellant would have received a performance award had he been working, the agency should also submit evidence that it paid the appellant the award and interest.</p>
