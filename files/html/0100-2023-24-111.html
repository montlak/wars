<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-107"><span class="space">1.</span> Examples of Sanctionable Conduct</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit described what constitutes a frivolous appeal, <span class="Italic">Finch v. Hughes Aircraft Co.</span>, 926 F.2d 1574, 1578-80 (Fed. Cir. 1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Access to the appellate courts is an important value in our system of justice. In determining whether or not an appeal is frivolous,...an appellate court must be mindful of the possibility that awarding damages and costs could have an undue chilling effect on the behavior of later litigants. An appeal having a small chance for success is not for that reason alone frivolous,...and a questionable appeal may simply be due to the overzealousness or inexperience of counsel....&#8197;The line between the tenuously arguable and the frivolous can be an uncertain one, and sanctions should not be imposed so freely as to make parties with legitimately appealable issues hesitant to come before an appellate court....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the same time, appellate courts must consider the importance of conserving scarce judicial resources. A frivolous appeal imposes costs not only upon the party forced to defend it, but also upon the public whose taxes supporting this court and its staff are wasted on frivolous appeals....&#8197;Sanctions under Rule 38...perform two vital functions: They compensate the prevailing party for the expense of having to defend a wholly meritless appeal, and by deterring frivolity, they preserve the appellate calendar for cases truly worthy of consideration....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Logically, an appeal can be deemed frivolous in two distinct ways, <span class="Italic">either</span> of which alone would support sanctions. In the first, the judgment by the tribunal below was so plainly correct and the legal authority contrary to appellant's position so clear that there really is no appealable issue. In such a case, we have held, the very filing of an appeal is frivolous and justifies the imposition of Rule 38 sanctions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the second type of frivolity, while genuinely appealable issues <span class="Italic">may</span> exist, the appellant's contentions in prosecuting the appeal are frivolous. The sorts of post-filing conduct that this and other circuit courts have determined to be frivolous under Rule 38 include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">--submitting rambling briefs that make no attempt to address the elements requisite to obtaining reversal...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">--filing numerous documents containing irrelevant arguments and authority....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">--seeking to relitigate issues already adjudicated....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">--failing to explain how the lower tribunal erred or to present clear or cogent arguments for overturning the decision below....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">--failing to exclude from the appeal individual opponents as to whom there is no basis for appeal...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">--rearguing frivolous positions for which sanctions had already been imposed in the trial forum...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">--citation of inapplicable or irrelevant authorities...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">--misrepresenting facts or law to the court....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such appeals, though not necessarily frivolous as <span class="Italic">filed</span>, are held to be frivolous as <span class="Italic">argued</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a warning to <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigants, <span class="Italic">Finch</span> explained, 926 F.2d at 1582:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor is a finding of frivolity precluded by the fact that Finch appealed <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. While courts are particularly cautious about imposing sanctions on a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigant, whose improper conduct may be attributed to ignorance of the law and proper procedures...this and other circuits have imposed sanctions in case where even a non-lawyer should have been aware that his conduct was frivolous....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court warned that it "will not hesitate to impose a sanction against a <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> petitioner who disregards the clear instructions of this court." <span class="Italic">Head v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 92-3260).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit indicated its inclination to sanction a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant who repeatedly pursued arguments frequently rejected by the Board and the reviewing court, <span class="Italic">Moss v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3336):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the DAF has requested that this Court impose sanctions against Moss for bringing a frivolous action. Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure provides: "If a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee." Fed. R. App. P. 38. Conduct that warrants the imposition of sanctions includes attempts to relitigate matters that have been fully and finally adjudicated<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">State Indus., Inc. v. Mor-Flo Indus.</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc.</span>, 948 F.2d 1573, 1579 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">cf. also Des Vignes v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transp.</span>, 791 F.2d 142 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Moreover, sanctions may be imposed against a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant who has filed a frivolous appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Constant v. United States</span>, 929 F.2d 654 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the facts in the case at bar reveal, there is a pattern of repeated claims where Moss has attempted to relitigate matters that had been previously litigated, followed by appeals brought without merit. These facts present us with a situation where we are forced to conclude that Moss has brought an appeal that is wholly without merit and without purpose other than to consume valuable judicial resources. "A frivolous appeal imposes costs not only upon the party forced to defend it, but also upon the public whose taxes supporting this court and its staff are wasted...." <span class="Italic">Romala Corp. v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States</span>, 927 F.2d 1219, 1224 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Moss' arguments against the imposition of sanctions amount to little more than a rehash of his prior arguments and do not convince us that he could of had any reasonable basis for bringing the instant appeal. That he had a right to bring this appeal does not make it automatically meritorious. He knew that his arguments had been rejected multiple times and yet has advanced them again in the instant appeal to no avail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, his assertion that he should be immune from sanctions because <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigants cannot be expected to know legal technicalities is unpersuasive. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Finch v. Hughes Aircraft Go.</span>, 926 F.2d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1991): "[A] finding of frivolity [is not] precluded by the fact that [appellant] appealed <span class="Italic">pro se</span>....&#8197;[T]his and other circuits have imposed sanctions in cases where even a non-lawyer should have been aware that his conduct was frivolous." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1582; <span class="Italic">see also Triola v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transp.</span>, 769 F.2d 760 (Fed. Cir. 1985). As such, we invite the DAF to file a formal motion for sanctions against Moss pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Arnett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 126 Fed. Appx. 474, 477 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), warned against repetitive unmeritorious appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Arnett has now had ample opportunities to challenge all of the disputes surrounding her attempts to obtain re-employment with the Navy and to raise various theories concerning the remedies she has sought from the United States Government. While the courts of the United States are open for individuals to make claims against their government, continued challenges concerning the same set of underlying facts eventually constitute an abuse of the judicial system. Such a point has now been reached. Arnett is therefore warned that further appeals involving claims based on the same set of facts, whether raising the same or new theories, may be held to be frivolous and subject to sanctions, <span class="Italic">see</span> Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">More admonitions on sanctions arrived in a commercial dispute, <span class="Italic">Romala Corp. v. United States</span>, 927 F.2d 1219, 1224-25 (Fed. Cir. 1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, Romala consistently avoids <span class="Italic">addressing</span> what is clearly the actual <span id="Page_5328"></span>basis of the Claims Court's judgment, much less pointing to anything in that judgment that is arguably wrong or offering a cogent argument for reversal. Most seriously of all, some of Romala's arguments are based on misrepresentations and distortions of its opponent's arguments and the Claims Court's opinion. We have held that even the presence of a few non-frivolous arguments does not prevent an appeal as a whole from being deemed frivolous....&#8197;Here, Romala fails to advance <span class="Italic">any</span> nonfrivolous argument for reversal. Without deciding whether a non-frivolous argument for reversal <span class="Italic">could</span> have been made, we hold that Romala's appellate conduct, including its numerous irrelevant arguments...and its "distortion and disregard of the record,"...is sufficiently egregious to render its appeal frivolous as argued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion we are mindful of the principle that sanctions should never lightly be imposed. As we have on other occasions noted, a meritless appeal is by no means necessarily a frivolous one--"[a]n appeal having a small chance for success is not for that reason alone frivolous."...&#8197;Questionable conduct, we are well aware, may be due simply to the inexperience or over-enthusiasm of counsel, and we shall not award sanctions "so freely as to make parties with legitimately appealable issues hesitant to come before an appellate court...." But the appellate tactics for which we here sanction Romala, consisting almost entirely of irrelevant and misleading arguments as well as outright misrepresentations, exceed all permissible bounds of zealous advocacy and have been repeatedly condemned....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have noted, "[a] frivolous appeal imposes costs not only upon the party forced to defend it, but also upon the public whose taxes supporting this court and its staff are wasted on frivolous appeals."...&#8197;This is particularly true in a case such as this one, in which a party has misrepresented the holding of the trial court and misstated the opposing party's principal position. By forcing the court to expend extra time and effort in carefully double-checking every reference to the record and opposing counsel's briefs, lest we be misled, such argumentation threatens the integrity of the judicial process and increases the waste of resources. As regular readers of appellate decisions are no doubt aware, this and other circuit courts have taken an increasingly firm stand against frivolous appeals....&#8197;Even in a case in which it <span class="Italic">might</span> be possible to file an arguably meritorious appeal, so that an appeal is not frivolous as filed, we may deem an appeal frivolous as argued, and award sanctions, where, as here, the arguments made in support of it are predominantly irrelevant or illogical, and rest in large part on serious misstatements and distortions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn next to the question of who precisely is to be held responsible for sanctionable misconduct. Frivolity in argument is no doubt attributable at least as much to tactical decisions made by an attorney in writing briefs as to the overall appellate strategy to which the client may specifically consent....&#8197;At the same time, it is well settled that a client is bound by the acts or omissions of his or her lawyer....&#8197;Though the language of Rule 38 does not explicitly provide for sanctions against attorneys, there is ample precedent in this and other circuits for imposing Rule 38 sanctions on an attorney as well as on the client....&#8197;Where the frivolity in an appeal lies not in the filing of the appeal, but in the type of argument employed in support of it, it is appropriate to hold not only the appellant but also its attorney responsible for this conduct. We therefore hold Romala's counsel liable jointly and severally with Romala for the payment of the sanction we impose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that Romala and its attorneys cannot escape a determination of frivolity by the decision to waive oral argument and submit the case on the briefs. While the cost to the appellee and the burden on this court's resources may be reduced somewhat by a decision to waive argument, the general policies behind Rule 38--compensating the prevailing party for the costs of having to defend a frivolous appeal and keeping the appellate calendar free for cases truly worthy of consideration...--are no less important in cases submitted on the briefs than in those on which oral argument is heard. The Department of Justice has been forced to expend time and effort in defending this appeal, and this court has had to devote its energy and resources to the process of considering these arguments. Waiving oral argument may have lessened somewhat the <span class="Italic">degree</span> of damage done, but it has by no means eliminated it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other decisions offer a more succinct analysis of sanctionable conduct by appellants and counsel. In <span class="Italic">Triola v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 769 F.2d 760, 762 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the appellant, proceeding <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">se</span>, was fined $100. His case was frivolous "because all of petitioner's contentions were rejected in our prior cases or are clearly without merit." Sanctions may be imposed jointly on the appellant and counsel because "there was no possible basis for reversing the board's decision." <span class="Italic">Synan v. MSPB</span>, 765 F.2d 1099, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sanctions of $500 against counsel were imposed for a frivolous appeal that involved unsupported allegations of bias against an AJ, considered "offensive" by the court. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 769 F.2d 1556, 1557-58 (Fed. Cir. 1985) [discussed at greater length under "<a href="0100-2023-10-156.html#sec3-156">Treatment of Bias Allegations</a>" in Chapter 3] ; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">In re Perry</span>, 918 F.2d 931, 934 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("The 'empty head and pure heart' defense will not excuse objectively unreasonable conduct.... Counsel's good faith beliefs that are unreasonable in light of clear law and dispositive authority will not immunize him from Rule 38 sanctions."); <span class="Italic">Pac-Tec Inc. v. Amerace Corp.</span>, 903 F.2d 796, 802 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (sanctions of counsel fees and costs against an attorney whose conduct included unfounded allegations of bias against a federal judge).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sanctions of $4,500 were imposed against an attorney who filed duplicative appeals containing what the court believed to be frivolous assertions that a number of Air Traffic Controller cases had to be remanded because of ineffective assistance of counsel in the Board hearings. <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 769 F.2d 753 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (court noted its clerk's practice of sending out notices as appeals are docketed, explaining that sanctions may be imposed in frivolous cases); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Chizmadia v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 92-3267) ("It is wholly frivolous for an attorney to file a petition for judicial review in this court contending that the AJ abused his discretion when the AJ was afforded no basis for exercising that discretion at all."); <span class="Italic">Amodeo v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 788 F.2d 1549, 1552 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ($500 in costs and counsel fees for each of 10 cases were awarded against the attorney who should have known that the appeals were frivolous following the disposition of what the court considered to be a virtually identical lead case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sanctions may be imposed for disregarding or ignoring precedent--in an ATC case, <span class="Italic">Klein v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 768 F.2d 336, 338 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners' 50-page opening brief contains not a single reference to, let alone any discussion of, any of those 12 decisions [deciding major legal issues in the ATC removals], even though several of them control and require rejection of a number of the petitioners' arguments. Instead, the brief consists of a meandering rehash of arguments rejected in those cases together with a number of contentions that on their face lack substance and can be characterized only as frivolous. The latter characterization also applies to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McEnery v. MSPB</span>, 963 F.2d 1512, 1516-17 (Fed. Cir. 1992), reaffirmed sanctions against those who ignore controlling precedent:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e have applied sanctions for failure to reference or discuss controlling precedents in an opening brief, <span class="Italic">Klein v. Department of Transportation, FAA</span>, 768 F.2d 336, 338 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Further, we have noted that the test of frivolity is an objective one--McEnery's good faith in pursuing his arguments to the appellate level cannot overcome clear law and dispositive authority. <span class="Italic">In re Perry</span>, 918 F.2d 931 (Fed. Cir. 1990) <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> [502 U.S. 808], 112 S. Ct. 49, 116 L. Ed.2d 27 (1991). Further, even the existence of one potentially non-frivolous argument cannot preclude a Rule 38 sanction when all other arguments are patently frivolous. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 934-35. McEnery's failure to cite and discuss either <span class="Italic">Garbacz</span> and <span class="Italic">Chaney</span> in his opening brief and <span class="Italic">Artmann</span> at least in his reply brief is inexcusable, as is his about face on key facts. His obfuscation of other issues with clearly frivolous arguments, e.g. that <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> did not control the issue of reduced responsibilities, was most unhelpful. Accordingly, we award costs plus $500 damages for which petitioner and his counsel are jointly and severally liable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sanctions are not to be imposed simply because one's arguments do not prevail in court. "In virtually every case, an appellate court finds one party's arguments and authorities unpersuasive, but this is not remotely sufficient to make the losing party's conduct sanctionable." <span class="Italic">Additive Controls &#x0026; Measurement Systems, Inc. v. Flowdata</span>, 96 F.3d 1390, 1398 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Sanctions will not be imposed even though the appeal is without merit, if counsel makes a good faith effort to distinguish the appeal from contrary precedents. <span class="Italic">Albjerg v. Dept. of Transp.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-1011).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Counsel may raise an argument previously decided with the intention of preserving it for <span class="Italic">en banc</span> consideration and possible Supreme Court review, <span class="Italic">Hayes v. DHHS</span>, 829 F.2d 1092, 1101 (Fed. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government urges that sanctions should be imposed against the petitioners and their attorney for presenting an argument that this court repeatedly has rejected....&#8197;The petitioners respond that they raised the point only to preserve it for seeking <span class="Italic">in</span> <span class="Italic">banc</span> consideration and possible Supreme Court review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The discussion of the issue in the Statement portion of the petitioners' opening brief occupies two pages. The discussion in the Argument portion occupies less than a page, and states only that the petitioners will file a suggestion for initial <span class="Italic">in</span> <span class="Italic">banc</span> consideration of the point. (They filed such a suggestion, which the court denied.) The government's discussion of the point in its brief occupies only two pages, arguing that the court repeatedly had rejected the contention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering all the circumstances, we cannot say that the petitioners' raising of the issue as they did warrants the imposition of sanctions upon them or their counsel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When cases are asserted to be factually frivolous, the characterization is appropriate "when the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible." <span class="Italic">Denton v. Hernandez</span>, 112 S. Ct. 1728, 1733-34 (1992). (The Board imposes a "nonfrivolous" standard on various jurisdictional pleadings.) <span class="Italic">Dentron</span> instructs that a case may not be dismissed simply because a court finds that the plaintiff's allegations are unlikely, for to "dismiss them as <span id="Page_5329"></span>frivolous without any factual development is to disregard the age-old insight that many allegations might be 'strange, but true; for truth is always strange, stranger than fiction.'"</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although it is not likely that a Board decision will not provide a basis for an immediate appeal on a collateral point, <span class="Italic">Nisus Corp. v. Perma-Chink Systems, Inc.</span>, 497 F.3d 1316, 1320-21 (Fed. Cir. 2007), concluded that adverse comments about counsel or a nonparty in a decision of a lower tribunal do not constitute sanctions (despite reputational harm) that are immediately appealable to the appellate court.</p>
