<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-49"><span class="space">D.</span> DETERMINATION OF TECHNOLOGY, METHODS AND MEANS OF PERFORMING WORK</h3>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7106(b)(1) allows an agency to elect to negotiate over the technology, methods, and means of performing work. FLRA defines "means" as "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy" used to accomplish or further agency work. "Method" is defined to embrace the way that an agency performs its work. <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2910 and Library of Congress</span>, 19 FLRA 1180, 1181 (1985). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2441 v. FLRA</span>, 864 F.2d 178, 180 (D.C. Cir. 1988), involving proposals concerning uniform requirements of correctional personnel working for the Bureau of Prisons, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]here are certain matters excluded from the duty to bargain; in particular, the FSLMRS contains a "management rights" provision....&#8197;Section 7106(a) lists matters over which an agency is not permitted to bargain. Section 7106(b)(1) sets out matters over which bargaining may take place "at the election of the agency." Included in the latter category are <span id="page_559"></span>decisions concerning the "methods, and means of performing work." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). As to these decisions, the agency is permitted but not required to negotiate with the labor organization....</p>
<p class="noindent">Providing further definition of "methods and means of performing work," as to proposals designed to mitigate the effect on employees of the imposition of medical standards and medical examinations, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 723 and Dept. of Interior, Geological Survey</span>, 66 FLRA 639, 646 (2012), stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the Agency could "elect to negotiate over the methods and means of performing work." In determining whether a proposal concerns the methods or means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), the Authority has construed "method" to refer to the way in which an agency performs its work, and has construed "means" to refer to any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, 55 FLRA at 593.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the proposal concerns a method or a means, then the Authority employs a two-part test to determine whether the proposal affects the management right. <span class="Italic">E.g., NTEU, Chapter 83</span>, 64 FLRA 723, 725 (2010). In this connection, it must be shown that: (1) there is a direct and integral relationship between the method or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission; and (2) the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">E.g., Prof'l Airways Sys. Specialists</span>, 56 FLRA 798, 803 (2000). Where a party fails to support its claim that a proposal concerns a method or means of performing work, the Authority rejects the claim as a bare assertion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, Local 2139</span>, 57 FLRA 292, 295 n.7 (2001) (Member Wasserman dissenting) (<span class="Italic">Local 2139</span>). <span class="Italic">Accord</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.25I(1)(i).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union's only assertion regarding methods and means is that "[s]ince this [p]roposal could also affect the way the Agency accomplishes [its] mission, [the Agency] could elect to negotiate over the methods and means of performing work." The Union does not: (1) explain how the proposal involves a method or a means; (2) demonstrate a direct and integral relationship between a method or means and the accomplishment of the Agency's mission; or (3) demonstrate that the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which a method or means was adopted. Accordingly, we reject the Union's claim as a bare assertion. <span class="Italic">See Local 2139</span>, 57 FLRA at 295 n.7.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1998 and Dept. of State, Passport Serv.</span>, 69 FLRA 626, 630 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting), demonstrates application of the "methods and means" test:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that Proposal 5 affects management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). In determining whether a proposal concerns the methods or means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), the Authority has construed "method" to refer to the way in which an agency performs its work, and has construed "means" to refer to any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work.[70]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[70]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Evergreen Chapter</span>, 55 FLRA 591, 593 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the proposal "concerns" a method or a means, then the Authority employs a two-part test to determine whether the proposal "affects" the management right.[71] In this connection, it must be shown that: (1) there is a direct and integral relationship between the method or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission; and (2) the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted.[72] Where a party fails to support its claim that a proposal affects a method or means of performing work, the Authority rejects the claim as a bare assertion.[73]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that its procedure--requiring a specialist to ask an applicant who refuses to provide his or her Social Security number to read certain legal information on the back of the passport application--furthers the Agency's goal of identifying fraud. We find that the Agency identifies a method or means that the proposal "concerns"--having the applicant read the back of the passport application. But we further find that the Agency's arguments do not satisfy the Authority's method or means "affects" test.[76]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[76]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., Chapter 83</span>, 64 FLRA at 725-26.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that this method or means has a direct and integral relationship to the accomplishment of the Agency's mission under the first prong, the Agency fails to demonstrate that the second prong of the test is satisfied.[77] In this regard, the Agency asserts that Proposal 5 "would weaken the Agency's ability to identify fraud." However, the Agency does not discuss the effect of options "a" or "c" on the Agency's goal of identifying fraud--the mission-related purpose for which the Agency adopted option "b." In these circumstances, we find that the Agency fails to explain how Proposal 5's options "a" or "c" would be any less effective than option "b" in achieving the Agency's mission-related purpose of identifying fraud. The Agency therefore fails to demonstrate that Proposal 5 would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means incorporated in option "b" was adopted.[79] As the Agency has not met its burden of providing a record to support its assertion that Proposal 5 affects the Agency's management right, we reject the Agency's claim that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain on this ground.</p>

<p class="noindent">The question of what constitutes the technology of performing work, subject to negotiation only at the election of management under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), was briefly explored in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1917 and DOJ, INS, New York City Dist. Office</span>, 4 FLRA 150, 153-54 (1980). The proposal was that the agency provide a secure facility for employees to store their weapons. FLRA decided that the proposal would determine whether the agency would use a particular technology of performing work, e.g., the use of a "gun box" rather than some other facility for storage of weapons or no facility for storage at all. It did not merely provide the employees access to a facility already in use by the agency. The proposal improperly required management to exercise its rights in a particular manner. The result was that if the proposal requires the creation of new facilities connected with performance of work, it is negotiable at the election of the agency because technology is being negotiated. If the technology, i.e., facilities, are already in place and the issue is one of access, the proposal is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement concerning the effect of the exercise of management authority, i.e., the development or implementation of technology.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another weapons case was considered, <span class="Italic">AFGE Int'l Council of Marshals Serv. Locals and DOJ, Marshals Serv.</span>, 4 FLRA 384, 386-87 (1980), involving a proposal that employees required to carry firearms be permitted to use privately owned weapons that meet certain criteria. The proposal was not a mandatory subject of negotiations. The firearm, or the carrying of the firearm, was a "means" of performing agency protective and law enforcement work. Firearms were an "instrumentality, that is, an agent, tool, device, measure, plan or policy used by the agency for the accomplishing or the furthering of the performance of its work." Under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), the means of performing work was negotiable only at the election of the agency, and the agency did not so elect. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3807 and Dept. of Energy, WAPA</span>, 54 FLRA 642, 651-52 (1998) (Proposals 2, 4) (proposals to maintain two helicopters rather than one, as means of preserving work, interfered with right of agency to determine methods and means of accomplishing work but was bargainable at agency's election); <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2544 and DOJ, INS, Border Patrol</span>, 46 FLRA 930, 952-54 (1992) (Proposal 3, designed to abate office noise by locating computer printer in room not occupied by employees); <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Laguna Niguel Dist.</span>, 46 FLRA 211, 217 (1992) ("as the Union's proposal is concerned only with employee seating assignments when they are not performing computer-related tasks, the proposal does not directly interfere with the Agency's right under section 7106(b)(1) to determine the methods and means of performing work"); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, HCFA, Baltimore</span>, 44 FLRA 1405, 1531-33 (1992) (discussing "methods or means" proposals designed to furnish assistance to handicapped employees); <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council and DOJ, INS</span>, 40 FLRA 521, 537-56 (1991) (considering various proposals pertaining to employees' use and possession of firearms impacting agency's right to direct its internal security practices). <span class="Italic">But see NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Ft. Lauderdale</span>, 41 FLRA 1283, 1291 (1991); <span class="Italic">NTEU and NRC, Region V, Walnut Creek</span>, 41 FLRA 1195, 1202-05 (1991) (discussing "methods and means" in context of proposals concerning assignment of desk and office locations for employees).</p>
<p class="noindent">A court determined that an agency's decision concerning the composition of employee uniforms is a decision involving the methods and means of work, a decision that need not be negotiated with the union. <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 881 F.2d 636, 637 (9th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">INS v. FLRA</span>, 855 F.2d 1454, 1464 (9th Cir. 1988). [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-291.html#sec6-292">Uniforms</a>," and Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-149.html#sec8-149">Insignia</a>."] The D.C. Circuit amplified the definition of management's right to establish work technology in <span class="Italic">DHHS, Indian Health Serv., Oklahoma City v. FLRA</span>, 885 F.2d 911, 913-17 (D.C. Cir. 1989), concluding as to the negotiability of proposals concerning smoking areas [FLRA's decision is mentioned in Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-521.html#sec6-522">Smoking Rules; Related Office Arrangements</a>"]:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA has consistently employed a two-part test to determine whether a proposal concerning a condition of employment interferes with that management prerogative. In order to sustain such a claim, an employer agency must show, first, "the technological relationship of the proposal to accomplishing or furthering the performance of the agency's work," and second, "how the proposal would interfere with the purpose for which the technology was adopted."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he first part of the test focuses on the agency--what it is doing and is attempting to accomplish--and the second part examines the union <span id="page_560"></span>proposal--whether and how that proposal would interfere with the agency's basic objectives....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he FLRA did not find that the agency failed the first part of the test....&#8197;In any event, it could hardly be contended that the no-smoking rule is not directly and integrally related to the agency's purpose....&#8197;I administers a national program for improving the health of approximately 950,000 Indians....&#8197;And smoking is clearly inimical to health....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The key issue, then, is whether the Union's proposals would interfere with the advancement by I of the health status of American Indians...and...whether they would interfere with the legitimate I objectives regarding smoking on the hospital premises.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Authority did not hold that bargaining is required unless the means chosen by an agency are the only ones suited for accomplishment of that agency's purpose, but that bargaining is required if the alternative proposed by the labor union does not improperly interfere with that purpose....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question here, then, is whether the Union's proposals--in particular its proposal for the establishment of well-ventilated rooms where employees may smoke during breaks in their work schedules--interfere with the purpose underlying the smoking restrictions, that is, the furthering of the health of the Indian people.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[P]recedents in the uniform or dress code area and elsewhere demonstrate...that, if a labor union proposal would completely eliminate, vitiate, or make operational an agency's requirements, it is not subject to bargaining. By contrast, proposals which do not interfere with the agency's purpose are not beyond the scope of collective bargaining even if they differ in details from the methods and means adopted by that agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he distinction, with respect to the statute, between those union proposals which do and those which do not interfere with the purpose for which an agency's technology, methods, and means were adopted, is not always simple or self-evident but may be complex and involve both expertise and judgment. The decision may depend, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, upon the degree of departure from agency policy implicit in a particular union proposal, the type of agency involved, and the agency's specific needs and requirements....&#8197;Because of the need for expertise and judgment, the drawing of lines between negotiable and non-negotiable union proposals is ultimately within the jurisdiction of the FLRA....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the FLRA found that there was "nothing in the record which indicates that the proposals would interfere with the Agency's objective."...&#8197;That conclusion can hardly be characterized as arbitrary or capricious.</p>
<p class="noindent">The right to determine a method of doing work precludes direct and indirect infringements. In one of the decisions denying the negotiability of the method that an agency distributes paychecks (actually, savings bonds), FLRA noted mission-related matters falling within the meaning of "performing work" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) include support functions integrally related to the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp. And AFGE Local 2747</span>, 19 FLRA 3, 3-4 (1985). A paycheck distribution proposal was nonnegotiable because the union's request--quicker distribution of checks--would require increased hiring and reorganization within the finance office, a result inconsistent with the agency's right to determine how it performed its work. <span class="Italic">NTEU Local R14-89 and Army Air Defense Artillery Ctr.</span>, 32 FLRA 392, 400-02 (1988). In another decision, because stools made it difficult for the customs inspectors to make some observations of what passengers were doing with baggage or to quickly stop passengers who attempted to destroy contraband, the use of the stools was a nonnegotiable method of doing work. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Region I and NTEU</span>, 15 FLRA 309, 310-11 (1984). The same type of indirect interference prevented negotiation of a proposal that the union have a permanent voting representative on an "Invention Evaluation Committee." <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1437 and Army Armament Research, Dev. And Eng'g Ctr., Picatinny Arsenal</span>, 35 FLRA 1052, 1066-67 (1990) (Proposal 3).</p>
<p class="noindent">The methods and means of performing work involve decisions by the agency as to how the agency performs its work or the tools or devices used to perform that work, not decisions concerning who will best perform the work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1985 and VAMC Dublin</span>, 55 FLRA 1145, 1148 (1999), explained in the context of a provision (Proposal 1) that a certain classification of employees not be required to administer a certain medical procedure:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are two prongs to the Authority's current test used to determine whether a proposal concerns the methods and means of performing work<span class="Italic">. See General</span> <span class="Italic">Services Administration and American Federation Of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Council of GSA Locals, Council 236, </span>54 FLRA 1582,1589 (1998) <span class="Italic">(AFGE GSA Council 236); National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 7 and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Rural Development, Portland, Oregon, </span>53 FLRA 1435, 1437-38 (1998) <span class="Italic">(NFFE Local 7). </span>First, the proposal must concern a "method" or "means" as defined by the Authority. The Authority construes "method" to refer to "the way in which an agency performs its work." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 7, </span>53 FLRA at 1437, <span class="Italic">citing International</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 49 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army Corps</span> <span class="Italic">of Engineers, South Pacific Division, San Francisco,</span> <span class="Italic">California, </span>52 FLRA 813, 818 (1996) <span class="Italic">(Army Corps of</span> <span class="Italic">Engineers). </span>The term "means" refers to "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work." <span class="Italic">AFGE GSA</span> <span class="Italic">Council 236, </span>54 FLRA at 1589-90; <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 7,</span> 53 FLRA at 1437-38. Second, it must be shown that (1) there is a direct and integral relationship between the particular methods or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission; and (2) the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Association of Civilian Technicians,</span> <span class="Italic">Arizona Army Chapter 61 and U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">Defense, National Guard Bureau, Arizona National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard, </span>48 FLRA 412, 420 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the first prong of the test, there is no basis on which to conclude that the proposal concerns the method and means by which the Agency performs its work. The proposal deals with the assignment of duties to particular employees. As the Authority stated <span class="Italic">in AFGE GSA Council 236, </span>in connection with a union's claim that a contracting out proposal concerned the methods and means of performing work, "proposals concerning contracting out do not relate to the <span class="Italic">way </span>in which an agency <span class="Italic">performs its work </span>or the <span class="Italic">tools</span> or <span class="Italic">devices </span>that may be used in accomplishing it. Rather, such proposals relate to an agency's decision-making process concerning <span class="Italic">by whom </span>the work is best performed--either in-house by agency employees or by employees of an outside organization." 54 FLRA at 1590 (emphasis in original; footnote omitted). Similarly, here, the requirement to assign only licensed employees the duty of administering certain medication involves <span class="Italic">who</span> will perform work, not the way in which the work is performed or the tools and devices that may be used to accomplish the work. As the proposal fails to satisfy the first prong of the methods and means test, there is no need to address the second prong of that test.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See NFFE Local 2192 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv.</span>, 59 FLRA 868, 872 (2004) (methods and means of performing work include tools or equipment agency uses in accomplishing its mission).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the proposal directly interferes with the agency's right to determine the technology of performing work, FLRA will, on request, consider the proposal under an "appropriate arrangements" bargaining test. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">NATCA Local ZHU and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 65 FLRA 738, 742-43 (2011) (approving negotiations Proposal 7, considered arrangement calling for positioning of radar positions to facilitate communications between controllers in adjacent sectors); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1122 and DHHS, SSA, W. Program Serv. Ctr.</span>, 47 FLRA 272, 279 (1993) ("Under section 7106(b)(1), management retains the discretion to determine that it will not install additional telephones with rollover capability to handle rollover calls. Consequently, the proposal is nonnegotiable unless it constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">GSA and AFGE Council of GSA Locals</span>, 54 FLRA 1582, 1590 n.6 (1998) (discussing legislative history defining methods and means).
