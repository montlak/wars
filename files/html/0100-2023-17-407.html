<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-405"><span class="space">3.</span> Prevailing Party</h4>
<p class="noindent">To obtain fees, a party must prevail in the arbitration. The concept of prevailing party status was explored in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard and AFGE Local 4015</span>, 34 FLRA 725, 729 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The "prevailing party" requirement was examined in detail by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In applying this standard, it should be borne in mind that determining who prevails is really no more than a totaling up of who won and who lost. It is a practical matter: for example, if a penalty is imposed against an employee and, as a result of his appeal, it is reduced, then that employee may be deemed to have prevailed.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Sterner v. Department of the Army</span>, 711 F.2d at 1567 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the definition of "prevailing party" set forth in <span class="Italic">Sterner</span>, a grievant may be the prevailing party in the proceeding if he or she obtains mitigation of discipline, even though he or she may have committed the offense which is the basis for that discipline. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Van Fossen v. MSPB</span>, 788 F.2d 748, 749, n.5 (Fed. Cir. 1986), in which the court, citing <span class="Italic">Sterner</span>, upheld the MSPB's finding that a grievant was a prevailing party because he obtained a significant part of the relief sought--reduction of discipline from a removal to a 30-day suspension--although the charges against him were sustained.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Dept. of Air Force, Warner Robins ALC</span>, 64 FLRA 884, 886-87 (2010), also reviewed what it takes to be a prevailing party:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the grievant was not a prevailing party because the Arbitrator's decision to mitigate the grievant's suspension was based on a procedural determination that the February 7 charge was untimely, rather than on a determination regarding the merits of the grievance. The Authority applies the definition of "prevailing party" adopted by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), under which an employee is the prevailing party within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) when the employee "received an enforceable judgment or settlement which directly benefited [the employee] at the time of the judgment or settlement." <span class="Italic">U.S. GSA</span>, <span class="Italic">Ne. &#x0026; Caribbean Region, N.Y., N.Y., </span>61 FLRA 68, 70 (2005) (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def., Dep't of Def. Dependents Sch., </span>54 FLRA 773, 788 (1998) (citation omitted)). Moreover, under MSPB precedent, an employee that receives a mitigated penalty is considered to have received significant relief and is, therefore, a prevailing party. <span class="Italic">E.g., Hutchcraft v. <span id="page_2439"></span>Dep't of Transp., </span>55 M.S.P.R. 138, 142 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd, </span>996 F.2d 1235 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table) (<span class="Italic">Hutchcraft</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the Arbitrator's award resulted in a mitigation of the grievant's suspension and an award of backpay. Consequently, regardless of the basis of the Arbitrator's determination, the grievant clearly received an enforceable judgment that benefited him. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3105, </span>63 FLRA 128, 130 (2009) (Authority reversed arbitrator's conclusion that grievant was not prevailing party where arbitrator determined that grievant was not prevailing party because his decision was based on agency's procedural error). Moreover, the Agency cites no precedent in support of its assertion that the grievant's reduced penalty is not "significant relief." To the contrary, under MSPB precedent, an employee who receives a mitigated penalty is considered to have received significant relief and is, therefore, a prevailing party. <span class="Italic">See Hutchcraft, </span>55 M.S.P.R. at 142. We, therefore, find that the grievant is a prevailing party within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7701(g).</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Ray</span>, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) overruled its prior case law that defined a prevailing party as one who had obtained all or a significant part of the relief that was sought. In so doing, the MSPB relied on Supreme Court decisions interpreting other attorney fees statutes. In general, when exceptions concern the standards established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), the Authority looks to the decisions of the MSPB and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923</span>, 49 FLRA 858, 864 (1994).

<p class="noindent-1">We find that the grievants were the prevailing parties because they received an enforceable judgment that directly benefitted them at the time of the judgment.&#x2003;In this regard, the employees were awarded EDP in the grievance and, as the Agency failed to file exceptions to the award, it is required to take the actions required by that award. The fact that the period of time for which EDP was ordered was less than that sought is irrelevant.

<p class="noindent-1">The standards established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), which apply to all cases except those involving allegations of discrimination, include the threshold requirement that the employee must be the prevailing party. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense, Defense Distribution Region East, New Cumberland</span>, <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 2004</span>, 51 FLRA 155, 158 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Local 2004</span>).

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the grievant "did <span class="Italic">not</span> violate the leave request procedure" in connection with his request for leave on 2 days, and the Arbitrator mitigated the disputed 2-day suspension to a written reprimand. The Arbitrator also directed the Agency "to pay [the grievant] two days of back pay plus interest." Clearly, the grievant directly benefitted from the award, and, as a result, the grievant is the prevailing party. <span class="Italic">See Local 2004</span>, 51 FLRA at 160. Accordingly, the portion of the award denying attorney fees, based on the determination that the Union was not the prevailing party, is deficient as contrary to the Back Pay Act.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">A threshold requirement for an award of attorney fees under the Back Pay Act is a finding that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of State</span>, 59 FLRA 129, 130 (2003) (<span class="Italic">State</span>) (citations omitted).

<p class="noindent-1">The personnel action at issue at arbitration is the Agency's alleged failure to pay the grievant HPD.

The Union does not argue that this factual finding is deficient as a nonfact. As the Back Pay Act requires that an employee suffer an actual loss of pay, allowances, or differentials to be entitled to an award of attorney fees, <span class="Italic">State, </span>59 FLRA at 130, and based on the Arbitrator's factual finding, to which we defer, that the grievant suffered no such loss, <span class="Italic">Local 1164</span>, 66 FLRA at 77-78<span class="Italic">,</span> we find that the Arbitrator's denial of attorney fees is consistent with the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Union's argument that it is entitled to attorney fees based on the MSPB decision is misplaced. The MSPB proceeding challenged the Agency's removal of the grievant. But the arbitration proceeding concerns the Agency's alleged failure to pay the grievant HPD.

Specifically, the Court found that a party who has achieved its desired result because its claim brought about a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct cannot be considered a "prevailing party." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 605-06.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that in addressing the standards under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), it will apply the MSPB's definition of the term "prevailing party" and will look to the decisions of MSPB and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for guidance. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Navy,</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr., Newport, R.I., </span>57 FLRA 32, 33 (2000); <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R5-188, </span>54 FLRA 1401, 1406 (1998); <span class="Italic">DOD, </span>51 FLRA at 160 n.5; <span class="Italic">United States</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of HHS, Soc.

In addition, the Authority has previously determined that the standards set forth by the Supreme Court for applying the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988, are applicable to requests for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R4-6, </span>54 FLRA 1594, 1598 n.1 (1998); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force Hdqt., 832D Combat</span> <span class="Italic">Support Group DPCE, Luke AFB, Ariz., </span>32 FLRA 1084, 1100 (1988). Consistent with the foregoing precedent, we will henceforth apply the definition of "prevailing party" set forth in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon </span>and adopted by the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that because the Agency voluntarily paid the grievant at Step 2 of the parties' grievance procedure, the grievant was not entitled to attorney fees under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). The Arbitrator's finding that the grievant was not entitled to fees in these circumstances is fully consistent with MSPB decisions holding that an appellant is not the "prevailing party," where an agency unilaterally rescinds an adverse action during the pendency of an appeal. <span class="Italic">See Sacco I,</span> 90 MSPB 37; <span class="Italic">see also Cole, </span>90 MSPR 627; <span class="Italic">Sacco II, </span>90 MSPR 225; <span class="Italic">Nichols, </span>89 MSPR 554.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that a different definition of the term "prevailing party" under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) should apply where fees are sought pursuant to the Back Pay Act because grievance arbitration matters and the Back Pay Act "extends to a significantly wider range of matters than those within the purview of the MSPB." The Union's claim in this regard is contrary to the express terms of the Act, which limit the circumstances under which an employee may recover attorney fees to the standards established under &#x00A7; 7701(g). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii). In addition, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Indian Head Div., Indian Head, Md.,</span> 57 FLRA 417 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Naval Surface Warfare</span>), is misplaced and its argument that the decision to pay the grievant constituted a settlement of the grievance is without merit. In this regard, the exceptions in <span class="Italic">Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Surface Warfare </span>did not involve "prevailing party" status, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), and nothing in the record indicates that the parties entered into an enforceable settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The formal entry of some relief by the arbitrator, coupled with a failure by the arbitrator to declare a controversy moot, led to prevailing party status, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1592 and Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB</span>, 65 FLRA 921, 921-23 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency contended that, during the arbitration hearing on the merits of the grievance, it had granted the grievant the disputed comp time, and that the time had appeared in time and attendance records prior to the issuance of the merits award. The Agency argued that, as a result, the grievant was not a prevailing party, as required for an award of attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g) (&#x00A7; 7701(g)). <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Bd. &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v.

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator acknowledged that the Agency had granted the grievant the disputed comp time prior to her merits award, but stated that she "did not have a factual basis for considering the instant matter to be moot."<span class="Italic"> </span>In this connection, she stated that "because she awarded the [g]rievant [three] hours of...comp time in her [merits award], based on the merits of his grievance, the [g]rievant is a prevailing party." Thus, she concluded that the grievant was entitled to an award of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In interpreting the term "prevailing party" in &#x00A7; 7701(g), the Authority has applied the definition of that term set forth in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon </span>and adopted by the MSPB. Specifically, the Authority has held that a grievant is a prevailing party when he or she obtains an enforceable judgment that benefited him or her at the time of the judgment. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 324.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, which set forth this definition, involved a lawsuit that challenged a particular requirement in a state law. <span class="Italic">See </span>532 U.S. at 601. While the lawsuit was pending, the challenged requirement was eliminated from the law, and, consequently, the district court dismissed the lawsuit as moot. <span class="Italic">See </span>532 U.S. at 601. In assessing whether attorney fees were appropriate, the Supreme Court rejected the petitioners' argument that fees were warranted under a "catalyst theory[,]" i.e., because their lawsuit brought about the change in the respondents' conduct. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 605. Instead, the Court found that the term "prevailing party" requires the party to have been awarded some relief by a court, and, thus, only court judgments on the merits and settlement agreements enforced through consent decrees create the "alteration in the legal relationship of the parties[&#8197;]" that is necessary for an award of fees. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 603-05. In contrast, the Court found that a "voluntary change in conduct[&#8197;]...lacks the necessary judicial <span class="Italic">imprimatur </span>on the change." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 605.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching its conclusions in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, the Court rejected the petitioners' claim that the catalyst theory was necessary to prevent defendants from unilaterally mooting an action before judgment in order to avoid an award of attorney fees. Specifically, the Court stated that "so long as the plaintiff has a cause of action for damages [rather than equitable relief], a defendant's change in conduct will not moot the case." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 608-09. Moreover, the Court emphasized that "[i]f a case is not found to be moot, and the plaintiff later procures an enforceable judgment, the court may of course award attorney's fees." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 609.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, the MSPB has found that appellants were not prevailing parties in cases where agencies had unilaterally rescinded the appealed actions <span class="Italic">and </span>the MSPB's administrative judges dismissed the employees' appeals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cole, </span>90 M.S.P.R. at 628; <span class="Italic">Sacco, </span>90 M.S.P.R. at 39; <span class="Italic">Nichols, </span>89 M.S.P.R. at 555. In <span class="Italic">Sacco </span>and <span class="Italic">Nichols</span>, the administrative judges dismissed the appeals as moot, and in <span class="Italic">Cole</span>, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal after the agency filed a motion to dismiss as moot and the employee withdrew his appeal. Consequently, in those decisions, there were no judgments on the merits on which the MSPB could base a finding that the employees were prevailing parties. Further, consistent with <span class="Italic">Buckhannon </span>and this MSPB precedent, the Authority has found that a grievant was a prevailing party, despite an agency's claim <span id="page_2441"></span>that its voluntary action mooted the grievance, where the arbitrator rejected the mootness claim. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 65 FLRA at 324.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the above-cited precedent, here, in issuing the merits award, the Arbitrator did not find the grievance moot; instead, she sustained the grievance and awarded relief in the form of comp time. In the remand award, the Arbitrator specifically found that she "did not have a factual basis for considering the instant matter to be moot." The Agency did not except to the merits award and, thus, did not argue that the grievance was moot or challenge the Arbitrator's award of comp time, which the Authority subsequently found to be an award of pay, allowances, or differentials. In addition, the Agency's exceptions to the remand award do not expressly challenge the Arbitrator's statement that the matter was not moot. Thus, in the words of the Supreme Court, as this "case [wa]s not found to be moot" and the Arbitrator issued the merits award sustaining the grievance, "the [Arbitrator] may of course award attorney's fees." <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 532 U.S. at 609.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The grievant was suspended for 1 day, and the Union filed a grievance on his behalf that was submitted to arbitration. During the arbitration hearing, the Agency "voluntarily and unilaterally rescinded" the suspension and agreed to award the grievant backpay. The Arbitrator retained jurisdiction pending proof of the cancellation of the suspension, which was provided by the Agency. On request of the Union, the Arbitrator further retained jurisdiction to resolve the Union's motion for attorney fees on behalf of the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator denied the motion for attorney fees.&#x2003;He concluded that the grievant was not the prevailing party within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g) because the cancellation of the grievant's suspension "did not result from a consent decree, settlement agreement or arbitration award." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 5-6 (citing <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Bd. &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v.

<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, an employee entitled to backpay may also receive "reasonable attorney fees related to the personnel action[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(l)(A)(ii). If fees are sought in a grievance, then they are awarded "in accordance with standards established under &#x00A7; 770l(g) of [title 5]," which pertains to attorney fee awards by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). The standards for an award of attorney fees under &#x00A7; 770l(g) include, among other things, that the employee must be the "prevailing party." When exceptions concern the standards established under &#x00A7; 770l(g), the Authority looks to the decisions of the courts and the MSPB for guidance. 58 FLRA at 243. In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1547,</span> the Authority held that it would apply the definition of "prevailing party" set forth in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> and adopted by the MSPB under &#x00A7; 770 l(g). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As a result, for a grievant to be a prevailing party within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7701 (g), the grievant must obtain an enforceable judgment, order, consent decree, or settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this precedent, we find that the Arbitrator correctly concluded that the grievant was not the prevailing party within the meaning of &#x00A7; 770 l(g) because he did not obtain an enforceable arbitration award, consent decree, or settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> We reject the Union's claim that the grievant is the prevailing party because the Agency's rescission of the suspension "is enforceable as a ruling" and that it "obtained an enforceable judgment." In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1547,</span> the Authority specifically adopted the MSPB's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7701 (g), holding that an employee is not the prevailing party when an agency unilaterally rescinds an adverse action during the pendency of an appeal. 58 FLRA at 243. Because the Arbitrator correctly concluded that the grievant was not the prevailing party under &#x00A7; 770l(g), the Union's claim that the cases cited by the Arbitrator are distinguishable provides no basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (express terms of &#x00A7; 7701 (g) provide the standards under which an employee may recover attorney fees). Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Even if the grievant suffered an actual loss of pay, she would not be entitled to fees under the Back Pay Act because she is not the "prevailing party," within the meaning of the standards established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g). In this regard, the Authority recently held--adopting the definition of "prevailing party" set forth in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Board &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health &#x0026; Human Resources</span>, 532 U.S. 598 (2001) and adopted by the Merit Systems Protection Board--that an appellant is not the "prevailing party" where an agency unilaterally rescinds an adverse action during the pendency of an appeal. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1547</span>, 58 FLRA at 242-43. As the Agency rescinded the grievant's suspension prior to the arbitration hearing, the grievant is not a "prevailing party," and the award of attorney fees is not consistent with the requirements of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

Under this definition, a grievant is a prevailing party when the grievant obtains an enforceable judgment that benefited the grievant at the time of the judgment. The Authority has noted that, under <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, the MSPB has found that appellants were not prevailing parties in cases where agencies had unilaterally rescinded the appealed actions and the MSPB's administrative judges had dismissed the employees' appeals. Consistent with this principle, where an agency has unilaterally rescinded a grievant's suspension before an arbitration hearing, the Authority has held that the grievant is not a prevailing party.").</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Awards of attorney fees under the Back Pay Act must be in accordance with the standards established under &#x00A7; 7701(g), which pertains to awards of attorney fees by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 65 FLRA 320, 323 (2010).

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that a grievant is not a prevailing party under &#x00A7; 7701(g) in instances where an agency has unilaterally rescinded a disputed action during the pendency of an appeal. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 446</span>, 64 FLRA 15, 16 (2009) (agency unilaterally rescinded suspension); <span class="Italic">State Department</span>, 59 FLRA at 130 (same); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1547</span>, 58 FLRA 241 (2002) (agency voluntarily restored grievant's overtime). <span class="Italic">Accord Sacco v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 37, 41-42 (2001) (agency unilaterally rescinded constructive suspension).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the initial award, the Arbitrator stated that there was "evidence...that the Agency...restor[ed]" the grievant's annual leave, but "out of an abundance of caution[,]" the Arbitrator directed the Agency to restore the grievant's annual leave. In the second supplemental award--the award at issue here--the Arbitrator "clarif[ied]" the initial award to find expressly that the Agency had in fact "restored" the grievant's annual leave "the day before the arbitration" hearing. Therefore, the Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievant was a prevailing party, and his award of attorney fees based on that conclusion, are contrary to &#x00A7; 7701(g). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., State Department</span>, 59 FLRA at 130.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the award of attorney fees is contrary to &#x00A7; 7701(g), and we set it aside. As such, it is unnecessary to consider the Union's exceptions claiming that the Arbitrator's reduction in the amount of fees requested was contrary to Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DODDS and FEA</span>, 54 FLRA 773, 788-91 (1998), emphasized that the degree of success--as long as there is some success--is not determinative of prevailing party status. <span class="Italic">DODDS</span> also noted that an arbitrator properly limits a fee award to efforts devoted to only those grievants who, among a larger group of grievants, prevail in their claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the Union is not entitled to attorney fees because the Union only prevailed with regard to grievant Rooney and therefore, failed to succeed in obtaining all or a significant part of the relief it sought. The Agency also argues that finding the grievant to be a prevailing party in this case is contrary to public policy because the amount of attorney fees awarded far exceeds the nominal damages recovered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The requirement in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g) that an employee be a prevailing party is met if the employee has received "an enforceable judgment or settlement which directly benefitted him at the time of the judgment or settlement." <span class="Italic">DiGiulio v. Department of Treasury</span>, 66 MSPR 659 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Ray v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 64 MSPR 100 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Ray</span>)). Contrary to the Agency's assertion, the degree of success obtained is not a consideration in determining whether an employee is a prevailing party. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DDRE</span>, 51 FLRA at 161. Further, the fact that a party receives only a nominal award does not impact on whether he or she is a prevailing party. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 506 U.S. 103, 112 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Farrar</span>) (holding that plaintiff receiving judgment for one dollar was prevailing party even though the plaintiff had sought $17 million in compensatory damages).[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, after determining that the plaintiff was the prevailing party, the Court found that an attorney is not entitled to fees for the representation of a plaintiff receiving "only nominal damages because of [the plaintiff's] failure to prove an essential element of his claim for monetary relief[.]" 506 U.S. at 115. In the present case, however, the grievant did not fail to prove an essential element of <span id="page_2442"></span>his claim. Therefore, as set forth <span class="Italic">infra</span>, such a basis for finding the fee award unreasonable is not present in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Fee Award granted attorney fees only with respect to the Merits Award and that portion of the Merits Award concerning grievant Rooney. It did not award attorney fees for work incurred for any other portion of the grievance resolved in the Bloch Award or the Merits Award. Thus, the attorney fees awarded only relate to the portion of the grievance in which the Union was successful. In this respect, the grievance resolved in the Merits Award sought the appropriate payment of interest, to which the grievants were entitled by virtue of the Bloch Award, and the Arbitrator made a specific finding as to the accrual date for the payment of interest due to grievant Rooney. As found by the Arbitrator in the Fee Award, inherent in the establishment of that date was the requirement that the Agency pay grievant Rooney a specific amount of interest that he otherwise would not have received. Clearly, grievant Rooney benefitted from that award, and, as a result, grievant Rooney is the prevailing party. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3310 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army Corps of Engineers, Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, Mississippi</span>, 53 FLRA 1595, 1600 (1998). The fact that grievant Rooney sought interest for a longer period than that for which he received interest is irrelevant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DDRE</span>, 51 FLRA at 161. Similarly, the fact that his recovery is arguably nominal is irrelevant to the "prevailing party" determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 112.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Sterner v. Department of the Army</span>, 711 F.2d 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">Sterner</span>), the Agency contends that attorney fees are not warranted in the interest of justice because of the "<span class="Italic">de minimis</span>" nature of the grievant's recovery. We conclude that the Agency's claims in this respect are misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 33 MSPR 127, 131 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Woodall</span>), the MSPB noted the <span class="Italic">Sterner</span> court's holding "that 'the extent of a party's victory' is clearly relevant to the interest of justice requirement set out in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1)." However, in <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, the MSPB specifically rejected the Agency's contentions that the extent of the employee's victory was "<span class="Italic">de minimis</span>" because the amount of backpay the employee received was small--after four years of litigation, the employee benefitted by approximately $1,800 dollars. In this regard, the MSPB found that "the amount of the [employee's] back pay award has no relevance to the question of the extent of his victory in determining his entitlement to attorney fees." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 132. Rather, the MSPB, citing <span class="Italic">Van Fossen v. MSPB</span>, 788 F.2d 748, 751 &#x0026; n.7 (Fed. Cir. 1986) and <span class="Italic">Sterner</span>, 711 F.2d at 1569-70, stated that "[d]etermining the extent of a party's victory requires a consideration of such factors as whether the appellant succeeded in having the action mitigated as opposed to reversed; if the action is mitigated, whether the penalty is major or minor; and the gravity and circumstances of the sustained charges." <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, 33 MSPR at 132. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Butler v. Dowd</span>, 979 F.2d 661 (8th Cir. 1992) (court upheld award of approximately $95,000 in attorney fees where civil rights plaintiffs only received $1 each in damages); <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R4-6 and U.S. Department of the Army, Fort Eustis, Virginia</span>, 52 FLRA 1522 (1997) (reversing the arbitrator's determination that attorney fees were not recoverable under the Back Pay Act in connection with an award of two hours of administrative leave).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the arguably <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of a grievant's backpay recovery does not impact on the determination as to whether attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the award of attorney fees is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g) because it is not reasonable. Specifically, the Agency argues that it is unreasonable to award fees where, as in this case, relief was granted to only one of 17 grievants and the fee award far exceeds the "<span class="Italic">de minimis</span>" nature of the underlying award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, the Supreme Court, citing <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983) (<span class="Italic">Hensley</span>), found that once a plaintiff meets the threshold requirement of being the prevailing party, the extent to which he prevailed is the most critical factor to consider in determining reasonable attorney fees. 506 U.S. at 114. Thus, the Court stated "that if 'a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 436). Relying on that precedent, the MSPB has held that in determining the "reasonableness" of attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), it is necessary to consider whether a fee award should be reduced because the relief ordered was significantly less than what was sought. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stein v. United States Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 685, 690 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Stein</span>). In circumstances where the relief ordered is significantly less than that sought, "an award may be reduced either by identifying the hours associated with unsuccessful claims or by simply reducing it to account for the limited success." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Smit v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 612, 619 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Smit</span>)). Thus, the MSPB has held that "when more than one claim for relief is made and the claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories, the fee determination should reflect the significance of the overall relief obtained in relation to the hours reasonably expended." <span class="Italic">Smit</span>, 61 MSPR at 618-19.</p>
