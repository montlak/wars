<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-83"><span class="space">d.</span> Decision to Require a Clearance; Whether Clearance Required as Employment Condition</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In early 1989, <span class="Italic">Skees v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 864 F.2d 1576, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1989), declared that an appellant may not obtain Board review of a decision to require a security clearance for a position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Skees accepts <span class="Italic">Egan</span> as prohibiting the Board from reviewing the Navy's revocation of his security clearance. He does not dispute that he knew his job was contingent on retaining his clearance. Rather, he contests the Navy's classification of his position as one requiring a security clearance in the first place. By this argument he seeks to do indirectly what he cannot do directly. He is still asking what was forbidden by <span class="Italic">Egan</span>: that an outside nonexpert body second-guess the Navy's judgment on protection of classified information in its charge. But this argument was subsumed in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. If the Board cannot review the employee's loss of security clearance, it is even further beyond question that it cannot review the Navy's judgment that the position itself requires the clearance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board confirmed that it would not become involved in determining whether an agency properly insists that all positions at a facility carry clearances. <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 691, 694 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Kriner v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 526, 529 (1994) ("The entrustment of national security matters to executive agency heads recognized by <span class="Italic">Egan</span> also precludes the Board from reviewing the agency's reasons for imposing a clearance requirement on a particular position."); <span class="Italic">Brady v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 133, 138 (1991) (Board has no authority to review the agency's reasons for imposing a clearance requirement, even when the employee has alleged a violation of his constitutional rights); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Retzlaff v. Dept. of Army</span>, CH-0752-14-0375-I-1 (NP 2/3/2015) ("Nevertheless, he reiterates as his sole argument on review that a security clearance was not actually necessary because he had been able to perform the assigned daily duties and responsibilities of his position without the need for a security clearance from the time of his return from active military duty in October 2011 until his suspension in May 2012. However, such an argument is also beyond the scope of the Board's authority to consider. As the administrative judge correctly determined, the Board may not review the propriety of the agency's decision that the position requires a security clearance."). The right to review of the decision to require a clearance is not expanded because the employee argues that the classification decision was in reprisal for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mattingly v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP No. 02-3032).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2544"></span>But if there is a dispute over whether the appellant's position requires a clearance, or whether the appellant is actually working in the position that does require a clearance, the AJ should take evidence on the issue, <span class="Italic">West v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 86, 88-90 (1994) (Member Amador dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that the Board lacks authority to review the agency's reasons for imposing a security clearance requirement as a condition of employment for a position. <span class="Italic">See Mitchell v. Department of the Navy,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. 691, 693-94 (1990). In reviewing an adverse action based on the revocation of a security clearance, however, the Board may inquire whether the agency has established that a security clearance was required for the position in question. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Lassiter v. Department of the Navy,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 23, 24-25 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]n agency security officer asserted that the appellant's position must have required a security clearance because the agency would not have granted him one otherwise. She admitted, however, that she had no personal knowledge of whether this was the case. The evidence of record indicates that the agency granted the appellant a security clearance in April 1987 because the duties of his job at the Recurring Work Division of the Public Works Center required him to have access to classified matter. Again, however, the appellant was not working at the Recurring Work Division when he was removed in October 1993, and the job description number listed on the request for a security clearance is not the same as the one under which the appellant was working at the time of his removal. As the record now stands, then, we cannot determine whether the position the appellant was working in at the time of his removal was subject to a security clearance requirement. In order to resolve the issue, we remand the appeal to the regional office so that additional evidence and testimony may be taken.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">At times the evidence seems a bit attenuated. In <span class="Italic">Crook v. DOD</span>, 71 Fed. Appx. 54, 56 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge appears to have concluded that, even if the agency did not establish that the appellant's position was subject to a security clearance requirement, the charge could still be sustained because the appellant occupied a non-critical sensitive position. However, the Board is required to adjudicate an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency and may not substitute what it considers to be a more appropriate charge. <span class="Italic">Guerrero v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 617, &#x00B6; 6 (2007). Although <span class="Italic">Egan</span> applies equally to Board appeals under chapter 75 based on the revocation of a security clearance and those based on the revocation of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, the removal action at issue in this appeal is based explicitly on the revocation of the appellant's security clearance. <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d at 1160. Not all sensitive positions require a security clearance or entail access to classified information. <span class="Italic">See Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d at 1160 ("<span class="Italic">Egan</span> prohibits review of [Department of Defense] national security determinations concerning eligibility of an individual to occupy a sensitive position, <span class="Italic">which may not necessarily involve access to classified information</span>." (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">see also Conyers v. Department of Defense</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 13 (2010) (the parties stipulated that the appellants' non-critical sensitive positions "did not require the incumbents to have a confidential, secret or top secret clearance...[or] access to classified information"), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded on other grounds sub nom. Berry v. Conyers</span>, 692 F.3d 1223 (Fed. Cir. 2012), <span class="Italic">reh'g granted en banc and vacated by Berry v. Conyers</span>, 497 Fed. Appx. 64 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Thus, we discern no basis to conclude that the agency can prove its charge, as set forth in its proposal and decision letters, without proving by preponderant evidence that the appellant's position was subject to a security clearance requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency failed to prove by preponderant evidence that it established a security clearance requirement for the appellant's position. The Supply Technician position description indicates that the position is non-critical sensitive but does not state that the position requires a security clearance. The appellant submitted a Standard Form 50 (SF-50), documenting his change from the position of Electronics Technician to the lower-graded position of Supply Technician in February 2005, which also makes no mention of a security clearance requirement. Neither the position description, nor the SF-50, indicates that the position could entail access to classified information. We also note the absence of other documents in the record which might reflect an established security clearance requirement, such as a vacancy announcement for the position of Supply Technician, an affidavit from an agency official, or, more generally, an agency policy announcing such a requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the various documents in the agency file which reference a security clearance requirement constitute preponderant evidence that the agency established such a requirement. The documents the administrative judge cited were all created as part of adjudicatory processes: the security clearance adjudication process, the removal process, and the adjudication of the appellant's EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Cf. Delancy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; 8 (2001) (an agency's proposal notice cannot itself constitute evidence of the charged conduct and may only be considered as forming part of the agency's valid proof where the letter is not merely conclusory and is corroborated by other evidence); <span class="Italic">cf. Trachy v. Defense Communications Agency</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 317, 322 (1983) (the fact that a statement was solicited by the agency for litigation purposes only, rather than being the type of statement that is routinely made, constituted a factor tending to lessen the credibility of the statement), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by Gill v. Department of the Navy</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 308, 311 (1987). Further, all of these documents were created years after the appellant was appointed to his position and do not establish that the agency imposed a security clearance requirement at the time the appellant was appointed or at any time during his employment up until the agency took action to revoke his purported clearance and remove him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find it curious that, despite suspending the appellant's access to classified information in March 2007, pending a determination on his eligibility for such access, the agency was able to retain him in his Supply Technician position until rendering its removal decision in December 2010. IAF, Tab 8 at 35 (FAD indicating that the appellant's first-level supervisor "acknowledged that the [appellant] had been working as a Supply Technician without a security clearance for more than three years"), (proposal notice stating that the appellant would "remain in a duty status, until further notice"). While the agency claims that "any duties requiring the handling of classified material had been referred to other employees with the proper security clearance," it is unclear how or why the agency maintained this alleged arrangement for nearly 4 years if eligibility for access and/or actual access to classified information was a requirement of the appellant's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the agency has failed to meet its burden to prove its sole charge--that the appellant "fail[ed] to meet a condition of employment" "[a]s a result of [his] clearance revocation"--because it failed to prove by preponderant evidence that the appellant was required to maintain a security clearance, in the form of eligibility for access to classified information, as a condition of employment. Thus, the appellant's removal must be reversed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rodriguez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 525 (2008) (ordering the agency to cancel the appellant's removal because it failed to prove its charges).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An arguable error in processing a position description does not control a determination of the need for a clearance, and the need for a clearance is not rebutted by the appellant's testimony that his duties did not require, or no longer required, a clearance, <span class="Italic">Cox v. Dept. of Army</span>, DE-0752-16-0260-I-1 (NP 2/1/2023):</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency submitted the appellant's position description, which states that "[t]he incumbent of this position must qualify for and maintain a SECRET clearance." At the hearing, the appellant testified that this was his position description and agreed that his position required security access and a secret clearance. Based on this position description and the appellant's testimony, the administrative judge found that his position required a security clearance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On review, the appellant challenges this finding. Specifically, he asserts that the agency failed to properly draft his position description in that it was not certified by a supervisor, in violation of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) and chapter 51 of Title 5. The Director, Civilian Personnel Advisory Center, reviewed the appellant's position description and testified that, in 2010, when the appellant's position description was last reviewed, there was no expectation that position descriptions in the electronic system would be certified in the certification block of the description. She further testified that, although the descriptions did not have supervisory certifications, this did not invalidate them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant argues that Optional Form 8 of the FPM includes a place for a supervisory signature, thus indicating that the agency should have included a signature on his position description. The FPM was abolished on December 31, 1993, and therefore, while it is instructive, the Board is not required to abide by its provisions. <span class="Italic">Drury v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6; 8 (1998). We find no basis for applying the FPM here, when the appellant is attempting to relate its sample forms to the agency's electronic system for classifying positions. We also find nothing in chapter 51 of Title 5, which includes provisions addressing position classifications that would require the agency to draft a position <span id="Page_2545"></span>description in a particular manner. The appellant has pointed to no other agency policy or statutory requirement that would indicate that his position description was invalid. Accordingly, we find, on the basis of the appellant's testimony and his position description, that he was employed in a position that required a security clearance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant argues, however, that his position no longer required a security clearance because he had no need to access classified information since 2007. The Board lacks authority to review the agency's reasons for imposing a security clearance requirement. <span class="Italic">West v. Department of the Navy</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 86, 88-89 (1994). Consequently, even if the appellant is correct that he did not need to access classified information, it is not for the Board to decide why the agency required his position to have a security clearance. Thus, the appellant's argument does not provide a reason for disturbing our conclusion that the agency proved its charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Two members of the Board (there being no third member at the time) issued separate opinions in the nonprecedential decision of <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD</span>, 110 MSPR 593, 2009 MSPB 32 (2009), involving whether the Board could review the decision of an agency to designate a position noncritical sensitive and remove from Board review the removal of employee as a result of the loss of eligibility to hold the noncritical sensitive designation. Chairman McPhie found the agency's designation to be unreviewable. Vice Chairman Rose disagreed. Because the vote was split, the decision of the AJ (affirming the removal) was affirmed.

<p class="Body-Text">The separate opinions in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, are provided here to show the members' split on review of agency designations of levels of security worthiness necessary for job retention. Chairman McPhie's opinion was:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant occupied a position that was designated non-critical sensitive by the agency pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(a). After providing the appellant with an opportunity to respond to a tentative decision, the Consolidated Adjudication Facility of the agency's Washington Headquarters Services (CAF WHS) issued a memorandum advising the appellant that her "eligibility for access to classified information and/or occupancy of a sensitive position" had been denied. The agency then proposed and decided to remove the appellant, based on "revocation/denial of your Department of Defense Eligibility to occupy a Position of Trust...based solely on your inability to maintain eligibility to occupy a sensitive position." The appellant filed a timely appeal challenging her removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ held that <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), governed the case. According to the AJ, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> stands for the proposition that an individual does not have a property right or liberty interest in obtaining or retaining a security clearance, and that the Board is therefore without authority to review the merits of an agency's decision to deny a security clearance to an employee. Per <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, when an employee is removed for failure to maintain a security clearance, Board review is limited to determining whether the agency can meet its burden of proving (1) the appellant's position required a security clearance; (2) her security clearance was denied or revoked; (3) transfer to a nonsensitive position was not feasible; and (4) the agency followed the procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 in processing the removal action. ID at 5, <span class="Italic">citing Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ acknowledged that the appellant had not been denied a "security clearance" <span class="Italic">per se</span>, and that the agency had conceded that the appellant's position does not require a "security clearance." Nonetheless, the AJ found that an agency decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a position designated sensitive under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(a) is "virtually identical" to the "security clearance" determination considered by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. In particular, the AJ carefully examined the Supreme Court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and concluded that it was equally applicable to the circumstances of appellant's case. Accordingly, the AJ considered the appeal under the limited standard of review prescribed by <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and affirmed the agency's removal decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and the language and structure of the regulation, it is well settled that the Board does not have authority to review the merits of an agency's designation of a position as a "sensitive position" at one of the three levels. <span class="Italic">See Skees v. Department of the Navy</span>, 864 F.2d 1576, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (reasoning that if, under <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, "the Board cannot review the employee's loss of security clearance, it is even further beyond question that it cannot review the Navy's judgment that the position itself requires the clearance"); <span class="Italic">Bolden v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 151, 154 (1994) (holding that "Board is without authority to review the agency's reasons for imposing the security access requirement"); <span class="Italic">Brady v. Department of the Navy</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 133, 138 (1991) (holding that the Board has no authority to review an agency's decision to classify a position as non-critical sensitive).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By designating the appellant's position as non-critical sensitive under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(a), the agency made the unreviewable judgment that "the occupant could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security." Accordingly, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(b), the agency imposed an appropriate investigative requirement to ensure that the appellant's background did not create, in its judgment, an undue risk to national security. As a result of that investigation, the CAF WHS, an independent branch of the agency, determined that the appellant was ineligible for occupancy in a sensitive position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these facts, there is no meaningful distinction that would warrant treating the determination that the appellant is ineligible to occupy a sensitive position any different from a determination denying or revoking an employee's security clearance. In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Supreme Court clearly described the precise authority under which the agency here designated appellant's position as sensitive,[1] and went on to include an employee's eligibility to hold such a position as the type of discretionary judgment that is not reviewable by the Board because executive agency heads have authority to classify and control access to information consistent with national security.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Supreme Court cited Executive Order No. 10450, &#x00A7; 3, 3 CFR 937 (1949-1953 Comp.). 484 U.S. at 528. The regulations authorizing agency heads to designate positions as "sensitive" and authorizing OPM to establish investigative requirements for each sensitivity level--5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 732.201(a) and 732.201(b)--had not been codified at the time <span class="Italic">Egan</span> was decided. However, Executive Order No. 10450 is the authority for the regulations and their requirements are drawn from the Executive Order. Thus, the Supreme Court clearly had in mind the language now contained in those two regulations when it described the authority of agency heads to classify positions "in three categories: critical sensitive, noncritical sensitive, and nonsensitive. Different types and levels of clearance are required, depending upon the positions sought. A Government appointment is expressly made subject to a background investigation that varies according to the degree of adverse effect the appointment could have on the national security." 484 U.S. at 528.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant case cannot be distinguished from <span class="Italic">Egan</span> on the grounds that "[n]othing in the record...suggests that the duties of the position held by the appellant involve access to classified information or to areas restricted to personnel with security clearances." Separate Opinion of Vice Chairman Mary M. Rose ("Rose Opinion"), &#x00B6; 4. Indeed, the Board's judgment as to whether the position involves access to classified information or otherwise implicates national security is irrelevant. Under <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, <span class="Italic">Skees</span> and <span class="Italic">Brady</span>, the Board has no authority to review the agency's decision to designate the appellant's position as noncritical sensitive. Although a reasonable argument could be made that there <span class="Italic">should</span> be some limitation upon or review of an agency's discretion to designate positions under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732(a), that fact does not bear upon whether <span class="Italic">the Board</span> has such authority. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hesse v. Department of State</span>, 217 F.3d 1372, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2000), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 531 U.S. 1154 (2001) (in response to argument that an employee who is denied WPA appeal rights to challenge as retaliatory the revocation of his security clearance would have no other recourse, the court observed that "employees typically have internal appeal procedures within their agencies through which to object to adverse decisions on security clearance issues").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also not relevant that the appellant's position did not require a security clearance. As the foregoing discussion shows, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> is not limited to security clearances, <span class="Italic">per se</span>. Its reasoning applies to any access eligibility standard that an agency, in its discretion, chooses to impose on candidates for a position that the agency has designated as sensitive because in the agency's judgment, the occupant of the position could materially, adversely affect national security. Moreover, the term "security clearance" should not be viewed as a term of art, but merely as a semantic device to describe--in the Supreme Court's words--any "background investigation" an employee must undergo and pass before being placed in a position deemed a national security risk. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Romero v. Department of Defense</span>, 527 F.3d 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the court rejected the argument that the appellant's security clearance was not revoked, on the grounds that "the WHS-CAF's statement that his eligibility 'for access to classified information and to occupy a sensitive position has been revoked' shows that his clearance was revoked." 527 F.3d at 1330 n.2. Notably, this is the precise language used by the agency to describe appellant's loss of eligibility to occupy her "sensitive" position. <span class="Italic">See also</span>, <span class="Italic">Tchakmakjian v. Department of Defense</span>, 57 Fed. Appx. 438, 439-40 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (applying <span class="Italic">Egan</span> standard of review to removal of employee who occupied a position that was designated non-critical sensitive and who was removed when the agency revoked his "security clearance and eligibility to occupy a sensitive position"); <span class="Italic">Bolden</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 152, 154 <span id="Page_2546"></span>(holding that the Board did not have authority to review the agency's reasons for imposing a "security access requirement or to review the merits of the security access determination" when reviewing the appeal of an employee holding a position that was designated non-critical sensitive and who was indefinitely suspended when his "access to classified information and areas was revoked"); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 277, 278 (1991) (applying <span class="Italic">Egan</span> standard of review to removal of employee who occupied position that was designated non-critical sensitive and who was removed when his access to "sensitive duties or classified information" was revoked).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Tellingly, the Vice Chairman's Separate Opinion fails to address how an AJ would weigh the merits of the agency's decision to deny the appellant "eligibility for access to classified information and/or occupancy to a sensitive position." In <span class="Italic">Egan</span> the AJ that originally heard the case held that the Board could review the merits of the security clearance denial, and imposed on the agency the burden to (1) specify the precise criteria used in its security-clearance decision; (2) show that those criteria are rationally related to national security; and (3) prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the acts precipitating the denial of his clearance actually occurred, and that the alleged misconduct has an actual or potentially detrimental effect on national security interests. 484 U.S. at 523.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These standards would obviously require the AJ to make the very determinations that the Supreme Court deemed in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to be beyond the expertise of the Board. As the Supreme Court explained, "it is not reasonably possible for an outside nonexpert body to review the substance of such a judgment [to deny a security clearance] and to decide whether the agency should have been able to make the necessary affirmative prediction [that the employee did not pose a national security threat] with confidence." 484 U.S. at 529. The absence of an alternative standard that would satisfy <span class="Italic">Egan</span> further demonstrates that Board review of the agency's determination in this case would be incompatible with that controlling Supreme Court precedent.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Vice Chairman Rose's Separate Opinion lists a number of decisions showing that the Board has exercised authority to review determinations underlying an adverse action notwithstanding <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. Even on the face of the parentheticals accompanying the citations, it is apparent that all but one of these cases did not involve agency decisions implicating national security issues generally, let alone the specific "sensitive" position designation at issue in both <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and the instant case. Rose Opinion, &#x00B6; 6. The one ambiguous parenthetical is for <span class="Italic">Adams v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 50, &#x00B6; 6, 9-12 (2007), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 273 Fed. Appx. 947 (Fed. Cir. 2008). In <span class="Italic">Adams</span>, the agency removed the appellant after conducting a background check that resulted in the suspension of his access to a computer that was essential to the performance of his job functions. However, the agency conceded that "the information [to which the employee would have access through the computer system] is not classified and has indicated that it does not consider access to that information to be equivalent to possession of a security clearance." 105 M.S.P.R. 50, &#x00B6; 12. Nor had the position been designated as "sensitive" by the agency. Consequently, the Board found that the appeal did not "involve the national security considerations presented in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The case is therefore inapposite.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The separate opinion of Vice Chairman Rose in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> was:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed in the position of commissary contractor monitor, GS-05, a position the agency had designated "noncritical sensitive." After deciding to deny the appellant "eligibility for access to classified information and/or occupancy of a sensitive position," it removed her based on that decision. A Board administrative judge sustained the action on appeal after finding that, under <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 530-31 (1988), he had no authority to review the agency's reasons for finding the appellant ineligible to hold a sensitive position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530-31, the Supreme Court held that the Board did not have the authority, in an appeal of an adverse action based on the revocation or denial of a security clearance, to review the substance of the security clearance determination, or to require the agency to support the revocation or denial by preponderant evidence, as it would be required to do in other adverse action appeals. In reaching this conclusion, the Court referred to the Executive Branch's "efforts to protect national security information by means of a classification system...," <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 527; to the need to commit "the protection of classified information...to the broad discretion of the agency responsible," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 529; and to the '"reasonable basis [it had found] for the view that an agency head who must bear the responsibility for the protection of classified information committed to his custody should have the final say in deciding whether to repose his trust in an employee who has access to such information,'" <span class="Italic">id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young</span>, 351 U.S. 536, 546 (1956)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Clearly, the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> is based on agencies' special responsibilities for safeguarding classified information, and on their consequent need to exercise discretion in deciding which of their employees should be granted access to that information, i.e., in deciding which of their employees should be granted security clearances. Nothing in the record of the present appeal, however, suggests that the duties of the position held by the appellant involve access to classified information or to areas restricted to personnel with security clearances. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> PFR at 5 (the appellant's statement that she has "never...worked with classified information"). In fact, despite the designation of her position as "noncritical sensitive," and despite the suggestion in an agency instruction that incumbents of such positions generally are investigated for security clearances, the agency acknowledges that the appellant's position did not require a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See</span> Appeal File, Tab 13 (order summarizing prehearing telephone conference) at 2.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Washington Headquarters Services Administrative Instruction No. 23, "Personnel Security Program and Civilian Personnel Suitability Investigation Program" (Dec. 20, 2006), <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/a023.pdf">http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/a023.pdf</a>, provides, in paragraph 5.1.2.2., that "[n]ominees for Noncritical-Sensitive positions shall be required to submit the forms for the completion of an Access [National Agency Check With Inquiries]," and that "[f]avorable adjudication shall result in the issuance of a SECRET clearance or CONFIDENTIAL eligibility." Neither this instruction nor any other authority of which I am aware, however, provides that positions designated "noncritical sensitive" may be held only by persons holding security clearances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I note further that the employee in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> held a position that, like that of the appellant in the present case, was designated as "noncritical sensitive." <span class="Italic">See Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 521. The Supreme Court's findings regarding the limited nature of the Board's review in that case were based on the requirement that the employee hold a security clearance, however, and, as I have noted above, on the government's need to protect the classified national security information to which the employee had access. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 527-30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Nothing in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> indicates that the designation itself was sufficient to preclude Board review of the merits of the determination underlying the employee's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Egan</span> exception for security clearance determinations is not the only one limiting the Board's review of underlying reasons for adverse actions. The Board has noted that the military system is separate from the civilian system, with separate rules, regulations, procedures, and other considerations. <span class="Italic">See Siegert v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 684, 690 (1988). For this reason, it has held that it lacks the authority to review "wholly military determinations." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> For example, in a case in which an employee's removal is based on his loss of membership in the active military reserve, it does not consider the merits of military personnel decisions resulting in that membership loss. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Buriani v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 777 F.2d 674, 675-77 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Butler v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 313, 318 (1997); <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. 305, 309 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 694 F.2d 281 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (Table). It also has held that it lacks the authority to look behind certain determinations made by authorities outside the employing agency. For example, it does not reexamine the reasons behind a criminal conviction in order to determine the innocence or guilt of an appellant whose adverse action was based on such a conviction, and it does not examine the reasons for bar decertification when such an action was the basis for an appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">Egan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 509, 517-18 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Crofoot v. United States Government Printing Office</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 248, 252 (1984), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 761 F.2d 661, 665 (Fed. Cir. 1985),[2] and <span class="Italic">McGean v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 49 (1983)), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 868 F.2d 1277 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Board subsequently overruled <span class="Italic">Crofoot</span> to the extent that that decision limited the collateral estoppel effect of crimes for which employees were convicted pursuant to an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea. <span class="Italic">Loveland v. United States Air Force</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 484, 490 n.6 (1987). Nothing in the decision overruling <span class="Italic">Crofoot</span> indicates that the holdings cited above are not applicable here. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 488-90 &#x0026; n.6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Exceptions such as those described above, however, are limited. The general rule is that the Board's review of the merits of an adverse action includes a review of any determination underlying that action. <span class="Italic">See Egan</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. at 517 n.5. For example, the Board has held that, despite <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, it has the authority to review the decision of an agency credentials committee to revoke an employee's clinical privileges, when that revocation was the basis for the employee's removal. <span class="Italic">Siegert</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. at 687-91; <span class="Italic">see also Cosby v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 16, 18-19 (1986) (the Board had the authority to review the validity of a medical determination underlying the removal of an air traffic control specialist). It also has held that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> does not preclude its review, in an appeal of a removal for "failure to maintain access to the Command Computer system," of the propriety of the agency's denial of access to sensitive personnel information, <span class="Italic">Adams v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 <span id="Page_2547"></span>M.S.P.R. 50, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 9-12 (2007), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 273 Fed. Appx. 947 (Fed. Cir. 2008); that it has the authority to review a security guard's disqualification from the Chemical Personnel Reliability Program based on his alleged verbal assault on a security officer, <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Department of the Army</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 688, 689 (1994); and that it has the authority to review an employee's disqualification under the agency's Personnel Reliability Program based on his allegedly negligent conduct, <span class="Italic">Dodson v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 562, 564 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The eligibility determination on which the removal at issue here was based is no more analogous to the denial of a security clearance than are the determinations the Board found, in the cases cited in the preceding paragraph, it had the authority to review. I note, in connection with this matter, that the agency presented hearing testimony that the appellant worked at the commissary at times when it was closed to the public, and that she was responsible for ensuring that doors were locked and that only authorized personnel were permitted to enter the facility. The record indicates, however, that agency officials regarded these responsibilities as sensitive because of the need to protect the store's valuable inventory, and not for any national security reasons. The appellant's duties with respect to store security appear to be similar to those of security guards, police officers, and others entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding agency property and personnel. The Board routinely reviews agency determinations underlying removals of such employees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jacobs</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 689; <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 224, 226, 230-32 (1993) (removal of a supervisory police officer for failing to file tax returns, a failure that violated the agency's minimum standards of conduct).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also presented testimony that the appellant had access to a computer and could "potentially gain access to numerous computer programs." The appellant's access appears to have presented security concerns only because of potential financial losses or privacy issues, however, and not because of any threat the access might pose to national security. The only computer programs mentioned in this testimony were those related to "the personnel program, the pricing, billing, inventory, ordering." A decision to deny the appellant computer access therefore would appear to be similar to underlying determinations the Board has reviewed in other cases. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Adams</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 50, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, an agency witness testified that the commissary was located on a military installation, and that the incumbent of the appellant's position "could have some knowledge of troop movements, certainly of troop levels, especially if a product was sharply increased or decreased, it may give some indication of troop levels on the base."[3] The agency does not require the incumbent of that position to hold a security clearance, however, as we have noted above; and there evidently are positions at the commissary where the appellant was employed that the agency does not regard as sensitive. Moreover, the testimony that the appellant might gain knowledge of troop levels on the base from the amounts of products the commissary purchased or sold seems speculative at best. A casual observer of traffic near the base would appear likely to gain equivalent information. Nothing in the record supports the proposition that the information to which the appellant had access in her position was similar to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.102(a), the term "national security position" includes positions that require regular use of or access to classified information, and those "that involve activities of the Government that are concerned with the protection of the nation from foreign aggression or espionage...." While the agency indicated in its prehearing brief that issues in the case included whether the "appellant's position [was] designated as a sensitive national security position consistent with 5 CFR 732.201 and Executive Order 10450," it does not appear to have argued specifically that the position was a "national security position" as that term is defined in that section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, I do not believe <span class="Italic">Egan</span> supports a finding that the Board lacks the authority to review the determination underlying the appellant's removal. I also see no other basis for concluding that the Board is precluded from reviewing the merits of that underlying agency determination. Obviously, the determination was made by the agency itself, rather than by an outside authority. It therefore is not analogous to a criminal conviction or a bar decertification. In addition, it is not a "wholly military determination." Instead, it was made under a system and procedures that are applicable to civilian federal employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I do not question the authority of the agency to determine the sensitivity level of its positions, to investigate its own personnel, and to make determinations concerning their eligibility for their positions. As I have indicated above, however, employees who are entitled to appeal their removals to the Board are entitled to a review of the reasons for those actions and, with limited exceptions, to a review of the merits of the determinations underlying those reasons. Because the determination underlying the removal at issue here does not fall within any of those limited exceptions, I would find that the administrative judge erred in declining to review the merits of that determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, I would vacate the part of the initial decision in which the administrative judge sustained the charge against the appellant, and I would remand the appeal for further adjudication. <span class="Italic">See Siegert</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. at 690 (in finding that it had the authority to review the merits of a decision revoking an employee's clinical privileges, the Board noted that an agency could not, through its own action, take away the Board's jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pistilli v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> NY-0752-11-0001-I-2 (NP 12/14/2011), involved an agency that was converting positions from nonsensitive to positions requiring individuals to hold security clearances. The agency maintained two sets of positions descriptions, one not requiring a clearance; the other requiring the incumbent to hold a clearance. As individuals obtained clearances, they were reassigned to the sensitive positions. Appellant, who was supposed to be moved to a position that required him to hold a clearance, was unable to secure the clearance and was not reassigned to the redesignated position. He was fired for lack of the clearance. The Board reversed the discharge, concluding that since the agency had not actually reassigned the employee, it did not have a basis for discharging him from the position that he held and that did not require the clearance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice of proposed removal stated the charge as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Reason 1: Failure to meet requirements of your position due to the denial of a Top Secret security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Specification 1: You are employed as an Investigative Analyst. As a condition of that position, you are required to have a top secret security clearance. On March 25, 2008[,] management was notified [that] you were denied a top secret security clearance. Accordingly, you are unable to satisfy a requirement of your position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency had the authority to require employees in the appellant's work unit to possess a top secret security clearance, the particular means by which it did so in this case was to create a separate position description and convert employees to that new position description only after they obtained the required clearance. Thus, the appellant, who failed to obtain a clearance, was never officially assigned to a position that formally required a top secret security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the agency proved its charge by preponderant evidence, the administrative judge relied upon the revised position description, "other agency memoranda," and a declaration from the deciding official. However, none of the documents submitted by the agency establish that the appellant was ever placed in a position that formally required a top secret security clearance, and there is no evidence that the revised position description was ever applied to the appellant. While the deciding official did state in his declaration that the appellant's position required a top secret security clearance, he did not identify the source of that requirement. We therefore find that the deciding official's unsupported assertion is of minimal probative value. <span class="Italic">See Adamsen v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-17 (2011) (giving "little weight" to a claim in an unrebutted statement from an agency official where the statement lacked any factual basis to support the claim). Upon review of the entire record, we find that the agency failed to prove its charge by preponderant evidence because it failed to establish that the appellant's position required a top secret clearance. Accordingly, we REVERSE the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the Board's review of an adverse action based on the denial or revocation of a security clearance is limited. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 530-31 (1988). However, one of the issues the Board may review in such a case is whether the appellant's position actually required a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Moreover, the agency charged the appellant with failing to satisfy a condition of his position by failing to obtain a top secret security clearance. Thus, in order to support its charge, the agency was required to show that the appellant's position actually required a top secret clearance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Enforcement proceedings developed in <span class="Italic">Pistilli v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, NY-0752-11-0001-C-1 (NP 11/20/2013). The Board determined it could not require the agency to place the appellant into a position requiring a clearance that the agency would not grant, although the appellant continued in a job not requiring the clearance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency's argument that the appellant must hold a security clearance in order to resume his CI position appears to contradict the Board's prior decision--something which our decisions would not permit, <span class="Italic">see Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 296, 302 (1995) (an agency cannot refuse to comply with a Board reinstatement order based on reasons that were rejected by the Board in the decision reversing the action)--there is a difference between an agency taking an adverse action against an employee for his failure to hold a security clearance and an agency's imposition of a security clearance requirement; while the former falls within the ambit of the Board's jurisdiction, the latter does not, <span class="Italic">see Schnedar v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 M.S.P.R.<span id="Page_2548"></span> 246, &#x00B6; 8 (2013) (The Board may only determine whether: the appellant's position required a security clearance; his security clearance was denied; transfer to a nonsensitive position was not feasible; and he was provided with the procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513.); <span class="Italic">see also Skees</span>, 864 F.2d at 1578. Thus, the Board is without authority to order the appellant into a position which the agency has determined requires the appellant to hold a clearance which he does not possess.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, the Board's enforcement authority is confined to ordering the appellant restored to duty in a position similar to that which he held prior to his removal. <span class="Italic">See Tubesing</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10; <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">LaBatte</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 594. The agency has returned the appellant to the detail assignment he held prior to his removal performing similar duties, thus satisfying the Board's reinstatement order. The appellant has not challenged the similarity of his duties before and after his reinstatement to this assignment. We have considered the remainder of the appellant's arguments on review and find that they do not support reversal of the administrative judge's compliance initial decision....</p>
