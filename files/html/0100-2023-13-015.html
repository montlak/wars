<p class="Body-Text">Although we classify the bases for constructive adverse actions by the type of coercion (time pressure, misrepresentation), or failure to accommodate a disability, and the type of action (resignation, retirement), actions may become constructively adverse through a combination of factors that must be evaluated as a whole, <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD</span>, 109 MSPR 493, 498 &#x00B6; 14, 2008 MSPB 177 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ's jurisdictional order in this case provided the appellant with notice of what an appellant must nonfrivolously allege to be entitled to a jurisdictional hearing on the issue of the voluntariness of a resignation or retirement generally. As the AJ explained, to invoke the Board's jurisdiction over involuntary retirement appeals generally, the appellant must present sufficient evidence to establish that the action was obtained through duress or coercion or show that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency. <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1123-24; <span class="Italic">Huyler v. Department of the Army</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 570, &#x00B6; 5 (2006). The touchstone of the "voluntariness" analysis is whether, considering the totality of the circumstances, factors operated on the employee's decision-making process that deprived him of freedom of choice. <span class="Italic">Coufal v. Department of Justice</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 22 (2004); <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 513, 519-20 (1995). An appellant is entitled to a hearing on the issue of Board jurisdiction over an appeal of an alleged involuntary resignation or retirement only if he makes a nonfrivolous allegation casting doubt on the presumption of voluntariness. <span class="Italic">Burgess</span>, 758 F.2d at 643.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As an example of a multifactor review of an allegedly involuntary retirement, the Federal Circuit remanded for a Board hearing an appeal involving a school administrator who retired after being issued a removal decision that was based on relatively minor misconduct and that would have taken the employee out of his foreign post assignment in too short a time to permit him to complete the tasks required for the relocation. The employer offered him the opportunity to retire with a later departure date. The employer was <span id="Page_1909"></span>alleged to have misrepresented to the employee insurance entitlements based upon retirement rather than dismissal, and to have also misrepresented to the employee his right to appeal the separation to the Board. The employee accepted the retirement and then challenged it as adverse. The court concluded that the combination of factors constituted nonfrivolous allegations of coercion entitling the employee to a hearing, <span class="Italic">Middleton v. DOD</span>, 185 F.3d 1374, 1379-83 (Fed. Cir. 1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is limited to adverse personnel actions expressly made appealable to it by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a) (1994); <span class="Italic">Forest v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 47 F.3d 409, 410 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Although retirements and resignations are not so designated, if shown to be involuntary they are treated as constructive removals and thus within Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Mintzmyer v. Department of Interior</span>, 84 F.3d 419, 423 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Whether the Board has jurisdiction to adjudicate a particular appeal is a question of law, which we review <span class="Italic">de novo. See King v. Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d 1384, 1387 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of this court's predecessors, the United States Court of Claims, laid down a clear, concise standard for determining the voluntariness of a resignation in <span class="Italic">Christie v. United States</span>, 518 F.2d 584 (Ct. Cl. 1975). This case established the following three-part test for determining when coercion or duress vitiates an apparently voluntary resignation: "(1) that one side involuntarily accepted the terms of another; (2) that circumstances permitted no other alternative; and (3) that said circumstances were the result of coercive acts of the opposite party." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 587. This test is an objective, rather than subjective one; an employee's subjective feelings are irrelevant. The employee must present allegations of fact which, if proven, establish that a reasonable employee confronted with the same circumstance would feel coerced into resigning. <span class="Italic">See Braun v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 50 F.3d 1005, 1007-08 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (holding that a former Department of Veterans Affairs employee "made a non-frivolous allegation that, if proven, could establish that his resignation was coerced," which is "all that is required to trigger the Board's jurisdiction at this threshold stage"). The same standards apply to retirement decisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Staats v. United States</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employee resignations and retirements are presumed to be voluntary, and usually, as here, are evidenced by a formal document signed by the employee. This presumption may only be rebutted by a showing of sufficient evidence to establish that the retirement or resignation was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Christie</span>, 518 F.2d at 587. The former employee bears the burden of pleading and proving involuntariness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to be entitled to an evidentiary hearing before the Board on jurisdiction, such an employee must make non-frivolous allegations that, if proven at an evidentiary hearing, could establish Board jurisdiction. "Moreover, the requirement that an employee make a threshold non-frivolous allegation of jurisdiction in order to be entitled to a hearing applies even with respect to a jurisdictional issue such as involuntariness, which is closely tied to the merits of the underlying claim." <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1125; <span class="Italic">see also Braun</span>, 50 F.3d at 1008; <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 789 F.2d 892, 894 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (holding that the threshold determination upon the government's motion to dismiss an employee's appeal from a removal action was whether he "allege[d] facts which if proven could make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of involuntariness"). We examine Dr. Middleton's allegations in light of this standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that the Board abused its discretion when it denied Dr. Middleton's request for an evidentiary hearing. For the reasons detailed below we are convinced that Dr. Middleton made sufficient allegations to warrant an evidentiary hearing as to the voluntariness of his retirement and of his signing the MOU (and, hence, of jurisdiction). Dr. Middleton alleged that he faced overwhelming time pressure to leave Turkey, that he faced pressures from ill health, and that he relied to his detriment on various misrepresentations by the DODDS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its decision, the Board considered <span class="Italic">separately</span> Dr. Middleton's allegations of (1) coercion and duress; and (2) of misinformation. All relevant non-frivolous allegations, including background facts, however, must be viewed as a whole when determining whether, if proven, they could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of involuntary retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Middleton alleged that the amount of time he was given in the removal notice he received on June 2--eleven days--was insufficient to arrange his affairs, leave the military base, and depart Turkey by June 13. This allegation is based on the May 30, 1997 decision letter from Dr. Ellinger, superintendent of Dr. Middleton's school district, directing Dr. Middleton to arrange for the return of his identification and ration cards by the close of business on June 13, 1997. The letter read, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You are directed to return to Mr. Menniti, Principal, Incirlik High School, any U.S. government or DODDS property that is in your possession. The termination of your employment will also require the return of your identification card and ration cards, if any, and those of your dependents if you are the sponsor of individuals who are your dependents. Therefore, you should <span class="Italic">begin immediately to make</span> <span class="Italic">arrangements</span> for clearing the military installation, terminating any rental agreements, and arranging for the exercise of any transportation entitlements. You are to contact Mr. Menniti, <span class="Italic">by close of business on</span> <span class="Italic">June 13, 1997, to arrange for return of your identification and ration cards</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government does not dispute the accuracy of any of the information contained in this letter. It does contend, however, that, implicit in the removal notice was a recognition that, so long as Dr. Middleton began making arrangements to leave Turkey by June 13, he would not be forced off the base. No evidence is provided by the government that Dr. Middleton in fact drew such an inference, nor that a similarly situated reasonable employee would have, either. On the contrary, it appears that only by resigning could Dr. Middleton extend the time to leave from eleven days to eight weeks, since Dr. Ellinger told him removal would give him only until June 13, while retiring would give him until August 1 to depart. It strains credulity and logic, moreover, to suggest, as the government apparently does, that a fired employee could expect to remain on the base. Nor is it reasonable to suppose a fired employee could retain his identification and ration cards so long as he had made arrangements before June 13 to surrender them at some later time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Time pressure to make a [retirement or resignation] decision has, on occasion, provided the basis for a finding of involuntariness, but only when the agency has demanded that the employee make an immediate decision." <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1126; <span class="Italic">see also Paroczay v. Hodges</span>, 297 F.2d 439, 441 (D.C. Cir. 1961); <span class="Italic">see generally Cosby v. United States</span>, 417 F.2d 1345, 1355 (Ct. Cl. 1969). We think that Dr. Middleton's allegations of unreasonable time pressure, if proven, could well suffice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to depart Turkey in eleven days, Dr. Middleton and his wife would have to have completed a number of complex administrative tasks, negotiating both American and Turkish governmental, as well as private, bureaucratic procedures. The Middletons would have to be cleared by various agencies on the military base, including the hospital, library and post office. Also, they would have to arrange a meeting with their Turkish landlord to terminate their lease. Utilities, telephone, and cable television services would have to be terminated by visiting those respective offices. Furthermore, the Middletons would have to arrange an appointment with the military agency which handles the moving of household goods. In addition, both Turkish and American customs officials would have to be contacted to make appointments for their respective inspections. Only after this formidable series of tasks had been accomplished could an actual moving date even have been scheduled, much less carried out. The activities the Middletons would allegedly have had to perform in those eleven days were considerable, especially in light of Dr. Middleton's age, poor health, and recent surgery. If these allegations are proven true, we think they could establish duress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is distinguishable from those where because "an employee has been given a period of time, such as two weeks, in which to consider his options, time pressure has not been regarded as a factor indicating involuntariness." <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1126. In <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, we found that, contrary to Mr. Staats's contentions, he was given adequate time to decide whether to take an offer of early retirement arising from the 1992 Postal Service reorganization. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. In fact, he had "several months to consider his alternatives, including several weeks after the Postal Service had announced that employees subject to reassignment in the reorganization would not have their pay or grade reduced." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Dr. Middleton's allegation that he was given a choice between retiring and departing two months later or suddenly uprooting his family from a U.S. military base in Turkey and leaving the country within eleven days is a far cry from Mr. Staats's opting, stateside, after several months of consideration, to take advantage of an early retirement package stemming from a long-planned and widely publicized agency reorganization. Dr. Middleton's claims, we think, at the very least, constitute a non-frivolous allegation that he was coerced into making a nearly immediate decision whether to retire in lieu of removal, based on the circumstances and his ill health. We need not rely, however, solely on facts relating to time pressure, because he pled other types of involuntariness as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Middleton also alleged that he was induced into signing the MOU and retiring based in part on DODDS misinformation, including the supposed loss of health and life insurance benefits if he did not retire but was removed, and his purported right to appeal after retirement. This court has held that "[a] resignation or retirement is involuntary if it is obtained by agency misinformation or deception." <span class="Italic">Covington v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Servs.</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984).[3] "A decision made 'with blinders on,' based on misinformation or a lack of information, cannot be binding as a matter of fundamental fairness and due process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 943. As with time pressure, the standard is not subjective, but, rather, objective: whether "a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency's statements." <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (holding that an employee's "optional <span id="Page_1910"></span>retirement from the federal civil service was an involuntary retirement" where the employer's statement to the employee "was misleading under an objective test, and that petitioner, indisputably a reasonable man, in good faith, justifiably relied on this misleading advice to his detriment"). There is no requirement that the misinforming be knowingly deceptive. <span class="Italic">See Covington</span>, 750 F.2d at 942. Further, an employee can make a factual showing sufficient to obtain a Board hearing on misrepresentation-based involuntariness, despite falling short of the showing necessary to mandate a hearing based on coercion-based involuntariness<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1125.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Covington</span>, the petitioner, a Community Services Administration (a "CSA") employee, received a reduction-in-force (a "RIF") notice informing him that the CSA would soon cease to exist, and that he had no right of assignment to another position. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 939. Relying on this information, Mr. Covington chose to retire<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. The information contained in the RIF notice, however, was incorrect in "material ways." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 942. The RIF notice erroneously stated that the agency would be abolished and that Mr. Covington had no right of assignment to another position. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Although the agency had not intentionally deceived Mr. Covington, his reasonable reliance to his detriment upon the "misleading and erroneous" information contained in the RIF notice rendered his retirement involuntary. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Dr. Middleton, like Mr. Covington, alleged that the incorrect information he received from the government regarding his employment situation so misled and confused him as to affect his decision to resign, or contest the removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the facts on misinformation as alleged by Dr. Middleton are probative and sufficient, at least when viewed against the background facts. First, Dr. Middleton alleged that his district superintendent, Dr. Ellinger, told him that if he did not retire and sign the MOU, the removal action would result in the loss of both Dr. Middleton's and his wife's health and life insurance benefits. Dr. Middleton's ill health and costs associated with present and future medical care at the time were of paramount concern to him. He had recently undergone surgery for kidney stones, was recovering from broken ribs and a gall-bladder operation, and suffered from prostate cancer. Therefore, cancellation, as threatened, of health and life insurance benefits was of overwhelming concern to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, according to Dr. Middleton's affidavit, he spoke to an employee in the office of Linda Councill, an attorney for the DOD Education Activity in Washington, D.C. This employee, whose name Dr. Middleton could not remember, allegedly informed him that "he could appeal [the removal action] even after retirement." Dr. Ellinger had provided Dr. Middleton with Ms. Councill's name, address, and phone number, after explaining that Dr. Middleton could arrange to receive a petition to appeal the removal action by contacting her. The fact that Dr. Middleton subsequently attempted to contact Ms. Councill strongly supports his assertion that he wanted to contest the removal. Furthermore, the fact that he specifically inquired as to the means for filing an appeal from the removal decision also shows plainly his intent to rely upon her office's answer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, Dr. Middleton claims that Dr. Ellinger had informed him that, according to "Headquarters" in "Washington," despite his retirement, he could still appeal his removal to the Board even after signing the MOU, so long as the appeal was timely filed. Following his own conversation with Ms. Councill's office, Dr. Middleton met again with Dr. Ellinger, on June 9, 1997. According to Dr. Middleton's affidavit, when he related the contents of his conversation with Ms. Councill's office to Dr. Ellinger regarding having an opportunity to appeal the removal action, Dr. Ellinger responded, "Yes, keep it within the time limit and most of the time the appeal will be granted." Dr. Middleton claims that he relied on these three alleged misrepresentations in deciding to sign the MOU and retire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues, as the Board found, that by willingly signing the MOU, Dr. Middleton waived all rights to appeal the removal action or challenge his retirement. The Board's piecemeal analysis of Dr. Middleton's allegations may have blinded the Board to what is clear to us: namely, that Dr. Middleton's allegations, taken as a whole, entitle him to an evidentiary hearing on the voluntariness of his retirement. Indeed, the sole relief requested by appellant is an evidentiary hearing. Dr. Middleton is not seeking a ruling of involuntariness. At this preliminary stage, then, we must concern ourselves only with the allegations as to the circumstances surrounding the execution of the MOU and the decision to retire. Moreover, as an appellate court, we may not find facts or assess credibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Middleton's allegations of detrimental reliance in signing the MOU on what is plainly misinformation may well be sufficient. If proven, they could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of involuntariness, especially in combination with the allegations of coercion relating to the removal decision, and the background circumstances of ill health, time pressure, and complicated departure procedures at this distant base. Such allegations cannot be summarily determined adversely merely by looking to the documentary record. <span class="Italic">See Dumas</span>, 789 F.2d at 894 ("[I]f the alleged facts are sufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of involuntariness, the issue can not be summarily determined adversely; the petitioner is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It may well be that, after an evidentiary hearing with live testimony, Dr. Middleton will be found to have voluntarily retired and to have so executed the MOU. But if so, it will likely depend on credibility findings that the Board can only properly make at an evidentiary hearing. We express no opinion on voluntariness here. The only issue we address and decide is whether Dr. Middleton presented sufficient non-frivolous allegations of involuntary retirement to entitle him to an evidentiary hearing. We hold he did.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Rejecting Board jurisdictional analysis that examines isolated rather than accumulated events, <span class="Italic">Trinkl v. MSPB</span>, 727 Fed. Appx. 1007, 1009-11 (Fed. Cir. 2018 NP) (Judge Lourie dissenting) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Trinkl v.

Cir. 2020 NP) (upholding MSPB determination that retirement was voluntary), determined the appellant deserved a jurisdictional hearing and rejected an approach by the Board that evaluated the strength of the appellant's appeal before a hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Resignations are presumed voluntary, and the burden of showing that the resignation was involuntary is on the petitioner." <span class="Italic">Terban v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2000). An employee asserting claims of involuntary retirement on the basis that the agency coerced the employee to retire must show that the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's resignation, the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire, and the employee's resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency. <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. Dep't of Agric</span>., 260 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001). To objectively determine whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign, the tribunal must consider the totality of the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A retirement will not be deemed involuntary where the employee retires simply because he "does not want to accept [actions] that the agency is authorized to adopt." <span class="Italic">Terban</span>, 216 F.3d at 1025 (alteration in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996)). "When determining whether a resignation was involuntary, the MSPB examines 'the surrounding circumstances to test the ability of the employee to exercise free choice.'" <span class="Italic">Lentz v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 876 F.3d 1380, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (quoting <span class="Italic">Perlman v. United States</span>, 490 F.2d 928, 933 (Ct. Cl. 1974)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The [Board] possesses jurisdiction over an appeal filed by an employee who has resigned or retired if the employee proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his or her resignation or retirement was involuntary and thus tantamount to forced removal." <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341. Once a claimant makes a non-frivolous allegation of MSPB jurisdiction, he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 437 F.3d 1322, 1325, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341 n.2 ("When there is a question as to the voluntariness of a petitioner's resignation or retirement and the petitioner makes a non-frivolous allegation of that involuntariness,...an evidentiary hearing is required to determine whether the resignation or retirement was in fact involuntary." (citing <span class="Italic">Braun v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 50 F.3d 1005, 1008 (Fed. Cir. 1995))). Non-frivolous allegations of jurisdiction are those that, if proven, can establish jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1330.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the Initial Decision, the ALJ found that "the onetime display of 'non-verbal aggressive behavior,' would not constitute working conditions that were so difficult that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have felt compelled to retire." The Board similarly concluded that given the length of time between the alleged near-physical altercation, the physical altercation witnessed by Trinkl, and Trinkl's eventual retirement meant that Trinkl failed to make a non-frivolous allegation of involuntary retirement. The Board stated that "given the lapse in time between these incidents in 2007 and 2013 and the appellant's January 10, 2015 retirement, they are not particularly probative evidence of involuntariness of the appellant's retirement," and that "the lack of clarity in the record regarding when the 'near physical attack' occurred...reduces its probative value." The Board also considered Trinkl's requests for reassignment and allegations about being placed on the PIP, and dismissed each as insufficient non-frivolous allegations of involuntary retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question at this stage is whether Trinkl has nonfrivolously alleged circumstances such that a reasonable person in Trinkl's position would have felt compelled to resign. On that question, we reach a conclusion different from that of the Board. Considering Trinkl's allegations of his experiences at the BEA collectively, rather than dismissing them one by one, as the Board did, we find that a person in like circumstances could reasonably feel unable to exercise free choice and compelled to retire. Specifically, Trinkl alleges that after serving the agency for several years with favorable reviews, he experienced multiple instances of hostility from his first- and second-line supervisors, Krakower and Kunze, culminating in a near-physical attack in a small, closed room. Trinkl reported the <span id="Page_1911"></span>incident and consistently refused to meet with his supervisors in person following the attack, resorting even to hiding in the nurse's station to avoid meeting with Krakower and Kunze. Trinkl submitted his retirement paperwork approximately two months after the investigation into his now-dismissed discrimination claims against Krakower and Kunze concluded. Prior to actually retiring, Trinkl was placed on a PIP reviewed by Krakower. Trinkl also sought transfer away from Krakower and Kunze but was denied. In light of Trinkl's allegations of threatened violence and compounded PTSD, being forced to continue working with Krakower and Kunze created working conditions so intolerable for Trinkl that he could reasonably feel driven to resign. We conclude that, viewed in totality, Trinkl makes a nonfrivolous claim of involuntary retirement. Such a "nonfrivolous allegation is all that is required to trigger the Board's jurisdiction at this threshold stage." <span class="Italic">See Braun</span>, 50 F.3d at 1008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board erred in considering and dismissing Trinkl's allegations individually, rather than viewing Trinkl's claims collectively as a series of escalating incidents culminating in his retirement. The Board further erred by considering the relative probative value of Trinkl's allegations over time and discounting the probative value of the alleged near-physical attack due to uncertainty as to when it occurred. Weighing allegations as more or less probative is appropriate only following a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Terban</span>, 216 F.3d at 1024 (discounting events that occurred long before retirement as less probative to the voluntariness inquiry following an evidentiary jurisdictional hearing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board improperly concluded that Trinkl failed to present non-frivolous allegations of jurisdiction, we vacate the decisions below and remand for a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
