<h2 class="h2" id="sec14-201"><span class="space">II.</span> RESTORATION RIGHTS UPON RECOVERY FROM OCCUPATIONAL INJURY OR ILLNESS</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Covered federal employees who fully or partially recover from occupational injuries or illness have statutory rights to restoration, or consideration for restoration, to employment, depending on the duration of the disability and extent of recovery. Statutory provisions are implemented by OPM regulations. Statutes and regulations are applied through MSPB decisions from appeals alleging violations of those statutes and associated regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 8151 provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Under regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;the department or agency which was the last employer shall immediately and unconditionally accord the employee, if the injury or disability has been overcome within one year after the date of commencement of compensation or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States, the right to resume his former or an equivalent position, as well as all other attendant rights which the employee would have had, or acquired, in his former position had he not been injured or disabled, including the rights to tenure, promotion, and safeguards in reductions-in-force procedures, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;the department or agency which was the last employer shall, if the injury or disability is overcome within a period of more than one year after the date of commencement of compensation, make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee in his former or equivalent position within such department or agency, or within any other department or agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations provide, 5 CFR 353.301 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fully recovered within 1 year</span>. An employee who fully recovers from a compensable injury within 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to be restored immediately and unconditionally to his or her former position or an equivalent one. Although these restoration rights are agencywide, the employee's basic entitlement is to the former position or equivalent in the local commuting area the employee left. If a suitable vacancy does not exist, the employee is entitled to displace an employee occupying a continuing position under temporary appointment or tenure group III. If there is no such position in the local commuting area, the agency must offer the employee a position (as described above) in another location. This paragraph also applies when an injured employee accepts a lower-grade position in lieu of separation and subsequently fully recovers. A fully recovered employee is expected to return to work immediately upon the cessation of compensation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fully recovered after 1 year</span>. An employee who separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency's reemployment priority list for the competitive service or reemployment list for the excepted service. If the individual cannot be placed in the former commuting area, he or she is entitled to priority consideration for an equivalent position elsewhere in the agency. (See parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for more information on how this may be accomplished for the excepted and competitive services, respectively.) This subpart also applies when an injured employee accepts a lower-graded position in lieu of separation and subsequently fully recovers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Physically disqualified</span>. An individual who is physically disqualified for the former position or equivalent because of a compensable injury, is entitled to be placed in another position for which qualified that will provide the employee with the same status, and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof, consistent with the circumstances in each case. This right is agencywide and applies for a period of 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation begins. After 1 year, the individual is entitled to the rights accorded individuals who fully or partially recover, as applicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Partially recovered</span>. Agencies must make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. At a minimum, this would mean treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. (See 29 U.S.C. 791(b) and 794.) If the individual fully recovers, he or she is entitled to be considered for the position held at the time of injury, or an equivalent one. A partially recovered employee is expected to seek reemployment as soon as he or she is able.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">MSPB appeal rights are, 5 CFR 353.304 (2022):</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee, who fully recovers from a compensable injury within one year from the date eligibility for compensation began, is entitled to immediate and unconditional restoration to her former position or an equivalent one. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a); <span class="Italic">Hall v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The restoration rights to which a compensably-injured individual is entitled differ depending on the timing and the extent of the individual's recovery. <span class="Italic">See Sherrod,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 25. For example, an employee who fully recovers from a compensable injury within 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began is entitled to be restored immediately and unconditionally to his former position or an equivalent one. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a). An employee who was separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he left or an equivalent one provided he applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). With respect to a partially recovered individual who is able to return to limited duty, an agency must make every effort to restore the individual in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). Finally, an individual who is physically disqualified for the former position or an equivalent one is entitled, for a 1-year period from the date eligibility for compensation began, to be placed in another position for which qualified that provides the employee with the same status, and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof, consistent with the circumstances in each case. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(c). After 1 year, a physically disqualified individual is entitled to the rights accorded individuals who fully or partially recover, as applicable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the appeal rights of a compensably-injured individual are also dependent on the extent and timing of the individual's recovery. For example, an individual who fully recovers from a compensable injury more than 1 year after compensation began may appeal to the Board if he believes that his reemployment priority rights have been violated because of the employment of another person who could not have been appointed properly under the regulations governing appointments to the competitive or excepted service, as appropriate. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 302.501, 330.209, 353.304(b). A partially recovered individual may appeal to the Board for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily or capriciously in denying restoration and, upon reemployment, may appeal the agency's failure to credit time spent on compensation for purposes of rights and benefits based on length of service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). Other compensably injured individuals, including physically disqualified individuals, may appeal to the Board an agency's failure to restore, improper restoration, or failure to return an employee following a leave of absence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(a); <span class="Italic">see Gerdes v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 500, &#x00B6; 7 (2001) (the right to appeal an agency's failure to restore, improper restoration, or failure to return an employee following a leave of absence accrue to a physically disqualified individual).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another description of restoration rights for individuals who are injured on the job and who recover partially or fully and seek to return to work is from <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 92, 96-99 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon an employee's recovery from a compensable injury, the employee is entitled to restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. Part 353 that are dependent upon both the extent of recovery and the time it takes for the appellant to recover. An employee who fully recovers from a compensable injury within 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began is entitled to be restored immediately and unconditionally to his or her former position or an equivalent one. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a). An employee whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one, provided that he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). An equivalent position for the purposes of Part 353 is one of like seniority, status, and pay. <span class="Italic">See Britton v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 170, 172 (1984). Finally, when an individual partially recovers from a compensable injury <span id="Page_4440"></span>and is able to return to limited duty, agencies must make every effort to restore the individual in the local commuting area. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). For the purposes of Part 353, "fully recovered" means compensation payments have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to perform all the duties of the position he or she left or an equivalent one. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. "Partially recovered" means an injured employee who, although not ready to resume the full range of his or her regular duties, has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's Board appeal rights also differ depending on the extent and the timing of the employee's recovery. To establish Board jurisdiction over an appeal alleging entitlement to immediate restoration, the appellant must show that: (1) he had a compensable injury or recurrence of a compensable injury; (2) his OWCP benefits had been terminated within 1 year from the date on which the benefits began, on the basis that he had fully recovered from the compensable injury; and (3) his separation from his position was substantially related to his compensable 6 injury. <span class="Italic">See Denny v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 123, 127 (1990). Because partially recovered employees, and those whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year, are not entitled to immediate and unconditional restoration, their appeal rights are not as extensive as those of an employee who fully recovers within 1 year. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304. A fully recovered excepted service employee entitled to priority consideration may appeal a violation of his or her restoration rights to the Board by presenting factual information that he or she was denied restoration rights because of the employment of another person. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.501. An individual who is partially recovered from a compensable injury may appeal to the Board only for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). Upon reemployment, a partially recovered employee may also appeal the agency's failure to credit time spent on compensation for purposes of rights and benefits based upon length of service, <span class="Italic">id</span>., but a partially recovered employee has no right to appeal an allegedly improper restoration. <span class="Italic">See Scott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 245, 248 (1993), <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed</span>, 22 F.3d 1106 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). However, under appropriate circumstances, the restoration of a partially recovered employee may be deemed so unreasonable as to amount to a denial of restoration within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 248-49. In order to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board may exercise jurisdiction over such an appeal, an appellant must present specific, independent evidence corroborating his allegations that the restoration was unreasonable. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 373, 377 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, to the extent that the appellant claimed that he was not qualified for restoration and should have continued to receive OWCP benefits, we discern no error in the administrative judge's dismissal of this claim for lack of jurisdiction.[3] As the file now stands, we are unable to determine the exact nature of the appellant's restoration rights and the agency's corresponding obligations because it is impossible to determine the series of events that resulted in the appellant's restoration to duty. It is possible that OWCP notified the appellant that it intended to terminate his benefits and the appellant subsequently applied for restoration. If OWCP terminated the appellant's benefits on the basis that he was able to perform all the duties of the position he left, or an equivalent one, the appellant would be entitled to the restoration rights of a fully recovered excepted service employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). However, the Board would lack jurisdiction to consider OWCP's determination regarding termination of his benefits. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 210, 213 (1985) (OWCP decisions are final regarding an employee's entitlement to benefits, but the Board retains the authority to hear and decide collateral issues, such as whether the employee committed fraud in obtaining OWCP benefits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In his appeal form, the appellant alleged that the agency ordered him to return to work in order to force him to apply for disability retirement and thereby "take a cut in benefits." We note that prior to his restoration, the appellant was receiving OWCP benefits, and we further note that compensation from OWCP generally provides an employee with greater benefits than a disability retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices, &#x00A7; 102A2.1-2(A) (Aug. 15, 1995). However, although an appellant who is entitled to both disability retirement benefits and compensation from OWCP must elect between them, he can change his election for different periods of time based on the benefits which will be more advantageous. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, even if we were to accept the appellant's allegation as true, his application for disability retirement would not prejudice his right to receive OWCP benefits if he is otherwise entitled to these benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also possible, however, that OWCP informed the appellant that it would terminate his benefits if he did not accept a suitable job offer from the agency. An agency may hasten a partially disabled employee's return to the workplace by offering suitable work to the employee. The regulations implementing FECA provide that the agency, in cooperation and coordination with OWCP, may offer reemployment in a position suitable to the former employee's capabilities. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.123(d). FECA provides that "A partially disabled employee[4] who--(1) refuses to seek suitable work; or (2) refuses or neglects to work after suitable work is offered to, procured by, or secured for him; is not entitled to compensation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8106(c). The FECA regulations provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Where an employee has been offered suitable employment (or reemployment) by the employing agency (i.e., employment or reemployment which [OWCP] has found to be within the employee's educational and vocational capabilities, within any limitations and restrictions which pre-existed the injury, and with the limitations and restrictions which resulted from the injury),...the employee is obligated to return to such employment. An employee who refuses or neglects to work after suitable work has been offered or secured for the employee has the burden of showing that such refusal or failure to work was reasonable or justified, and shall be provided with the opportunity to make such showing before a determination is made with respect to termination of entitlement to compensation as provided by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8106(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.124(c). An employee may appeal OWCP's final decision to terminate compensation on the basis of the employee's refusal to work after suitable work has been offered to the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board (ECAB). 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.139.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;A partially disabled employee is an "injured employee who is unable to return to the position held at the time of injury (or to earn equivalent wages) but who is not totally disabled for all gainful employment." 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.303(a). Thus, an employee who is partially recovered for the purposes of 5 C.F.R. Part 353, i.e., one who has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements, will generally be a partially disabled employee for the purposes of FECA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant "was forced back into work" because OWCP notified the appellant that it would terminate his compensation if he refused to accept the agency's suitable job offer, the Board would have no authority to overrule OWCP's determination. <span class="Italic">See New v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1259, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 1998) ("It is the OWCP, not employing agencies or the Board, that possesses the requisite expertise to evaluate whether a position is suitable for an employee in light of that employee's particular medical condition."). Thus, to the extent that the appellant may be claiming that he was a partially recovered employee whose restoration rights were violated because he was restored to an unsuitable position which OWCP has found suitable, the Board does not have jurisdiction to consider this claim.[5] The appellant's discrimination and Veterans Preference Act claims.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4441"></span>There is no dispute that the appellant was absent from her position due to a compensable injury and that she has sufficiently recovered to return to work in a part-time or less demanding position. Moreover, we find that the April 27, 2010 job offer constituted a denial of restoration.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual's rights to restoration following a compensable injury are set forth at 5 C.F.R. part 353, subpart C. The specific obligation of an agency under that subpart and the extent of the Board's jurisdiction over restoration claims depend upon the extent of the individual's recovery and the amount of time that recovery took. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(b), "an individual who fully recovers from a compensable injury more than 1 year after compensation begins may appeal to [the Board] as provided for in parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for excepted and competitive service employees, respectively."

USPS</span>, SF-0353-13-4238-I-1 (NP 9/10/2014) (allowing for jurisdiction if the restored job is beyond the appellant's medical restrictions, but declining jurisdiction when the assertion was that the working conditions were alleged to be hostile).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Restoration rights discussed in the decisions that follow are for current or former employees of executive branch employees, <span class="Italic">Medlock-Nurse v. Judicial Branch,</span> SF-3443-14-0679-I-1 (NP 5/20/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's argument that the administrative judge erred by finding a lack of Board jurisdiction, the administrative judge correctly found that claims of improper restoration or failure to restore following a compensable injury are appealable to the Board under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304 only if the appellant is an employee or former employee of an agency in the executive branch, including the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304. Persons employed or formerly employed by the judicial branch, such as the appellant, are not covered. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401 (a)(3) (1987); 60 Fed. Reg. 45, 650, 657 (Sept. 1, 1995) (renumbering section 353.401 to 353.304 without substantive change); 53 Fed. Reg. 857 (Jan. 14, 1988) (modifying section 353.401 to "clarify that employees of the legislative and judicial branches do not have appeal rights to the MSPB"). The administrative judge also correctly found that the appellant was not a fully recovered individual and therefore the Board lacks jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(b) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.501. <span class="Italic">See</span> ID at 3 (citing <span class="Italic">McFarlane v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 126, &#x00B6; 15 (2008)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For years the Board considered restoration claims and resolved them on the basis of a jurisdictional finding. If the statutory or regulatory restoration right was improperly denied, the Board had jurisdiction; there was no jurisdiction if the agency acted properly. <span class="Italic">Chavez v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 481, 484 (2000), with some prompting from the Federal Circuit, adopted a more realistic approach: if the employee claimed a violation of a regulation or statute that provided an appeal right to the Board, then invocation of that statute or regulation placed the matter within the jurisdiction of the Board under 5 USC 7701, extending Board appellate jurisdiction to any action appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation. The jurisdictional niceties are not addressed in the discussion that follows. The effort is to determine how the Board has interpreted and enforced the restoration scheme in its daily adjudication efforts.

<p class="Body-Text">The appeal involving rights to restoration to duty following partial or full recovery is different from treatment of an appeal of a removal based on medical inability to perform a job (whether or not from a work-related injury) and the effect on the "efficiency of the service" standard of recovery during the pendency of the appeal. [Refer to Chapter 8, "Recovery From Disability," and <span class="Italic">Owens v. DHS</span>, 2023 MSPB 7 (2023).]</p>
