<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-182"><span class="space">m.</span> Failure to Receive Initial Decision; E-Filer</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming the initial decision is not just delayed but not received at all, to justify the late filing of a PFR the appellant must prove that both he and his representative did not receive the initial decision; if the Board has evidence that leads it to believe that the representative received the initial decision (even if that evidence is not conclusive), good cause will not be found for late filing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Givens v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 21 MSPR 488, 489 (1984) (ambiguous reference in a union mail log led the Board to find it more likely than not that the representative had received the initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The necessity for promptly filing a PFR following discovery of the existence of an initial decision was explained, <span class="Italic">Biddle v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 68 MSPR 270, 273-74 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we were to accept the appellant's unsubstantiated claim that he did not receive timely notification that his appeal had been dismissed, that would not excuse the inordinate amount of time that he allowed to elapse before inquiring about the status of his appeal. On January 25, 1995, the administrative judge informed the parties that, pursuant to the appellant's request, his appeal had been transferred to the Washington Regional Office, and issued an acknowledgment order directing him to show good cause for his untimely filed appeal by February 24, 1995. Despite the administrative judge's order, the appellant concedes that he did not contact the agency representative about the case until March 22, 1995, and did not contact the administrative judge until April 25, 1995, long after the record had closed and his appeal had been dismissed with prejudice. The appellant's failure to inquire about the status of his case before then was not the act of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances<span class="Italic">. See Campa</span>, 65 MSPR at 323.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the appellant had acted diligently in inquiring about the status of the case, he still was required to exercise due diligence in filing his petition for review once he discovered that the initial decision had been issued<span class="Italic">. See Soleto v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 58 MSPR 253, 256 (1993). The appellant concedes that, by April 25, 1995, he had discovered that the initial decision had been issued dismissing his appeal with prejudice and had been informed of his review rights by the administrative judge. Nevertheless, he did not file his petition for review until June 14, 1995, over one and one-half months after the date he allegedly learned of the initial decision. Consequently, the appellant did not exercise due diligence or ordinary prudence under the circumstances<span class="Italic">. See Labinghisa <span id="Page_1772"></span>v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 52 MSPR 69, 73 (1991) (although appellant did not receive Board's deficiency notice until after its response deadline, appellant did not show good cause for subsequent four-week delay in filing his corrected petition).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Those who are involved in the Board's e-filer system must monitor their Board e-appeal account like young hawks to ensure that they are aware of what is lodged there. If the initial decision is placed into the repository, it is deemed served, and the PFR filing period begins running, upon placement of that initial decision into the e-appeal repository. If the attorney representative participates in the e-filer system, and the appellant receives filings by mail, the appellant is deemed to have been served with the initial decision at the time the attorney is served through the e-filer system, <span class="Italic">Morton v. VA</span>, 113 MSPR 365, 367-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7, 2010 MSPB 45 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Pensanti claims that she did not receive the initial decision until October 13, 2009. We reject her contention that she did not receive the initial decision until this late date. As we discussed in <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Social Security Administration,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 581, &#x00B6; 5 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Our e-filer regulations provide that, as a registered e-filer, the appellant agreed to accept documents through electronic service and, further, that he was required to monitor his case activity at the Repository at e-Appeal Online to ensure that he received all case related documents. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(e), (j)(3). Moreover, our regulations provide that pleadings and Board documents served electronically on registered e-filers are deemed received on the date of electronic submission. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14 (m)(2). When a statute or regulation "deems" something to have been done, the event is considered to have occurred whether or not it actually did. <span class="Italic">See Lima v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 5 (2006). Thus, we deem the appellant to have received the initial decision on January 12, 2009, and his petition was, therefore, filed 5 days untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record here confirms that a copy of every order, including the initial decision, was sent electronically to the e-mail address that Ms. Pensanti provided in the initial appeal paperwork. Although the appellant was not an e-filer, the record also reflects that he received a copy of every order via regular mail. Consistent with this precedent, we deem Ms. Pensanti (and thus, the appellant) to have received the initial decision on August 31, 2009, and we conclude that the PFR was filed 14 days late. <span class="Italic">See Lima,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 5 ("Thus, as a matter of law, the appellant's representative was served with the initial decision on August 31, 2005.

<p class="Body-Text">The responsibility of the appellant to monitor the e-filing repository, not just to rely on receipt of an e-filed document, was stressed in <span class="Italic">Rocha v. MSPB</span>, 688 F.3d 1307, 1310-11 (Fed. Cir. 2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board will waive the time limit for filing a petition for review if a petitioner establishes "good cause" for his delay in filing. <span class="Italic">Zamot</span>, 332 F.3d at 1377. Relevant factors in determining whether a petitioner has demonstrated good cause for a late filing include the length of the delay, whether circumstances beyond a petitioner's control affected his ability to comply with the filing deadline, whether he was notified of the time limit for filing a petition for review, and whether he exercised due diligence in attempting to meet the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Walls v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the board did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow Rocha to file his petition for review more than five months after the filing deadline. Although Rocha claims that he did not receive the administrative judge's initial decision, the record shows that the decision was sent to the email address he provided to the board when he filed his appeal. As a registered e-filer, Rocha consented to accept all documents issued by the board in electronic form. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(e)(1) ("Registration as an e-filer constitutes consent to accept electronic service of pleadings filed by other registered e-filers and documents issued by the [board]."). Indeed, Rocha was required by regulation to monitor his case online in order to insure that he received all case-related documents. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 1201.14(j)(3) ("E-filers are responsible for monitoring case activity at the Repository at e-Appeal Online to ensure that they have received all case-related documents.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that Rocha did not in fact review the email copy of the initial decision on the date that it was issued, he has not submitted any evidence to show how he received that decision or how circumstances beyond his control prevented him from filing his petition for review in a timely manner. "Delay is excusable where, under the circumstances, a petitioner exercises diligence or ordinary prudence." <span class="Italic">Mendoza</span>, 966 F.2d at 653. Because Rocha failed to carry his burden to establish that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence in monitoring his case, the board acted well within its discretion in refusing to waive the time limit for filing his petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. U.S. States Postal Serv.</span>, 695 F.2d 1389, 1391 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board again concluded that a PFR late despite the appellant's protestations that he did not receive the electronic edition of the initial decision, <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Broadcasting Board of Governors</span>, 115 MSPR 46, 48-49 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10, 2010 MSPB 186 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject the appellant's suggestion on review that he did not receive the initial decision. The appellant registered as an e-filer, and thereby consented to accept all pleadings filed by other registered e-filers, and all documents issued by the Board, in electronic form. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(e) and (j)(1). The Board's e-Appeal Online Document Distribution Log indicates that on February 9, 2010, notice of the initial decision was sent to the appellant's e-mail address of record. Moreover, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(m)(2), "MSPB documents served electronically on registered e-filers are deemed received on the date of electronic submission." When a law or regulation "deems" something to have been done, the event is considered to have occurred whether or not it actually did. <span class="Italic">Terrell v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 38, &#x00B6; 8 (2010). We therefore deem the appellant to have electronically received the initial decision on February 9, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision clearly apprised the appellant of the March 16, 2010 deadline to file a petition for review. However, the appellant did not file a petition for review until May 10, 2010, 55 days after the deadline date. Thus, we find that the appellant filed his petition for review 55 days late.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may grant or deny the waiver of a time limit for filing a petition for review, in the interest of justice, after considering all the facts and circumstances of a particular case. <span class="Italic">Smith,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 433, &#x00B6; 5.

Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his petition. <span class="Italic">Smith,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 433, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Moorman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant states on review that he was unaware that he could monitor the status of his appeal through the Board's public website, and because he received a copy of an agency submission through the U.S. mail, he expected the Board to send a copy of the initial decision to him by U.S. mail. Such an expectation was not reasonable. The Board's e-filing regulation provides that paper copies of MSPB documents issued to the parties "will not ordinarily be served on e-filers." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(j)(1); <span class="Italic">see Terrell,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 38, &#x00B6; 7 n.2. In this regard, we note that the administrative judge's January 21, 2010 acknowledgment order was also served by sending it to the appellant's e-mail address of record. Consequently, we find that the appellant should reasonably have expected the initial decision to be served on him electronically and that he did not fulfill his obligation under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(j)(3) to monitor the case activity at the e-Appeal Online Repository.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant presents no further explanation for the filing delay, and no evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits. A 55-day delay is significant. <span class="Italic">See Terrell,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 38, &#x00B6; 9 (finding that a 42-day delay is significant). Despite the fact that the appellant is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, we find that he failed to show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence in this case that would justify waiving the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Smith,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 433, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Alonzo,</span> 4 M.S.P.R. at 184.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's attorney contends that the filing delay is due to a mistake made by a temporary paralegal who placed the Clerk of the Board's e-mail in a spam folder, his sole reliance on the paralegal does not demonstrate that he acted with due diligence or ordinary prudence under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Henderson v.

The motion must be accompanied by an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1746, which includes the reasons for failing to request an extension before the deadline for the submission; and a specific and detailed description of the circumstances causing the late filing, accompanied by supporting documentation or other evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Because Haynes submitted the petition for review after the finality date, the e-Appeal system guided him through an online interview, which provided notice of Board law on untimely filings and gave him the opportunity to describe, under penalty of perjury, the facts and circumstances related to the untimely filing. Haynes stated that the appellant had received a copy of the initial decision, but that he had not received one, either by mail or by e-mail. Haynes did not specify the date that the appellant received the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Haynes is a registered e-filer, and the Board's e-filing regulation provides that such registration constitutes consent to accept electronic service of pleadings filed by other registered e-filers and documents issued by the Board, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(e)(1). Such would have been the case even though the appellant, who was not an e-filer, continued to receive pleadings and Board documents by non-electronic means. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(e)(3). Under the Board's e-filing procedures, he should have reasonably expected to receive the initial decision in this way. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Broadcasting Board of Governors</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 46, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). He has not asserted that he failed to receive other documents from the Board via e-mail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The certificate of service shows that Haynes was served electronically on October 22, 2010. The Board's regulations deem documents served electronically to have been received on the day of electronic submission. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(m)(2). Haynes is thus deemed to have received the initial decision on October 22, 2010. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Morton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2010); <span class="Italic">Lima v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 5 (2006). Likewise, the appellant would be deemed to have received the initial decision the same day, as service on a party's designated representative is imputed to the party. <span class="Italic">Lima</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if Haynes had not been served electronically, however, the 30-day time period for submission of the petition for review would have commenced when the appellant received the initial decision, and Haynes acknowledged that he did. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(d). The certificate of service shows that the appellant's copy of the initial decision was mailed on October 22, 2010. Haynes did not allege that the appellant received the initial decision after October 27, 2010, which is the last day of the five-day window for receipt by mail. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Haynes thus did not provide a reasonable excuse for the late filing, nor did he demonstrate due diligence or the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file. A five-day delay is relatively brief, though in the absence of an excuse or showing of due diligence, it does not support a showing of good cause. <span class="Italic">See Grant v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 426, &#x00B6; 6 (2001). Thus based on the foregoing, the appellant has not shown good cause for the delay in filing his petition for review.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Addressing the nonreceipt of an enforcement submission, <span class="Italic">Santos v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 573, 577-79 (1998), provided close analysis of the presumption that follows from a certificate of service and the evidence necessary to rebut that presumption:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a certificate of service indicates that a copy of a document was mailed to the appellant's address of record, a presumption is raised that it was duly delivered to, and received by, the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Blue v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 MSPR 370, 374 (1994) (Chairman Erdreich, dissenting on other grounds), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 65 F.3d 188 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); <span class="Italic">Pfaff v. Defense Investigative Service,</span> 25 MSPR 633, 636 (1985). Here, the agency attached a certificate of service to its response indicating that Richard C. Overton, the agency's representative at that time, mailed a copy of the response to the appellant's address of record on June 21, 1996. Thus, we find that a presumption is raised that the response was duly delivered to, and received by, the appellant. <span class="Italic">Blue</span>, 65 MSPR at 374.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statements of the appellant's representative in the petition for review do not constitute evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Levine v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 MSPR 549, 552 (1996) (the statements of a party's representative in a pleading do not constitute evidence). Moreover, because these statements are not sworn or in affidavit form, they are not evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Blue,</span> 65 MSPR at 375; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Averella v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 59 MSPR 181, 184 n.3 (1993) (accepting as true the appellant's sworn statement on review that he did not receive a designation of representative form with an acknowledgment order); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Navy,</span> 52 MSPR 450, 452 (1992) (where the appellant asserted in a sworn statement on review that he did not receive a show-cause order, and the statement was unrebutted, the Board accepted it as true). The appellant has not provided any other evidence to support his alleged nonreceipt of the agency's response. We therefore find that the appellant has not rebutted the presumption of due delivery and receipt. <span class="Italic">Blue</span>, 65 MSPR at 375.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the agency's certificate of service did not include the correct address for the appellant's representative. This mistake indicates that the agency's response may not have been duly delivered to the appellant's representative. <span class="Italic">See Blue,</span> 65 MSPR at 374 (when a certificate of service attached to an agency motion to dismiss indicated that the motion was misaddressed to the appellant, it may not have been duly delivered to the appellant). Nevertheless, even assuming that the response was not received by the appellant's representative, the appellant was still responsible for the prosecution of his petition for enforcement, which included filing a reply to the agency's response. <span class="Italic">See Hudgies v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 55 MSPR 311, 315 (1992) (the right to appeal is personal to the appellant, who remains personally responsible for the prosecution of his own case even if he is represented); <span class="Italic">Depierro v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 54 <span id="Page_1774"></span>MSPR 251, 254 (1992) (regardless of whether the appellant believed that an attorney would file a petition for appeal on his behalf, the appellant remained personally responsible for the prosecution of his appeal); <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Department of Transportation,</span> 35 MSPR 674, 677 (1987) (an appellant is responsible for responding to a show-cause order, even when a copy of the order may not have been sent to his attorney).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the AJ informed the appellant and his representative that the agency had fifteen days to file a response, and that the appellant had ten days after the date of service of the response to file a reply. The appellant's representative does not claim that he and the appellant did not receive the AJ's order. A reasonably prudent appellant and representative would have checked with the AJ before their filing deadline to ascertain whether an agency response had been filed if they had not received one. The appellant's representative, however, does not claim that he or the appellant did this. The appellant's reply was due at the beginning of July 1996. The AJ waited three months, until October 2, 1996, to issue his initial decision. The appellant's representative does not claim that he or the appellant checked with the AJ during these three months to determine whether the agency had filed a response. Thus, the appellant was not diligent in processing his petition for enforcement, and he is responsible for any negligence on the part of his representative in not ascertaining whether an agency response had been filed, and in not filing a timely reply on the appellant's behalf. <span class="Italic">Cf. Leone v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 MSPR 398, 400 n.2 (1983) (an attorney's negligence is not good cause for excusing an appellant's failure to appear at a hearing and prosecute his appeal, inasmuch as the appellant is responsible for the errors of his representative).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the initial decision alerted the appellant to the fact that a response by the agency had been filed, and set forth the essence of the agency's response. The appellant and his representative could have asked the AJ for a copy of the response after they received the initial decision and before they filed a petition for review, but they do not indicate whether they did so. Thus, any nonreceipt of the agency's response below could have been remedied by the appellant and addressed in his petition for review. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 18 MSPR 670, 672 (1984) (when the agency was aware, in preparing its petition for review, of a statement by the appellant that it allegedly did not receive below, it had an opportunity to respond to it, and any error in failing to serve the statement below was harmless). The appellant does not allege that the initial decision is otherwise incorrect, nor does he now respond to the agency's evidence of compliance or specify how he believes the agency breached the agreement. Thus, he has not shown that he was harmed by any alleged failure to receive the agency's response to his petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See Crespo v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 53 MSPR 125, 128-29 (1992).</p>

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 573, 577 (1998). Here, the status conference order was mailed to the address the appellant provided.

<p class="Body-Text">A general allegation that an appellant's mail was not delivered in a timely fashion, without more, does not constitute good cause for an untimely filing. <span class="Italic">Powers v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 52 MSPR 83, 85-86 (1991) (appellant who belatedly received an initial decision did not explain why she did not immediately request an extension of time to prepare her PFR instead of waiting a month past the deadline to the make request); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lawson v. DHS</span>, 102 MSPR 185, 187 &#x00B6; 6, 2006 MSPB 154 (2006) ("The record does not reflect when the appellant received the ID, but the appellant has not alleged that he received the ID more than 5 days after it was issued."); <span class="Italic">Grant v. OPM</span>, 89 MSPR 426, 429 &#x00B6; 6 (2001) (attorney's unsworn, "vague, bare allegation" of the late receipt of the initial decision was insufficient to extend the period for a PFR).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming adequately detailed explanation, the Board will rely on an agency's unrebutted and sworn statement explaining that the late filing of a PFR occurred because the agency did not receive an initial decision from the regional office. <span class="Italic">Bono v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 140, 142 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Gonczi v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 529, 530-31 (1985) (suggesting, however, that agency should make some effort to ensure that the AJ has the agency representative's proper address). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Hutchinson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 91 MSPR 31, 34 &#x00B6; 5 (2001) (statement of party's representative in a pleading was not given evidentiary weight concerning the date an arbitration award was received for purposes of Board review of the award). <span class="Italic">Troncoso v. OPM</span>, 84 MSPR 663, 665 &#x00B6; 5 (2000), admonished that a claim of nonreceipt of an initial decision must be supported by more than the appellant's unelaborated sworn declaration attesting to delay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon our review of the record in this appeal, we find that the appellant has not shown good cause for the untimeliness of his petition for review. The certificate of service attached to the initial decision indicates that the appellant was served with a copy of the initial decision on April 28, 1999, by regular mail sent to the same address as noted in his petition for review. A letter properly addressed, stamped, and mailed is presumed to have been duly delivered to the addressee. <span class="Italic">Pfaff v. Defense Investigative Service</span>, 25 MSPR 633, 636 (1985). The appellant's bare allegation that he did not receive the initial decision, although under penalty of perjury, is insufficient to overcome the presumption of timely receipt of the mail. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Campa v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 65 MSPR 321, 323 (1994); <span class="Italic">Mickens v. Department of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 251 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also Powers v. Department of the Navy,</span> 52 MSPR 83, 86 (1991) (general allegation that mail was not delivered in timely fashion without more, does not constitute good cause for untimely filing). In this regard, we note that the petition for review does not give any indication that the appellant's receipt of the initial decision was delayed. Nor does his statement in response to the Clerk's order indicate when he received it or how he became aware of it, despite the motion's direction that "a specific and detailed description of the circumstances causing the late filing" be included. We thus reject the appellant's contention that there is good cause for the delayed filing of his petition for review, and we DISMISS the petition as untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming that the appellant did not receive an initial decision, he must exercise diligence in monitoring an appeal and may not allow years to lapse before filing a PFR, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Dept. of Army,</span> DC-315H-03-0217-I-1 (NP 12/16/2011) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. MSPB</span>, 495 Fed. Appx. 79 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the appellant's assertion that he never received the initial decision, the record reflects that the initial decision was sent by regular mail on March 27, 2003, to the appellant's address as it was printed, presumably by the appellant, on the return address section of the envelope in which the appellant sent his initial submission to the Board. A letter properly addressed, stamped, and mailed is presumed to have been duly delivered to the addressee. <span class="Italic">Gross v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 334, &#x00B6; 7 (2006); <span class="Italic">Hall v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 17, 20 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 106 F.3d 426 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table). However, to the extent that the appellant rebutted this presumption by way of his sworn statement that he did not receive the initial decision, he still must establish that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184. The appellant has not met this burden because he has provided no explanation for his failure for more than 8 years to contact the administrative judge, the regional office, or the Board to check the status of the appeal he filed in 2003. Accordingly, the appellant's delay in filing his petition for review is extraordinarily lengthy, and his conclusory statement that he did not receive the initial decision, even though it was mailed to the same address at which the appellant resides today, indicates that he did not exercise due diligence or ordinary prudence under the circumstances of this case. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's reviewing court sustained the Board in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>. Assuming that appellant did not receive the initial decision, he had a duty to exercise reasonable diligence to determine the status of the appeal, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. MSPB</span>, 495 Fed. Appx. 79, 82 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that the Board did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Jackson's petition. First, the signed certificate of service on the Initial Decision states that the decision was sent by regular mail to Jackson at the address he provided the Board. That address is the same address that Jackson, in this appeal, provided both the Board and this court. Moreover, it was within the Board's discretion to find that even if Jackson did not receive the Initial Decision, he still failed to exercise ordinary prudence during the eight-year span between when the Initial Decision was mailed and when Jackson filed his petition for full Board review. There is no evidence that Jackson inquired about the status of his appeal prior to 2011, even under Jackson's recollection of events.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The need for reasonable diligence in determining what has occurred in an appeal when no initial decision is received was reiterated, <span class="Italic">Chowdhary v. USDA</span>, CH-0752-09-0364-I-1 (NP 6/16/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant rebutted this presumption by way of his attorney's sworn statement that he did not receive the initial decision, the appellant still must establish that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184. The appellant has not met this burden because he has provided no explanation for his failure for more than 4 years to contact the administrative judge, the regional office, or the Board to check the status of the appeal he filed in 2009. In sum, the appellant's delay in filing his petition for review is very lengthy, and his conclusory statement that he did not receive the initial decision, even though it was mailed to the same address at which the appellant resides today, indicates that he did not exercise due diligence or ordinary prudence under the circumstances of this case. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184.</p>
