<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-7"><span class="space">3.</span> Furlough</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">One species of personnel action may be treated as an adverse action or a RIF, depending upon its duration. This is the furlough--most commonly characterized as a nonduty, nonpay status of a temporary and nondisciplinary nature arising from lack of work or lack of agency funds. Many of the cases that follow resulted when a March 1, 2013, Sequestration Order issued by the President required across-the-board reductions in federal spending pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, as amended. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2 USC 901a. The Board's appellate jurisdiction over furloughs is statutory, since 5 USC 7512 defines as an appealable adverse action a furlough of 30 days or less. 5 USC 7511(a)(5) defines the furlough: "the placing of an employee in a temporary status without duties and pay because of lack of work or funds or other nondisciplinary reasons."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To appeal, the furloughed employee must meet the statutory definition of an "employee" under by 5 USC 7511. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Voss v. DOD,</span> CH-0752-13-2793-I-1 (NP 3/16/2016) ("As the administrative judge carefully explained, the regulations cited by the appellant outline the statutory rights of tenured employees in the competitive and excepted service under chapter 75 of title 5, and these rights do not apply to, among others, probationary employees, employees appointed 'by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,' and Presidential appointees. These employees' exclusion from coverage under chapter 75 does not imply that an agency may not furlough such employees; rather, their exclusion only means that they do not have adverse action appeal rights to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b); <span class="Italic">Hamlett v. Department of Justice</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6; 8 (2002).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Harris v. USPS</span>, 119 MSPR 583, 587 &#x00B6; 8, 2013 MSPB 47 (2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A furlough of 30 days or less is an action that is appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(5), 7513(d), and 7701. A furlough is the temporary placement of an employee in a nonduty, nonpay status because of lack of work or funds or for other nondisciplinary reasons. <span class="Italic">Marks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 451, 454 (1998). An employee's tour of duty and the legal consequences flowing therefrom, such as regular periods of inactivity, are conditions of employment and determine whether the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal. <span class="Italic">Prior v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 561, 567 (1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Strickland v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 748 F.2d 681, 684 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). If, therefore, the placement of the employee in a nonduty, nonpay status was in accordance with the terms of his appointment, he has not been subjected to a furlough under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 and does not have the right to appeal his placement to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Marks</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 454; <span class="Italic">Prior</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. at 567.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Note the distinction between a furlough of less than 30 days, processed and appealed as an adverse action, and a furlough of more than 30 days, treated as a RIF under 5 CFR 351.201(a) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2996"></span>(2)&#x2003;Each agency shall follow this part when it releases a competing employee from his or her competitive level by furlough for more than 30 days, separation, demotion, or reassignment requiring displacement, when the release is required because of lack of work; shortage of funds; insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization; the exercise of reemployment rights or restoration rights; or reclassification of an employee's position die to erosion of duties when such action will take effect after an agency has formally announced a reduction in force in the employee's competitive area and when the reduction in force will take effect within 180 days.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">"Furlough" means the placing of an employee in a temporary status without duties and pay because of a lack of work or funds or other nondisciplinary reasons. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(5); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402. A furlough of 30 days or less is appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(5); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(a)(5).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chandler</span> explained the evolution of law concerning furloughs and compared the analysis of furlough and RIF appeals, 120 MSPR 163, 170-72, 177 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9, 28:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the law now distinguishes between adverse action furloughs and RIF furloughs based on their length, that was not always the case. Section 14 of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, Pub. L. No. 78-359, 58 Stat. 387, provided that, with respect to preference eligibles, furloughs of whatever length constituted adverse actions that must meet the efficiency of the service standard and were appealable to the Civil Service Commission, the Board's predecessor agency. It was only later that the Civil Service Commission issued regulations distinguishing between furloughs based on their length, with furloughs of 30 days or less being covered by adverse action procedures and amenable to the general efficiency of the service standard, and furloughs of more than 30 days requiring specific RIF procedures and being appealable for review of adherence to those procedures. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.201(a), .901(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 752.101, .103(b)(3), .201(b)(3), .203 (1977). Thus, the Civil Service Commission maintained the appeal rights for all furloughed employees while prescribing additional procedural protections for employees subjected to more lengthy furloughs. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, &#x00A7; 204(a), preserved the Civil Service Commission's distinction between furloughs of varying duration with regard to procedural protections and appeal rights but, consistent with the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, continued to recognize that any placement of an employee in a temporary nonwork, nonpay status is a furlough regardless of its length. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(5), 7512(a)(5). In other words, all furloughs are fundamentally the same type of action brought for the same types of reasons even though the procedures for conducting a furlough and the attendant appeal rights may vary depending on its duration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We observe that chapter 75 furloughs are short term solutions to transitory problems, such as budgetary shortfalls, and that they have only a temporary effect on an individual's employment status. RIF actions, on the other hand, including lengthy furloughs, are more suited to long-term changes in an agency's function or workload, and they have the potential for more lasting or even permanent effects on an individual's career. We see no indication that Congress intended lesser protections for employees affected by more severe personnel actions or that it intended greater scrutiny of temporary measures that agencies take in response to acute situations such as the government-wide furloughs in response to the 2013 sequestration. Rather, it appears from the legislative history described above that the opposite is true. Nevertheless, in light of the basic similarities between RIF and adverse action furloughs, we find that RIF principles are instructive in determining the scope of the Board's review of adverse action furloughs and what it means for a furlough of 30 days or less to be taken for the "efficiency of the service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency is always responsible for proving that an adverse action promotes the efficiency of the service, we find that the analysis of this issue must depend on the problem that the adverse action was meant to address. Furloughs are unique among adverse actions because by definition they are taken for nondisciplinary reasons and are generally used to address work or funding shortages or other matters that are not personal to the affected employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(5); <span class="Italic">cf. Butler v. Department of the Interior</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 25, 27 (1982) (a RIF action may be invalid if motivated by reasons personal to the employee). The Board has found that an agency satisfies this standard in a furlough appeal by showing, in general, that the furlough was a reasonable management solution to the financial restrictions placed on it and that the agency applied its determination as to which employees to furlough in a "fair and even manner." <span class="Italic">Clark v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 224, 225 (1984). By "fair and even manner," we take the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Clark</span> to mean that the agency applied the adverse action furlough "uniformly and consistently" just as it is required to apply a RIF. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.201(b). This does not mean that the agency is required to apply the furlough in such a way as to satisfy the Board's sense of equity. Rather, it means that the agency is required to treat similar employees similarly and to justify any deviations with legitimate management reasons. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b)(2) ("When some but not all employees in a given competitive level are being furloughed, the notice of proposed action must state the basis for selecting a particular employee for furlough, as well as the reasons for the furlough."). Which employees are similarly situated for purposes of an adverse action furlough will be decided on a case-by-case basis, but the Board will be guided by RIF principles in making that determination. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (applying RIF competitive level principles to adverse action furloughs).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we find that the Board's efficiency of the service determination does not encompass agency spending decisions<span class="Italic"> per se</span>, including spending on personnel matters. <span class="Italic">See Schroeder v. Department of Transportation</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 566, 570 (1994) (even if the agency might have avoided a RIF had it manipulated its budget in a different manner, it is within the agency's broad management discretion to take action to avoid a budget deficit, and the Board lacks the authority to look behind the agency's decision to remedy that deficit); <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 168, 171 (1980) (the agency's decision to replace certain employees with private contractors was a matter committed by law to agency discretion and was unreviewable by the Board in the context of a RIF proceeding); <span class="Italic">see generally</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 301, 302, 305. Nor does it encompass an agency's decision to allocate furlough days in a certain manner among employees who are not similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See Waksman v. Department of Commerce</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 640, 645-56 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Harris v. Department of Commerce</span>, 878 F.2d 1447 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table) (an agency has broad discretion to avoid a deficit by conducting a RIF, and the Board will not second guess an agency's decision to reorganize its work force as it lacks authority to review the management considerations underlying that exercise of discretion). Such matters belong to the judgment of agency managers, who are in the best position to decide what allocation of funding will best allow the agency to accomplish its mission. <span class="Italic">Cf. Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 302 (1981) (agencies have primary discretion in managing their own workforces). What the efficiency of the service determination does encompass are issues relating to the uniform and consistent application of the furlough, including whether the agency used a furlough to target employees for personal reasons, <span class="Italic">see Losure v. Interstate Commerce Commission</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 195, 200-01 (1980), or attempted to exempt certain employees from the furlough without legitimate management reasons, <span class="Italic">see Phelps v. Department of Labor</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 30, 31-32 (1984).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A furlough is not a separation by RIF.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has statutory and regulatory authority to adjudicate employee appeals of furlough actions. 5 USC 7511(a)(5) defines a furlough as the placing of an employee in a temporary status without duties and pay because of lack of work or funds, or other non-disciplinary reasons. Under 5 USC 7512(5) and 5 CFR 1201.3(a)(2), an employee may appeal a furlough of thirty days or less to the Board. Further, under 5 CFR 351.201(a)(2) and 351.901, employees may also appeal furloughs of more than thirty days of the Board.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Clerman v. ICC</span>, 35 MSPR 190, 192-93 (1987), considered the 30-day reckoning period for furloughs and the appropriate procedures for challenging them:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 351.201(a)(2) provides that an agency should follow reduction-in-force procedure whenever it "releases a competing employee from his or her competitive level by furlough for more than 30 days...." The reduction-in-force regulations define "days" as calendar days. 5 CFR 351.203. OPM has further interpreted 30 calendar days to mean 22 work days whenever the furlough was not to be served on consecutive days. FPM Bulletin 351-32, Para. 6(a)(1) p.2, issued 12-4-81; expired 1-20-83; and OPM bulletin FED-FACTS 24. Since a 30 calendar day period generally contains 22 work days, the obvious intent of these OPM interpretations was to extend the protections of Part 351 to any furlough served on intermittent days which was the functional equivalent of a covered furlough served on consecutive days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Part 351 generally provides veterans, employees who have seniority, and employees who have good performance ratings with rights in the event of a reduction-in-force which they would not have if they were subjected to an adverse action. Therefore, while an employee can be subjected to a sustainable short-term furlough, as an adverse action under 5 USC 7512, if the agency establishes that the furlough was in the interests of the efficiency of the service, the same employee cannot be subjected to a sustainable long-term furlough, under Part 351's reduction-in-force procedures, unless the agency establishes that it is also releasing all competing employees who are in a lower tenure group or who have a later service computation date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he actions should have been sustained. The agency established that the reduction-in-force regulations were invoked in order to cope with a budgetary crisis and that Part 351 procedures were properly applied in an across-the-board fashion to all of its employees. The appellants presented no evidence to challenge the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>s of the agency's reason for taking the challenged actions nor did they raise any non-jurisdictional argument that the applicable regulations had been misapplied....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Clerman</span>, an agency may plan a long-term furlough and use RIF procedures; its budget crisis may be resolved; the furlough may turn out to be short-term; and the agency will not be faulted for not using adverse action procedures. <span class="Italic">Clerman</span> determined that, without a showing of bad faith, MSPB will not overturn an agency action because it incorrectly estimated the necessary length of the furlough.

Agencies may conduct furloughs of 30 days or less without following RIF procedures. <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 5. Such actions are reviewable by the Board under the "efficiency of the service" standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Clerman v.

Both RIFs and adverse action furloughs, however, are taken for the same types of nondisciplinary reasons. <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">see Hastie v.

In light of the basic similarities between RIF and adverse action furloughs, RIF principles are instructive in determining the scope of the Board's review of adverse action furloughs and what it means for a furlough of 30 days or less to be taken for the "efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furloughs are unique among adverse actions because by definition they are taken for nondisciplinary reasons and are generally used to address work or funding shortages or other matters that are not personal to the affected employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(5); <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8. An agency satisfies the "efficiency of the service" standard in a furlough appeal by showing, in general, that the furlough was a reasonable management solution to the financial restrictions placed on it and that the agency applied its determination as to which employees to furlough in a "fair and even manner," <span class="Italic">Clark v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 224, 225 (1984), i.e., that the agency applied the adverse action furlough uniformly and consistently, just as it is required to apply a RIF, <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.201(c). The agency is not required to apply the furlough in such a way as to satisfy the Board's sense of equity. <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8. Rather, the agency must treat similar employees similarly and justify any deviations with legitimate management reasons. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b)(2) ("When some but not all employees in a given competitive level are being furloughed, the notice of proposed action must state the basis for selecting a particular employee for furlough, as well as the reasons for the furlough."). Which employees are similarly situated for purposes of an adverse action furlough will be decided on a case-by-case basis, but the Board is guided by RIF principles in making that determination. <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b)(2) (applying RIF competitive level principles to adverse action furloughs).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also held that its efficiency of the service determination does not encompass agency spending decisions <span class="Italic">per se</span>, including spending on personnel matters. <span class="Italic">See Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 9. Such matters belong to the judgment of agency managers, who are in the best position to decide what allocation of funding will best allow the agency to accomplish its mission. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The efficiency of the service determination does encompass issues relating to the uniform and consistent application of the furlough, including whether the agency used a furlough to target employees for personal reasons, or attempted to exempt certain employees from the furlough without legitimate management reasons.[3] <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The dissent asserts in &#x00B6; 4 that the Board applies "a diminished due process analysis" when reviewing RIF and furlough adverse actions. We disagree. We do agree with the dissent, though, that RIF and furlough adverse actions and inability to perform cases are similar in that they all are not disciplinary in nature. We note, however, that an agency takes a physical inability to perform action based on a finding that the particular individual cannot do his or her job for medical reasons personal to the employee. In contrast, furlough or RIF adverse actions target entire groups of employees or, indeed at times, entire agencies for reasons not personal to any employee. Yet, agencies always must satisfy the efficiency of the service standard in all these cases for the Board to sustain the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant asserts that the agency's action did not promote the efficiency of the service because the agency admitted that the furlough created delays, mission failures, and cancellations relating to administrative or day-to-day operations, these types of disruptions are the likely result of any furlough and do not demonstrate a failure to meet the efficiency of the service standard. We agree with the administrative judge's determination that the agency proved that the furlough promoted the efficiency of the service because the agency showed that the furlough was a reasonable management solution to the financial restrictions placed on it and applied its determination as to which employees to furlough in a fair and even manner. <span class="Italic">See Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8. We also agree with the administrative judge that the agency established a legitimate management reason for exempting H-1B visa holders from the furlough and that the appellant did not prove national origin discrimination. To the extent that the appellant has alleged that the agency committed harmful error because the deciding official did not have "full authority" to make a decision regarding the furlough, the appellant has not shown that any error in that regard likely caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's due process contention, procedural due process rights derive from a property interest in which the individual has a legitimate claim of entitlement. <span class="Italic">Board of Regents v. Roth</span>, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). Once acquired, a property interest falls within the protections of procedural due process. A property interest is not created by the U.S. Constitution; rather, it is created and its dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source, such as a statute. <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(5) and 7513(a) provide that an agency may furlough an employee for 30 days or less "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." This language creates a legitimate claim of entitlement to retention in a pay status, and thus a property interest, that conditions the placement of an employee in a temporary status without duties and pay on such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1374 ("If the government gives a public employee assurances of continued employment or conditions dismissal only for specific reasons, the public employee has a property interest in continued employment."); <span class="Italic">McGriff v.

Department of the Navy</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 526, 532 (1994) (the agency's deprivation of the appellant's property interest in his employment--his suspension from his job--triggered the application of due process); <span class="Italic">see also Krause v. Small Business Administration</span>, 502 F. Supp. 1332, 1338-39 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (finding a protected property interest in a federal employee's expectation of continued and uninterrupted public employment because the agency could suspend him for 7 days only "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service"). In fact, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 31, that information regarding the specific process applied by the agency in conducting a furlough would be relevant to the issue of due process, thus implicitly finding a protected property interest at stake. Having found that the appellant has a property interest at stake in this case, the question remains as to what process is due, and whether the procedure that the agency applied sufficiently satisfied the mandates of due process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gajdos</span> described the steps taken within the chain of command to determine to furlough employees and explained the due process considerations, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-25:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The May 14, 2013 memorandum [from DOD] also identified who could be a deciding official, indicated that deciding officials were "charged with, and [were] accountable for, making final decisions on furloughs for individual employees after carefully considering the employee's reply, if any, and the needs of the Department," and stated that deciding officials "[would] have the authority to execute the full range of options with respect to providing relief in individual employee cases," including reducing the number of days or hours an individual was to be furloughed or granting the employee an exception from the furlough.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the agency issued its notice proposing his furlough, the appellant submitted his written response to the notice to a "Reply Official," i.e., the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel and Logistics. In his June 14, 2013 decision letter, the Commandant of the DLIFLC indicated that the appellant's response was "reviewed and carefully considered," but that the reasons for the proposed furlough remained valid. In its response to one of the appellant's interrogatories in this case, the agency indicated that the following procedures were used after the appellant filed his response to the proposed furlough:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2999"></span>When the Agency received written replies to the Proposed Furloughs, the Reply Official drafted a summary of the employee's arguments, and sent the reply and summary to the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate (OSJA) for a legal review to determine whether the employee fell within one of the furlough exemptions. The OSJA conducted a review, after which, the package was sent to the Deciding Official for final review and signature. If the employee was not exempt from furlough, their [sic] response was given no further consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Appellant neither fell into one of the furlough exemptions, nor did he claim to be exempt in his response. As a result, his response was given no consideration beyond what is described above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also relies upon a March 1, 2013 memorandum from the Commandant to DLIFLC faculty and staff indicating that "the furlough will affect all DLIFLC Department of Army civilians; there will be very few exceptions for the Army and we do not expect any for DLIFLC," that "the furlough will be mandatory to meet required spending reductions," and that "[n]either the Union nor DLIFLC management will be able to stop the furlough." The appellant further contends that the Commandant stated during a February 27, 2013 "Fiscal Uncertainty" briefing that "we can meet our budget cuts without furlough, so we will furlough only if we are told we have to." <span class="Italic">See</span> CF, Tab 7 at 6 (the agency's response to the appeal indicating that the appellants do not fall into one of the categories of exempt civilians, and "[b]ecause the Appellants were not exempt from the furlough, and because the Agency was required...to furlough all non-exempt civilian employees, the Agency furloughed the Appellants."). The appellant asserts these documents indicate that the Commandant had only limited, if any, authority and was not the true decision maker because he did not have the authority to reverse the furlough. Thus, the appellant alleges that additional procedural protections were required in the form of an opportunity to submit a response to an official, such as the Secretary of Defense, with the authority to reverse the furlough.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Due process requires, at a minimum, that an employee being deprived of his property interest be given "the opportunity to be heard 'at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.'" <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Eldridge</span>, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976) (quoting <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Manzo</span>, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965)). Such opportunity "should be an initial check against mistaken decisions--essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action." <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 545-46 (1985). Nevertheless, "due process, unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place, and circumstances." <span class="Italic">Mathews</span>, 424 U.S. at 334. Rather, it is "flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, resolution of the issue of whether the administrative procedures provided here are constitutionally sufficient requires the Board to analyze the governmental and private interests that are affected. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. In particular, identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three factors: first, the private interest affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the private interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and third, the government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 335.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the first <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factor, i.e., the private interest affected by the action, although the Supreme Court has recognized the severity of depriving someone of the means of livelihood by terminating the individual, it has also emphasized that, in determining what process is due, one must take into account the length and finality of that deprivation. <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Homar</span>, 520 U.S. 924, 932 (1997); <span class="Italic">see Miranda v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co</span>., 710 F.2d 516, 524 (9th Cir. 1983) (Wallace, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("Although the requirements of procedural due process apply to the deprivation of even small amounts of property, the severity of the deprivation is a factor to be weighed in determining the appropriate form of the hearing."). Thus, as long as a furloughed or suspended employee receives a sufficiently prompt post-deprivation hearing, the lost income from such temporary actions is "relatively insubstantial (compared with termination), and fringe benefits such as health and life insurance are often not affected at all." <span class="Italic">See Homar</span>, 520 U.S. at 932. The 6-day furlough in this case is far less substantial than the termination at issue in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and the approximately 10-month suspension at issue in <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 29, which the Board described as a "significant" deprivation. We nevertheless recognize that, although a furlough is a temporary deprivation, like a suspension, it is nonetheless "likely to cut off subsistence income and to prevent one from obtaining other gainful employment," and it may have a "great practical impact" on the employee. <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Department of the Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we must consider the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards. <span class="Italic">Mathews</span>, 424 U.S. at 335. When the Court in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 535, 542-46, considered the second <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factor in the context of a public employee who had been discharged from employment based on his dishonesty in filling out an employment application, it explained that, for the purpose of reaching an accurate decision, the opportunity to respond to a proposed removal is important for two reasons. First, an adverse action will often involve factual disputes and consideration of an employee's response may clarify such disputes. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 543; <span class="Italic">see Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376. Second, "[e]ven where the facts are clear, the appropriateness or necessity of the [penalty] may not be," and in such cases the employee must receive a "meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the decisionmaker." <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 543. Thus, "the employee's response is essential not only to the issue of whether the allegations are true, but also with regard to whether the level of penalty to be imposed is appropriate." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find in this case that there was a low risk of an "erroneous" deprivation of a property interest through the procedures used by the DLIFLC. As set forth above, the procedures used by the agency were designed to limit the risk of an erroneous deprivation of a property interest by ensuring that the appellant did not fall within one of the furlough exemptions. The appellant does not suggest that any such error occurred, or was even likely to occur, concerning him. <span class="Italic">See Wash. Teachers' Union Local # 6 v. Bd. of Educ</span>., 109 F.3d 774, 780 (D.C. Cir. 1997) ("Although the Union suggests that factual errors, such as attributing disciplinary proceedings to the wrong teachers, could produce erroneous scores on ranking forms, the record contains no evidence that such errors have occurred, much less that the risk of such errors is significant.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in considering <span class="Italic">what</span> procedural protections are required in this <span class="Italic">situation</span>, there is a fundamental difference in the nature of the action at issue here as compared to the actions at issue in such cases as <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>. As set forth above, the action in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> was based on employee misconduct <span class="Italic">such that</span> the court found it necessary, in order to reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation, to permit the employee to invoke the discretion of the decision maker as to the appropriateness or necessity of the penalty. 470 U.S. at 545-46. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-6, 33, the Board held that a significant question existed as to "whether the appellant had a meaningful opportunity to respond to the proposed indefinite suspension such that the procedures that were used posed a risk of erroneous deprivation of the appellant's property interest." There, the agency had indefinitely suspended the appellant based on its suspension of his security clearance, which in turn was based on alleged conduct that involved questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Here, by contrast, DoD and the agency made certain policy and spending decisions and directed the furlough action at the appellant's position, not at any conduct, characteristic, qualification, or reputation of the appellant as an individual. <span class="Italic">See Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8 (furloughs are unique among adverse actions because by definition they are taken for nondisciplinary reasons and are generally used to address work or funding shortages or other matters that are not personal to the affected employee). Thus, the agency did not impose a "penalty" upon the appellant that was amenable to invoking the discretion of the deciding official in favor of the appellant as an individual. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 31 (the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06, which are relevant in agency penalty determinations in adverse action cases, do not apply to furloughs, which are nondisciplinary).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In making such policy decisions in conducting a furlough, agencies have broad management discretion. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 9 (matters such as spending decisions belong to the judgment of agency managers, who are in the best position to decide what allocation of funding will best allow the agency to accomplish its mission); <span class="Italic">Department of Labor v. Avery</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 150, &#x00B6; 10 (2013) (agencies retain the expertise to make spending choices to save funds necessary to avoid furloughs). Thus, there is little risk in the procedures used by the agency of an "error" as that term is generally understood. <span class="Italic">See UDC Chairs Chapter, Am. Ass'n of Univ. Professors v. Bd. of Trustees of the Univ. of the Dist. of Columbia</span>, 56 F.3d 1469, 1474 (D.C. Cir. 1995) ("Where, as here, the deprivation turns on a policy decision and not on an individual's characteristics, a predeprivation hearing would do little to reduce the risk of erroneous deprivation of the chairpersons' interests."); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Brienen</span>, 722 F.2d 360, 368 (7th Cir. 1983) (Flaum, J., concurring) (the "risk of government error and the value of a predeprivation hearing in reducing that risk" is "insubstantial" when the decision not to grant compensatory time off is based on staffing shortages and individualized determinations of fact or law are not necessary). We therefore find only minimal probable value in the substitute procedural safeguard suggested by the appellant, namely, an opportunity to submit his response to a different decision maker, such as the Secretary of Defense, who would presumably have had superior authority to that of the DLIFLC Commandant with respect to reversing the furlough.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3000"></span>Our analysis of the third <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factor, the government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail, turns largely on sheer numbers. <span class="Italic">See Wash. Teachers' Union Local # 6</span>, 109 F.3d at 781. Irrespective of the total number of DoD civilian employees affected by the furlough nationwide, the record reflects that the Department of the Army's furlough alone was expected to impact 251,000 civilians. Requiring the Secretary of Defense to have considered and answered all of the responses to the proposed furloughs affecting DoD civilian employees would have slowed the furlough process considerably and added a significant administrative burden. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wash. Teachers' Union Local # 6</span>, 109 F.3d at 781 (requiring principals to answer each of the 400 responses to the teachers' ranking forms would have slowed the RIF process considerably, both delaying and reducing the financial savings that were desperately needed). Under these circumstances, we find that the government's interest under the third <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factor weighs heavily. <span class="Italic">See Whalen v. Mass. Trial Court</span>, 397 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 2005) (because reorganizations often affect numerous employees, the governmental interest in efficient administration may weigh more heavily).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Balancing the <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factors and taking into account the availability of post-deprivation relief before the Board, <span class="Italic">see Clements v. Airport Auth. of Washoe Cnty</span>., 69 F.3d 321, 332 (9th Cir. 1995) (the nature of subsequent proceedings may lessen the amount of process that the state must provide pre-termination), we hold that the agency satisfied the requirements of due process in this case. The agency's need to cut expenditures quickly and efficiently in the face of an extensive number of civilian employees furloughed nationwide as a result of the sequester outweighed the appellant's interest given the length of the furlough and the minimal risk of error involved.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In concluding that the agency failed to provide the appellant with a meaningful opportunity to respond because the deciding official presumably did not give any consideration to the appellant's response to the furlough notice, the dissent relies on a statement the appellant made in his January 6, 2014 "Supplement to the Record." The appellant claimed therein that the agency, in response to one of his interrogatories, wrote that, "[i]f the employee was not exempt from [the] furlough, their [sic] response was given no <span class="Italic">further consideration</span>.... The appellant neither fell into one of the furlough exemptions, nor did he claim to be exempt in his response. As a result, his response was given no consideration beyond what was described above." We believe the dissent's reliance on the appellant's statement may be misplaced for three reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">First, the quoted language itself denotes, by inclusion of the words "further consideration," that the agency did consider the appellant's response. Second, the appellant omitted a crucial sentence at the end of the agency's response to this interrogatory. Importantly, in this missing sentence, the agency explained that: "[t]he appellant acknowledged receipt...of the letter the Agency presented him, <span class="Italic">which informed him that his response had been considered</span>, but that, nonetheless, the reasons for furloughing him remained valid and would go into effect as planned." This omitted language reflects once again that the agency gave consideration to the appellant's reply. Third, the agency's response to the interrogatory states that the agency provided the appellant with "no consideration beyond what is described above." The phrase, "what is described above" refers to the preceding paragraph of the agency's response to the interrogatory, in which the agency elaborates on the process it provided the appellant and other employees to ensure that they were given a meaningful opportunity to respond. In particular, as we stated above in &#x00B6; 17, the agency reported that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">When the Agency received written replies to the Proposed Furloughs, the Reply Official drafted a summary of the employee's arguments, and sent a reply and summary to [OSJA] for a legal review to determine whether the employee fell within one of the furlough exemptions. The OSJA conducted a review, after which, the package was sent to the Deciding Official for final review and signature. If the employee was not exempt from furlough, their [sic] response was given no further consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. As this language makes plain, the agency's review process was a far cry from "an empty formality," as the dissent characterizes it. In fact, the agency provided three steps during the review process: (a) the reply official's receiving, reviewing, and summarizing the appellant's reply; (b) the OSJA's receiving and legally reviewing both the appellant's reply and the reply official's summary of the appellant's arguments; and (c) the deciding official's review, prior to signing the final decision, of the "package," which included the appellant's response. In light of these factors, we believe that the agency ensured that the appellant was given a meaningful opportunity to respond to the furlough notice and that the agency, including the deciding official, duly considered the appellant's response to the furlough notice. <span class="Italic">See Lachance v. Erickson</span>, 522 U.S. 262, 266 (1998) ("The core of due process is the right to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Vice Chairman Wagner dissented in <span class="Italic">Gajdos</span>, arguing that due process considerations were equally applicable to furloughs and adverse actions, and that the limitations on the deciding official's discretion to implement the furlough robbed the reply process of due process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with the approach announced in <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, the majority here undertakes to reexamine the question of what process is constitutionally due furloughed employees. Maj. Op., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 22. I recognize that the Supreme Court, in <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Eldridge</span>, 424 U.S. 319, 334 (1976), said that "due process, unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place, and circumstances...[but, rather] is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, the Supreme Court has already distilled the Mathews factors to arrive at the fundamental contours of due process, i.e., notice and meaningful opportunity to respond, when a public employee is deprived of a property interest in employment. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532 (1985). For this reason, I believe that the majority's discussion (Maj. Op., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-25) of <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Eldridge</span>, and particularly its application of the <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factors to define what constitutional process is due under these circumstances, to be unnecessary.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor do I believe that we can construe 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 as creating a separate class of adverse actions, furloughs, warranting a diminished due process analysis. The majority explains that the need for this reexamination stems from the fact that, unlike the other adverse actions identified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, a furlough is taken for nondisciplinary reasons, i.e., to address work or funding shortages, rather than in response to individual misconduct. However, both the Board and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have long recognized that removals and suspensions taken for physical or medical reasons are not disciplinary in the narrow sense of the term, i.e., a sanction for improper conduct, but only in the broader sense of maintaining the orderly working of the government. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. General Services Administration</span>, 756 F.2d 86, 88-89 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (appeal of an indefinite suspension pending a psychiatric fitness for duty examination); <span class="Italic">Hunley v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 493, 495 (1988) (appeal of a period of enforced leave exceeding 14 days because of medical restrictions of no bending, lifting, climbing and walking); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 335, 336-37 (1981) (appeal of removal for failure to meet physical requirements, i.e., lifting, climbing stairs, walking, standing and bending, of the position), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 666 F.2d 258 (Fed. Cir. 1982). Yet, despite the fact that these actions are not taken in response to individual misconduct, the Board has not lowered the due process requirements afforded to employees subjected to them. Indeed, we have held that, when an employee has been placed on enforced leave for medical reasons without notice and an opportunity to respond, the action must be reversed because it cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. <span class="Italic">Vargo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 284, 287 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If furloughed employees are entitled to the same constitutional protection afforded individuals facing other statutorily appealable actions, the inescapable conclusion would be that the agency denied the appellant due process here because the deciding official did not give the appellant a meaningful opportunity to respond to the action. While due process does not require that a deciding official have the authority to ignore or overrule agency policies, the reply opportunity may not be an empty formality, and the deciding official should have authority to take or recommend agency action based on the reply. In this case, it appears that the Secretary of Defense delegated the "authority to execute the full range of options with respect to providing relief in individual cases" to deciding officials. Despite the broad delegation of authority to the deciding official here to review individual cases, the record shows that he limited his consideration of cases only to whether the employee had met one of several specific furlough exemptions. For example, the appellant argued in his written reply to the proposed furlough that the exemption of foreign national employees improperly created two classes of employees, which gave an improper preference to non-citizens in violation of merit systems principles. The deciding official apparently declined to give this argument any consideration. Accordingly, I would have reversed the furlough in this case because the record shows that the appellant's response to the proposed furlough was not given any further consideration by the deciding official after it was determined that the appellant did not fall into one of several specified furlough exemptions.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Implementation of the furlough is to be fair, but the process need not be uniform from agency to agency, and the Board will not overturn furloughs based on agency use of overtime for some employees under fairly-administered agency polices, <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/KELLY_EDWARD_ANTONIO_PH_0752_13_5622_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1062529.pdf">121 MSPR 408</a>, 414-16 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-14, 2014 MSPB 58 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's overtime allegations, guidance from the Office of the Secretary of Defense provides that under no circumstances may overtime be used to offset furloughs and that there can be no overtime on furlough days unless furlough relief has already been provided. During periods when furloughs are in effect, overtime should be strictly limited and should not appear to be an attempt to offset furloughs. Any command that approves overtime must have adequate funds to pay for the overtime, even after furlough savings are used for readiness activities within the command or withdrawn through reprogramming for use by other commands. Subject to these limits, limited overtime may be authorized to meet mission-critical needs, and the appropriate deciding official must personally review overtime requests to ensure that they are required to meet mission-critical needs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A March 20, 2013 memorandum issued by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Army provides that "[e]mployee overtime work...will be prohibited during [the] sequester through the end of this FY, except as necessary to protect the health, safety and security of personnel or property; to ensure the direct and timely provision of services and material to deployed units or to units that are preparing to deploy; or to perform similar mission critical functions." During the furlough, commanders may approve overtime that meets the above criteria, and any such approval must be documented in writing in advance of the time and date on which the work is to be performed, signed and dated by the approval authority, and set forth the purpose of the overtime work and the rationale for concluding that the work meets the criteria set forth above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's decision to award certain employees overtime pay may be relevant to whether the agency applied the furlough uniformly and consistently. <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 14. Thus, if the agency used overtime payments to relieve certain employees but not others of the financial consequences of the furlough, this may be sufficient to show that the furlough did not meet the efficiency of the service standard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The efficiency of the service standard ultimately encompasses issues relating to the uniform and consistent application of the furlough, including whether the agency used a furlough to target employees for personal reasons or attempted to exempt certain employees from the furlough without legitimate management reasons. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. The agency must treat similar employees similarly and must justify any deviations with legitimate management reasons. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged that "the Agency is continuing to pay overtime to make up for the lost productivity due to employees out on furlough thereby undermining the purpose of an administrative furlough, which is to reduce operating cost. This action is in direct violation of the administrative furlough policy and procedure mandating cancellation of all overtime, unnecessary travel and implementing other cost saving measures." To the extent that the appellant is alleging that the agency's policy mandated the cancellation of all overtime, the evidence set forth above demonstrates that this assertion is incorrect. Moreover, we find that the agency's decision to adopt a policy under which it permitted the use of overtime to meet mission-critical needs is a spending matter within the agency's sound discretion. <span class="Italic">See Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 14 (the agency's alleged decision to award certain employees overtime "may be characterized as a spending decision as well"). Although the manner in which the agency implemented that overtime policy may be relevant to whether the agency applied the furlough uniformly and consistently, <span class="Italic">see id</span>., the appellant has not alleged in this case that the agency applied its overtime policy during the furlough in a manner that was not uniform and consistent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's contention that the number of furlough days has been inconsistently reduced throughout the federal sector, thereby contradicting the original "across the board" furlough for all federal agencies, is unavailing.

Here, the furlough action was taken by the USACE.

The appellant's assertion that the Baltimore District Corps of Engineers has not shown what it has done to reduce costs in an effort to capture the 5 percent savings required for FY 2013 is essentially a challenge to the spending decisions of the agency, which are within the agency's sound discretion. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 9.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency satisfies the efficiency of the service standard in a furlough appeal by showing, in general, that the furlough was a reasonable management solution to the financial restrictions placed on it and that the agency applied its determination as to which employees to furlough in a "fair and even manner." <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8.

This does not mean that the agency is required to apply the furlough in such a way as to satisfy the Board's sense of equity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Rather, it means that the agency is required to treat similarly-situated employees similarly and to justify any deviations with legitimate management reasons. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's analysis of this issue, which relied upon general RIF principles. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8; <span class="Italic">see also Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 7 (RIF principles are instructive in determining the scope of the Board's review of adverse action furloughs and what it means for a furlough of 30 days or less to be taken for the efficiency of the service). As the Board held in <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8, the question is whether the agency applied the adverse action furlough uniformly and consistently. Moreover, in determining whether the agency structured a furlough in a fair and even manner, the Board will not scrutinize an agency's decision in such a way that second guesses the agency's assessment of its mission requirements and priorities. <span class="Italic">Department of Labor v. Avery</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 150, &#x00B6; 10 (2013). Here, the agency made a determination that it needed only two individuals per shift to protect property, health, and safety during the furlough, rather than the usual three. The appellant does not challenge this determination that only two individuals were needed, which was well within the agency's discretion. <span class="Italic">See Veneziano v. Department of Energy</span>, 189 F.3d 1363, 1365-66 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (affirming the appellant's separation by RIF where the agency decided to eliminate eight positions in the office where the appellant worked, three of which would be at her competitive level); <span class="Italic">see also Griffin v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 168, 171 (1980) (the decision whether a particular position is to be preserved or abolished is for the agency to make).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once the agency determined the number of USRO positions it needed to keep filled during the furlough, it used a uniform and consistent criteria, service computation date, in deciding which employees to furlough, just as it would have been required to do in a RIF. <span class="Italic">See Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 913 F.2d 976, 979-80 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (length of service, unlike bargaining unit membership, is a retention factor that permits an agency to apply secondary assignment rights uniformly and consistently); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 821 F.2d 761, 764-65 (D.C. Cir. 1987) ("When a RIF occurs, employees are generally laid-off according to their seniority--employees with fewer years of service lose their positions before employees with more years of service."); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.501(a). Thus, as the administrative judge suggested in his initial decision, the legitimate management reason for the difference in treatment was, in the first instance, the appellant's lower service computation date. Although there may have been other ways in which to structure the furlough that could have satisfied the appellant's or the Board's sense of equity, the agency is not required to furlough its employees in those alternative ways. <span class="Italic">See Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in an adverse action furlough, as in a RIF and in a directed reassignment, the Board's general review is to assure that such actions are used for legitimate reasons; therefore, the Board's focus is on the legitimacy of the reasons for the furlough, RIF, or reassignment. <span class="Italic">In re Tinker AFSC/DP v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 21 (2014). There is no indication or allegation by the appellant that the agency chose this criterion, service computation date, specifically to target or exempt any particular employees. <span class="Italic">Cf. Phelps v. Department of Labor</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 30, 32 (1984) (the agency's granting of an opportunity to obtain an unscheduled performance appraisal to some employees while denying it to others resulted in the denial of uniform and consistent application of RIF provisions). In fact, the record indicates that the facilities manager who authorized the reduction of the USRO teams to two-person teams during the furlough testified that he was not aware of the service computation dates of the affected employees when he decided to use this method to determine who would be furloughed and that service computation dates had been used in the decision to furlough other non-USRO employees, as well as in RIFs and decisions to fill critical vacant positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant contends on review that the agency did not establish a legitimate management reason for failing to treat the USROs fairly and equally because all USRO schedules had to be changed anyway, and the agency could have changed the schedules to distribute the furlough hours equally without excepting any USROs from the furlough, the mere fact that the agency had to change schedules due to the furlough does not affect the level of difficulty involved in creating schedules with different objectives. Mr. Iha testified that, although anything is possible, it would have been an administrative burden and a "nightmare" to come up with the schedule suggested at the hearing by the appellant. Although a USRO called by the appellant testified that the agency could have furloughed each USRO 4 hours per week or one 8-hour shift per week, it is not clear how this proposal would have affected overtime payments to USROs, which the agency had sought to reduce, and this USRO admitted that creating schedules was not part of his job duties. In any event, we have found that the appellant's service computation date served as a legitimate management reason for his different treatment. We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the agency had the discretion to determine whether to except four USROs and furlough the rest or attempt to create a schedule under which none of the USROs would be excepted from the furlough with all of them furloughed for the same number of hours.</p>

A "fair and even manner" means that the agency applied the adverse action furlough uniformly and consistently, just as it is required to apply a reduction in force (RIF). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the agency established a legitimate management reason for treating certain shipyard employees differently from others. The furlough exception for employees in Navy shipyards covered only the following facilities: Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and IMF; Portsmouth Naval Shipyard; Norfolk Naval Shipyard; Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and IMF; and the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay. These shipyards were included "due to the particular difficulty in making up delays in maintenance work on nuclear vessels critical to mission success." In implementing this exception, agency leadership determined that it would apply only to those individuals who worked directly for the above facilities, that not all positions geographically located at a shipyard were necessarily covered by the exception, and that this determination was made based on Unit Identification Codes unique to each of the facilities. The appellant has not identified any specific evidence in the record supporting his claim that the administrative judge made an error in finding that the agency established a legitimate management reason for the difference in treatment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(a)(2) (a petitioner who alleges that the judge made erroneous findings of material fact must explain why the factual determination is incorrect and identify specific evidence in the record that demonstrates the error).

<p class="Block-Quote1">We modify the initial decision to find that the appellant and any employees in Bremerton were not similarly situated for purposes of an adverse action furlough. As set forth above, the Board will be guided by RIF principles in making that determination, including RIF competitive level principles. In determining the retention standing of competing employees during a RIF, each agency shall establish competitive levels consisting of all positions in a competitive area which are in the same grade (or occupational level) and classification series, and which are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions so that an agency may reassign the incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in the level without undue interruption. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.401, 351.403(a)(1). Generally, a competitive area "must be defined solely in terms of the agency's organizational unit(s) and geographical location." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402(b). The minimum competitive area is a subdivision of the agency under separate administration within the local commuting area. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A local commuting area means the geographic area that usually constitutes one area for employment purposes, and includes any population center (or two or more neighboring ones) and the surrounding localities in which people live and can reasonably be expected to travel back and forth daily to their usual employment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.203.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge properly limited the scope of discovery to the appellant's competitive area insofar as the appellant was attempting to obtain evidence to rebut the agency's evidence regarding the uniformity and consistency of its furlough determinations. <span class="Italic">See Weathers</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 9. Moreover, for employees to be deemed similarly situated for purposes of a disparate treatment discrimination claim, all relevant aspects of the appellant's employment situation must be "nearly identical" to those of comparator employees. <span class="Italic">Fox v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 37 (2014). For example, to be similarly situated, comparators must have reported to the same supervisor, been subjected to the same standards governing discipline, and engaged in conduct similar to the appellant's without differentiating or mitigating circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Regarding the appellant's disparate treatment claim, the administrative judge properly denied the appellant's motion to compel the production of information relating to employees outside his competitive area because the appellant did not allege that all relevant aspects of his employment situation, including the supervisor to whom he reported, were nearly identical to the employment situations of all DOD civilian employees. <span class="Italic">See Snell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, employees outside an appellant's work unit may be similarly situated when the evidence establishes that a central office is responsible for the review and coordination of adverse actions against employees of different work units and the officials who execute the notices do not exercise a sufficient degree of autonomy in determining the disciplinary actions to be taken against the employees. <span class="Italic">Deas v. Department of Transportation</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 637, &#x00B6; 21 (2008). Here, even assuming that employees outside the appellant's work unit or competitive area were similarly situated to him under <span class="Italic">Deas</span>, the agency provided information to the appellant regarding which employees were furloughed for the entire DCMA Eastern Region, which was broader than his competitive area. In this regard, the deciding official, who was the DCMA Commander for the Eastern Region, indicated in a declaration made under penalty of perjury that, "[a]fter carefully considering each employee's reply to the proposed furlough notice and the efficiency of the service of the Department and based on the professional advice of the DCMA Human Capital Directorate, I did not find any circumstances that warranted granting relief from the furlough for any DCMA employee in the Eastern Regional Command." Thus, the appellant has shown no abuse of discretion by the administrative judge as it relates to discovery in support of a claim of disparate treatment age discrimination.</p>

In determining whether the agency structured a furlough in a fair and even manner, the Board will not second guess the agency's assessment of its mission requirements and priorities, e.g., such as an agency's determination as to the number of individuals needed to protect property, safety, and health during a furlough. <span class="Italic">Lopez v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Yee v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/YEE_CORINNE_S_SF_0752_13_3562_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1101026.pdf">121 MSPR 686</a>, 690-94 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-15, 2014 MSPB 81 (2014), rejected the argument that, because the appellant's position received independent funding, there was no financial necessity for the furlough from the Navy; instead, the necessity for the furlough should be assessed under service efficiency standard based on funding constraints facing the Defense Department:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that the "agency" in this case is the Navy because it is her employing office and that, although the agency provided evidence of DOD's factual basis for the furlough and that the furlough promoted the efficiency of the service of DOD, it did not present evidence showing the Navy's factual basis for the furlough and that the furlough promoted the efficiency of the service of the Navy. The appellant contends that the Navy is separately organized under the Secretary of the Navy, even though it operates under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that the "agency" that took the action against her was the Navy. Nevertheless, we disagree with her contention that the agency was required to prove that the furlough promoted the efficiency of the service solely as it related to the Navy. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), an agency may take an action, such as a furlough of 30 days or less, "against an employee only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(5). OPM's regulations similarly provide that an agency may take an adverse action "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.403(a). Thus, the question is whether the phrase "efficiency of the service" should be interpreted consistent with the appellant's allegation that the agency was required to prove that the furlough promoted the efficiency of the service of the Navy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point for any case involving statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself, which must be examined to determine Congress's intent and purpose. <span class="Italic">Adkins v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 233, &#x00B6; 12 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 525 F.3d 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2008). In construing statutes, their provisions should not be read in isolation; rather, each section of a statute should be construed in connection with every other section so as to produce a harmonious whole. <span class="Italic">Styslinger v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 17 (2007). Moreover, it is a normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it does not appear that the term "service" has been defined by statute or regulation for purposes of that term's use in either 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) or 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.403(a). We note, however, that section 7513(a) does include the term "employee," which is defined in part as either "an individual in the competitive service," "a preference eligible in the excepted service," or "an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). The record reflects that the appellant is a nonpreference eligible in the excepted service. Thus, for purposes of this appeal, the agency may take an action against "an individual in the excepted service" only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the "service." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). In other words, when sections 7511(a)(1) and 7513(a) are construed in connection with each other, section 7513(a) essentially provides that an agency may take an adverse action against an individual in the competitive or excepted service, or a preference eligible in the excepted service, only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the competitive or excepted service, as applicable. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 405, &#x00B6; 11 (2002) (when a word is used in the same section of a statute more than once, and the meaning is clear in one place, the word will be given the same meaning in any other place). We therefore find that the term "service" in section 7513(a) should generally be read in the broader sense of meaning the civil or federal service, which includes both the competitive and excepted service, rather than the service of a particular agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101 (for purposes of Title 5 of the United States Code, the "civil service" consists of all appointive positions in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of the government of the United States, except positions in the uniformed service); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2103(a) (the "excepted service" consists of those civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service). Although the Navy may ordinarily show that an action promotes the efficiency of the service by establishing a connection or nexus that relates solely to the operations of the Navy, we find that section 7513(a) is not so limiting under the facts of this case; its requirements can be met by showing a connection or nexus between the action in question and the efficiency of the civil service more generally.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We need not decide whether this interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) applies in other contexts beyond the special relationship, explained more fully below, that exists between a military department, such as the Navy, and DOD. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105 (for purposes of Title 5 of the United States Code, "executive agency" means an executive department, a government corporation, and an independent establishment); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101 (DOD is an executive department); 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 111(a)-(b) (DOD is an "executive department" and is "composed of," among other things, the Navy); <span class="Italic">Francis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 545, 549 (1992) (the organizational history of DOD indicates that the military service departments were intended to function--at least with respect to personnel matters--with the independence that generally characterizes executive departments outside DOD, rather than the limited kind of independence that generally characterizes organizations within those departments).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) is consistent with general Board principles relating to the efficiency of the service, as well as earlier versions of section 7513(a). An agency satisfies the efficiency of the service standard in a furlough appeal by showing, in general, that the furlough was a reasonable management solution to the financial restrictions placed on it and that the agency applied its determination as to which employees to furlough in a fair and even manner. <span class="Italic">Chandler v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8 (2013). Here, the appellant has shown no error in the administrative judge's determination that the Navy's furlough was a reasonable management solution to the financial restrictions placed on it by DOD.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the Board has long held that, in order to promote the efficiency of the service, there must be a clear and direct relationship between the articulated grounds for an adverse action and either the employee's ability to accomplish his or her duties satisfactorily or some other legitimate governmental interest promoting the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Hoofman v. Department of the Army</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 532, &#x00B6; 16 (2012), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 526 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2013); <span class="Italic">Risner v.

Hampton</span>, 566 F.2d 265, 272 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Here, that "other legitimate governmental interest," which bears a clear and direct relationship to the appellant's furlough, consists of the serious budgetary challenges facing DOD as a whole, which the appellant does not dispute on review. In this regard, we note that, although the Navy is separately organized under the Secretary of the Navy, it operates under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense. <span class="Italic">See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5011. In particular, the Secretary of the Navy is responsible to the Secretary of Defense for, among other things, "the effective and timely implementation of policy, program, and budget decisions and instructions of the President or the Secretary of Defense relating to the functions" of the Navy. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5013(c)(3). Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that, although the appellants asserted that the Navy had adequate funding to avoid the furloughs, it was reasonable for DOD to consider its budget situation holistically, rather than isolating each individual military department's situation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the substantive ground for taking an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 has been essentially unchanged in the civil service law since 1912 with the enactment of the landmark Lloyd-LaFollette Act. <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 830 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The Lloyd-LaFollette Act of 1912 provided that "no person in the classified civil service of the United States shall be removed therefrom except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of said service and for reasons given in writing." Lloyd-LaFollette Act of 1912, ch. 389, &#x00A7; 6, 37 Stat. 539, 555; <span class="Italic">see Bush v. Lucas</span>, 462 U.S. 367, 383 (1983). Thus, under this provision, an agency needed to show that its action promoted the efficiency of the "civil service" of the United States. With the passage of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, furlough actions were, for the first time, subject to the same procedural requirements as removals and other adverse actions, at least as to actions against preference eligibles. <span class="Italic">Hastie v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 64, 68 (1984), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Horner v. Andrzjewski</span>, 811 F.2d 571, 574-77 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Section 14 of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 provided that no permanent or indefinite preference eligible who has completed a probationary or trial period "employed in the civil service," or in any establishment, agency, bureau, administration, project, or department created by Acts of Congress or Presidential Executive Order, shall be discharged, suspended for more than 30 days, furloughed without pay, reduced in rank or compensation, or debarred for future appointment "except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service and for reasons given in writing." Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, Pub. L. No. 78-359, 58 Stat. 387, 388, 390. Similar to the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, the reference to the "efficiency of the service" in the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 is preceded by a reference to the "civil service," suggesting that an agency could meet its burden by showing that its action promoted the efficiency of the "civil service" of the United States. The appellant has not <span id="Page_3005"></span>alleged, and there is no indication, that Congress intended any change in meaning in the current version of the law.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Einboden contends that the Navy working capital fund was not subject to sequestration pursuant to the OMB report. Because Dahlgren's funds were not sequestered, Dahlgren never was facing a budgetary shortfall, and therefore the Navy cannot demonstrate that his furlough promoted the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject Mr. Einboden's contention that Dahlgren could not have reasonably anticipated a shortage of funding at the time the decision to furlough was made and that Dahlgren's budget is unaffected by agency-wide cuts. While working capital funds were treated as being exempt from sequestration,[2] sequestration was applied to agencies that would be paying working capital fund entities (like Dahlgren). When agencies ordering services from Dahlgren had their budgets sequestered, those agencies could and would prioritize their spending, and Dahlgren could have anticipated receiving less funding from those agencies and thus suffering a funding shortfall. The flexibility from the furlough of working capital fund employees allowed the Navy to potentially "address other higher-priority budgetary needs," by transferring money from the working capital fund pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2208(r)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We accept, without deciding, the position that the Navy working capital fund was not subject to sequestration as the OMB report suggests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Einboden contends that the Navy failed to show that his unpaid salary was used to meet a budgetary shortfall and thus failed to demonstrate that the furlough would "promote the efficiency of the service." We reject Mr. Einboden's contention that the Navy be required to show actual re-programming of the funds saved by his furlough. It is not our role to second guess agency decisions as to how to prioritize funding when faced with a budget shortfall. <span class="Italic">See Berlin v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 772 F.3d 890, 894-95 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The Board interpreted the statute's requirement that the furlough "will promote the efficiency of the service" as requiring that the decision be a reasonable management solution to the financial restrictions placed on the agency and that the agency determine which employees to furlough in a fair and even manner. This interpretation is correct. It is immaterial whether subsequent events ameliorated these concerns. These management decisions are inherently prospective. <span class="Italic">See Cross v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 127 F.3d 1443, 1447 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We give wide berth to agency decisions as to what type of adverse action is necessary to "promote the efficiency of the service," provided that the agency's decision bears some nexus to the reason for the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 565 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (an agency meets the "efficiency of the service" standard when it demonstrates the existence of a nexus between the reason for adverse action and the work of an agency); <span class="Italic">Webster v. Dep't of Army</span>, 911 F.2d 679, 685 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (when deciding what penalty for misconduct promotes the efficiency of the service "deference is given to the agency's judgment...unless...it amounts to an abuse of discretion" (alterations, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted)). We have also accepted the very standard utilized by the Board here under similar circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Berlin</span>, 772 F.3d at 894-95. The Navy's decision has not been shown to be unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject Mr. Einboden's argument that the Navy implemented the furloughs unfairly because he was treated differently than other civilian employees. Mr. Einboden makes no claim that he was treated differently than other employees in the Navy, but instead alleges that he was treated differently than other civilians in the Air Force--contrary to the requirement that the furlough be implemented in a "fair and even manner." <span class="Italic">See Chandler v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8 (2013). When the DOD made the decision to perform furloughs in response to the budget shortfall, it mandated a furlough of all civilian employees except certain categories--leaving it to the various sub-agencies to make decisions as to which employees were exempt from sequestration. The specific decision to furlough Mr. Einboden was made by the Navy. The Navy was not obligated to implement the DOD directive in the same way as the Air Force, assuming the Navy's decision was consistent with DOD guidance (and here there is no contention that it is not). Management decisions as to which individual employees to furlough in the face of budget shortfalls are within the sound discretion of agency officials, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Berlin</span>, 772 F.3d at 896, and the Navy did not act arbitrarily nor capriciously in making a different decision than the Air Force in implementing the DOD guidance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1442 v. Dept. of Army</span>, 810 F.3d 1272, 1278-83 (Fed. Cir. 2015), followed <span class="Italic">Einboden</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Appeal 3175 and Appeal 3189, we are faced with the same two questions: (1) whether the arbitrator erred in analyzing the efficiency of the service issue by focusing on DOD as a whole rather than on the local AWCF entity (LEAD or WVA); and (2) whether the arbitrator erred in ruling that the employer carried its burden of demonstrating that the furlough promoted the efficiency of the service. We conclude that, in both appeals, the arbitrators correctly focused on DOD as the relevant agency rather than on the local WCF entity. We also conclude that, in both appeals, substantial evidence supports the arbitrators' findings that the efficiency of the service standard was met. We consider first the arbitrators' focus on DOD rather than on LEAD and WVA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our analysis begins with the language of the statutory provisions authorizing furloughs of federal employees. Section 7513(a) states that "an <span class="Italic">agency</span> may take an action covered by this subchapter [i.e. those listed in &#x00A7; 7512] ...only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) (emphasis added). Section 7512 provides that the subchapter "applies to...a furlough of 30 days or less." The term "agency" is not defined in Chapter 75 of Title 5, under which &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512 and 7513 are organized. Chapter 1 of Title 5, however, divides "Agencies Generally" into five different groups: (1) Executive departments (&#x00A7; 101); (2) Military departments (&#x00A7; 102); (3) Government corporations (&#x00A7; 103); (4) Independent establishments (&#x00A7; 104); and (5) Executive agencies (&#x00A7; 105). DOD is included in the first group of agencies, "Executive departments." Specifically, &#x00A7; 105 provides that, "[f]or purposes of [Title 5], 'Executive agency' means an Executive department." Section 101, in turn, explains that "Executive departments" includes, among others, DOD. In contrast, Title 5 nowhere defines "agency" as specifically including WCF entities, such as LEAD and WVA, or any other agency subdivision or local employing office. Indeed, virtually every time the term "agency" is defined elsewhere in Title 5, the definition includes DOD, but never LEAD, WVA, or any other agency subdivision or local employing office. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3132, 3701, 3581, 4701, 5351, 5381, 5402, 5521, 7103. The statutory language supports the arbitrators' decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by NFFE's argument that the word "agency" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) refers to the "local agency level" because the adverse actions listed in Chapter 75 include removals and suspensions, as well as furloughs, and those adverse actions (removals and suspensions) regularly are taken at the local level or duty station. Even assuming NFFE's proposition to be true, we see no basis for concluding that, because some adverse actions are implemented at the local level or at an affected employee's duty station, it necessarily follows that the determination of the validity of furloughs at a particular location arising from an agency-<span id="Page_3006"></span>wide sequestration must be assessed from the standpoint of the local level or local duty station. In our view, such an approach ignores the fact that entirely different considerations are involved when assessing an adverse action, such as a removal or a suspension, as opposed to a furlough. In the former, the pertinent facts--the conduct of the employee and the resulting actions of his or her supervisors--are purely "local" in that they typically arise at the particular employee's duty station. In the case of the furloughs here, however, the actions at issue (the furloughs at the local level) were the result of financial restraints imposed on the entire agency, not just on particular subcomponents of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find instructive the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Yee v. Department of the Navy</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 686 (2014). The issue in <span class="Italic">Yee</span> was whether the furloughing of a Navy attorney in response to the sequester and resulting DOD directives promoted the efficiency of the service, where the Navy had sufficient funding to avoid the furlough. In <span class="Italic">Yee</span>, the Board reasoned that, "[a]lthough the Navy may ordinarily show that an action promotes the efficiency of the service by establishing a connection or nexus that relates solely to the operations of the Navy,...section 7513(a) is not so limiting under the facts of this case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 692. The Board found that the requirements of &#x00A7; 7513(a) "can be met by showing a connection or nexus between the action in question and the efficiency of the civil service <span class="Italic">more generally</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). In <span class="Italic">Yee</span>, the Board noted that, "although the Navy is separately organized under the Secretary of the Navy, it operates under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 693.
