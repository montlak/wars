<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-130"><span class="space">d.</span> Due Diligence</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">New evidence in a PFR must be evidence that could not be obtained at the hearing stage in the exercise of reasonable diligence. <span class="Italic">Fritz v. OPM</span>, 5 MSPR 28, 30, 5 MSPB 108 (1981) ("However, because appellant has not made a showing that despite due diligence this evidence was previously unavailable, he is precluded from presenting the evidence by way of a petition for review under 6 C.F.R. 1201.115(a)."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 136, 140 (1994) (declining to consider evidence submitted after the close of the record when the appellant did not comply with the Board order concerning discovery and failed timely to initiate discovery); <span class="Italic">Szczerbiak v. USPS</span>, 2 MSPR 561, 563, 3 MSPB 82 (1980) (evidence supporting a disability discrimination claim should have first been presented to the AJ); <span class="Italic">cf. Cap Export, LLC v. Zinus, Inc.</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210505137">996 F.3d 1332</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021) (considering due diligence and newly discovered evidence as to civil procedure rules applied to a patent dispute)<span class="Italic">. But see</span> <span class="Italic">Mendez v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 88 MSPR 596, 602 &#x00B6; 13 (2001) (considering with a PFR relevant evidence that the agency should have produced in response to a discovery request).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board elaborated on due diligence, <span class="Italic">Avansino v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 211, 214 (1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides, similarly, for relief from a final judgment or order by a court when a party establishes, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that there is "newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b)." That "due diligence" requirement for newly discovered evidence may be analogized to the Board's "due diligence" requirement for new and material evidence because both relate to new evidence warranting reconsideration of an adjudicatory disposition at the first level. In construing Rule 60(b), the courts have required that the party offering the newly discovered evidence at least offer a reasonable explanation as to why the additional material or testimony could not have been supplied earlier. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United Medical Laboratories</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.</span>, 258 F. Supp. 735, 747 (D. Ore. 1966), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 404 F.2d 706 (9th Cir. 1968), <span class="Italic">cert. den.</span>, 394 U.S. 921, 89 S. Ct. 1197, 22 L. Ed.2d 454 (1969).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations provide at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.57(a) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.58(a)] that "[w]hen there is a hearing, the record shall be closed at the conclusion of the hearing." In the instant case the presiding official notified the parties of this rule shortly before concluding the hearing. The record shows further that appellant was notified more than two weeks before the hearing that the agency's medical officer was scheduled to testify regarding appellant's fitness for duty. When appellant did not then produce his own physician at the hearing to counter testimony by the agency's medical officer, he was precluded from arguing that testimony his physician could have proffered at the time of the hearing was "new and material evidence" that was not available when the record was closed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the basis of appellant's appeal was that the agency should have reassigned him to a position within the agency for which he was qualified, namely, that of Distribution Clerk, it is reasonable to expect appellant to exercise "due diligence" in preparing to counter the agency's evidence that he was not physically qualified for it, by oral testimony or otherwise. If presenting appellant's physician as a witness would have been too expensive for appellant to afford, appellant could have introduced his physician's written statement at the hearing. Appellant has offered no reasonable explanation as to why such a statement could not have been supplied at that time. Thus, the written statement of appellant's physician dated October 23, 1979, relating to appellant's ability to lift up to 70 pounds, cannot be deemed "not available when the record was closed," as required of "new and material evidence" by the Board's regulations. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Diligence is due from both parties. The agency's failure to use discovery, or acquire a hearing continuance, to obtain or supply additional evidence prevents evidence submitted with a PFR from being considered "new," <span class="Italic">Nelson v. VA</span>, 22 MSPR 65, 68-69 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to meet the new evidence standard, the agency must show that the evidence was previously unavailable despite due diligence. The agency's failure to do this will preclude it from presenting the evidence by way of a petition for review. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(a); <span class="Italic">Beer v. Department of the Army,</span> 2 MSPB 226, 228 (1980). In the present case, the agency could have filed a motion to compel discovery or for the issuance of a subpoena with the presiding official after appellant and Mr. Yan refused to answer its questions. 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.73(c)(2) and 1201.81(a). Because it did not avail itself of these simple procedures, it may not now claim that appellant's refusal to voluntarily assist it prevented it from obtaining the evidence despite due diligence. <span class="Italic">See Fuiava v. Department of Justice,</span> 3 MSPB 217, 218 (1980). In addition, Mr. Yan testified at the hearing and was cross-examined by the agency representative. The record does not indicate that the agency objected to Mr. Yan's testimony or asked for an extension of time to rebut it. Therefore, it has failed to show that it exercised due diligence in obtaining the evidence before the record closed at the end of the hearing. <span class="Italic">Wakeland v. National Transportation Safety</span> <span class="Italic">Board,</span> 6 MSPB 44, 45 (1981). Moreover, regardless of Mr. Yan's testimony, the agency had the burden of proving its charge that appellant used the credit card on December 27, 1982, and March 11, 1983, to pay for gasoline for his personal vehicle. The additional evidence obtained by the agency concerning those dates and others, even if it was gathered in response to Mr. Yan's testimony, was clearly available to the agency prior to the closing of the record. Therefore, it does not warrant granting the agency's petition for review on the basis of new and material evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board would not accept the agency's proffer of evidence in a PFR that suggested, for the first time, that a disciplinary action was undertaken before a protected disclosure, a fact that would have negated a whistleblowing reprisal determination by the AJ. The evidence could have been located earlier with proper litigation management, a conclusion reached in <span class="Italic">Duggan v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has asked the Board to consider newly submitted evidence in this case. The newly submitted evidence relates to the agency's argument that it initiated the action prior to the appellant's whistleblowing. The agency asserts, and supports through affidavits, that the agency representative was a relatively new attorney in the office and did not discover the document until after the record closed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">King v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 181 (2010), the agency argues that when the Board has found that "the appellant's submission of new evidence consisted of records that pre-dated the close of the record, [and] the documents lent credibility to the appellant's claims," the Board will remand the matter for review. The agency argues that the Board should apply such reasoning here because the agency's new evidence would change the outcome of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span id="Page_1715"></span><span class="Italic">Russo v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 345, 349 (1980) (the Board will not grant a petition for review unless it is of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision). However, <span class="Italic">King</span> does not stand for a general proposition that all evidence that could change the outcome of an appeal will be considered for the first time on review. Instead, <span class="Italic">King</span> specifically explains that in annuity cases, unlike the case at bar, our paramount concern is whether the appellant is entitled to the benefit sought, and we resolve any doubt as to whether an appeal should be reopened for adjudication on the merits in favor of the appellant. <span class="Italic">King</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 181, &#x00B6; 26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the contrary, the general rule pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(d)(1), is that the Board will not consider evidence submitted for the first time with the petition for review absent a showing that it was unavailable before the record was closed despite the party's due diligence. <span class="Italic">Avansino v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 211, 214 (1980). We do not find the agency's argument persuasive. The agency should have anticipated that the timing of the proposed suspension was a significant issue, for circumstantial evidence regarding the timing of personnel actions normally is at issue in whistleblower appeals. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Kewley v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the agency representative was a relatively new employee and did not know the potential location for all relevant evidence, agency managers in the legal office would have known the location of the necessary files and had a duty to assist the representative in finding them.

Department of Homeland Security</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 156, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2005) (the agency failed to establish good cause for untimely petition for review based on newly discovered evidence that the appellant's concurrent case before another agency was not final, as the appellant had represented); <span class="Italic">Ernst v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 133, 137 n.2 (1995) (the Board rejected the appellant's claim that he had not discovered newly-submitted evidence in support of his case before the record closed because it had been buried under 200 pounds of documents), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 92 F.3d 1208 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Due diligence is demonstrated by an appellant who makes a timely but unsuccessful request for assistance from the AJ to obtain medical records maintained by the Labor Department; those records will be reviewed with the PFR when they are finally obtained after the close of the record before the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v.

A transcript of proceedings in a criminal case that cannot with due diligence be obtained prior to the Board hearing may qualify as new evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCaffrey v.

<p class="Body-Text">Due diligence requires effort. Evidence may be received with a PFR as "new" if its production was improperly blocked by the agency when the case was before the AJ. But the rule is that if one party refuses to provide information during discovery, the party seeking discovery must pursue it through a motion to compel production of evidence. The Board will not grant a PFR based on new evidence if that evidence could have been secured through discovery. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Madrid v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">With its petition for review, OPM submits, as new evidence, copies of the appellant's Federal tax returns for the years from 1983 through 1991, alleging that it had specifically asked during a prehearing telephone conference whether the appellant had those documents, but that it had not pursued its attempts to obtain them because the appellant had asserted that her copies of the returns had been destroyed during a fire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant's alleged assertion that she did not have copies of her returns excuses OPM's failure to pursue a discovery request for the documents before the record closed below, we find that OPM has still failed to establish a proper basis for considering the documents in question in connection with this proceeding. A party seeking to submit, on petition for review, documents that are not in the record must show that the information contained therein, not just the documents themselves, was unavailable despite due diligence when the record closed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grassell v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 40 MSPR 554, 564 (1989). Here, although copies of the appellant's tax returns may not have been available to OPM when the record closed below, OPM could have obtained information about the appellant's earnings during the years in question through interrogatories. Neither OPM's Request for Response to Written Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents, however, nor its subsequent Motion to Compel Complete Response to Interrogatories, reflects any inquiries regarding the appellant's non-Federal earnings.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board will not extend the time for filing a PFR on the basis of unsupported allegations that the other party has, allegedly in bad faith, withheld evidence from the petitioner.

The appellant says the information in Behr's statement was not produced in the regional office proceeding because Kathy Eaton, Deputy State Director, Administration, told Behr and other employees not to provide the appellant with any information or statements that would aid him in his appeal to the Board. The appellant's unsworn statements in his petition for review cannot prove the truth of this assertion, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Valverde v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 40 MSPR 380, 386 n.8 (1989), which is not confirmed by Mr. Behr's statement. Even if we were to accept the appellant's assertions as true, we note that he made no allegation below that he was prevented from adducing relevant evidence, and he did not request a hearing at which he could have questioned Mr. Behr under oath. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the appellant has not demonstrated that the evidence in Mr. Behr's statement was previously unavailable despite due diligence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the documents alleged to show that it is common agency practice to complete paperwork after the fact, the appellant gave no explanation with his petition for review of why he could not have adduced these or similar documents in the regional office proceeding. In a pleading filed one day after the record on review had closed, the appellant argued that these documents were not previously available because he had been denied access to property management files and other materials. This allegation is itself not properly before the Board because the appellant has made no showing that he could not have <span id="Page_1716"></span>made it before the record on review closed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.114(i). Even if we were to consider the appellant's explanation of why the documents were previously unavailable, it would not establish that he exercised due diligence in the regional office proceeding. A review of the initial appeal file does not indicate that the appellant availed himself of the Board's discovery procedures to obtain the documents in question, or that he complained to the administrative judge about being prevented from adducing relevant evidence. <span class="Italic">Cf.

<p class="Body-Text">A PFR was denied despite the agency's claim that it had a new witness.

There was a contrary result: an agency managed to persuade the Board that a recently discovered witness had "new" evidence when the agency established that it could not reasonably have known the witness had information--essentially the appellant's admission of wrongdoing--before the close of the record.

The Board declined to consider the allegation of perjury, stating that the evidence could have been presented to the AJ and was, therefore, not new. <span class="Italic">Thomson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 16 MSPR 474 (1983). Similarly, the agency attempted to convince the Board through affidavits that a witness lied at a hearing concerning the timing of events.

See, e.g., Patillo v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 452, 454-55 (1989); <span class="Italic">Lee v. OPM</span>, 26 MSPR 391, 392 (1985). Therefore, we will consider this evidence on review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status may not excuse lengthy delays in reopening for new evidence, as the Board noted as to an appellant's effort to resume an appeal based on evidence that he thought rendered his settlement agreement invalid, <span class="Italic">Marrero-Camacho v. Dept. of Army</span>, 101 MSPR 362, 365 &#x00B6; 8, 2006 MSPB 57 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an initial decision dismisses the appeal as settled, newly-discovered evidence may constitute good cause for the untimely filing of a petition for review, if the newly discovered evidence establishes that the settlement agreement was invalid. <span class="Italic">Dickson v. General Services Administration</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 7, &#x00B6; 6 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 243 F.3d 566 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table). The appellant contends that, in negotiating and accepting the settlement agreement, it was his understanding that his retirement annuity would include credit for military service, and that he did not learn until May 1998 that an award of military retired pay would result in the reduction of his monthly annuity. Assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that this discovery would serve as a basis for invalidating the settlement agreement, the appellant provides no explanation for why he waited an additional 7 years before filing a petition for review. While we note the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, we find that he has not shown good cause for the lengthy delay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Particularly when the appeal does not involve a hearing, problems may occur when an AJ permits the parties to simultaneously file evidence on a record closing date, without a right of either party to file evidence responsive to the evidence that goes then goes into the record. There have been a variety of approaches of parties who, when they receive the evidence filed by the other party on the closing of the record, seek to rebut that evidence.
