DOD</span>,<a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SOUTHERLAND_ROBERT_SF_0752_09_0864_R_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER__649285.pdf"> 117 MSPR 56</a>, 65-67 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-28, 2011 MSPB 92 (2011) [replacing the decision at 2011 MSPB 78 (2011)] (overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Southerland v. DOD</span>,<a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SOUTHERLAND_ROBERT_SF_0752_09_0864_B_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_CONCURRING_OPINION_832922.pdf"> 119 MSPR 566</a>, 2013 MSPB 46 (2013)), explained the nature of a disability covered under the ADAAA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a federal employee, the appellant's claim of discrimination on the basis of disability arises under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. However, the regulatory standards for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) have been incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act, and the Board applies them to determine whether there has been a Rehabilitation Act violation. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g); <span class="Italic">Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 36 n.3 (2007); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(b). Further, the ADA regulations superseded the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC's) regulations under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Collins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2005) (stating that 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(g) and other portions of the regulation at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203 were repealed on June 20, 2002, and the ADA regulations at 29 C.F.R. part 1630 were made applicable to cases under the Rehabilitation Act); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), which liberalized the definition of disability, became effective on January 1, 2009. <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Social Security Administration</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 17 (2010) (citing P.L. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008), codified at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>). Thus, in the appellant's appeals of his suspension, effective June 22, 2009, and of his removal, effective November 6, 2009, the ADAAA definition is applicable. While the ADAAA became effective on January 1, 2009, because the amended regulations implementing it did not become effective until May 24, 2011, the administrative judge did not have the benefit of the amended regulations or the guidance provided by the EEOC in the Appendix to Part 1630 when he issued his initial decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2; Appendix to Part 1630--Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 16,978, 17,003-17,017 (Mar. 25, 2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ADAAA defines a disability, in relevant part, as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities"[3] or "[b]eing regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1)(A), (C); <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1)(i), (iii). With respect to the "regarded as having such an impairment" provision, both the ADAAA and the amended regulations explain that "[t]his means that the individual has been subjected to an action prohibited by the ADA as amended because of an actual or perceived impairment that is not both 'transitory and minor.'"[4] 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(3); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1)(iii); <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, &#x00A7; 1630.2(l)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The amended regulations provide that "[A]n impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of this section." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). They explain that "the term 'substantially limits' shall be interpreted and applied to require a degree of functional limitation that is lower than the standard for 'substantially limits' applied prior to the ADAAA." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(iv).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Appendix to Part 1630 clarifies that the "transitory and minor" exception to coverage under the "regarded as" prong is a defense to a claim of discrimination but that "this limitation on coverage should be construed narrowly."

<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We note that 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(iii) &#x0026; (v) provide that "the threshold issue of whether an impairment 'substantially limits' a major life activity should not demand extensive analysis" and that this determination "usually will not require scientific, medical, or statistical analysis...." Although the appellant's medical records are relevant to resolving the insubordination charges, it is unlikely the administrative judge needs to consider these records in addressing the "regarded as" prong of the ADAAA and EEOC's implementing regulations; there appears to be no dispute that the appellant has a 10-pound lifting restriction. <span class="Italic">See infra</span> note 6 and accompanying text.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the appellant has not asserted that the agency failed to accommodate him. Rather, he has asserted that the agency removed him on the basis of his impairment. Therefore, the administrative judge's analysis of the appellant's discrimination claim should have focused on whether the appellant meets the "regarded as" definition of disability as set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1)(iii) and as further explained in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(l). That is, the administrative judge should have determined whether the appellant was "subjected to a prohibited action because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment, whether or not that impairment substantially limit[ed], or [wa]s perceived to substantially limit, a major life activity."[6] <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(l)(1). However, the amended regulations explain that "[e]stablishing that an individual is 'regarded as having such an impairment' does not, by itself, establish liability. Liability is established under Title I of the ADA only when an individual proves that a covered entity discriminated on the basis of disability within the meaning of section 102 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12112." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(l)(3); <span class="Italic">see</span> Appendix to Part 1630, 76 Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Decisions earlier than the 2008 ADAAA provide some, but not controlling, guidance concerning transitory conditions. If a major life activity is limited by the requisite physical or mental restriction or impairment, an appellant is considered disabled. The major life activity that is adversely affected may be the ability to work. <span class="Italic">Widger v. VA</span>, 37 MSPR 368 (1988). To be disabling, the appellant's injury or illness must be more than transitory; no matter how severe, the condition is not disabling if it "has no permanent effect on his health." <span class="Italic">Kinsey v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A handicapped person is one who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities, such as working. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(1)-(3); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 45 MSPR 136, 140 (1990); <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 43 MSPR at 477. The question of who is a handicapped person under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires an individualized inquiry as to whether the particular impairment constitutes for the individual person a significant barrier to employment; relevant factors are the number and type of jobs from which the impaired individual is disqualified, the geographical area to which he has reasonable access, and his job expectations and training<span class="Italic">. Anderson</span>, 45 MSPR at 140-41; <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 43 MSPR at 477. The fact that an impairment prevents an employee from meeting the demands of a particular job does not necessarily mean that he is handicapped; the impairment must foreclose generally the type of employment involved<span class="Italic">. Anderson</span>, 45 MSPR at 141; <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 43 MSPR at 477-78. A person who suffers from a transitory illness or injury, no matter how severe, that has no permanent effect on his health is not considered a handicapped person<span class="Italic">. See Price v. Mecham</span>, EEOC Docket No. 03900045, slip op. at 4-5 (May 4, 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, we believe that the agency's contention in its cross petition for review that the appellant is not a handicapped person has merit. There is some evidence indicating that the appellant had intermittently been under different forms of medical restrictions for approximately 2 years due to various injuries and conditions before the agency placed him on involuntary leave on February 22, 1993. However, the record also shows that the appellant's condition at issue in this appeal appears to have resulted from surgery he had in December 1992. The agency's medical officer indicated on January 19, 1993, that the appellant's medical restrictions were temporary and should be re-evaluated on March 1, 1993. The proposing and deciding officials testified that this notation from the medical officer led them to believe that the appellant's condition was likely to improve and they expected him to return to full duty in a few months. Although he contended that his hands had been bothering him for some time, the appellant submitted no medical evidence to rebut the agency's assertion that his condition was temporary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's injury thus produced a temporary physical impairment that would, at most, require light-duty work for a period of time<span class="Italic">. Price v. Mecham</span>, slip op. at 5. The appellant did not submit any medical evidence indicating that his condition would be permanent. To permit those with temporary impairments of this nature to avail themselves of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 would contravene the intent of the Act to protect those who are truly handicapped<span class="Italic">. Price v. Mecham</span>, slip op. at 5; <span class="Italic">see also Miller</span>, 43 MSPR at 479. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge erred by determining that the appellant is a handicapped employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, this error does not warrant reversal of the initial decision because the appellant did not show that he is a qualified handicapped employee<span class="Italic">. See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984). Even if the appellant were a handicapped employee, the mere existence of a handicap is insufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that an individual is a qualified handicapped employee; the employee must articulate a reasonable accommodation that the agency could or should have made in order to enable him to perform successfully<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Joyner v. Department of the Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 596, 600 (1991); <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 43 MSPR at 477.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's suggested accommodation in this appeal was that the agency assign him to a permanent light-duty position. There is no evidence that the agency placed him in a light-duty position after he went on medical restriction on January 19, 1993. In any event, prior assignment to light duty does not establish a continuing entitlement to light duty even when a handicapping condition is permanent<span class="Italic">. See Bauman v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 209, 214 (1992); <span class="Italic">Joyner</span>, 47 MSPR at 600-01. Further, an agency need not accommodate a handicapped employee by permanently assigning him to light-duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position<span class="Italic">. See Bauman</span>, 55 MSPR at 214. Therefore, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency was not required to assign the appellant permanently to a light-duty position as he suggests, and that the appellant failed to demonstrate that he is a qualified handicapped employee<span class="Italic">.
