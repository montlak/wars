<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-8"><span class="space">a.</span> "Gross" Waste or Mismanagement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii) and 2302(b)(8)(B)(ii) prohibit reprisals based on disclosures that individuals reasonably believe evidence gross mismanagement or gross waste of funds. <span class="Italic">Nafus v. Dept. of Army</span>, 57 MSPR 386, 393-98 (1993), clarified the definition of "gross" mismanagement or waste by examining the significance of the disclosure relative to the magnitude of related agency operations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish his affirmative defense of whistleblowing, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that he made a disclosure described in 5 USC 2302(b)(8) that was a contributing factor to his removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDaid v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 46 MSPR 416, 420 (1990). This includes any disclosure of information that the appellant reasonably believed evidenced a gross waste of funds or gross mismanagement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii). In his petition for review, the appellant asserts, among other things, that the administrative judge erred in finding that his December 12, 1990 memorandum did not make such a disclosure. We find that the appellant's memorandum did not disclose a gross waste of funds or gross mismanagement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Gross waste</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the initial whistleblower provisions, passed as part of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454 (Oct. 13, 1978), now codified in various portions of title 5 of the United States Code, does not shed much light on the definition of "gross waste." The legislative history makes it clear, however, that the "gross" standard in relation to funds was not intended to protect trivial or <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> matters. It states that "[w]hat is needed is a means to protect the Pentagon employee who discloses billions of dollars in cost overruns, the GSA employee who discloses widespread fraud and the nuclear engineer who questions the safety of certain nuclear plants." S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2730.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Aside from these comments, the legislative histories of the relevant statutes do not suggest a test for gross waste of funds. Black's Law Dictionary 702 (6th ed. 1990), however, defines gross as, "[o]ut of all measure; beyond allowance; flagrant; shameful; as a gross dereliction of duty, a gross injustice, gross carelessness or negligence....&#8197;Such conduct as is not to be excused."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the legal definition found in Black's Law Dictionary, and the legislative history of the WPA, it is clear that Congress intended the term "gross" to be more than merely a debatable expenditure. Thus, we find that gross waste of funds constitutes a more than debatable expenditure that is significantly out of proportion to the benefit reasonably expected to accrue to the government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Gross mismanagement</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) defined the term "mismanagement" in prior regulations, which will serve as guidance here.[3] "Mismanagement means wrongdoing or arbitrary and capricious actions that may have an adverse effect on the efficient accomplishment of the agency mission." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1250.3(e) (1989).[4] In addition, West's Legal Thesaurus / Dictionary 496 (1985 ed.) equates "mismanagement" to "maladministration, malpractice, misconduct, misfeasance, misdirection, neglect" and "negligent."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;When OSC became an independent agency under the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act, this definition was eliminated from its regulations at 5 CFR part 1800 without explanation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In cases involving alleged "mismanagement," the Board has found that an employee's expression of views contrary to those of the Chairman of his agency on financial matters, upon which the employee had expertise, could be considered an allegation of mismanagement and abuse of discretion under the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Farm Credit Administration</span>, 51 MSPR 569, 582 (1991). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Oliver v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA of 1989, 5 USCA 2302(b)(8) (West Supp. 1992), changed the reference from "mismanagement" in the CSRA to "gross mismanagement." <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. 13, 26, 34. The legislative history of the WPA shows that Congress also intended the term "gross" to reflect something blatant or out of the ordinary. The legislative history explains as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">S.&#x2003;508 would also change the definition of protected disclosures from "mismanagement" to "gross mismanagement." While the Committee is concerned about improving the protection of whistleblowers, it is also concerned about the exhaustive administrative and judicial remedies provided under S. 508 that could be used by employees who have made disclosures of trivial matters. CSRA specifically established a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard for disclosures affecting the waste of funds by defining such disclosures as protected only if they involved "a gross waste of funds." Under S. 508, the Committee establishes a similar <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard for disclosures of mismanagement by protecting them only if they involve "gross mismanagement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gross mismanagement is also a term that is used in bankruptcy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">In re Evans</span>, 48 B.R. 46 (Bankr. W.D. Tex. 1985); <span class="Italic">In re Colby Construction Corp.</span>, 51 B.R. 113 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1985); <span class="Italic">In re St. Louis Globe-Democrat Inc.</span>, 63 B.R. 131 (Bankr. E.D. Mo. 1985). As these examples illustrate, gross mismanagement has a degree of blatancy to it. Several courts have asserted that it requires the showing of extreme errors in judgment or organization which causes or is likely to cause harm to creditors. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">In re Evans</span>, 48 B.R. at 47; <span class="Italic">In re Mako, Inc.</span>, 102 B.R. 809, 812 (Bankr. E.D. Okla. 1988), citing <span class="Italic">In re Brown</span>, 31 B.R. 583 (Bankr. D.D.C. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, considering the foregoing definitions and examples, we conclude that "gross mismanagement" is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> wrongdoing or negligence. Thus, gross mismanagement does not include management decisions which are merely debatable, nor does it mean action or inaction which constitutes simple negligence or wrongdoing. There must be an element of blatancy. Gross mismanagement means a management action or inaction which creates a substantial risk of significant adverse impact upon the agency's ability to accomplish its mission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that there was no gross waste of funds or gross mismanagement in this case. The administrative judge explained the events culminating in the appellant's memorandum as follows. On December 10, 1990, the appellant received a telephone call from Rose Falcetta, Computer Specialist in the information center (IC), who informed him that Gerald Carinci, Chief, EHQ, with the assistance of IC, had prepared and sent a CAPR to Michael Mullahey, a Computer Specialist then assigned to the Advanced Technology and Communications Directorate (ATD). The CAPR requested the purchase of seven PCs and peripherals for EHQ, costing $21,292.00. Mr. Mullahey asked Ms. Falcetta if the appellant was aware of and had concurred in the CAPR for this purchase and whether the required economic analysis (EA) had been prepared. The appellant told Ms. Falcetta that he was not aware of the CAPR.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3586"></span>On December 11, 1990, the appellant received a telephone call from James Sherman, the Acting Chief of EHQ, asking the appellant to prepare the EA and sign-off on the CAPR. The appellant responded that he could not prepare the EA, because EHQ had not gone through the automation office, but that he would review the CAPR and EA. With the CAPR, the appellant received a written justification written by Mr. Wells to support the urgent need for the computer purchases. However, after reviewing the documents, the appellant informed Mr. Sherman that he could not concur in the CAPR. The appellant documented these events in the memorandum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant's memorandum on its face disclosed gross waste and gross mismanagement. Specifically, he found that in the memorandum, the appellant protested the requested purchase of seven PCs and computer software for an office which at the time had only three employees. The administrative judge concluded that the appellant challenged the agency's justification for up to four of the seven PCs as well as the software requested. He found that this amount represented a substantial portion of the total requested purchase of $21,292.00, and thus the matter could not be considered trivial. We disagree with the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the appellant contends only that four of the seven personal computers were unnecessary, and their value is approximately $12,000.00. The annual computer budget for the arsenal for the year in question was $1.5 million, so at issue is less than 1% of the annual computer budget.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;This does not necessarily suggest that any expenditure under $12,000.00 or that is less than 1% of some budget is "debatable," since for example, paying $100.00 for a $12.00 hammer is still gross waste. Any allegation of gross waste of funds must be looked at in context, and here the allegation of gross waste was that these items were purchased at all, not the cost of the items. Because the decision to make purchases was questioned, the amount of the purchases, and the percentage of the budget, therefore, may be relevant on a case by case basis since, as noted above, "gross" suggests "shameful"; "flagrant"; "out of all measure."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the agency's explanations belie a finding of gross waste or mismanagement under the definitions set forth above. The agency contended that two different divisions, the DEH and the EHQ, were jointly requesting the computer authorization. Thus, the appellant's contention that EHQ had only three employees at the time is not as relevant, since the EHQ was anticipating hiring two new employees, and the DEH had at least two people who needed computers. In addition, the agency contended that there were only fifteen to twenty-five computers for 110 employees in the DEH. Thus, none of the computers would be wasted, even if they were not immediately used by the particular divisions requesting them. Moreover, the agency contended that authorization was for up to seven computers, which did not mean that seven would necessarily be purchased at the time authorization was approved. Finally, the agency contended that it was trying to expeditiously automate ($15 million was budgeted on computers in the five-year plan), and knew that between the request for computers and their arrival there would be a significant lag time. Given these facts, the agency's action here could not be construed as having had an adverse impact on the accomplishment of the agency's mission to a significant degree. Therefore, we find that the expenditure was not gross waste and did not exhibit gross mismanagement as the four computers would still be put to the use and benefit of the government, and would not cause harm to the taxpayers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of whether gross waste or mismanagement occurred, however, the Board must still determine whether the appellant <span class="Italic">reasonably believed</span> that there was gross waste or mismanagement before it can decide the appellant's whistleblowing allegation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii). We find it necessary to remand the case for a determination of whether a person with the information the appellant had could well have reasonably concluded there was a gross waste of money or gross mismanagement involved. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Ramos v. FAA</span>, 4 MSPB 446, 4 MSPR 388, 392 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e note that the administrative judge apparently relied on inappropriate factors in determining that the appellant did not reasonably believe that he had disclosed gross waste or gross mismanagement. The administrative judge cited the appellant's failure to proceed through the supervisory chain of command before issuing his memorandum. Under the circumstances of this case, we find that whether the appellant exhausted intraagency channels was not a proper consideration in determining the reasonableness of the appellant's belief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There may be cases where an appellant's failure to go through agency channels <span class="Italic">to secure additional information</span> would detract from or even be fatal to the claim that he reasonably believed some fact. These would be cases in which the appellant acted on information so obviously incomplete or sketchy that a reasonable person would not have relied on it alone.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge considered the appellant's argument that the quality control and timing issues with OLPA press releases and media advisories, as well as OLPA's low employee morale, created a threat to the agency's "public image and public relations effectiveness" and jeopardized "essential support of those in the Congress who allocate critical funding to and authorize the funding of the Agency." The administrative judge also considered the appellant's argument that the agency was subject to congressional investigation as a result of the agency's mismanagement. However, she found that the appellant failed to allege specific facts which, if proven, would establish that the actions or inactions of his supervisor or the head of OLPA created a substantial risk of significant adverse impact on the agency's ability to accomplish its mission.[6] <span class="Italic">See Embree v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained by the administrative judge in the initial decision, establishing a reasonable belief that one is disclosing a gross waste of funds is a substantial hurdle, as a gross waste of funds constitutes a more than debatable expenditure that is significantly out of proportion to the benefit reasonably expected to accrue to the government. Initial Decision at 13 (citing <span class="Italic">Lane v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 342, &#x00B6; 31 (2010)). Here, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to meet this burden because he failed to make a specific allegation that would rise to more than a debatable difference of opinion regarding the cost of the lease of the office building. In so finding, the administrative judge found that the appellant's claim was a "general statement that the agency would be paying 'hundreds of thousands' of dollars more" for the lease in question than if the agency went with one of the other office locations, whereas the testimony of the then-Logistics Section Chief and the individual who terminated the appellant claimed that the agency's procurement of the lease in question had actually saved the agency millions of dollars. Further, the administrative judge underscored the fact that management's decision to sign the lease was reviewed with all other interested agency branches as well as the General Services Administration contracting office personnel. Therefore, even considering the appellant's claims that three other individuals believed that the procurement of the lease was a "waste of funds," we agree with the administrative judge that this apparent disagreement regarding the cost of the lease does not rise to more than a debatable difference of opinion under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Fisher v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge considered the appellant's arguments that the cost of the press releases was "steep" because most of the 10 OLPA media relations officers were GS-14 and GS-15 employees and that the "productivity of all but one or two media staff was extremely low (i.e., only a few releases produced each couple of months)." The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to provide supporting evidence or argument sufficient to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the 10 employees had low production or that the agency's expenditures for these employees was significantly out of proportion to the benefit for the agency. <span class="Italic">See Embree</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 85 (defining a "gross waste of funds" as a more than debatable expenditure that is significantly out of proportion to the benefit reasonably expected to accrue to the Government). We agree and find that the appellant's general allegation that the OLPA press releases wasted taxpayer money is debatable and unsupported. There is no evidence of how much time was spent and what resources were used to create the press releases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's assertion that he "discussed OLPA-specific statistics showing OLPA's low performance on the [FEVS]" at an OLPA meeting does not meet his jurisdictional burden. The appellant repeats on review that the FEVS reflected poor morale, but again fails to explain why a reasonable person in his position would conclude that the actions of the agency evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of the WPA, gross mismanagement is management action or inaction that creates a substantial risk of significant adverse impact upon the agency's ability to accomplish its mission. It is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> wrongdoing or negligence and does not include management decisions that are merely debatable. It must also include an element of blatancy<span class="Italic">. See Harvey v. Department of the Navy</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 51 &#x00B6; 9 (2002). With these principles in mind, we will examine the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the mid-1980s, the agency began to look for ways to improve the quality of its on-base educational programs. The agency was concerned that these programs were not as rigorous as college campus courses. During the next several years, the agency conducted an agency-wide study of its on-base educational program. These studies identified various problems with the quality of the on-base educational programs, including the educational institutions' commitment to computers and libraries, the amount of required course time, and course duplication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an attempt to address these problems, the agency assembled a team of academicians and ESOs to develop guidelines for the on-base educational programs. By 1991, this team had developed guidelines for on-base educational institutions that it believed addressed the identified problems, and called its recommendations the QES guidelines. While these guidelines were deemed flexible, General Loh, who commanded the agency's Headquarters Tactical Air Command and implemented the QES, wanted firmer standards to be developed, based upon the guidelines. The team then prepared the QES standards that formed the basis of the appellant's complaints, and these standards were implemented in October 1992 and remained in effect until 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The QES standards imposed various requirements on the educational institutions providing services on agency bases, and set forth ways to measure the institutions' compliance with the standards. The requirements pertained to faculty prerequisites, compilation of statistical data monitoring the effectiveness of the on-base educational programs, minimum classroom contact hours, compatible computer systems, mathematical and English placement testing to determine enrollment levels, course duplication, course evaluations to maintain quality, and adequate library resources to support the courses and programs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant first learned of the QES program in 1991, and he knew that it was prepared by a team that included agency employees and an education expert whose ideas "seemed sound" to the appellant. The appellant believed, however, that "administrators" took the program in an unsatisfactory direction, and he filed written criticism of the program in September of 1991. The appellant also learned of the progress of the QES during weekly staff meetings from 1991 through 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From September 1991 through March 1992, the appellant discussed the QES with various educational institutions that were already providing service and discovered that these institutions were also critical of the program. The objections to the QES focused on its duplication of regional accreditation, its expense, and a belief that it was academically unsound. The appellant also faulted both the agency's failure to provide a cost-benefits analysis and the QES's failure to address the financial management of the education system in the manner of the Inspector General audits. The appellant raised these objections to the agency in February 1992, as did various academic institutions, but the agency implemented the QES without addressing the appellant's concerns. Ultimately, the appellant expressed his opinions about the QES during the May 4 and May 5, 1992 meetings that are the subject of this appeal. The record developed on remand further supports our previous conclusion that some of the appellant's concerns were shared by other ESOs and educational institutions. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic">ee White I</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 94-97.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of this evidence under the objective test reveals that a disinterested observer, with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the appellant, could not have reasonably concluded that he was disclosing management action or inaction that created a substantial risk of significant adverse impact upon the agency's ability to accomplish its mission, that was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> wrongdoing or negligence, and included an element of blatancy<span class="Italic">. See White IV</span>, 174 F.3d at 1381; <span class="Italic">Harvey</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 51 &#x00B6; 9. Instead, we find that the appellant disclosed a debatable management decision regarding a policy matter, and that he recognized that the agency had authority to set policy regarding the education program<span class="Italic">. See White IV</span>, 174 F.3d at 1381.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, the record establishes that the agency identified the goal of improving on-base educational services, studied those services, and commissioned a team of agency educational employees and outside educational experts to develop ways of improving the services. The record also establishes that this team solicited and accepted input, and that it ultimately recommended guidelines that agency management converted into the QES standards. Further, on their face, these standards directly relate to the goal of improving the educational services. In conducting our review, we have presumed that the agency officials and employees who identified the goal of improving on-base educational services, conducted the studies, recommended the QES, and then ultimately adopted it, performed those duties correctly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with the law and governing regulations. We find that the appellant has not provided preponderant evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, a disinterested observer in the appellant's position would have known that the agency wanted to improve the quality of on-base education, that it formed a team to study and develop a way of meeting this aim, and that the team included agency educational employees and outside educational experts. A disinterested observer may have well concluded that the QES had shortcomings and that it may not have been the best process for achieving the agency's goal. Indeed, one of the agency officials who worked on the QES project testified that reasonable people disagreed about the QES process, and that some had concerns about the QES, and others did not. Similarly, a deponent for the appellant, who held a doctorate degree in education and worked for the agency's headquarters for Air Education and Training Command, acknowledged that reasonable educational experts could disagree about the QES project. Disclosures concerning reasonable debatable differences about agency policy, however, are not protected under the WPA<span class="Italic">. See Harvey</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 51 &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the administrative judge focused on shared criticism of the QES at the time the agency implemented that program, and changes the agency made to the QES in the years after 1992, that conformed to the previous criticism, to determine that the agency committed gross mismanagement. Evidence that the agency changed the program to conform to the appellant's criticism, as well as criticism by the educational institutions, does not support the conclusion that the appellant reasonably believed the agency committed gross mismanagement when it implemented the program in 1992. The agency's later decisions to change the QES standards only show that subsequent history revealed that the debatable aspects of the QES warranted change, and do not establish that the agency blatantly acted in a wrongful or negligent manner when it originally decided to implement the QES after conducting studies of its educational needs and services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reviewing the party's beliefs regarding the agency's decision to implement the QES, and concluding that the agency's decision to implement the QES does not appear to engender a reasonable belief of gross mismanagement, we recognize that the Board is not an expert <span id="Page_3589"></span>on educational policy, and that we appropriately rely upon testimony and other evidence proffered by those knowledgeable in the subject matter before us<span class="Italic">. See Waksman v. Department of Commerce</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 640, 650-51 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Harris v. Department of Commerce</span>, 878 F.2d 1447 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table). Indeed, the witnesses in this appeal, including the appellant, have extensive experience in education and on-base education. While these witnesses were neither called nor qualified as expert witnesses (<span class="Italic">see Curtin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 846 F.2d 1373, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1988), we must necessarily rely on their subjective views in their areas of expertise since, in remanding the appeal, the court noted that such subjective views have relevance<span class="Italic">. White IV</span>, 174 F.3d at 1381. Upon considering the record, we find no basis for disturbing the administrative judge's conclusion that neither the supporters nor the critics of the QES program were otherwise biased.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon considering all of the testimony and evidence, we find that the record establishes that these experts, including the appellant, disagreed about whether the QES would bring the results the agency intended in developing and implementing it. This disagreement, however, does not show that the agency acted inappropriately in promulgating the QES<span class="Italic">. See White IV</span>, 174 F.3d at 1381. A disinterested observer with this knowledge in the appellant's position therefore could not have reasonably concluded that the agency's decision to implement the QES evidenced gross mismanagement<span class="Italic">. See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "element of blatancy" formulation was rejected by the Federal Circuit, although the exclusion from coverage under the WPA definition of gross mismanagement of debatable issues was confirmed in <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 391 F.3d 1377, 1381-84 (Fed. Cir. 2004), determining that "where a dispute is in the nature of a policy dispute, 'gross mismanagement' requires that a claimed agency error in the adoption of, or continued adherence to, a policy be a matter that is not debatable among reasonable people":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he government argues that criticism of agency policy, as long as that policy is not unlawful or a gross waste of funds, can never be protected under the WPA. Contrary to the government's position we do not think that the WPA includes a blanket exception for policy disputes between the employee and the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mere differences of opinion between an employee and his agency superiors as to the proper approach to a particular problem or the most appropriate course of action do not rise to the level of gross mismanagement. In defining a protected disclosure, Congress in 1989 specifically chose to replace the "mismanagement" standard in the prior law with a more stringent "gross mismanagement" standard. WPA &#x00A7; 4, 103 Stat. at 32 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) (2000)). The statute, as amended, protects an employee who makes "any disclosure of information...which the employee...reasonably believes evidences...gross mismanagement." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). As the Board correctly held in this case, debatable differences of opinion concerning policy matters are not protected disclosures. Rather, for a lawful agency policy to constitute "gross mismanagement," an employee must disclose such serious errors by the agency that a conclusion the agency erred is not debatable among reasonable people.[2] The matter must also be significant. <span class="Italic">See Frederick v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 73 F.3d 349, 353 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;This non-debatable requirement does not, of course, apply to alleged violations of statutes or regulations. In that circumstance, there may be a reasonable belief that a violation has occurred, even though the existence of an actual violation may be debatable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A similar standard was articulated by the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Coons v. Secretary of the Treasury</span>, 383 F.3d 879 (9th Cir. 2004).[3] In <span class="Italic">Coons</span>, the Board found that a disclosure alleging that the Internal Revenue Service "processed a large, fraudulent refund for a wealthy taxpayer" under "highly irregular circumstances" was "normal disagreement between managers over a debatable matter of internal policy." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 890. The Ninth Circuit rejected the Board's position because "Coons's disclosure cannot reasonably be characterized as a 'normal disagreement between managers over a debatable matter of internal policy.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Ninth Circuit held that the actions of the agency, if true as alleged, would be considered "gross mismanagement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Ninth Circuit had jurisdiction because the case involved both a Board appeal and a discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">Coons</span>, 383 F.3d at 884.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the petitioner's contention, this standard hardly means that every agency policy is "debatable" simply because someone must have viewed it as a good idea when it was adopted. Not every policy-maker is necessarily a reasonable person. There may have been broad agreement among reasonable people that a policy was bad even at the time it was adopted; the employee need not establish a universal view that the policy was a mistake. There may also be a question as to whether continuing to keep the policy in place at the time of the employee's disclosure was debatable. Many government policies, desirable or at least debatable at their inception, remain in place as the result of inertia or because those responsible do not wish to admit that the policy is no longer useful. The WPA is designed to protect those employees who call attention to such instances through a disclosure. There is again no requirement that there be a unanimous view that the continuation of the policy is a mistake.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in determining whether there is gross mismanagement, we have held that the employee need only establish that there was gross mismanagement based on the information "known to and readily ascertainable by the employee." <span class="Italic">White IV</span>, 174 F.3d at 1381. If the disclosure of that information indicated that error in adoption or continuation of the policy is not debatable, the disclosure is protected, regardless of whether the agency can marshal other information supporting the policy that the employee could not have reasonably obtained at the time of disclosure. We note in this respect that both sides have relied on reports, either criticizing or praising the QES program, that were issued after May 1992. Such reports are irrelevant except insofar as they reflect other information that was available to the employee at the time of the disclosure. Also, contrary to the Board it is not necessary to show that the gross mismanagement is "blatant." <span class="Italic">White V</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. at 11; <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Nafus v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 386, 394-95 (1993). In summary, we hold that where a dispute is in the nature of a policy dispute, "gross mismanagement" requires that a claimed agency error in the adoption of, or continued adherence to, a policy be a matter that is not debatable among reasonable people.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that the policy in question here, though significant, fell into the debatable category based on the information known to or reasonably ascertainable by the employee at the time of disclosure. These findings are supported by substantial evidence. The Board found that White was reassigned because of "his disclosures on May 4 and 5, 1992." The record is uncontradicted that the reassignment was because the Air Force "lost confidence in [White's] ability to support the Command's Bright Flag Quality Education System." White's criticisms were directed to, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the overall implementation, soundness and cost of the QES program. The Board properly considered whether the QES policy, as a whole, was debatable based on the information reasonably available to White at the time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner bore the burden of establishing that, based upon the information known to and readily available to him at the time, the QES policy was not debatable. Petitioner pointed to three pieces of evidence to support his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, petitioner pointed to the significant number of complaints and threats to leave the QES program by educational institutions. Though White knew of twenty-two letters from thirteen institutions complaining about the QES, and White claims to have heard about even more, there is nothing in the record to demonstrate whether, based on White's knowledge, these complaints reflect a consensus of criticism of the QES or just the views of a minority. Though the record does not reveal the total number of institutions that participated in the QES, the record establishes that there were at least fifty such institutions. The only consensus demonstrated by White's testimony was among "local" institutions. Moreover, the institutions that did complain did not uniformly complain about the QES as a whole; some complained about only selected aspects of the program. Even if White's reasonable knowledge were to be confined to the opinions of educational institutions--and he has not demonstrated this should be so--White has not satisfied his burden of establishing that, based on information reasonably available to him at the time, there was broad agreement among educational institutions that QES was a mistake.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, petitioner pointed to the fact that the QES program was repeatedly revised after his May 1992 disclosure, allegedly because of the protests from other Air Force commands and from educational institutions, and by 1996 had been eliminated. The mere fact that a program was revised and eventually eliminated four years later does not establish that it was a non-debatable mistake at the time of petitioner's disclosure. Indeed, the wisdom of a program may be debatable even at the time it is eliminated. So too the fact that some Air Force commands had objections to the QES program does not establish that it was not debatable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Last, petitioner relied heavily on an Air Force report issued in 1995 criticizing many aspects of the QES program. The report concluded that "the benefits [of QES] are insignificant when compared to the workload and cost increase." It surmises that "[a]s the QES is currently working, there can be little genuine collegial-partnership between the [Air Force] and the [educational institutions]. The present relationship is more contractual requiring demonstration of compliance by the [educational institutions] with the standards." Finally, it laments that the Air Force takes the side of "traditional academics [who] are slow to accept the proposition that education is not a fixed commodity to be delivered in equal rations to all comers," and that the "return to a traditional, compliance-based system as QES places [the Air Force] out of step with current academic trends." This evidence hardly indicates that QES was erroneous beyond debate. And even assuming that all the information contained in the report was <span id="Page_3590"></span>available to White in 1992, the author of the report conceded in her testimony that "there [was] plenty of evidence to show" that "reasonable experts in education could disagree" on the merits of the QES program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, petitioner's counsel conceded at oral argument that reasonable people could have disagreed about the Air Force's QES program and that under the "debatable" standard, petitioner cannot prevail. The Board's conclusion that reasonable people would have found the merits of the QES program debatable at the time of disclosure is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because a disinterested observer with knowledge of all the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by White at the time of his disclosure would have concluded that the merits of the QES program that White criticized were debatable by reasonable people, White could not have a reasonable belief that he disclosed gross mismanagement. For this reason, the decision of the Board is <span class="Italic">AFFIRMED</span>.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">What separates protected disclosures from disagreements over policies? The Board finds it hard to say. A valid whistleblowing claim should not be thrown out by the AJ through the characterization of the whistleblowing as a "difference of opinion" when the appellant is complaining of gross mismanagement. By its very nature, an allegation of whistleblowing presupposes that the whistleblower disagrees with the actions or opinions of some agency officials. The element of opinion is always present in a protected disclosure. The issue is not whether the disclosure is the appellant's opinion, but whether the appellant reasonably believed it to be evidence of prohibited wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">White v.

Dept. of Army</span>, 80 MSPR 311, 315-17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-10 (1998), distinguished protected (specific and substantial) from unprotected (unspecific and unsubstantial) allegations of waste or mismanagement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged that he disclosed "what I considered to be (waste and mismanagement) for purposes not in the best interest of the government," that "management had no concerns related too [sic] our mission, seek only to serve their individual interest and that of their circle," and that he disclosed to the agency's Inspector General (IG) "mismanagement, waste and other wrongful acts related to procurement practices." As the AJ found, these general allegations do not support a finding of a protected disclosure<span class="Italic">. See Sazinski v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 73 MSPR 682, 686 (1997) (revelation of a negligible, remote, or ill-defined peril that does not involve a particular person, place, or thing, is not protected).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also, however, referenced and attached a copy of his "initial contact" with the IG. In this November 14, 1994 document the appellant raised three specific "irregular practices" at the agency. The appellant asserted that: (1) His division started buying fuel "off record" and inventories were out of tolerance and not acceptable to the parties involved; (2) the practice of buying items "off the accountable record" was being applied to stock items such as freon units, which were being bought ten at a time at $300 each, and which were items that "many of the people working in refrigeration can use" in their personal businesses; and (3) the agency's purchase of a $15,000 fuel management system was wasteful because it replaced a seven-year old system that provided all the information the present system was capable of providing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> pleadings are not held to the same standard as those drafted by attorneys in a judicial proceeding<span class="Italic">. Walters v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 MSPR 115, 119 (1994). Thus, although the appellant did not specifically describe the nature of this disclosure in the text of his pleading, the AJ should have addressed the disclosure because the pleading incorporated it by reference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant described his disclosure as alleging "mismanagement, waste and other wrongful acts related to procurement practices." "Gross mismanagement" is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> wrongdoing or negligence. <span class="Italic">Embree v.

It does not include management decisions that are merely debatable, nor does it mean action or inaction which constitutes simple negligence or wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. There must be an element of blatancy. Therefore, gross mismanagement means a management action or inaction that creates a substantial risk of significant adverse impact upon the agency's ability to accomplish its mission. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A "gross waste of funds" is a more than debatable expenditure that is significantly out of proportion to the benefit reasonably expected to accrue to the government. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's first two allegations in his November 14, 1994 disclosure do not constitute nonfrivolous allegations of gross mismanagement or a gross waste of funds. Instead, they appear to take issue with management actions that do not create a substantial risk of significant adverse impact upon the agency's ability to accomplish its mission. Although the appellant specifies that $3,000 worth of freon units were bought at one time, he does not allege that such purchases were wasteful, i.e., significantly out of proportion to the benefits reasonably expected to accrue, nor does he claim that they were in fact being used in employees' personal businesses. We also find that these allegations do not constitute nonfrivolous allegations of a violation of law, rule, or regulation, or an abuse of authority. The appellant has identified no law, rule, or regulation that he believed the agency violated, nor has he identified a Federal official or employee whose arbitrary or capricious exercise of power resulted in personal gain to himself or preferred others. Finally, these allegations do not relate to any substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do find, however, that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that he disclosed information he reasonably believed evidenced a gross waste of funds, i.e., the agency's purchase of the $15,000 fuel management system. The test for whether the appellant had a reasonable belief that his disclosure was protected is an objective one, meaning that he must show that the matter reported was one that a reasonable person in his position would believe evidenced a gross waste of funds. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McCollum v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 75 MSPR 449, 455 (1997). Here, the appellant alleged that he has been responsible for the "areas of concern" disclosed to the IG for the past eight or nine years, and that those areas "are being looked into." The record also indicates that the appellant provided historical and other information relating to the fuel management system to a Captain Talkington on June 26, 1995, and that the appellant's performance evaluations between June 24, 1993 and June 30, 1995 in the GS-7 position of Supply Technician indicate that he "assures the full reports, receipts, and issues are prepared on time," "assures that replenishments of fuel...are prepared monthly," and "perform[s] fuel, petroleum, and industrial gas function to maintain a sufficient quantity on hand preventing work interruptions." <span class="Italic">See Schlosser v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3591"></span>In <span class="Italic">Christopher v. DLA</span>, 44 MSPR 264, 271 (1990), the appellant defended his adverse action by alleging that it resulted in reprisal from his "objection to a single-source contractor" resulting in "savings of perhaps $6,000,000." The Board shrugged off the allegation with the observation that "[t]he appellant has not explained how his objection to 'a single-source contractor' and the alleged resultant savings constituted a disclosure of gross waste inasmuch as such savings indicate that there was, in fact, no actual waste shown." Does this mean that successful whistleblowing does not qualify for protection? Refer to <span class="Italic">Braga v. Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 392 (1992), concluding that "gross mismanagement" included the failure of a manager to respond to the appellant's complaints that the protective clothing that he was directed to design was inadequate to meet requirements of military personnel. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Schwartz v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the appellant alleged sufficient facts to establish a nonfrivolous allegation of gross mismanagement. Gross mismanagement means a management action or inaction which creates a substantial risk of significant adverse impact on the agency's ability to accomplish its mission. It is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> wrongdoing or negligence and does not include management decisions that are merely debatable. <span class="Italic">White v.

Our reviewing court has held, however, that "the WPA does not require that whistleblowers establish gross mismanagement by irrefragable proof."<span class="Italic"> See White v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 391 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Rather, the proper test is whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably conclude that the government's actions evidence gross mismanagement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court further stated that it is not necessary to show, as the administrative judge required here, that the gross mismanagement is blatant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1383. Instead, an employee must disclose such serious errors by the agency that a conclusion that the agency erred is not debatable among reasonable people. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1382.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant has alleged that he reported Schmidt for having failed to request an investigation into large-scale thefts by agency employees after being notified of the possible thefts in July 2000 and for having failed to redeem $90,000 in discount coupons. Under the circumstances described above, and in light of the alleged value of the coupons, it is not debatable among reasonable people that these disclosures allege serious errors by agency management. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boughton v.

The appellant further asserted that, in August or September 2002, Eller informed him that the agency was investigating the appellant for not reporting the thefts earlier. This assertion, if substantiated, could support a finding that the appellant's belief that he was disclosing evidence of gross mismanagement was reasonable.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, we find that the appellant has presented a nonfrivolous allegation that this disclosure is protected. In a letter the appellant sent to both the agency's Inspector General and to Senator Barack Obama, the appellant described alleged improper workload management at an agency facility that was scheduled to close that the appellant claimed were violations of law, gross mismanagement, and gross waste of funds. Specifically, the appellant alleged that, while the agency had scheduled one facility to close and markedly decreased its workload in transition to closing, it continued to schedule and pay a full complement of staff. The appellant further alleged that the unnecessary staff at this facility could have easily been reassigned to another busy facility where the agency improperly employed extra staff that would have otherwise not been needed. These circumstances constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of a gross waste of funds. <span class="Italic">See Van Ee v. Environmental Protection Agency,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 693, 698 (1994) (Gross waste of funds constitutes a more than debatable expenditure that is significantly out of proportion to the benefit reasonably expected to accrue to the government).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegations of gross mismanagement may include agency failures to adhere to its policies or operating procedures. An appellant alleged gross mismanagement when he communicated to a manager his belief that agency scheduling policies were being violated. <span class="Italic">Geyer v. DOJ</span>, 63 MSPR 13, 17-19 (1994), also noted that the appellant's allegations did not lose their protection because the problem was already known to management, a conclusion seemingly at odds with the result in <span class="Italic">Meuwissen v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/2000243234f3d91242">234 F.3d 9</a>, 13 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Under <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, the communications from the appellant did not lose their protection only because the appellant meant the information to be helpful or to provide guidance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find that the subject matter of appellant's disclosures falls within the purview of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). In his May 1990 memorandum, the appellant alleged, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that: (1) Most of the Immigration Inspectors at Logan International Airport were scheduled outside the period of greatest passenger traffic, and (2) although the scheduling system required the hiring of additional personnel and the payment of additional overtime, and although the volume of air traffic had gone up, interceptions of aliens were down. Because the interception of illegal aliens is one of the agency's prime functions, the appellant's communication concerned practices that could possibly evidence "gross mismanagement," <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, a management action or inaction which creates a substantial risk of significant adverse impact upon the agency's ability to accomplish its mission. <span class="Italic">See Nafus</span>, 57 MSPR at 395.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we find that the appellant reasonably believed that the agency practices which he disclosed constituted gross mismanagement. As an Immigration Inspector, the appellant was familiar with the agency's day-to-day operations, and he was therefore in a position to form such a belief. Moreover, the record indicates that the appellant's belief was shared by other, similarly situated Immigration Inspectors. This evidence further supports a finding that the belief was reasonable. As noted above, the actual accuracy of the appellant's belief that he was disclosing gross mismanagement does not affect whether the disclosure is protected. <span class="Italic">See Nafus</span>, 57 MSPR at 397.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the administrative judge relied upon inappropriate factors in determining that the appellant's disclosures were not protected. He first found that the appellant's communications were merely proposals for policy adjustments, that neither the appellant nor agency <span id="Page_3592"></span>management officials viewed them as disclosures of the kind described in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and thus that they did not constitute protected disclosures. However, communications may be protected even if they are only meant to be helpful or to provide guidance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McDaid</span>, 46 MSPR at 421-22 (employee's communications to agency's Inspector General that supervisor was ignoring staff recommendations intended to ensure agency conformity with Federal regulations constituted protected disclosure); <span class="Italic">see also Thompson v. Farm Credit Administration</span>, 51 MSPR 569, 581 (1991) (a communication may be protected, even where it was not intended as a disclosure of waste, fraud, or abuse, if the record as a whole reflects that the agency viewed the employee as a whistleblower). Furthermore, as we have indicated above, the record shows that the appellant reasonably believed the practices he was disclosing constituted gross mismanagement. In addition, even if agency management officials did not regard the disclosures as protected under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), we see no basis for concluding that their failure to recognize the protected nature of the disclosures would affect the disclosures coverage under that section. Such a conclusion would be inconsistent with the reference, in that provision, to "any" disclosure of information that the employee believes evidences gross mismanagement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the administrative judge found that the appellant's disclosures were not protected because he did not include any facts that were unknown to the agency. The Board has found, however, that a communication may be protected even if the disclosure discusses information known throughout the agency. <span class="Italic">See Oliver v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 34 MSPR 465, 469-70 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 847 F.2d 842 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sachdeva v. VA,</span> PH-1221-09-0265-W-1 (NP 4/4/2011), determined that an allegation of gross mismanagement was established by a disclosure of problems in medical procedures followed at a VA hospital and that the disclosure was protected even though the information disclosed was already known to management:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, Chief, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Services at the agency's Philadelphia Medical Center, filed an individual right of action (IRA) appeal on February 16, 2009. She alleged that, in response to an incident that had occurred at the hospital, she sent an e-mail to a subordinate, the Chief Medical Technologist, with copies to various management personnel, directing, effective immediately, the discontinuation of sample collection and testing for certain research until the appropriate approval for the project and the required consent forms were on file. The appellant further alleged that, the next day, she was detailed out of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the nonfrivolous allegations required to establish Board jurisdiction, we note that the determination as to whether such allegations are nonfrivolous must be made based on the written record. <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Department of the Department of the Navy</span>, 327 F.3d 1354, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Based on the written record, we find that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that, in sending the e-mail, she made a protected disclosure because raising the issue of testing being performed at the laboratory without proper approval and consent was a disclosure of information that she reasonably believed evidenced gross mismanagement. We further find that she nonfrivolously alleged that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to detail her out of her position. We conclude, therefore, that the appellant established the Board's jurisdiction over her IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish that she made a protected disclosure, the appellant must show that she disclosed information that she reasonably believed evidenced, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, gross mismanagement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). The proper test for determining whether an employee had a reasonable belief that her disclosure evidenced misconduct under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) is whether a disinterested observer, with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee, could reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidenced wrongdoing as defined by the WPA. <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 296, &#x00B6; 7 (2008). Based on our review of the record, we find that the appellant made the required showing. Gross mismanagement within the meaning of the WPA means more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> wrongdoing or negligence; it means a management action or inaction that creates a substantial risk of significant adverse impact on the agency's ability to accomplish its mission, <span class="Italic">Swanson v. General Services Administration</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 11 (2008), although it does not require an element of blatancy. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, as noted, the appellant sent an e-mail to her subordinate wherein she stated that, effective immediately, sample collection and testing for certain research should be discontinued until the appropriate approval for the project and the required consent forms were on file. The appellant copied the e-mail to the Medical Center Director, the Chief of Staff and his associate, and the Vice President, Research and Development.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that she sent the e-mail because she believed that informed consent documentation was necessary and that she meant to convey that research was occurring without required approval. She further testified that, as an honest and honorable supervisor, she felt that it was her obligation to stop every instance of blood collection that was being done without informed consent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All the witnesses who testified at the hearing were in agreement that this was a serious matter and that supports a finding that the appellant reasonably believed that what happened in the laboratory evidenced gross mismanagement. The Medical Center Director testified that there is a large research program at the Center with substantial funding and grant money which could be jeopardized by incidents such as this one. Moreover, actions taken immediately after the matter came to light reflect that consensus. For example, on July 30, the Medical Center Director ordered the Research Compliance Officer to carry out some fact-finding, posed certain questions to her, and asked her to report back to him by the end of the day. Later that day, a group was convened to discuss what the Compliance Officer had learned, which was that there had been a breach of protocol. Based on the seriousness of the incident, the Center Director told her to notify the Office of Research Oversight that evening, which she did. He also determined that it was appropriate to convene an Administrative Board of Investigation (ABI) to discover the "root cause" of how the incident had occurred and to determine how many veterans were affected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above, we find that the appellant established by preponderant evidence that she made a protected disclosure when she directed that blood collection for certain types of research be stopped until the appropriate documentation was on file because she (the appellant) reasonably believed that the current practice evidenced gross mismanagement on the part of the agency. A disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the appellant could reasonably have believed that this was so. Our finding in this regard is unaffected by the fact that the management officials to whom the appellant copied her e-mail were already aware of the incident by the time she sent the e-mail. <span class="Italic">See Askew v. Department of the Army</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6; 21-22 (2001) (employee made a protected disclosure that agency violated accounting rules even though disclosed information was well known to agency managers; matter was not publicly known, and an individual who communicates wrongdoing that is not concealed or already known may still be protected under the WPA which, as remedial legislation, is to be broadly construed); <span class="Italic">see also Wadhwa v.

Section 2302(b)(9), unlike &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), does not impose a reasonableness standard. Section 2302(b)(9) requires only that the employee's or applicant's disclosures to OSC or to the IG of an agency be made in accordance with applicable provisions of law in order to be protected. <span class="Italic">See SSA v.
