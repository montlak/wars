<p class="noindent">5 CFR 2424.22(a) and (b) (2022), set out earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-12-006.html#sec4-7">Framework for Negotiability Appeals</a>," sets out FLRA's requirements concerning the content and format of the union petition for review of an agency allegation of nonnegotiability. The parties bear the burden of creating a factual record sufficient for FLRA to resolve a negotiability dispute. FLRA is not obligated to conduct an independent factual investigation to secure record proof of either party's claims. The parties should direct FLRA's attention, with as much specificity as possible, to the statutes and regulations relevant to the agency's duty to bargain. Although FLRA may make an independent inquiry, the parties should not expect FLRA <span class="Italic">sua sponte </span>to conduct an analysis. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1167 v. FLRA</span>, 681 F.2d 886, 891 (D.C. Cir. 1982). "A party failing to meet this burden acts at its peril." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3601 and DHHS, Pub. Health Serv., Indian Hosp., Claremont, Okla.</span>, 36 FLRA 224, 226 (1990). <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 1748 and Dept. of Labor, Kansas City</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-48.html">73 FLRA 233</a>, 234 (2022), <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R7-51 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Pub. Works Ctr.</span>, 56 FLRA 941, 941 (2000) ("The Authority has declined to dismiss filings on the basis of minor deficiencies that did not impede the opposing party's ability to respond.").</p>
<p class="noindent">If an agency fails to file a timely statement of position, although it does not forfeit the case, it does itself no service, for FLRA must then rely on whatever there is in the extant record to determine the agency's position and interests. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3172 and DHHS, SSA, Vallejo Dist. Office</span>, 35 FLRA 1276, 1277-78 (1990) ("Our Rules and Regulations do not impose a duty on an agency to reaffirm a previous allegation that a disputed proposal is nonnegotiable. Accordingly, the Authority acts on petitions for review where the agency fails to file, or timely file, a statement of position."). But if the agency position statement addresses only portions of disapproved positions, FLRA will direct the agency to rescind its disapproval of those portions not addressed. <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 954, 954 &#x0026; n.1 (1993) (applying rule to review of interest arbitration award) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 46 FLRA 696 (1992)). FLRA may determine a union proposal is negotiable if the agency position statement fails to cite a section of law, rule, or regulation supporting an allegation of nonnegotiability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC Newington</span>, 53 FLRA 403, 412-13 (1997) (insufficient for agency solely to reference outdated Comptroller General decisions).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA expects a sufficient description of the circumstances concerning negotiability in a statement of position. That more information could be supplied does not make the statement deficient, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Carson</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 191-92 (1993) (concerning a safety provision, Proposal 12):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note our dissenting colleague's position that we have created an appropriate arrangement analysis that is unsupported by the record. Our colleague points out, in this connection, that the record before us does not address certain matters that could inform our consideration of the proposal. Although we do not necessarily agree that information concerning such matters would affect disposition of this case, we agree, of course, that the record does not contain argument regarding them. Indeed, we doubtless could identify, here and in almost all other cases, even more items, with varying relevance, that have not been addressed. However, in our view, the question before us is not whether particular items of information have been provided. Instead, the question is whether the record is sufficient to determine whether the proposal is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement. We believe that it is. In this regard, two of the factors on which our analysis rests--the inherent danger to employees posed by the covered assignments and the benefits accruing to employees from the proposal--are not even disputed by the Agency. Moreover, the Agency's assertion that the proposal would abrogate the Agency's right to assign employees to work in enclosed spaces is refuted by the plain wording of the proposal. Nothing in the proposal, as plainly worded or interpreted by the Union, affects the Agency's right to assign work to be accomplished in enclosed spaces unless those spaces lack natural or mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA may dismiss a negotiability appeal on a proposal because it cannot discern from the record the meaning or impact of the proposal. Although the post-petition conference settles some negotiability disputes and clarifies those that must be adjudicated, if there is one area calling for improvement <span id="Page_440"></span>in FLRA practice, it is the development of union petitions for review, agency statements of position, and union responses to those statements. Some parties' submissions are conclusory. If the function of the submission is considered, the need for its development is evident. The parties' submissions constitute the factual record that FLRA relies on to make a judgment concerning negotiability. If FLRA is recognized for what it is at the point of filing a negotiability appeal--a third party, uninformed as to the practices and organization of the agency and the union--it becomes clear that the submissions should educate FLRA as to the foundation for the proposal--its cause, an estimation of the impact of the proposal--its effect. The submissions should describe the agency, its organization, the organizational components affected by the proposal, the history behind the proposal, the union's need for (or management's need to avoid) the proposal, and the meaning of the proposal--both as to the assumptions underlying the proposal (including related contract provisions or agency practices and directives) and as to the meaning of particular words in the proposal that may not be commonly understood. The submissions should discuss each argument for or against the negotiability of the proposal, with reference to FLRA decisions. The submissions should state whether one party or another desires FLRA to consider severable portions of the proposal separately. Pleadings should be carefully developed through concise writing based upon thorough research. A simplistic or conclusory submission is an invitation to an unsatisfactory FLRA decision. The regulations guide the parties on the structure of negotiability appeals and responses.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA emphasized the need for a proper record in negotiability cases, <span class="Italic">NTEU and PTO</span>, 53 FLRA 539, 603 n.31 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issuance of our decision today brings to 28 the total number of proposals and provisions that we have resolved in this case and in <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce</span>, 52 FLRA 1265. Originally, the Authority was presented with an <span class="Italic">entire</span> collective bargaining agreement that had been disapproved along with 7 proposals that had not been resolved through the bargaining process. In view of the Agency's subsequent withdrawal of its disapproval with regard to a number of provisions, it appears that the Agency recognized that disapproval of the entire agreement was not consonant with section 7114(c)(2) of the Statute, which limits disapprovals to agreements that are not in accordance with laws, rules or regulations. Of the provisions that remained in dispute, only portions of many of them were actually disapproved. Had the parties resolved, or at least narrowed, the number of issues in dispute, this case would have not have required such a significant expenditure of Authority resources.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's resolution of this case also could have been greatly advanced had the parties made a more diligent effort to present an adequate record on which the Authority could rule. Deficiencies in the record required us to solicit input from the parties on several occasions, principally with regard to the meaning of various proposals and provisions, their intended operation, and an identification of which proposals and provisions were actually in dispute. We remind all parties that it is their obligation to provide a sufficient basis on which the Authority can make negotiability rulings.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's Rules and Regulations implementing these statutory provisions require the parties to provide certain information to enable the Authority to make negotiability determinations. Among other things, the Union and the Agency are required to: (1) provide a full and detailed statement of reasons supporting or disagreeing with the allegation of nonnegotiability; (2) explain all terms of art, acronyms, technical language, or any other aspect of the language in the disputed proposal which is not in common usage; and (3) describe the work situation or other particular circumstances so that the Authority will be able to understand the context in which the proposal is intended to apply. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2424.4, 2424.6, and 2424.7.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's entire argument is quoted above. As is apparent from examining the argument, the Agency cites only to the Executive Order and its implementing regulations, the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (Standards of Ethical Conduct).

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency makes only a bare assertion that the proposal conflicts with a Government-wide regulation.

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA v. FLRA</span>, 145 F.3d 1425, 1427-29 (D.C. Cir. 1998), the reviewing court disagreed with FLRA's analysis. The court first recounted the various filings of the parties addressing the negotiability issue, then determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a brief decision dated June 30, 1997 the FLRA ordered the FAA to negotiate the revised proposal, concluding that the FAA's "bare assertion that the proposal conflicts with a Government-wide regulation...does not establish that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain." Reciting that the FAA's supplemental response "cites only to the Executive Order and its implementing regulations, the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch," "does not cite any specific section of either the Executive Order or the regulations in support of its contention that the Union's proposal conflicts with Government-wide regulation" and "does not offer any arguments establishing a basis for its contention," the FLRA asserted the FAA had failed to carry its "burden of creating a record upon which the Authority can make a negotiability determination." To the contrary, we find the argument and supporting authority in the FAA's Supplemental Statement of Position sufficiently places the FAA's negotiability objection before the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act requires a federal agency to negotiate conditions of employment with the recognized exclusive representative of its employees. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7114, 7117; <span class="Italic">see United States Dept of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev. v. FLRA</span>, 964 F.2d 1, 2 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The duty to negotiate exists, however, only "to the extent not inconsistent with any Federal law or any Government-wide rule or regulation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1). In its Supplemental Statement of Position, the FAA stated its argument clearly, if succinctly: "Free air travel for personal use is considered a gift prohibited by the Standards of Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch" and thus "[t]he Union's proposal is contrary to government-wide regulations within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. section 7117(a)(1) and is therefore non-negotiable." While the FAA miscited two of the sources for the anti-gift regulations (citing to Exec. Order No. 12,574 and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 2635.01 instead of to Exec. Order No. 12,674 and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 2635.101 or &#x00A7; 2635.201, respectively) and failed to cite specific subsections within the regulations, its position and authority are easily understood. The regulations on which the FAA relied are neither obscure nor difficult to locate. The FLRA apparently had little trouble identifying not only the specific language prohibiting solicitation or acceptance of gifts but also various provisions creating exceptions to the general prohibition.[3] We are at a loss therefore to understand why the Authority declined to address the argument squarely put before it. It is true that an agency has a duty to "direct the Authority's attention, with as much specificity as possible, to the statutes and regulations relevant to an agency's duty to bargain" and "should not expect the Authority, <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, to locate, analyze and apply all arguably pertinent regulations from the myriad of federal regulations governing the numerous federal agencies within the Authority's jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">National Fed'n of Fed. Employees, Local 1167 v. FLRA</span>, 681 F.2d 886, 891 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 2424.6(a)(2). [Footnote omitted.] But when the agency, as here, has borne its burden and squarely presented an argument to the FLRA, the Authority cannot shirk its own duty to decide the issue before it.[5] <span class="Italic">Cf. Department of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 762 F.2d 1119, 1122 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (concluding that conflict-with-government-wide-regulation issue "was presented to the Authority with sufficient clarity to make it proper for consideration on review," in spite of agency's failure to cite conflicting regulation where regulation was "well known" and not "obscure, technical provision of civil service law"). Moreover, if the FLRA found the FAA's submission too oblique for resolution, it should at least have requested additional briefing from the FAA, <span class="Italic">cf.</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 2424.8, or held a hearing, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 2424.9, to probe the matter further rather than simply refuse to address the argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;We do not endorse the suggestion, implicit in footnote 2 of the FLRA decision, that an agency bears the burden not only of making its own case but also of anticipatorily rebutting all possible counterarguments.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Even when the agency falters, "the Authority plainly is not foreclosed from making an independent inquiry into the law relevant to each agency's exercise of management rights." <span class="Italic">National Fed'n of Fed. Employees</span>, 681 F.2d at 891. The FLRA seems to have undertaken just such an inquiry here with regard to possible exceptions to the anti-gift rule.</p>
