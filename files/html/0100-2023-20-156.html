<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-148"><span class="space">18.</span> Defamatory Statement; Tort; Arrest; False Allegation; Blacklisting</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">A claim of falsification of information in personnel actions was not a personnel action covered by the WPA. <span class="Italic">Santillan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 53 MSPR 487, 492 n.5 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Kochanoff v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 54 MSPR 517, 520 (1992) (false evaluation of an appellant's qualifications for promotion, unlike a performance appraisal under Chapter 43, was not a personnel action). Although the analysis could be different through more recent decisions involve IRA hostile environment allegations,<span class="Italic">Newby v. EPA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 97-3156), agreed with the Board's analysis in an appeal involving IRA allegations challenging, among other practices, "loud, unprofessional, public verbal criticisms in [the] work place":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Paul v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 66 MSPR 643 (1995), the Board concluded that acts of defamation and interference with employment relations were not personnel actions under the WPA. In so holding, the Board rejected the assertion that "any order or action made in reprisal for whistleblowing is appealable in an IRA action, even if it does not fall within the actions specified in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302 (a)(2)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 649<span class="Italic">. See also Godfrey v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 298, 303 (1990) (personnel actions are concrete matters that are taken or done by an agency and that can be reviewed, and undone, by the Board). We agree with the Board that the alleged matters which formed the basis for Mr. Newby's complaint of intolerable working conditions were not "personnel actions" within the meaning of the WPA.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In 1994, Congress amended the WPA by expanding the list of prohibited personnel practices to include "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." <span class="Italic">See</span> Act of October 29, 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 5(a)(2), 108 Stat. 4361, 4363 (codified at 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi) (1994)). In <span class="Italic">Caddell v</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Justice</span>, 96 F.3d 1367, 1370-71 (Fed. Cir. 1996), we held that these amendments apply only to conduct that occurs on or after October 29, 1994. Because the agency actions about which Mr. Newby complains occurred prior to that date, the 1994 amendments do not apply to his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee's arrest and treatment under arrest was not a covered personnel action, even though it was alleged that the arrest was to punish the appellant for protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Weber v. GSA</span>, 54 MSPR 444 (1992). With the caution again that more recent decisions involve hostile environment allegations might result in a different analysis, allegations that an agency committed various tortious acts, including defamation, interference with appellant's employment relations with the agency, placing him in a false light, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, are not covered by the Board's IRA jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Schlosser v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 75 MSPR 15, 22 (1997) (agency official's circulation of defamatory material was not a personnel action under WPA); <span class="Italic">Paul v. USDA</span>, 66 MSPR 643, 650 (1995). Nor do statutorily covered personnel actions include transmittals to appellant (notifying him of a detail) in a manner that the appellant alleged to be objectionable. <span class="Italic">Gores v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 100, 120 (1995). Covered personnel actions did not include allegations that the appellant received threatening phone calls, that his supervisor shouted at him in front of his coworkers to find another job, or that he was under increasing pressure to leave. <span class="Italic">Shivaee v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 74 MSPR 383, 387 (1997) (also: "physical pain and emotional stress" were not covered personnel actions). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel <span id="Page_3915"></span>v. Costello</span>, 75 MSPR 562 (1997) (OSC disciplinary case based on reprisal against an employee who reported that a supervisor violated the agency regulations prohibiting profanity and abused his authority by demeaning subordinates), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Costello v. MSPB</span>, 182 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although not raised in an IRA case, the Board did not rule out in <span class="Italic">Brownscombe v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 382, 387 (1988), an annuity appeal, the possibility that an agency might commit a prohibited personnel practice by providing incorrect information about an employee with the effect of denying him a benefit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the employing agency retaliated against him for his allegations of misuse of computer software by refusing to state on OPM's disability retirement forms that he had a service deficiency. Since the record does not otherwise show a service deficiency, however, the appellant did not establish a basis for his allegation that information about his whistleblowing activities was relevant to his disability retirement case. Thus, the administrative judge did not err in disallowing evidence of alleged retaliation for whistleblowing by the employing agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mattil v. Dept. of State</span>, 118 MSPR 662, 673-74 &#x00B6; 23, 2012 MSPB 127 (2012), determined that blacklisting could form a personnel action in an IRA case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that the administrative judge found that the appellant's claim that the agency "blacklisted" him from employment opportunities is not a personnel action and that, even if it were, the appellant did not exhaust his remedies with OSC with respect to this claim. Although "blacklisting" <span class="Italic">per se</span> is not an enumerated personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A), construed broadly, it could constitute a failure to appoint, which would be properly before the Board in an IRA appeal if the appellant identifies particular employment opportunities that the agency denied as part of the alleged "blacklisting." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(i), 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Dept. of Labor</span>, AT-3443-13-7178-I-1 (NP 11/21/2014) ("It is well-established that an appointment to a position may be conditioned upon the completion of a background investigation and that information discovered in the course of that investigation may be the basis for the cancellation of an appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Social Security Administration</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 128 (2012); 5 C.F.R. Parts 731, 736. However, this appeal involves more than a merely hypothetical effect from the dissemination of derogatory information. Taking the appellant's assertions as true, the allegedly negative information clearly represented a direct and credible threat to the appellant's conditional DHS appointment. This threat was not speculative, but rather, was comparable to the allegation of 'blacklisting' deemed actionable in <span class="Italic">Mattil</span>, involving specific actions by an agency official to prevent the appellant's employment in a particular position, and, therefore, could constitute a personnel action within the meaning of the WPA.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mattil</span> was distinguished by <span class="Italic">Gomez v. USDA</span>, DE-1221-13-0021-W-1 (NP 7/14/2014) (Vice Chairman Wagner dissenting), when no specific employment opportunity was identified as being threatened by incorrect, derogatory comments made by an official of the appellant's former employer to OPM--comments in turn made available to the appellant's successor employer, but without impact on his job:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the agency's actions constitute a covered personnel action because they were threats to harm his status before SBA. While the operative statute does preclude an agency from taking or failing to take, or threatening to take or fail to take a personnel action against an employee or applicant because of whistleblowing activities, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), any such threat must involve a personnel action. "Personnel action" is clearly defined at &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A) to mean any of twelve specific actions, and the one upon which the appellant relies is "any other significant change of duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii). However, his argument that OPM's INV Form 41 is an official and permanent document from which the SBA official's memorandum flows does not compel a finding that either or both of these actions had any bearing on his duties, responsibilities, or working conditions, reflected a significant change in them, or otherwise constitute a covered personnel action. <span class="Italic">Cf. Schlosser v. Department of the Interior</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 15, 22 (1997) (agency official's alleged circulation of defamatory material regarding the appellant does not constitute a covered personnel action). As such, even if the agency's actions could be construed as a threat to harm his status at SBA, they did not threaten a covered personnel action, and are, without more, too distant from the possibility of an actual covered personnel action to be considered a threat under the WPA.[6] <span class="Italic">See Daniels v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6; 8 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;In her dissent, the Vice Chairman has found the actions of the appellant's second-line supervisor to be the equivalent of an allegation of "blacklisting" as addressed in <span class="Italic">Mattil v. Department of State</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 23 (2012). There the Board concluded that such a claim would properly be before the Board if the appellant identified particular employment opportunities that the agency denied as part of the alleged "blacklisting." That issue was to be addressed on remand. Unlike in <span class="Italic">Mattil</span>, the appellant here has identified no harm. The agency corrected the second-line supervisor's inaccurate information and, as noted above, the appellant remains employed at the SBA. The appellant's allegations of threatened harm are thus speculative at best, a fact not acknowledged by the dissent. Furthermore, we note that, in the event that the appellant does suffer a personnel action which he might attribute to an alleged protected disclosure, he is not precluded from filing a future complaint regarding that matter and relying on this decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find unavailing the appellant's claim that OPM's INV Form 41 is a personnel action because it is similar to a performance evaluation. Even if it were, and we make no such finding, the statute's list of covered personnel actions does not include any and all evaluations, but only performance evaluations "under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ix). <span class="Italic">Cf. Kochanoff v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 517, 520 (1992) (administrative judge correctly found that the alleged false evaluation of the appellant's qualifications for promotion does not constitute a covered personnel action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding that the Board is required to construe the terms of the WPA broadly, <span class="Italic">see Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 9 (2010), we find that the appellant failed to establish the Board's jurisdiction over this appeal and that the administrative judge properly dismissed it on that basis.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to show that he was subjected to a personnel action. At this stage of the proceeding, in order to establish the Board's jurisdiction, the appellant was required only to make a nonfrivolous allegation that he was subjected to a personnel action. As explained in this Order, we find that he failed to do so and that the administrative judge statement did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Vice Chairman Wagner dissented, arguing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the majority notes that the circulation of derogatory information does not constitute a covered personnel action, citing <span class="Italic">Schlosser v. Department of the Interior</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 15, 22 (1997). The majority further finds that, even if the agency's dissemination of the derogatory information constituted a threat to the appellant's status at SBA, it did not threaten a covered personnel action and, without more, was too distant from the possibility of a covered personnel action to be considered a threat under the WPA. I disagree. It is well established that an appointment to a position may be conditioned upon the completion of a suitability investigation and that a negative suitability determination may be the basis for the cancellation of an appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. part 731; <span class="Italic">Hudlin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 61, &#x00B6; 9 (2012). Thus, this appeal involves more than a merely hypothetical effect from the dissemination of derogatory information. The false and negative report of the appellant's employment history at APHIS clearly represented a direct and credible threat[*] to his SBA appointment. The threat was not speculative, but rather, was comparable to the allegation of "blacklisting" in <span class="Italic">Mattil</span>, where an agency official has allegedly taken specific actions to prevent the appellant's employment in a particular position. In addition, I would further find that OPM's retention of the false information in its investigative file constitutes a covered personnel action because of the likelihood that it will threaten the appellant's opportunity for other federal appointments requiring a background investigation. Accordingly, I would find that the appellant met his jurisdictional burden of making a nonfrivolous allegation that the APHIS supervisor's provision of false and derogatory information in a suitability investigation constituted a threatened personnel action under the WPA and would remand this appeal for adjudication on the merits of his whistleblower retaliation claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;Indeed, the appellant appears to have plainly understood that the false report threatened his SBA appointment as reflected in his retention of legal counsel to rebut the allegations.</p>
