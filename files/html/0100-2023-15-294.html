<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-292"><span class="space">a.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Ad Hoc</span></span> Measure</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an agency need not use formal performance standards under Chapter 43 to take adverse action under Chapter 75 against a poor performer, there must still be some reasonable basis for measurement of performance deficiencies. The burden of proof in a Chapter 75 performance-related removal action includes a showing by the agency that the job performance standards applied are based on criteria permitting accurate measurement of performance. Unlike performance appraisal systems established under 5 USC 4302, measurement of performance under Chapter 75 will frequently be <span class="Italic">ad</span> <span class="Italic">hoc</span>; however, an accurate means of assessment must be developed. <span class="Italic">Glover v. DHHS</span>, 24 MSPR 636, 638 (1984) (following <span class="Italic">Wellman v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 10 MSPR 591, 594-96 (1982) ("[T]he agency's burden of proof in a Chapter 75 removal action includes a showing by the agency that the job performance standards applied to the employee being removed are based on criteria which permit accurate measurement of job performance.")); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Backer v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DE-0752-12-0315-I-1 (NP 7/1/2014) ("When an agency takes a performance-based adverse action under chapter 75, the agency must prove that the standards against which an employee's performance is measured are reasonable and provide for an accurate measurement of the employee's performance. <span class="Italic">Shorey v. Department of the Army</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 239, 244 (1998)."); <span class="Italic">Gellerman v. VA</span>, 12 MSPR 200, 202 (1982) (it was sufficient to use the evaluation system and manual that was used by the agency for many years to evaluate psychologists); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Wills v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 90, 93 &#x00B6; 6 (1999) (intent is not element of charge of unsatisfactory performance), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Langham v. USPS</span>, 92 MSPR 268, 272 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 8 (2002) (intent need not be proved when charge was that appellant was "either unable or unwilling to meet" requirements of position). [Refer to Chapter 9, "<a href="0100-2023-16-076.html#sec9-75">Chapter 43 and 75 Actions Distinguished</a>," for more discussion of the <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> case and the relationship of Chapter 75 and Chapter 43 actions.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Wellman v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 10 MSPR 591, 595-97 (1982), it was insufficient to apply standards to an appellant that were developed by one supervisor based on his general assessment from memory of the productivity of prior incumbents in the appellant's position. No supporting data from actual productivity records was considered in arriving at those standards:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an agency may proceed with a removal based on unacceptable or inadequate performance using the standards and procedures of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris,</span> 1 MSPB 199 (1980). The Board here holds that the burden of proof in a Chapter 75 removal action includes a showing by the agency that the job performance standards applied to the employee being removed are based on criteria which permit accurate measurement of job performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2836"></span>The agency may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case in a Chapter 75 removal action for inadequate performance by proving the standards against which the employee was measured and the employee's failure to meet those standards. If the employee does not challenge the standards, the agency's initial evidence may suffice to meet the agency's burden of persuasion on its decision to remove. Once the agency makes out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence shifts to the employee, but the ultimate burden of persuasion, to prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence, never shifts from the agency. <span class="Italic">See Losure v. Interstate Commerce Commission,</span> 2 MSPB 361 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant action, the agency, at the hearing, responding to appellant's challenge to the standards which applied to her, explained how it developed the performance standards:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Q.&#x2003;(By Mr. Mott) Were the performance standards expected of Ms. Wellman set forth in this 90-day warning letter:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A.&#x2003;(By Mr. Burns) Yes, they were.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Q.&#x2003;Could you briefly summarize how you arrived at those standards?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A.&#x2003;Yes. I have been at the Training Center for ten years as an instructor and assistant director and have people in that position typing lesson plans, work-sheets, note guides, letters, for that ten years and there were five to six people serving in that position during that ten year period. Based on previous experience with those people, I arrived at what seemed to me, error rates that I could accept as being of average efficiency and then liberalized them somewhat. Feeling that they should be targets that Ms. Wellman could reach and certainly if she could reach those we could bring her up to a very professional type.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency presented no other evidence on this point. On cross examination, appellant's attorney and Mr. Burns had the following exchange:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Q.&#x2003;"As far as an overall average, do you have some objective standards that you have documented?"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A.&#x2003;"No."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The definition of accurate measurement criteria is a factual question. The Board recognizes that unlike performance appraisal systems established pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, the measurement of performance in actions brought under Chapter 75 will frequently be <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> in nature. However, in the instant case the standards applied to appellant were developed by one supervisor based solely on his general assessment from memory of the productivity of prior incumbents of appellant's position. No supporting data from the actual productivity records of those employees was considered in 800 arriving at the standards. We cannot conclude that in this case the standards permitted measurement of appellant's performance in a manner sufficient to establish that appellant was in fact performing inadequately. The agency thus has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the action taken was for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">More objective standards were employed in a Chapter 75 action, although the agency did not establish that a clerk typist failed to meet them, <span class="Italic">Glover v. DHHS</span>, 24 MSPR 636, 638-40 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the charge of unacceptable performance the presiding official stated that "it must be shown that the charges and specifications set forth in the notice of proposed removal are sustained, and that the agency's action based on the sustained charges promotes the efficiency of the service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a)." The presiding official did not apply the agency's performance standards to the sustained specifications and thus the initial decision is in error. In <span class="Italic">Wellman v. United States Department of Commerce,</span> 9 MSPB 798, 799-800, 10 M.S.P.R. 591, 594-96 (1982), we held that the agency's burden of proof in a Chapter 75 removal action includes a showing by the agency that the job performance standards applied to the employee being removed are based on criteria which permit accurate measurement of job performance. The agency relying upon <span class="Italic">Hatcher v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 705 F.2d 1309 (11th Cir. 1983), asserts that substandard performance is a proper basis for removal under Chapter 75. This does not alter our holding in <span class="Italic">Wellman, supra,</span> that performance deficiencies must be measured against performance standards to determine if performance is substandard. <span class="Italic">See Hoffman v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 20 M.S.P.R. 345 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The unacceptable performance charge was labeled by the agency as "unacceptable quality and quantity of work." The presiding official did not sustain that portion of the charge relating to the quantity of the appellant's work because the agency presented no evidence to support it. Appellant's supervisor testified that it was possible appellant typed 800 documents during the twelve month period that he assessed the appellant's performance. The agency presented six travel vouchers to support this specification. The presiding official declined to consider three of the six vouchers because they had in part formed the basis for a reprimand issued to the appellant on June 15, 1982. We find no error in this regard. <span class="Italic">See Adamek v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 11 MSPB 482, 13 M.S.P.R. 224 (1982). The presiding official found that the remaining three vouchers show omissions, incorrect dates, and errors in per diem rates and itineraries. Additionally, the appellant's supervisor testified that travel vouchers were frequently returned because of miscalculations and missing documents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official did not sustain specifications (b) and (c). The agency did not file a timely petition for review concerning these specifications and does not contest the propriety of the presiding official's factual findings concerning these specifications. Specification (d) asserted that the material typed by the appellant frequently contained typographical and/or spelling errors. The agency submitted seven documents in support of this specification. The documents reflect errors in spacing, capitalization, spelling, format and punctuation. The appellant argued below that her errors were <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> in view of her typing volume and that her errors did not render her performance unacceptable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Performance standards for the appellant's position appear at Tab 7 of the agency's response and read in pertinent part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">With regard to Element No. 1, your work must be accurate, neat, and meet established guidelines most of the time. We would feel that this implies that there would be no more than one grammatical error or typing error for every three pages of typewritten documents. If either the originating staff, other staff, or your supervisor become aware of a higher error rate, this would be considered unsatisfactory in terms of this Plan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Since a large portion of your work presently consists of preparation of travel documents, it is important that these documents contain calculations which are free of errors. In addition to the error rate as mentioned above, we would feel that travel vouchers and other documents requiring calculations and numerical entries would contain no more than one error for every three travel vouchers or travel documents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petition for review asserts that the appellant's accuracy rate was 98.75% (i.e., 10 errors divided by 800 documents) and that this evidence cannot support the agency's assertions that travel vouchers were often returned due to errors and that the appellant's typing frequently contained errors. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The preponderance of the evidence does not support the charge that the appellant's performance was unacceptable. Accordingly, specifications (a) and (d) of the advance notice cannot be sustained. We, therefore, substitute our finding for the presiding official's finding regarding specifications (a) and (d). <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Department of the Navy,</span> 2 MSPB 297, 2 M.S.P.R. 129 (1980) (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982). Accordingly, the unacceptable performance charge is not sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Relatively objective standards were used in an adverse action involving a GS-5 benefits authorizer trainee, <span class="Italic">Huffman v. DHHS</span>, 20 MSPR 345, 346-348 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated April 21, 1981, appellant was advised that his work was unsatisfactory and numeric standards were set, which required that his daily case output be between 12-18 cases per day, that his overall accuracy rate be 86-92%, and his payment accuracy rate be 90-96%. Prior to appellant being issued this letter, Trainee Progress Reports were prepared and interviews were held with appellant in an attempt to improve his performance. The agency continued to apprise appellant of his performance deficiency until his removal was proposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that an agency may remove an employee based on unacceptable or inadequate performance using the standards and procedures of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75 <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris,</span> 1 MSPB 199 (1980). The Board has further held that in a removal action taken under Chapter 75 for performance based reasons, the agency must establish that the standards evaluating an appellant's performance were reasonable, <span class="Italic">Bridges v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 6 MSPB 194, 195 (1981), and that the standards must afford an accurate measurement of performance. <span class="Italic">Wellman v. Department of Commerce,</span> MSPB Docket No. SL075209070 at 3-4 (March 23, 1982). In the instant case, we find that the agency had established that the performance standards were both reasonable and provided for accurate measurement of appellant's performance. Thus, we find that the presiding official erred in concluding that the agency had not established by preponderant evidence that appellant's work was substandard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official correctly found that the standards provided for accurate measurement of appellant's performance. However, she erroneously found that the standards were unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining that the standards were unreasonable, the presiding official compared the standards set for appellant and those established by the agency in its implemented performance appraisal system. We find that it was proper to compare the two standards in order to make the determination of the reasonableness of those applied to appellant. However, in our view, based upon a comparison of the standards, we find that those applied to appellant were reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2837"></span>Under the standards set for appellant, his required case output was 12-18 cases per day, whereas under the performance appraisal system he would have been required to complete 16-18 cases per day. Thus, we cannot find that this standard was unreasonable. Contrary to the presiding official's finding, the performance appraisal system does have a numeric measurement for overall accuracy. It required 83-86% accuracy of reviewed cases. Under the standard set for appellant overall accuracy was set at 86-92%. Although the standard set for appellant is slightly higher than that set in the performance appraisal system, we, nonetheless, do not find the standard for appellant to be unreasonable. Moreover, appellant's overall accuracy rate never reached the lower percentage rate set in the performance appraisal system. Even though the performance appraisal system does not have a standard which would measure payment accuracy, we cannot conclude that the standard set for appellant was unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the agency's assertion that it correctly measured appellant's performance under the standards set for him and not those established in the performance appraisal system. When the agency first recognized that appellant's performance was deficient, it had not implemented its performance appraisal system. Thus, the agency could establish <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> standards and proposed to remove appellant for failure to meet those standards. <span class="Italic">Wells, supra.</span> There is no rule, law, or regulation which would require the agency to wait until it had implemented its performance appraisal system before it could remove an employee for failure to meet performance standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we find that the removal action will promote the efficiency of the service, and constitutes an appropriate penalty in these circumstances. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 MSPB 313 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> the Chapter 75 standards were more demanding than the Chapter 43 standards used for the employee's performance appraisal. That result might have been unsustainable under <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">post</span>, calling for Chapter 75 standards employed in adverse actions that do not exceed Chapter 43 standards.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Greater deference may be given to a management decision to separate a high-level employee for poor performance because the executive-level employee's performance may be more difficult to quantify under objective standards. The Claims Court explained in <span class="Italic">Hoppe v. United States</span>, 136 Ct. Cl. 559, 564 (1957), involving removal of an IRS Assistant Commissioner:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This was a job at a very high level; the duties were of an executive nature requiring much ingenuity and creative judgment. What constitutes competence in this context is much more a matter of conjecture than in jobs more routine in nature. In a position of this consequence a wide discretion should be given responsible officials as to causes for removal that will promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">McGillivray v. FEMA</span>, 58 MSPR 398, 402-04 (1993), a contract specialist was removed after his contracting warrant was revoked. Analysis focused on the reasonableness of the revocation, an analysis that required examination of the alleged performance deficiencies leading to the revocation. Performance standards should have been considered to determine the severity of the errors charged to the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency did not err in choosing to bring the action under 5 USC Chapter 75. Contrary to the implication throughout the appellant's petition, it is within an agency's discretion to take a performance-based action under Chapter 75 rather than Chapter 43. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 843 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 475 U.S. 1111, 106 S. Ct. 1523, 89 L. Ed.2d 921 (1986). However, even if an agency chooses to proceed under Chapter 75, it may not circumvent Chapter 43 procedures by charging that an employee should have performed better than his performance standards required. Specifically, if the subject of an agency's charge is covered by a performance standard of the appellant's position, the agency may not impose a different standard in taking a Chapter 75 action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Bowling v. Department of the Army</span>, 47 MSPR 379, 381 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the charge in this case, revocation of procurement authority, was performance-based, and that the Board has authority to consider the underlying reasons for the revocation. The revocation resulted from performance deficiencies revealed by the Office's review of Region VIII. Thus, the substance of the charge might be covered by a performance standard of the appellant's position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bowling v. Department of the Army</span>, 40 MSPR 348, 352 n.2 (1989). Moreover, the charge did not involve issues of national security, and the same agency that revoked the appellant's warrant removed him. Therefore, this case is different from those in which the Board has found that it lacks authority to review security clearance determinations or military selection processes, or actions of agencies over which it lacks jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Siegert v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 MSPR 684, 686-91 (1988).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Lovato v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 48 MSPR 198, 200-01 (1991) (an appellant charged with "failure to carry out assigned duties in a reasonable period of time, tardiness, and unauthorized absence (AWOL)" was not charged with unacceptable performance, and the evidence did not show that the agency attempted to circumvent requirements set forth in 5 USC Chapter 43 by bringing the action under 5 USC Chapter 75).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge simply found that "the appellant was provided with <span class="Italic">a standard</span> against which his performance could be measured." Specifically, he cited the government-wide procurement regulations as "the prime standard" under which the appellant worked. In addition, he stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Other factors in his job also informed him of the standard expected. He did have performance standards and an official position description. Perhaps more significantly, he had the results of the 1988 onsite review which specifically outlined the errors that his office had committed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In making these findings, the administrative judge implied that the agency was not required to use the standards set forth in the appellant's performance appraisal plan to evaluate his performance. However, the decisions that the administrative judge cited, <span class="Italic">Graham v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 46 MSPR 227 (1990), and <span class="Italic">Wellman v. Department of Commerce</span>, 9 MSPB 798, 10 MSPR 591 (1982), involved employees who did not have established performance standards under Chapter 43. Thus, the issue of whether the agency was circumventing Chapter 43 requirements was not present in those cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is not clear what the appellant's performance standards were prior to the revocation of his procurement authority....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, it is not entirely clear whether the deciding official considered only the revocation of the appellant's procurement authority in sustaining the charge. Although he testified that his decision was based on the appellant's loss of his contracting warrant, he also testified to the effect that the appellant could not perform as a Contract Specialist because of the deficiencies listed in the Office's report. Thus, he suggested that he considered the appellant's overall performance, in addition to his loss of procurement authority, in making his decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will not sustain a performance-based action taken under Chapter 75 if the agency fails to show that the appellant's performance did not meet an applicable performance standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bowling</span>, 47 MSPR at 382. Accordingly, we find it necessary to remand this case for a new initial decision. On remand, the administrative judge should allow the parties to present additional evidence and testimony concerning the performance standards that were in effect for the appellant prior to the revocation of his procurement authority. The administrative judge should determine whether the agency's charge was governed by a performance standard of the appellant's position, and if so, should evaluate the appellant's performance under that standard before deciding whether the agency proved the charge by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Madison v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 48 MSPR 234, 238 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ incorrectly rejected evidence in a Chapter 75 action that tended to demonstrate that the employee failed to meet <span class="Italic">ad</span> <span class="Italic">hoc</span> standards developed by an agency as part of the employee's performance improvement period. A performance action under Chapter 75 need not track the formal standards set forth in a performance appraisal system, but may rely instead upon <span class="Italic">ad</span> <span class="Italic">hoc</span> standards, as long as the standards are based on criteria permitting accurate performance measurement. <span class="Italic">Cowins v. VA</span>, 64 MSPR 551, 556-57 (1994) (<span class="Italic">ad</span> <span class="Italic">hoc</span> standards must still be provided to the employee in a fashion that explains what is required and when it is required; the employee may defend against the action by demonstrating that he was prevented from performing the assigned work by factors outside his control, e.g., that during his employment he was denied assistance that materialized after his departure).</p>
