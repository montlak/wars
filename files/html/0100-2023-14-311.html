<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-312"><span class="space">3.</span> Prior Consideration of Inside Candidates; Justification for Nonselection</h4>
<p class="noindent">One negotiability struggle centered on the ability of the union to negotiate proposals requiring management first to consider (and rule out) unit employees for positions before candidates from other groups are considered. The D.C. Circuit entered the priority consideration deliberations in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, BATF v. FLRA</span>, 857 F.2d 819, 821-22 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The court <span id="page_860"></span>considered the following proposal, determined to be negotiable by FLRA in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, BATF</span>, 26 FLRA 497, 500 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree that agency employees should receive first consideration for all actions...[promotions], except in an emergency or in those instances where there is no employee within the region at a grade level lower than the level specified on the vacancy announcement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First consideration requires that a vacancy be available to agency employees and that they be ranked and considered for selection before any non-ATF applicants are solicited, ranked or considered for selection.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court reversed FLRA's determination of negotiability, 857 F.2d at 820-23:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In a two-to-one decision, the Authority held that the proposal is consistent with the merit system and, also, that the proposal is procedural (and thus negotiable) because at most, it would merely result in a delay in management's exercise of its right to choose employees.... The FLRA did not discuss the proposal at length but simply referred to what it described as its "virtually identical" decision in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 24 F.L.R.A. 494 (1986), <span class="Italic">enforced</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 837 F.2d 1163 (D.C. Cir. 1988).... [T]he FLRA had held that management must negotiate over a proposal providing that management may not consider non-bargaining unit candidates for promotion until ten days after first considering candidates from within the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its deliberations, the FLRA did not consider whether the union's proposal would "directly interfere" with management's right to select employees from any appropriate source but, instead, determined that the proposal is negotiable as a purely procedural limitation that would not prevent the agency from "acting at all."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "acting-at-all"/"directly interfere" tests, however, do not exist in a theoretical vacuum. The guidance provided in <span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span> [659 F.2d 1140] must be assessed not only in terms of the specific requirements a particular proposal would impose on management in the exercise of its protected rights, but on the circumstances which in real life allow it to exercise them. When a proposal stipulates procedures that so affect the environment within which an agency is allowed to act that it places the equivalent of a substantive restraint on its ability to act, that proposal has forfeited its claim to procedural purely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA argues, in this case, that it correctly classified the proposal as purely procedural because the proposal leaves the ultimate hiring decision to management and does not outline particular criteria by which management must evaluate applicants. We think the FLRA misjudged the impact of the union proposal and, as a result, mistakenly classified it as a procedural proposal subject to the "acting-at-all" standard. To be sure, we have persistently held that proposals do not forfeit their procedural status simply by delaying the exercise of a management right.... But the practical implications of the proposal at issue in this case go beyond mere delay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he effect of the proposal at issue in this case is to delay only <span class="Italic">part</span> of the employment process; and it is this asymmetrical impact that would directly interfere with management's ability to exercise the substantive rights guaranteed it by Congress. By delaying only one part of the hiring process, the proposal inhibits management's ability to look beyond the agency for potential employees, and it would be naive to believe it had any other purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The practical consequence of the proposal is clear: management may not consider or even solicit applications from outside the agency until it has finished ranking and considering eligible agency applications. As a result, the agency will make its initial employment decisions before it is permitted to inform itself of the qualifications of the full range of potential candidates for the position it seeks to fill. Thus the effect of the proposal is to narrow the universe of candidates that section 7106(a)(2)(C) is intended to guarantee management the right to consider.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While it is true that the proposal does not prevent management from ultimately considering candidates from beyond the agency...it would create pressure on even the most careful managers to promote a reasonably competent agency employee rather than leave a position unfilled during the time it would take to initiate and complete a late-starting search for a more qualified outside candidate. This result is inconsistent not only with section 7106(a)(2)(C), but also with the Act's larger goal of promoting "an effective and efficient Government."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that our decision is fully consistent with our earlier consideration of <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the case on which the FLRA based its decision. In <span class="Italic">Department of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 837 F.2d 1163 (D.C. Cir. 1988), we upheld the FLRA's determination that the union proposal giving bargaining unit applicants a ten-day head start in the hiring process did not contravene merit system principles. The litigants, however, did not ask us to consider what we then described as the "more difficult question" of whether the ten-day delay would impair management's right to select employees from any appropriate source.... Furthermore, the proposal in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> was significantly different from the one currently at issue because it did not prevent management from soliciting outside applicants during the ten-day waiting period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA unreasonably concluded that the union's proposal was a purely procedural proposal subject to mandatory negotiation. If enacted, the proposal would constitute a direct and substantive impediment to management's exercise of its statutory right to select employees from any appropriate source....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">BATF</span> was followed by FLRA in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2429 and Dept. of Air Force, Hq. Space Sys. Div., Los Angeles</span>, 38 FLRA 1469, 1472 (1991), negating the negotiability of a proposal designed to compel the employer to rank and consider unit members before consideration was provided to individuals eligible for hiring preference under the 1985 Military Family Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA then determined nonnegotiable a provision that unit employees receive first consideration for vacancies in unit positions, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 61 FLRA 209, 211 (2005) (Proposal 2):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, Bur. of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms v. FLRA</span>, 857 F.2d 819 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">BATF</span>), the court found that a proposal requiring the agency to rank and consider current employees for promotion before soliciting or ranking outside candidates was outside the agency's duty to bargain. The court concluded that by providing that "management may not consider or even solicit" outside applicants until it had finished rating, ranking and considering internal candidates, the proposal "would create pressure to promote a reasonably competent agency employee rather than leave a position unfilled during the time that it would take to initiate and complete a late-starting search for a more qualified outside candidate." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 822. The court found this result inconsistent with management's right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, the Authority held that proposals that allow management to concurrently solicit unit and nonunit employees, but "preclude management from rating and ranking nonunit candidates until after a preliminary placement process for currently employed bargaining unit employees has been completed[,]" also affect management's right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C). <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 43 FLRA 1279, 1287 (1992) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2429</span>, 38 FLRA 1469, 1476-77 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Local 2429</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Union explains that, under the proposal, any actions required by the selection process be completed for unit candidates <span class="Italic">before</span> such actions are completed for nonunit candidates. Thus, for example, the proposal does not contemplate concurrent rating and ranking of unit and nonunit candidates. <span class="Italic">See Local 2429</span>, 38 FLRA at 1476-77. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Local 868</span>, 45 FLRA 224, 228 (1992) (proposals that require an agency to give priority consideration to bargaining unit candidates but do not prevent the concurrent solicitation <span class="Italic">and rating and ranking</span> of nonunit candidates do not affect management's right to select). Consequently, because Proposal 2 requires that priority consideration be given unit candidates before nonunit candidates are rated and ranked, it affects management's right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is therefore distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Evergreen &#x0026; Rainier Chapters</span>, 57 FLRA 475, 478-81 (2001) (<span class="Italic">ACT</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting in part) (citing <span class="Italic">ACT, Volunteer Chpt. 103</span>, 55 FLRA 562, 565 (1999) (Chair Segal dissenting on other grounds);<span class="Italic"> Laurel Bay Teachers Ass'n OEA/NEA</span>, 49 FLRA 679, 687 (1994); <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>,<span class="Italic"> Local 1923</span>, 44 FLRA 1405, 1493-94 (1992); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 43 FLRA at 1287-88 (1992)). None of those cases precluded the simultaneous rating and ranking of unit and nonunit candidates as does the proposal in this case. Moreover, as noted above, <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> specifically states that a proposal that has such an effect impermissibly interferes with management's right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not claim that the proposal constitutes a procedure within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) or an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). Consequently, the proposal is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also nonnegotiable, for the same reasons, in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 61 FLRA 209, 212 (2005), was Proposal 3: "[n]o selection shall be made unless and until the selecting official has interviewed all available candidates on the certificate who are within the unit and given them first consideration."</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1991 FLRA decided <span class="Italic">IAM Local Lodge 2297 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point</span>, 38 FLRA 1451, 1452, 1454-55 (1991), involving Proposal 1, calling on management to agree that the area of consideration for promotion would be the activity unless that area did not supply sufficient candidates for the vacancy. FLRA initially ruled the proposal negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In [<span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and</span>] <span class="Italic">OPM</span>, [33 FLRA 335 (1988)], the Authority concluded that a proposal concerning the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees, which also affects employees or positions outside the bargaining unit, is negotiable under the Statute if it (1) vitally affects the working conditions of unit employees and (2) is consistent with applicable law and regulations. The Authority additionally stated that the proposal's effect on nonunit employees or positions is not a factor in making the <span id="page_861"></span>negotiability determination and that prior decisions inconsistent with the described approach would no longer be followed.... In [<span class="Italic">AFGE, Council of Marine Corps Locals and Dept. of Navy, U.S. Marine Corps</span>, 35 FLRA 1023, 1032-33 (1990)],...we reiterated that a proposal's effect on nonunit employees or positions is not a factor in determining whether the proposal vitally affects the working conditions of bargaining unit employees, and the fact that some of those nonunit employees may be in bargaining units represented by other unions does not affect our analysis of the proposal's effect on bargaining unit employees.... And in <span class="Italic">Federal Employees Metal Trades Council of Charleston and U.S. Department of the Navy, Charleston Naval Shipyard, Charleston, South Carolina</span>, 36 FLRA 148, 153 (1990), (<span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>), the Authority determined that in order to "vitally affect" the working conditions of employees in the bargaining unit, the effect must be significant or material, as opposed to indirect or incidental.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Proposal 1 "vitally affects" the working conditions of employees in the bargaining unit because the proposal's effects on those employees are significant and material. Proposal 1 concerns the area of consideration for promotion announcements. That is, Proposal 1 deals with the area from which employees can apply for promotion vacancies. As a result, it pertains to determinations as to the promotions for which bargaining unit employees may apply and which employees will compete with bargaining unit employees for promotional opportunities. As noted by the Union, the proposal's requirement that a larger area of consideration for promotional opportunities be maintained for both unit and nonunit employees directly affects job opportunities for unit employees. In particular, it allows bargaining unit employees to be considered for a variety of promotional opportunities within and outside the unit. Moreover, it enables those who for some reason are unable to perform their former jobs in the unit to find more suitable positions outside the unit. We consider these effects on bargaining unit employees to be significant and material, and, therefore, to vitally affect the working conditions of those employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our conclusion is not altered by the Agency's contention that because the proposal affects the working conditions of employees of other bargaining units it does not vitally affect the working conditions of employees of this bargaining unit. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Marine Corps</span>, we considered this contention and rejected it, holding that a proposal's effect on nonunit employees or positions is not a factor in determining whether the proposal vitally affects the working conditions of bargaining unit employees.... Moreover, the fact that some of those nonunit employees may be in bargaining units represented by other unions does not affect our analysis of the proposal's effect on bargaining unit employees.... Finally, it is not contended by the Agency, nor is it apparent to us, that the proposal is inconsistent with law and regulation....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Local 2297</span> was vacated and remanded by the D.C. Circuit as that court substantially reformed FLRA's approach toward the "vitally affects" test. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 1434, 1441-43 (D.C. Cir. 1992) ("<span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>") [discussed in Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-13-004.html#sec5-5">Employment Conditions</a>"]. On remand FLRA concluded that the proposal was not negotiable, explaining in <span class="Italic">IAM Local Lodge 2297 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, N.C.</span>, 45 FLRA 1154, 1155-56, 1160-61 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the court's view, the vitally affects test is appropriately used "to define the limited circumstances in which subjects not normally seen to be within the compass of mandatory bargaining--<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the terms of a relationship between the employer and a third party--may become mandatory subjects due to their effect on bargaining unit employees."... The court added that the test "is <span class="Italic">not</span> implicated, however, merely because a union proposal, which is otherwise within the scope of mandatory bargaining, would, if accepted, have <span class="Italic">some</span> <span class="Italic">impact</span> on persons outside the bargaining unit."...(emphasis in original). The court recognized that most union bargaining demands have some "extra-unit effects" on non-unit personnel but held that such effects do not alter an employer's duty to bargain over mandatory subjects of bargaining.... The court found that "proposals that principally relate to the conditions of employment of bargaining unit personnel are within the traditional scope of mandatory bargaining."... According to the court, the vitally affects test is not relevant to such proposals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addressing the applicability of the vitally affects test, the court differentiated among four groups: non-bargaining unit employees, non-employees, management and supervisory personnel, and employees in other bargaining units. According to the court, the vitally affects test applies only when the interests of non-bargaining unit personnel are "directly implicated" by a union proposal or, phrased alternatively, when a proposal "purports to regulate the terms and conditions of employment of non-unit employees."... In such circumstances, the proposal would fall outside the mandatory scope of bargaining absent a showing that the proposal vitally affects conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees. The court reached the same conclusion as to proposals that seek to bargain with respect to non-employees, finding that a union may bargain over "a non-employee matter [that] vitally affects bargaining unit interests...."... However, the court held that the vitally affects test does not apply in circumstances where a union seeks to regulate through collective bargaining the conditions of employment of employees in other bargaining units and management and supervisory personnel who are excluded by the Statute from bargaining units....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court held that the two proposals at issue in this case "are non-negotiable to the extent that they purport to regulate the conditions of employment of supervisory personnel and employees in other bargaining units."... Accordingly, the court vacated the Authority's decision and order and remanded this case to the Authority for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion. In remanding, the court noted that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The only possibly unresolved issue is whether there are non-unit, non-supervisory employees at Cherry Point whose conditions of employment are directly implicated by the Local 2297 proposals. If there are such persons, the Authority can address on remand whether the "vitally affects" test is satisfied with respect to those persons on the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As formulated by the court, the only issue before us is whether the proposals are negotiable to the extent that "there are non-unit, non-supervisory employees at Cherry Point whose conditions of employment are directly implicated by the...proposals." <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, 954 F.2d at 1443.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the issuance of our initial decision in this case, the Union had stated that its intent as to Proposal 1 was to negotiate the "minimum area of consideration for promotion announcements." The Union argued that the past practice of one area of consideration for all of the activities located at the Cherry Point installation had operated well and that the Agency had not demonstrated any need for a smaller area of consideration. The Union stated, "[w]e hold the position that the minimum area of consideration should include all employees of the Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As written, Proposal 1 establishes a minimum area of consideration that encompasses all three activities located at the Cherry Point installation. The Union's statements concerning the intent of the proposal make clear that the Union specifically seeks to retain a minimum area of consideration that encompasses all employees at the Cherry Point installation. As written and explained by the Union, therefore, Proposal 1 is not consistent with a construction that it seeks or allows for an area of consideration of any proportions less than installation-wide, such as one limited to employees in the union's bargaining unit and non-unit, non-supervisory employees. Under the circumstances that exist in this case, placing such limitations on the proposal would require substantive revision of the proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n the absence of any basis in the record of this case for construing Proposal 1 as defining an area of consideration that is limited to the vacancies of employees in the Union's bargaining unit employees and those of non-unit, non-supervisory employees, it is not appropriate to rule on the negotiability of a proposal for such an area of consideration in this case. We conclude, based on the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, that Proposal 1 is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Decisions postdating <span class="Italic">IAM Local Lodge 2297,</span> still appear to permit negotiation of some priority consideration schemes. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Laurel Bay Teachers Ass'n, Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DOD, Stateside Dependents Sch., Laurel Bay</span>, 49 FLRA 679, 686, 687 (1994) (Proposal 3) ("A proposal that requires an agency to give priority consideration to employees within a bargaining unit when filling vacancies, but does not prevent management from timely considering other applicants or expanding the area of consideration once bargaining unit employees have been considered, does not directly interfere with management's right to select from any appropriate source under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">ACT Chap. 103 and DOD, Tennessee NG</span>, 55 FLRA 562, 565-67 (1999), the proposal required that if the selecting official was directed by the agency to select from among a particular (the "well qualified") group of competitors, the official would make a selection or nonselection from the group with a written justification for nonselection, followed by review of the nonselection justification by the agency human resource office, followed by similar consideration of "basically eligible" candidates, with either selection or justification for nonselection. The proposal was negotiable, both as to the sequential consideration scheme and the necessity for written justifications for nonselections from either group of candidates:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Paragraph (b) of Section 17 prescribes the mechanics of the selection process and the order in which the selecting official will consider candidates. Specifically, after interviewing and considering candidates referred by the HRO, the selecting official will either make a selection or provide written definitive justification to the HRO for nonselection of each candidate. Such justification must provide information as to the ways in which the candidate needs to improve. Once the HRO accepts the justification submitted, the remaining basically eligible candidates will <span id="page_862"></span>be referred to the selecting official. The selecting official will interview and consider those candidates and either select one of the candidates or nonselect each of them, providing written definitive justification to the HRO for the nonselection of each. If there are no "well qualified" candidates, and it is impractical to expand the area of consideration, the selecting official may select a qualified candidate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the context of Article 15 as a whole, Section 17(b) requires the Agency to first consider well qualified candidates from "area 1"--technician members of the Tennessee National Guard--to select from among those candidates, or nonselect each candidate and provide a written justification for the nonselection. After the HRO accepts the justification for the nonselection of each candidate, the selecting official will receive a list of all "area 1" qualified candidates for consideration. If the selecting official decides not to select from among the qualified "area 1" candidates, he or she may reconsider the nonselected well qualified "area 1" candidates or expand the area of consideration. In this regard, the plain terms of the last sentence of Section 17(b)(4) provide that the Agency is limited to selecting from among qualified "area 1" candidates or expanding the area of consideration only if there are no well qualified "area 1" candidates. Because Section 17(b), as worded, allows the selecting official to select from among well-qualified "area 1" candidates after considering qualified candidates, we adopt that interpretation for purposes of this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proposal that requires an agency to give first consideration to bargaining unit employees when filling vacant positions, but does not prevent management from timely considering other applicants or expanding the area of consideration once bargaining unit employees are considered, does not directly interfere with management's right to select from any appropriate source under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Laurel</span> <span class="Italic">Bay Teachers Association, OEA/NEA and U.S. Department of Defense, Stateside Dependents Schools, Laurel</span> <span class="Italic">Bay Schools, Laurel Bay, South Carolina, </span>49 FLRA 679, 687 (1994) <span class="Italic">(Stateside Dependents Schools) </span>(citing <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Nuclear</span> <span class="Italic">Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C, </span>43 FLRA 1279, 1287-88 (1992) <span class="Italic">(Nuclear Regulatory Commission)); American Federation of Government Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 1923 and U.S. Department of Health and Human</span> <span class="Italic">Services, Health Care Financing Administration, Baltimore,</span> <span class="Italic">Maryland,</span> 44 FLRA 1405, 1493-94 (1992) <span class="Italic">(HCFA).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, consistent with existing precedent, proposals that require an agency to provide a statement setting forth the reasons for the agency's action do not directly interfere with management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Association and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark</span> <span class="Italic">Office,</span> <span class="Italic">Washington, D.C., </span>47 FLRA 10, 65-66 (1993) <span class="Italic">(PTO, Washington)</span>; <span class="Italic">Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </span>43 FLRA at 1293. Specifically, a proposal requiring a management official to document the reasons for an action and secure the approval of the next higher level of management prior to taking that action does not directly interfere with management's rights<span class="Italic">. American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 446 and U.S. Department of the Interior,</span> <span class="Italic">National Park Service, Blue Ridge Parkway, Asheville,</span> <span class="Italic">North Carolina, </span>43 FLRA 836, 845 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Blue Ridge</span> <span class="Italic">Parkway).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 17(b) provides for the selecting official to consider well qualified "area 1," <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, bargaining unit, candidates first and then, if the selecting official decides not to select any of those candidates, requires that official to provide written justification for the decision not to select each candidate. If that written justification is accepted by the Agency's HRO, the selecting official will then be able to consider other candidates. By permitting the selecting official to consider other candidates, once that official has rejected those first considered and provided the requisite written justification, Section 17(b) does not directly interfere with management's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C). This conclusion is consistent with the Authority precedent set forth above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument that the proposal directly interferes with its right to select because it requires the selecting official to decide not to select as a prerequisite to consideration of other candidates is not convincing. The selecting official would not need to consider other candidates if he or she had not already decided to select from the "area 1" well qualified candidates initially considered. The selecting official would request other candidates, that is, only if he or she had decided not to select from the candidates considered first. In referring to nonselection by the selecting official, Section 17(b) simply recognizes the options that the official confronts in considering candidates and exercising the right to select: either select from the initial list, and end the process, or don't select from that list and request to see other candidates. By recognizing those options, Section 17(b) does not directly interfere with management's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that, by requiring a written justification of the decision not to select each of the candidates as a prerequisite to considering other candidates, Section 17(b) interferes with its right to select. However, Section 17(b) does not prescribe a substantive criterion by which the selecting official's decision not to select candidates can be evaluated. Rather, Section 17(b) requires the selecting official to explain to a nonselected candidate the area or areas in which the candidate would need to improve in order to warrant possible selection<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Association</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office, </span>48 FLRA 129, 155-58 (1993) (proposals requiring the agency to provide guidance to employees, which does not limit the agency's ability to find an error in employees' performance, held not to directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work); <span class="Italic">PTO, Washington, </span>47 FLRA at 34 (1993) (proposal requiring written explanation of any deviations from expected practices in establishing performance standards held negotiable); <span class="Italic">Blue Ridge Parkway,</span> 43 FLRA at 845. Consequently, consistent with existing Authority precedent, by requiring the selecting official to provide information to nonselected candidates, Section 17(b) would not directly interfere with management's right to select.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the Agency's argument that Section 17(b) would preclude management from comparing candidates before making a selection, that argument is based on a misunderstanding of the proposal. The selecting official's decision is not irrevocable. Thus, that official can decide initially not to select from among the well qualified "area 1" candidates referred for first consideration, noting the reasons that he or she declines to select each candidate, and then examine qualified "area 1" candidates. After examining those candidates, the selecting official may choose from among the well qualified, or the qualified, "area 1" candidates, or expand the area of consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">ACT Evergreen and Ranier Chapters and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau</span>, 57 FLRA 475, 479-81 (2001) (Proposal 2), also approved as negotiable a sequential consideration proposal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Meaning of the Proposal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2 provides that the selecting official will interview and consider Area One candidates, and if the selecting official does not select one of the Area One candidates, then the selecting official will submit to HRO a statement of reasons that the individual candidates were not selected. Proposal 2 further provides that after that statement of reasons has been "accepted" by HRO, Area Two candidates will be submitted to the selected official, who will then interview and consider those candidates. If after considering the Area Two candidates the selecting official determines that an Area One candidate previously non-selected should be selected, then the proposal provides that the selecting official will submit to HRO a statement of reasons for changing the initial statement submitted by the selecting official justifying that candidate's prior non-selection. The proposal also provides that if an employee is not selected for re-promotion, then the employee will have 7 days, during which the position will remain unfilled, to rebut the written justification for non-selection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts, and the dissent agrees, that Proposal 2 requires the selecting official to have its reasons for non-selection "approved" by HRO before additional candidates can be provided to the selecting official. The Union explains, however, that Proposal 2 provides only that (1) if all Area One candidates are non-selected, then reasons must be given; and (2) if after non-selection of all Area One candidates, the selecting official changes her or his mind and decides to select an Area One candidate, then reasons be given for that change. Because the Union's explanation of the proposal is consistent with its plain wording--which provides only for the reasons to be "accepted" by HRO--it is adopted for the purposes of this decision<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Proposal 2 Does Not Violate Management's Rights</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that a proposal that requires an agency to give first consideration to bargaining unit employees when filling vacant positions, but does not prevent management from timely considering other applicants or expanding the area of consideration once bargaining unit employees are considered, does not directly interfere with management's right to select from any appropriate source under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See ACT, Volunteer Chpt. 103</span>, 55 FLRA 562, 565 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Volunteer Chpt.</span>) <span class="Italic">(Chair Segal dissenting on other grounds); Laurel Bay</span> <span class="Italic">Teachers Ass'n OEA/NEA, </span>49 FLRA 679, 687 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>43 FLRA 1279, 1287-88 (1992)); <span class="Italic">AFGE,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 1923, </span>44 FLRA 1405, 1493-94 (1992). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 738, </span>39 FLRA 872, 875 (1991) (proposal precluding management from soliciting, processing, and considering applications from candidates outside the unit held to directly interfere with management's right to select from any appropriate source). The Authority has also consistently held that a proposal that requires an agency to provide a statement setting forth the reasons for the agency's action does not directly interfere with management's rights. <span class="Italic">See ACT, Volunteer Chpt. 103,</span> 55 FLRA at 565-66; <span class="Italic">POPA, </span>47 FLRA 10, 65-66 (1993); <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>43 FLRA at 1293; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 446</span>, 43 FLRA 836, 845 (1991). Accordingly, in <span class="Italic">ACT, Volunteer Chpt.</span> <span class="Italic">103</span>, 55 FLRA at 565-66, the Authority found that a proposal nearly identical to Proposal 2 in this <span id="page_863"></span>case--requiring a selecting official to consider and reject qualified unit employees prior to considering other candidates and to provide the agency's HRO with written justification for the decision not to select each unit candidate--did not directly interfere with management's right to select.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this well-settled precedent here, we conclude that Proposal 2 does not violate management's right to select. As set forth above, Proposal 2 provides for the selecting official to consider Area One--<span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> bargaining unit--candidates first and then, if the selecting official decides not to select any of those candidates, requires that official to provide written justification for the decision not to select each candidate. Once that written justification is accepted by the Agency's HRO, the selecting official is free immediately to consider other candidates. Because the proposal permits the selecting official to consider other candidates once that official has rejected those first considered and provided the requisite written justification, and because the proposal merely requires the selecting official to document the reasons for non-selection, it does not violate management's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>

Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">BATF</span>) compels a different conclusion. The court in <span class="Italic">BATF </span>found that a proposal requiring the agency to rank and consider current employees for promotion before soliciting or considering outside candidates was outside the agency's duty to bargain. The court concluded, in this regard, that by providing that "management may not consider or even solicit" outside applicants until it had finished rating and ranking internal candidates, the proposal "would create pressure...to promote a reasonably competent agency employee rather than leave a position unfilled during the time it would take to initiate and complete a late-starting search for a more qualified outside candidate<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 822. The court found this result inconsistent with management's right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sharp contrast to the proposal in <span class="Italic">BATF, </span>Proposal 2 permits the <span class="Italic">simultaneous solicitation </span>of applications from unit and non-unit employees. Further, to the extent there is a time lag between consideration of the two groups, the length of it is within the control of the Agency. In this regard, the Agency is free under the proposal to determine the form of the written justifications and the amount of time it takes to accomplish them. In addition, the Agency would be free to establish a system for expediting the selection process, such that immediately after HRO receipt of the selecting official's written justification for non-selection of Area One candidates, the official would receive the list of Area Two candidates for consideration and be able to make a selection therefrom. This differs markedly from the <span class="Italic">BATF </span>proposal. Indeed, the court in <span class="Italic">BATF </span>described as "significantly different" a proposal that provided internal candidates a "ten-day head start" but "did not prevent management from soliciting outside applicants during the ten-day waiting period<span class="Italic">." Id. </span>at 823. If a 10-day "head start" proposal is "significantly different" from the one in <span class="Italic">BATF, </span>then Proposal 2--which imposes no particular "head start" at all--is even more so. As such, <span class="Italic">BATF </span>does not support a conclusion that Proposal 2 violates the Agency's right to select.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even if <span class="Italic">BATF </span>were to be read broadly as rendering nonnegotiable any proposal whose "practical effect" is to "create pressure on the selecting official to select a unit employee," we do not view this proposal, as construed above, as fitting within that rationale. We do not believe that requiring a selecting official to state his or her reasons for nonselection of unit employees places any undue pressure on that official. <span class="Italic">See ACT,</span> <span class="Italic">Volunteer Chpt</span>, 103, 55 FLRA at 566.</p>
<p class="noindent">A justification process was negotiable as a part of bargaining for a term contract. Under Proposal 1 in <span class="Italic">NTEU and USDA, Food Nutrition &#x0026; Consumer Serv.</span>, 68 FLRA 334, 334 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the selecting official chooses to fill a unit position with an applicant who is not presently a federal employee, e.g., via an OPM appointment certificate, it will upon request of any bargaining unit employee who was rated Best Qualified, but not selected, articulate in writing a nondiscriminatory, merit-based reason with sufficient clarity to afford the employee a realistic opportunity to show that the reason is pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU</span> explained the proposal's meaning, 68 FLRA at 334-35:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree that, under the proposal, if a bargaining-unit employee applies for a bargaining-unit position and receives a rating of best qualified, but the Agency selects an external, non-federal-government applicant for the position, the employee may request information from the Agency. Specifically, if the employee feels that the Agency discriminated against him or her because he or she is a member of a protected class, then he or she may request from the Agency a written, merit-based reason for his or her non-selection. The reason would have to be explained with sufficient clarity to grant the employee the opportunity to demonstrate that the Agency's stated reason is pretextual, referencing the burden-shifting framework established by the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span> and its progeny.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU</span> sustained negotiability, 68 FLRA at 335:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The proposal is not contrary to federal anti-discrimination law.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the proposal "is contrary to law because it establishes a protected class that currently does not exist under law,"i.e., current federal employees. The Union disputes this assertion. Because the Union's explanation is consistent with the proposal's plain wording and agreed-upon meaning, we adopt that explanation. Accordingly, we find that the proposal does not create an additional protected class.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that, in grievances involving non-selection, the proposal improperly shifts the burden of proof to the Agency when an outside candidate is selected over a bargaining-unit employee. The Union responds that the proposal says "nothing about burdens of any kind." The Agency's argument is inconsistent with the agreed-upon meaning of the proposal, which does not impose any burden on the Agency other than providing information. Thus, we find that the proposal does not transfer the burden of proof to the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Agency has not established that the proposal is contrary to federal anti-discrimination law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The proposal affects the Agency's right to select employees.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the proposal affects its right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute by discouraging it from selecting outside candidates. The Union does not dispute that the proposal affects the Agency's right to select. Under &#x00A7; 2424.32(c)(2) of the Authority's Regulations, "[f]ailure to respond to an argument or assertion raised by the other party will, where appropriate, be deemed a concession to such argument or assertion." Thus, consistent with that regulation and Authority precedent, the Union has conceded that the proposal affects the Agency's right to select employees. Accordingly, we find that the proposal affects the Agency's right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. But even if the proposal concerns the exercise of this management right, the proposal is nevertheless negotiable if it constitutes a procedure within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The proposal is a procedure.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is also uncontested that the proposal is a procedure.&#x2003;The Union argues in its response that the proposal constitutes a procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2). The Agency did not address this issue in its statement of position or file a reply to the Union's response. As discussed above, by not responding to the Union's argument, the Agency has conceded that the proposal is a procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2). We therefore hold that this proposal is a procedure. In light of this determination, we find it unnecessary to reach the Union's argument that the proposal is also an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA traditionally blocks negotiation of proposals that completely bar consideration of outside candidates. Typical is <span class="Italic">Nat'l Council of CSA Locals and Community Servs. Admin.</span>, 3 FLRA 84, 84-85 (1980). The proposal was that if five in-house employees within the area of consideration are rated qualified, the area of consideration shall not be extended; if less than five employees are rated qualified, the selection may be made or the area may be expanded, at the option of the selecting official. The proposal could be interpreted (and the union offered no evidence that a different meaning was intended) that if management did not select from the referenced certificate it could not fill the position. The proposal prevented the agency from exercising its right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C). It limited management's discretion to consider other candidates if five qualified candidates were referred on the certificate. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 331 and VA Hosp., Perry Point</span>, 2 FLRA 428 (1980) and <span class="Italic">ACT, Del. Chap. and Nat'l Guard Bureau, Del. NG</span>, 3 FLRA 57 (1980), were specifically distinguished. A proposal was not negotiable that allowed the agency to consider outside applicants for promotional vacancies only when there were less than three minimally qualified internal applicants being considered and when a qualification screening committee determined that there were no qualified candidates among the applicants. The proposal impermissibly restricted the right to select and appoint; it precluded consideration of outsiders and required the appointment of internal candidates under the conditions set by the proposal. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1451 and Navy Exch., Naval Admin. Command, Orlando, Fla.</span>, 3 FLRA 392, 392-93 (1980).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2823 and VA Reg'l Office, Cleveland, Ohio</span>, 8 FLRA 422, 422-24 (1982), a nonnegotiable proposal precluded management from expanding its area of consideration or from making selections from other sources if three highly qualified candidates were identified under the negotiated merit promotion procedure. A proposal was not negotiable that prevented management from establishing trainee positions when registers already existed to fill the vacancy or there were well-qualified employees to fill the positions. The proposal prevented management from filling a position with a trainee when it was not satisfied with existing candidates. <span class="Italic">DOD, Dept. of Navy, Navy Ordnance Station, Louisville and IAM Local Lodge 830</span>, 4 FLRA 760, 773 (1980) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3296 and Nat'l Guard Bureau, Alaska NG</span>, 33 FLRA 99, 100 (1988) (proposal was nonnegotiable that required cut-off of other certificates of eligibles or areas of consideration if five candidates appeared on certificate).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_864"></span>A proposal was not negotiable that foreclosed further search in promotion cases if only one highly qualified applicant was located in the area of initial consideration. The proposal was inconsistent with the agency's authority to make selections. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1332 and Hq., Army Materiel Dev. and Readiness Command, Alexandria</span>, 6 FLRA 361, 363 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Tidewater Va. FEMTC and Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 31 FLRA 131, 135 (1988) (Provision 3, permitting expansion of an initial area of consideration only if it failed to produce a single qualified candidate, was nonnegotiable). A nonnegotiable proposal prevented expansion of the minimum area of consideration for promotion and placement actions if the minimum area would yield from three to five highly qualified candidates. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 15 and Dept. of Army, Rock Island Arsenal</span>, 11 FLRA 172, 172 (1983). Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">FEMTC of Charleston and Dept. of Navy, Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>, 44 FLRA 683, 700 (1992), was Proposal 3, that if it determines that unit employees are equally qualified to perform duties of positions with other employees, the agency shall select from qualified unit employees, based on seniority, before offering a position to a nonbargaining unit employee. The proposal unduly interfered with the agency's ability to consider and select candidates from any appropriate source, a restriction--arising every time a position was filled--going beyond the adverse effects of changes in job descriptions of unit employees.</p>
