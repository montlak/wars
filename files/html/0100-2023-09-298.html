<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-295"><span class="space">1.</span> Dismissal Warranted</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ may impose sanctions, including dismissing an appeal with prejudice for failure to prosecute. That sanction "may only be imposed, however, if the party failed to exercise basic due diligence in complying with any order, or the party exhibited negligence or bad faith in his efforts to comply." <span class="Italic">Monley v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 27, 29 (1997). <span class="Italic">White v. SSA</span>, 76 MSPR 447, 464-65 (1997), summed up:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that the sanction of dismissal may be imposed if a party fails to prosecute or defend an appeal. <span class="Italic">Wright v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 244, 249 (1992); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43(b). The imposition of such a severe sanction must be used, however, only when necessary to serve the ends of justice, <span class="Italic">Wright</span>, 53 MSPR at 249, as when a party has failed to exercise basic due diligence in complying with any order, or has exhibited negligence or bad faith in his efforts to comply, <span class="Italic">Monley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 MSPR 27, 29 (1997); <span class="Italic">Cioce v. Department of the Army</span>, 69 MSPR 564, 566 (1996). The Board has held that good faith efforts falling short of full compliance should be considered in determining whether dismissal is an appropriate sanction, <span class="Italic">see Branch v. Department of Defense,</span> 51 MSPR 537, 541 (1991), and that sanctions are unwarranted when a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant is confused by Board procedures or makes incomplete responses to Board orders, but evidences no intent to abandon his appeal, <span class="Italic">Wright,</span> 53 MSPR at 249.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also summarizing the basis for a dismissal for failure to prosecute or defend an appeal was <span class="Italic">Clair v. OPM</span>, CH-0839-13-0456-I-1 (NP 6/24/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The sanction of dismissal with prejudice may be imposed if a party fails to prosecute or defend an appeal. <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 7 (2011) (citing <span class="Italic">Ahlberg v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 804 F.2d 1238, 1242 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(b)). However, it is a severe sanction and should only be imposed when it is clearly warranted. Although the Board's regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(b), does not set forth guidelines for exercising this authority, the Board has held, in pertinent part, that such a severe sanction is only appropriate when necessary to serve the ends of justice and should only be imposed when: (1) a party has failed to exercise due diligence in complying with Board orders; or (2) a party has exhibited negligence or bad faith in its efforts to comply. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 7. Furthermore, absent a showing of abuse of discretion, the Board will not reverse an administrative judge's imposition of sanctions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an appellant's repeated failure to respond to multiple Board orders reflects a failure to exercise basic due diligence, the imposition of dismissal for failure to prosecute has been found appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Ahlberg</span>, 804 F.2d at 1242-45; <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 9. For example in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the sanction or dismissal was appropriate because the appellant completely failed to respond or comply with any of the Board's orders. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12. We analogize the facts in this appeal to those in cases like <span class="Italic">Williams</span> where the appellant failed to exercise basic due diligence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the undisputed record shows that the Central Regional Office sent three orders to the appellant's home. The appellant made no attempt to respond to or comply with any of the Board's orders, despite explicit warning that noncompliance with the show cause order may result in a dismissal for failure to prosecute. On review, the appellant merely asserts that, because the agency's cover letter stated "the final decision is affirmed," she thought it was the Board's decision on her appeal, and because she thought her appeal had been denied, she did not open or read any of the Board's correspondence. Thus, the appellant does not claim that she failed to receive the Board's orders, or that she was incapable of responding to them, but instead she concedes that she chose to ignore the Board's orders. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find no abuse of discretion in the administrative judge's decision to impose sanctions under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(b) based on the appellant's failure to exercise basic due diligence. Accordingly, the appellant has shown no basis upon which to disturb the initial decision dismissing her appeal for failure to prosecute.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The sanction of dismissal with prejudice may be imposed if a party fails to prosecute or defend an appeal. <span class="italic">Leseman v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6; 6 (2015); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(b). Such a sanction should be imposed only when (1) a party has failed to exercise basic due diligence in complying with Board orders or (2) a party has exhibited negligence or bad faith in its efforts to comply. <span class="italic">Leseman</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6; 6. When, as here, an appellant's repeated failure to respond to multiple Board orders reflects a failure to exercise basic due diligence, the sanction of dismissal for failure to prosecute is appropriate. <span class="italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 9 (2011). Absent an abuse of discretion, the Board will not reverse an administrative judge's determination regarding sanctions. <span class="italic">Leseman</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record reflects that the appellant failed to engage in discovery, failed to file prehearing submissions as ordered by the administrative judge, failed to appear for a telephonic prehearing conference, and failed to file a response when the administrative judge informed the appellant that her appeal would be dismissed for failure to prosecute absent a showing of good cause. The Board has upheld dismissals for failure to prosecute in similar situations. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Leseman</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4, 7 (upholding a dismissal for failure to prosecute after the appellant failed to appear at two conferences, failed to submit a close of record submission, and failed to respond to an order to show cause). Despite warnings that a failure to abide by the appellant Board's orders would result in a dismissal for failure to prosecute, the only contact the appellant made with the Board after the appeal returned from unsuccessful mediation was the filing of the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that her attorney is to blame for the failure to prosecute. An appellant is generally responsible for the errors or inaction of her chosen representative. <span class="italic">See Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981). The Board will not, however, penalize an appellant when her representative thwarts her diligent efforts to prosecute her appeal. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Shavers v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 187, 190 (1992). Here, the record shows that the appellant was personally served by electronic mail with the relevant orders to which she did not respond. Further, she has submitted with her petition for review an email from her former attorney informing her that he would not be representing her in her Board appeal and that she should inform the Board that she would be representing herself. This email is dated prior to the deadline for prehearing submissions, the date of the prehearing conference, and the administrative judge's order to show cause why her appeal should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute. We find that the appellant has not demonstrated she acted diligently under the circumstances and that her allegations regarding her former attorney do not provide a basis for disturbing the initial decision. <span class="italic">See Shavers</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. at 190-91 (finding that the appellant's unwarranted belief that his representative was pursuing his appeal was not a proper basis for a finding of due diligence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also continues to argue the merits of the underlying removal action. However, the merits of the underlying matter do not bear on the dispositive issue in this appeal--the dismissal of the appeal based on a failure to prosecute. <span class="italic">See Bennett v. Department of the Navy</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 683, 688 (1980) (concluding that an appellant's argument regarding the merits of the underlying agency action was not determinative of the propriety of a dismissal for failure to prosecute). The record does not show that the administrative judge abused her discretion in dismissing the appeal with prejudice for failure to prosecute.</p>

OPM</span>, 79 MSPR 437, 439 &#x00B6; 4 (1998) (sanction of dismissal of an appeal for failure to prosecute was appropriate when the party failed to exercise basic due diligence in complying with any order or exhibited negligence or bad faith in her efforts to comply; the failure to obey a single order does not ordinarily justify the sanction); <span class="Italic">Disney v. OPM</span>, 16 MSPR 416, 417, 419 (1983) (affirming dismissal for lack of prosecution when the appellant failed to attend the hearing and failed to respond to an order requiring him to show-cause why he had not appeared at the hearing); <span class="Italic">Coleman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The sanction of dismissal with prejudice may be imposed if a party fails to prosecute or defend an appeal. <span class="Italic">Williams v.

Cir. 1986) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(b)). However, it is a severe sanction and only should be imposed when it is clearly warranted. Our reviewing court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, has stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The [MSPB's] precedent notes that such an "extreme sanction of dismissal of an appeal for failure to prosecute should not be imposed for a single instances of failure to comply with a Board order. In the absence of bad faith or evidence that an appellant intends to abandon his appeal, dismissal for failure to prosecute is generally inappropriate." <span class="Italic">Burnett v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 34, 38 (1996) (overturning a dismissal based on a failure to respond to <span id="Page_1283"></span>timeliness portion of Acknowledgment Order)(citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Williamson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 334 F.3d 1058, 1063 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board's regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(b), does not set forth guidelines for exercising this authority, the Board has held, in pertinent part, that such a severe sanction is only appropriate when necessary to serve the ends of justice and should only be imposed when: (1) a party has failed to exercise basic due diligence in complying with Board orders; or (2) a party has exhibited negligence or bad faith in its efforts to comply. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 7. Furthermore, absent a showing of abuse of discretion, the Board will not reverse an administrative judge's imposition of sanctions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we agree with the administrative judge's assessment that the appellant, through her representative, showed bad faith in prosecuting her appeal because she repeatedly ignored the administrative judge's orders. Furthermore, she exhibited bad faith when she pursued reconsideration of long-decided motions on the morning of the scheduled hearing and then withdrew her hearing request on the basis of the foreseeable result of this gambit. The motions involved and the appellant's decision to request a decision on the written record could and should have been made long before the parties went to the expense of preparing for and appearing at the hearing. As the administrative judge found, Mr. Beesley's tactic was "clearly designed to delay the efficient processing of [the]appeal." Furthermore, as outlined above, the record shows that the appellant repeatedly failed to make good faith efforts to comply with the administrative judge's orders. These clear and unambiguous orders plainly stated the time and manner of response. Accordingly, under the totality of the circumstances presented, the administrative judge's dismissal of this appeal for failure to prosecute was within his discretionary authority, and we affirm the initial decision dismissing the appeal with prejudice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Dismissal for failure to prosecute was warranted for unjustified appellate inaction, <span class="Italic">Norris v. VA,</span> PH-0752-10-0514-I-1 (NP 9/12/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 7 (2011), the Board found that the sanction of dismissal with prejudice may be imposed if a party fails to prosecute or defend an appeal. <span class="Italic">Ahlberg v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 804 F.2d 1238, 1242 (Fed. Cir. 1986); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the appellant initially filed her appeal, she has not pursued it in any respect other than sending documents to the Board unrelated to any Board order and apparently agreeing to enter into a settlement on or about November 23, 2010. More specifically, in the approximately 2 months between agreeing to settle the appeal and the issuance of the initial decision on January 25, 2011, the appellant failed to sign the draft settlement agreement sent to her by the agency's representative and she did not return it to that official, her representative, or the Board for inclusion in the appellate record for prospective enforcement purposes. In addition, the appellant did not respond to several orders sent to her by the administrative judge nor did she communicate with her own designated representative throughout the course of this appeal. The appellant's repeated silence and inaction in the face of such efforts overwhelmingly indicated that she abandoned her appeal. In light of these circumstances, the administrative judge rightly dismissed the appeal for appellant's failure to prosecute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant argues on petition for review that she had been out of contact with her representative and she was dealing with personal problems, including sick children, she never communicated with her representative nor did she request an extension of time to either continue with the adjudication of this appeal or to sign the settlement agreement. Further, she failed to respond to the Order to Show Cause with evidence to support her assertion that she did not intend to abandon her appeal but was dealing with personal problems and sick children. The appellant has failed to submit any response to either of the Orders to Show Cause to explain why this appeal should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute, despite being specifically informed therein of the consequences, i.e.,<span class="Italic"></span> that failure to respond would result in dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, based on the facts and circumstances presented in this appeal, we find that dismissal for failure to prosecute is appropriate. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the appellant was confused by the proceedings or did not understand her responsibilities, as she did not communicate any such confusion or lack of clarity to the Board, the agency's representative, or her own chosen representative. Therefore, because the appellant's behavior can only be construed as an abandonment of her appeal and her failure to exercise due diligence, we find the administrative judge properly dismissed this appeal for failure to prosecute. <span class="Italic">See Williams,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Failure of the appellant to notify the AJ of his proper address and keep track of and respond to orders from the AJ when the proper address was supplied led to the sanction, sustained by the Board, of dismissal of the appeal in <span class="italic">Long v. OPM</span>, NY-0845-16-0302-I-1 (NP 7/28/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 7, 2016, the appellant filed a petition for review in which he asserts that he did not receive any of the notices below because the address listed on his appeal form was a temporary address, and he moved from New York to Texas in late September 2016. The appellant also filed a motion to accept his petition for review as timely, asserting that he did not receive the initial decision until December 7, 2016, when his car was shipped to Texas and he discovered a box of mail in the back. The agency has opposed the appellant's petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the three show orders were sent to the appellant at the address he provided on his appeal form. The preliminary status conference order and acknowledgment order were initially sent to an incorrect address. Thus, the appellant's failure to appear at the preliminary status conference on September 30, 2016, may have been excused. However, both orders were subsequently sent to the appellant's correct address of record on September 30, 2016. The appellant did not respond to these orders or any of the other orders that were properly served on him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant contends that he informed a customer service agent that his address was temporary, the Board's regulations provide that an appellant is responsible for notifying the Board in writing of any change of address, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.26(b)(2). The Board's appeal form similarly notified the appellant of this requirement. Further, the appellant does not contend that he ever informed the Board of his new address. The appellant's failure to keep the Board informed of his correct address delayed his receipt of documents essential to his appeal and indicates a lack of due diligence and ordinary prudence on his part. <span class="italic">See Jacks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 355, &#x00B6; 8 (2010) (finding that the appellant's failure to notify the Board of a change in address caused a delay in his receipt of the initial decision and did not reflect due diligence). We find that the appellant has not shown that he exercised basic due diligence by timely updating his contact information so that he could stay abreast of the developments in his appeal. Nor does the record contain any evidence that the appellant took any steps to pursue his appeal between September 8, 2016, when he filed his appeal, and December 7, 2016, when he filed his petition for review.</p>
