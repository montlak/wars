<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-105"><span class="space">b.</span> History of the Cost-Plus Rule</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Early in the Board's history, <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 322, 330 (1981), considered how the time of union counsel should be compensated. Union counsel petitioned for a reasonable hourly fee based on prevailing rates. OPM opposed the petition, arguing that clients of union counsel did not incur fees because the union lawyers were on salary and did not bill their time. Finding that counsel fees are "incurred," although they are not paid directly from an appellant to the union counsel, the Board grappled with the concept of what constituted a reasonable fee. The difficulty presented in <span class="Italic">Powell</span> was that if union lawyers were reimbursed at amounts exceeding their salaries and benefits, and the lawyers paid to the union the sums received, the union would profit from the services of counsel. Disciplinary rules prohibit lawyers from splitting fees with nonlawyers. The Board, concluding that <span class="Italic">de facto</span> fee splitting would occur if unions made a profit from attorneys' services, decided that the reasonable fee for union-salaried counsel who repay fee awards to the union may consist of no more than the actual cost to the union of providing legal services.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, recovery by the union-employed counsel who turn their fees over to the union treasury was to consist of the hourly salary of the attorney, multiplied by the time in the appeal, plus out-of-pocket expenses, plus overhead to cover the costs of an office, books, secretarial work, supplies, equipment, and telephone. The Board decided that proof of overhead, detailed accounting and allocation of costs, would be burdensome. It determined that in the private practice of law, the general experience was that overhead built into the hourly rate charged to clients averaged 100% of a salaried attorney's compensation. Assuming (lacking contrary proof) that union lawyers had the same proportion of overhead to salary, the Board resolved that, as an element of the union's actual costs, in addition to compensation for the attorney's time devoted to the case, it would award an allowance of 100% of that compensation for overhead.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 19 MSPR 174, 182 (1984), "an award of attorney fees to a salaried union attorney should be made directly to the attorney notwithstanding the existence of a legal services program established by the union." Under <span class="Italic">Powell</span> and <span class="Italic">Wells v. Schweiker</span>, 14 MSPR 175, 178-79 (1982), if an award of fees was to be made to a salaried union attorney, and the money was paid to some component of the union, the cost-plus, not the market-value, rate applied whether or not the funds were to be deposited in the union's legal services fund. <span class="Italic">Franks v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 26 MSPR 351, 354-55 (1985) (cost-plus counsel fee formula applied to union attorneys who must pay their earnings over to a union legal aid fund); <span class="Italic">Froehlich v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 21 MSPR 265, 270 (1984) ("This Board has previously held that where an award of attorney fees is to be made to a salaried union attorney, the cost-plus, and not the market-value, rate attorney fees apply irrespective of whether the funds are to be deposited in the union's legal services fund."); <span class="Italic">Allen v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 20 MSPR 518, 520 (1984) (cost-plus formula was to be applied, irrespective of whether the fees are deposited in a union legal services fund). The money going to the litigation fund only reduced the drain on the general treasury; the counsel fee provisions of the Reform Act and Back Pay Act were designed to reimburse employees for the legal fees incurred, not to provide windfall recoveries for unions providing legal services. <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 19 MSPR 174, 181-82 (1984) (following remand on the original 1981 decision); <span class="Italic">Wells v. Schweiker</span>, 14 MSPR 175, 179-80 (1982) (market value fee to a legal services fund would relieve the union of the burden of financing its litigation by allocating funds from its general revenues, allowing the union to profit from the underlying activities of its attorneys).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Powell</span> cautioned that the actual cost to the union of providing legal services to an appellant represented the maximum reasonable fee that may be awarded. This amount could be reduced by the AJ upon consideration of factors including the hours claimed, to be weighed against time required for presenting similar appeals, the possibility of duplication of efforts, and the distinction between legal and nonlegal work that ordinarily commands a lesser rate (with the obscure comment that "a case of first impression or great complexity may establish the justification of the hours claimed"). 8 MSPR at 333 n.8.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Goodrich v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 733 F.2d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1984), counsel of the American Federation of Government Employees sought fees at market rather than cost-plus rates. A decision from the D.C. Circuit,<span class="Italic"> NTEU v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 656 F.2d 848 (D.C. Cir. 1981), resolving that union counsel could not receive fees in excess of union expenses performing legal services, was argued in <span class="Italic">Goodrich</span> as distinguishable because AFGE had a legal representation fund that received all fees, the fund was under the sole control of the union's general counsel, the fund was used only to pay for legal services, and the fund was maintained as an account discrete from the union's general treasury. AFGE argued that money going into the fund would not be for the general benefit of the union. The court noted that not all legal services were paid by the fund; some were paid for by the union's general treasury. The court declined to upset the Board's approach<span class="Italic">. Id</span>., 733 F.2d at 1580-81. The Federal Circuit's views of the cost-plus formulation under both the Back Pay Act and EAJA were summarized in <span class="Italic">Devine v. NTEU</span>, 805 F.2d 384, 386-89 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board applied the cost-plus fee equation for union counsel to EEO cases, a practice that did not survive scrutiny in the regional appellate courts. In <span class="Italic">Kean v. Dept. of Army</span>, 41 MSPR 618, 620-22 (1989), the Board considered a fee application under 5 USC 7702(g)(2) by a union-employed attorney whose fees were to be turned over to the union legal representation fund. Section 7701(g)(2) provides that when an employee prevails and the decision is based on a finding of discrimination, fees are awarded in accordance with the provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 USC 2000e-5(k), rather than upon the "interest of justice" formulation of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). At the time of <span class="Italic">Kean</span>, the Federal Circuit then adhered to the cost-plus formula for union counsel, but the other circuit courts, reviewing civil rights cases appealed from district courts, tended to award full market rate fees to union-employed counsel in civil rights cases if the fees were paid over to a legal defense fund. In <span class="Italic">Kean</span>, the Board attempted to abide by the then prevailing Federal Circuit affirmation of the cost-plus formula. The <span class="Italic">Kean</span> ruling met its demise in the Third Circuit. <span class="Italic">Kean v. Stone</span>, 966 F.2d 119, 121-24 (3d Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Curran v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 805 F.2d 1406 (9th Cir. 1986), involving review of an MSPB decision, found no impediment to market rates for union counsel whose legal services fund maintained a separate operating account. The court rejected the argument that the union obtained an improper indirect benefit when its legal fund received awards in excess of costs. The EEOC followed <span class="Italic">Curran</span> in federal sector cases, meaning that if a Board appeal progressed to the Commission, any fees awarded to union counsel would be at a market rate if the legal services system operated by the union followed the <span class="Italic">Curran</span> model. <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Secretary, HHS</span>, EEOC 01880657 (1988)<span class="Italic">. But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ray Brook and AFGE Local 3882</span>, 32 FLRA 20 (1988) (Federal Labor Relations Authority unfair labor practice decision adopted the cost-plus formulation), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 944 F.2d 922, 935 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (explicitly rejecting the position of the Board and the Federal Circuit and awarding market rates to the union counsel when the fees were deposited into a union legal services account under the control of the union's general counsel).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There were some variations on the cost-plus theme. <span class="Italic">Sailor-Nimocks v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 438, 440-43 (1995), decided that market rates could be awarded if union counsel retained a fee award and only repaid to the union the costs (including salary) that the union incurred in supplying legal services to the client. But <span class="Italic">Seibel v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 233, 237 (1985), a disability discrimination case, determined that union counsel could not recover fees at market rates even if counsel was only required to reimburse the union for compensation received and other expenses. The Board reduced the fees, concluding that a lawyer is prohibited from splitting fees with his client. Even if the union was relieved of its burden of legal expense only to the extent of its actual costs, it stood to benefit indirectly from the windfall to its attorneys: it would provide them with an employment benefit at no cost to itself--unexpected remuneration to the attorney under the representational agreement with the appellant. The Board noted in <span class="Italic">Sailor-Nimocks</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 66 MSPR 438, 443 n.2, (1995), that <span class="Italic">Seibel</span> was reversed by a federal district court decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Calculations to determine the hourly rate for union counsel were described in <span class="Italic">Overton v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 27 MSPR 394, 395-96 (1985) (1820-hour work year), and <span id="Page_4642"></span>in <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 26 MSPR 343, 346 (1985) ("[A] union attorney's hourly salary rate must be based on the total number of annual work hours for which the attorney was paid [2080-hour work year] rather than on the hours of actual service. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Allen v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 20 MSPR 518, 521 n.4 (1984)."). Although the cost-plus formula established by the Board for union counsel appeared to be applied with regularity, union counsel could urge through arguments and evidence that the standard multiplier used in the cost-plus formula was insufficient to compensate for overhead. <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 322, 332 (1981), and 26 MSPR 343, 345 (1985) (but the evidence would need to be specific concerning overhead costs to justify a variation on the Board's formula; general statements of the hourly "rate" of union counsel will not be sufficient). If a union retained private counsel to represent an employee, the retained attorney would be awarded fees on the basis of the hourly rate charged to the union. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jennings v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 45 MSPR 615, 616 n.1 (1990); <span class="Italic">Peasley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 25 MSPR 137, 139 n.3 (1984) (cost-plus measure does not apply if union hires outside counsel; normal fee determinants then apply).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board once maintained that it was inappropriate to award the market rate for private counsel's travel time, the cost to a union in providing legal services remained the same during the travel time of salaried counsel; accordingly, if fees were based on a cost-plus formula, the appropriate rate for travel was the same as for legal work performed. <span class="Italic">Curran v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 26 MSPR 306, 309-10 (1985). The travel time formulation was modified by the Federal Circuit. Now travel time is fully compensable for all counsel, a matter subsequently discussed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The decisions on the cost-plus issue generally involved an ethical question: whether a lawyer may split a fee with a nonlawyer client, his employer. The Legal Ethics Committee of the District of Columbia Bar issued Opinion No. 176 on October 21, 1986, finding that "no ethical restriction exists under [DR 3-102 and DR 3-101(A)] where market value fees are placed in a separate fund to be used solely by the union's lawyers to finance legal assistance, even if the umbrella organization receives some indirect benefit from this arrangement." Despite these developments, until the Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Raney</span> decision, the Board's position was rigidly maintained: even with an EEOC finding of discrimination adopted by the Board, the Board awarded fees under the cost-plus formula, determining that "while the appellant cites various court cases to support his assertion that he is entitled to the market value rate, none of these decisions were issued by our reviewing court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit." <span class="Italic">Hand v. Dept. of Army</span>, 56 MSPR 334, 336 n.1 (1993).</p>
