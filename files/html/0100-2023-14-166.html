<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-167"><span class="space">1.</span> Directed or Enforced Leave Usage</h4>
<p class="noindent">An agency has the right to partially close during holiday periods. A proposal is outside the duty to bargain if it could deprive management of its right to require employees to take leave and prevent the closing of operations. That was the effect of a proposal calling on management to make every attempt to avoid requiring an employee to take annual leave or leave without pay during the holiday period. The proposal was not an appropriate arrangement. It could eliminate the agency's discretion to exercise its rights and excessively interfered with management rights. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2185 and Tooele Army Depot</span>, 23 FLRA 193, 195 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">IAM and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing</span>, 33 FLRA 711, 722-23 (1988) (Proposal 5 nonnegotiable, prohibiting management from requiring employees to schedule or use annual leave unless employees are in danger of losing accrued leave at end of leave year).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was nonnegotiable that management attempt, during periods of activity shutdown or reduced operations, to provide available work first to employees not having a balance of annual leave. The proposal interfered with the right of management to assign work and restricted management's choice of employees to be laid off. <span class="Italic">FEMTC of Charleston and Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>, 33 FLRA 618, 620-21 (1988). A proposal was nonnegotiable that management to assign work to employees who wanted to work during a "Christmas curtailment," when operations would ordinarily be suspended, if the agency were not precluded by budget reasons from employing those individuals. <span class="Italic">FEMTC of Charleston and Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>, 36 FLRA 401, 405 (1990) (not presenting question whether proposal constituted appropriate arrangement). A proposal was nonnegotiable that required an agency to assign an extra hour of work to employees who decline to be charged annual leave or LWOP to compensate for an hour of work lost on their shift upon conversion to daylight savings time. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1857 and Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr., McClellan AFB</span>, 34 FLRA 909, 914 (1990). A nonnegotiable proposal required the agency to provide a sufficient amount of work to employees who report for duty during a period of temporary closure. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1156 and Dept. of Navy</span>, <span class="Italic">Navy Inventory Control Plant,</span> 61 FLRA 615, 616 (2006). [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-152.html#sec6-153">Temporary Shutdown of Facility</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-14-151.html#sec6-152">Administrative Leave</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-14-593.html#sec6-594">Furloughs; Seniority</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite the decisions just cited, approved in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 53 and Dept. of Navy, Navy Material Transp. Office</span>, 42 FLRA 938, 943, 947-49 (1991), as an appropriate arrangement was the proposal that "[d]uring any period of shutdown of activities or reduced operations for vacation purposes, every effort will be made to provide work for employees not having annual leave to their credit":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Provision 3 directly interferes with management's rights to assign employees and to assign work, it is negotiable only if it is an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. To determine whether Provision 3 constitutes an appropriate arrangement, we must decide whether the provision is: (1) intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right; and (2) appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management's rights. [<span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Kansas Army National Guard</span>).]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that Provision 3 constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. The Union asserts that Provision 3 "merely requires the Agency to attempt to utilize...employees who would otherwise be unpaid due to lack of annual leave." We conclude that Provision 3 is intended by the Union as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the Agency's exercise of its right to reduce or shutdown its operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that Provision 3 is an arrangement, we now consider whether it is appropriate within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. To determine whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of a management right, we weigh "the competing practical needs of employees and managers" to determine whether the benefit to employees afforded by the proposal outweighs the burden placed by the proposal on the exercise of the management right or rights involved. <span class="Italic">Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-32. The question, therefore, is whether the burden imposed on the exercise of management's rights by Provision 3 is excessive when weighed against the benefit the provision affords employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the burden placed on the Agency by Provision 3 is not significant.&#x2003;While Provision 3 would obligate management to provide work for employees if it determines that there is work that could be performed, the judgment as to the availability of work that could be performed and the qualifications of employees needed to perform the work is reserved to management. Similarly, although the provision would require the Agency to make "every effort" to provide work for employees not having annual leave during reduced operations or a shutdown, the <span id="page_733"></span>provision does not impose an absolute requirement that employees without leave be assigned work. Thus, the burden imposed by Provision 3 on management's rights is not significant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand by requiring that the Agency make every effort to provide work for employees lacking annual leave during reduced operations or a shutdown, Provision 3 affords a benefit to employees. As noted above, the Union asserts that employees would be adversely affected if the Agency decides to require employees to take leave during a reduction or shutdown of its operations. If the Agency decides to reduce or shut down its operations, employees who lack annual leave would be adversely affected because they would not receive compensation. The provision ensures employees that management will at least make efforts to provide them with work before requiring them to take leave without pay and, thus, preserves the possibility that some employee or employees would not need to take leave without pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that, on balance, the benefit to employees outweighs the burden placed on the Agency. Consequently, we find that Provision 3 does not excessively interfere with management's rights and is a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 42 FLRA No. 57, slip op. at 10-11<span class="Italic">. See also</span> <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span>, 39 FLRA at 40 (provision requiring an agency to make "a reasonable effort" to find work for an employee found to constitute a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute). <span class="Italic">Compare American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2185 and Tooele Army Depot, Tooele, Utah</span>, 23 FLRA 193, 196 (1986) (Authority interpreted a proposal requiring an agency to "make every conceivable attempt to assign employees to available work" if they declined to take annual leave or leave without pay during a partial closing as totally eliminating the agency's discretion to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(2) and concluded that the proposal excessively interfered with those rights).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that Provision 3 directly interferes with management's right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B), but constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the subject of required leave usage during periods of inactivity, FLRA shifted direction somewhat in <span class="Italic">NAGE and VA</span>, 43 FLRA 414, 431-32 (1991), resolving as negotiable Proposal 4, that the employer allow an employee administrative leave, permit the employee to remain on duty, or, at the employee's request, permit the employee to take annual leave when the employee reports for duty and the employer determines that the employee's services are not needed for the day:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the Agency's assertion that Proposal 4 directly interferes with management's rights to assign work and employees by "prohibiting enforced annual leave[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6302(d) provides that "[t]he annual leave provided by this subchapter...may be granted at any time during the year as the head of the agency concerned may prescribe." FPM chapter 630, subchapter 3-4.b., which implements this statutory provision, states, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Annual leave provided by law is a benefit and accrues automatically. However, supervisors have the responsibility to decide when the leave may be taken. This decision will generally be made in the light of the needs of the service rather than solely on the desires of the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with these provisions, an agency may deny an employee's request to use accrued annual leave when the agency requires an employee's services. However, where an agency has decided it does not need an employee's services on a particular day, neither 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6302(d) nor its implementing regulations support a conclusion that an agency may require an employee to take annual leave on that day. The Agency has not cited any other statute or regulation, and none is apparent to us, which provides the Agency such a right. Accordingly, we reject the Agency's argument that it may require employees to take annual leave in the circumstances encompassed by Proposal 4.... To the extent that previous decisions have indicated that agencies have the right to require employees to take annual leave, they will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that the portion of Proposal 4 requiring the Agency to grant employees administrative leave is negotiable. Accordingly, Proposal 4 does not require the Agency to permit an employee to remain on duty and does not, therefore, directly interfere with management's right to assign work and employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable in <span class="Italic">Tidewater Va. FEMTC and Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth</span>, 42 FLRA 845, 851 (1991), was Proposal 2:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before requiring forced leave in a shop, the Employer will discuss with the Council the reasons for the distribution of forced leave<span class="Italic">. Attempts will be made by the Employer to place the employees in other areas of need within the Shipyard</span>. Other naval shipyards will be called to determine whether they have need for the services of employees faced with such leave and are able to take them on a loan in order to reduce the impact on the employees' accumulated leave. [Only the [italicized] portion is in dispute.]</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">FEMTC</span> proposal was a negotiable arrangement, 42 FLRA at 853-55:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we find that Proposal 2 directly interferes with management's rights to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B). However, we further find that the proposal constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. In reaching these results, we find it unnecessary to determine whether the proposal also directly interferes with management's right to lay off employees. Even if it does, we would find the proposal to be a negotiable appropriate arrangement on the same basis as set forth below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The disputed portion of Proposal 2 would require the Agency to attempt to place employees subject to forced leave into other areas of need within the shipyard.&#x2003;As such, the proposal is comparable to the provision at issue in <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>, 33 FLRA at 618-19, which required management to "attempt to provide available work first to employees not having annual leave to their credit[,]" during periods of shutdown or reduced operations. The Authority found that the provision interfered with management's rights to assign and lay off employees and to assign work. The Authority found that the provision would apply regardless of management's decision concerning whether work should be performed during those periods and regardless of the need for the employees' services, thereby requiring management to forego its decision to temporarily cease operations. In reaching its decision, the Authority relied on its earlier decision in <span class="Italic">Tooele Army Depot</span>, in which a proposal requiring the agency to make every conceivable attempt to assign employees to available work if they declined to take annual leave or leave without pay during partial closings of the activity during certain holiday periods was found to interfere with management's rights to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. 23 FLRA at 195.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reach the same conclusions here concerning management's rights to assign employees and assign work. Although the proposal does not specifically refer to a curtailment of operations or closing of the employer's facility, the effect of the proposal, as explained by the Agency, is to require it to maintain employees on duty without regard to periods of temporary shutdown or curtailment of operations. While the Union contests the Agency's interpretation of the proposal, the Union acknowledges that the proposal would operate when employees' services are not needed for short periods of time, which we view as applying to periods of temporary shutdown or curtailment. During these periods, the proposal would require the Agency to retain on duty employees who might be surplus under the Agency's plan of reduced operations and to assign duties to those employees. Consequently, and for the reasons more fully set forth in <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>, we find that the proposal interferes with the Agency's rights to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Employees Metal Trades Council of Charleston and U.S. Department of the Navy, Charleston Naval Shipyard, Charleston, South Carolina</span>, 36 FLRA 401 (1990) (proposal requiring agency to assign available work to employees choosing to work during period of temporary curtailment of operations directly interfered with the agency's right to assign work).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we further find that the proposal constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. In determining whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, it is first necessary to determine whether the proposal is intended as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. If the proposal is intended as an arrangement, the Authority next examines whether the arrangement is appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of the management right<span class="Italic">. National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 31-33 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that Proposal 2 is intended to mitigate the adverse effects of requiring employees to take annual leave when their services are not needed.&#x2003;As such, we conclude that the proposal is intended as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights to assign employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further conclude, on balance, that the proposal would not excessively interfere with the exercise of those rights because the burden imposed on the Agency's exercise of its rights is outweighed by the significant benefits that would inure to employees. The disputed portion of the proposal simply requires that attempts will be made to place employees. Although we have found that proposals requiring an agency to take every reasonable effort or to attempt certain actions involving management rights directly interfere with the exercise of those rights, such decisions do not preclude a finding that the proposals may constitute negotiable appropriate arrangements. In <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association and Department of Defense Dependents Schools</span>, 39 FLRA 153 (1991), for <span id="page_734"></span>example, we found that although proposals requiring the agency to make every reasonable effort to provide preparation time during the workday for various activities interfered with the right to assign work, they constituted negotiable appropriate arrangements because the requirements were not unconditional and permitted exceptions to the right to assign work. Here, as noted, the proposal simply requires the Agency to attempt to place employees and does not impose an absolute requirement on the Agency to do so. For this reason, our finding that the proposal constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement differs from the Authority's determination in <span class="Italic">Tooele Army Depot</span>, in which the proposal was found to excessively interfere with management's rights because it would have totally eliminated the agency's discretion to exercise its reserved rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, in finding that Proposal 2 does not excessively interfere with management's rights, we note that the last sentence of the proposal, which would require the Agency to contact other shipyards for placement purposes, was not declared nonnegotiable and the Agency did not contradict the Union's assertion that the proposal, which has been in effect for some time, has not caused any hardship or undue burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast to the minimal burden imposed on the Agency's exercise of its rights, we find that the proposal affords significant benefits to the employees. Employees who are not required to use leave when their services are not needed would be able to preserve their leave and to use such leave, within applicable legal and regulatory requirements, when the leave was most appropriate and beneficial to the employees. Additionally, under the proposal, employees would be able to continue to perform work only where the Agency has determined that there is work available and the employees are qualified to perform such work. Consequently, we find that Proposal 2 constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was not appropriate for negotiations that removed from the agency its authority to determine whether an employee is capable of returning to work and performing his or her assigned duties. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 31 FLRA 360, 376 (1988) (relying upon <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1625 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Air Station, Oceana</span>, 30 FLRA 1105 (1988)).</p>
