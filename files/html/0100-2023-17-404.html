<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-402"><span class="space">2.</span> Reasoned Award</h4>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's role is to ensure that an arbitrator complies with statutory standards governing fee awards. <span class="Italic">PTO and POPA</span>, 32 FLRA 375, 378 (1988). The arbitrator must issue a fully reasoned decision resolving a counsel fee request. That decision must set forth specific findings supporting the determination on each pertinent statutory requirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Air Dev. Ctr. and AFGE Local 1928, AFL-CIO</span>, 21 FLRA 131, 140-41 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">That an award denies fees does not excuse insufficient rationale for that result, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3239 and SSA</span>, 61 FLRA 808, 808-810 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator, based on his finding that the Agency violated Article 23, Section 1 of the parties' agreement, awarded the grievant back pay <span id="page_2431"></span>and interest for the two-day suspension. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> However, the Arbitrator denied the Union's request for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In so doing, the award states in entirety:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The request for attorney's fees is denied as there was no showing of bad faith, gross procedural error or other Agency action that would warrant such an award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Arbitrator's denial of attorney fees violates the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596. The Union claims that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted agency personnel action, which resulted in the withdrawal of her pay for the term of the suspension. The Union also asserts that the grievant was the prevailing party and that an award of fees is in "the interest of justice" because the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors have been met [1].</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Allen v. United States Postal Serv</span>., 2 M.S.P.R. 420 (1980) (<span class="Italic">Allen</span>). According to <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice if: (1) the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice; (2) the agency actions are clearly without merit or wholly unfounded, or the employee is substantially innocent of charges brought by the agency; (3) the agency actions are taken in bad faith to harass or exert improper pressure on an employee; (4) the agency committed gross procedural error which prolonged the proceeding or severely prejudiced the employee; or (5) the agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding. The Authority has also stated that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice when there is either a service rendered to the Federal workforce or there is a benefit to the public derived from maintaining the action.<span class="Italic"> United States Dep't of the Army, Red River Army Depot, Texarkana, Tex.</span>, 39 FLRA 1215, 1223 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Naval Air Dev. Ctr., Dep't of the Navy</span>, 21 FLRA 131, 139 (1986)). An award of fees is warranted if any of these criteria is satisfied. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Def., Def. Mapping Agency, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr., Wash., D.C.</span>, 47 FLRA 1187, 1194 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator's denial of attorney fees is contrary to the Back Pay Act. When a party's exceptions involve an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews the question of law and the arbitrator's award <span class="Italic">de novo. NTEU, Chapter 24, </span>50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv. v. FLRA, </span>43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> standard of review, the Authority assesses whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The threshold requirement for entitlement to attorney fees under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, is a finding that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, which resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Defense, Defense Distribution Region E., New Cumberland, Pa.</span>, 51 FLRA 155, 158 (1995). The Back Pay Act further requires that an award of fees must be: (1) in conjunction with an award of backpay to the grievant on correction of the personnel action; (2) reasonable and related to the personnel action; and (3) in accordance with the standards established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g). <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The prerequisites for an award of attorney fees under &#x00A7; 7701(g) are that: (1) the employee must be the prevailing party; (2) the award of fees must be warranted in the interest of justice; (3) the amount of the fees must be reasonable; and (4) the fees must have been incurred by the employee. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not articulate the reasons for denying the Union's request for attorney fees and the record, as submitted to the Authority, does not contain any evidence that would assist the Authority in determining the Arbitrator's basis for denying the Union's request for attorney fees. The Authority's approach to attorney fees awards under the Back Pay Act that are not sufficiently explained is to "take the action necessary to assure that the award is consistent with applicable statutory standards."<span class="Italic"> See United States Dep't of Agric., Animal and Plant Health Inspection Serv., Plant Prot. and Quarantine, </span>53 FLRA 1688, 1695 (1998) <span class="Italic">(Animal and Plant Health Inspection Serv.) </span>(citing<span class="Italic"> NAGE, Local R5-188, </span>46 FLRA 458 (1992)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the interest of justice standard, the Arbitrator specifically cited two of the interest of justice factors, finding that "there was no showing of bad faith, gross procedural error or other Agency action that would warrant such an award." However, the Arbitrator did not explain the basis of those findings or specifically address the other interest of justice factors. In addition, the Arbitrator did not address, and the record does not reveal, whether the fees as requested were reasonable, or were incurred by the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Arbitrator has not sufficiently explained the "determination of a pertinent statutory requirement" and the record does not permit the Authority to resolve the Union's exception, we remand this portion of the award to the parties, absent settlement, for resubmission to the Arbitrator to clarify, consistent with the foregoing standards, the reasons for the denial of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Animal and Plant Health Inspection Serv., </span>53 FLA at 1695.<span class="Italic"> See also, AFGE, Council 220</span>, 60 FLRA 1, 4 (2004).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">When arbitration is provided for in a government agency's collective bargaining agreement, an affected employee has the option to invoke arbitration in place of an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1). Such an arbitration proceeding is governed by the same standard of proof as a proceeding before the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(2). A fee award following an arbitration is available to a prevailing employee under the same circumstances that it would be available to such an employee following a successful appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and is awarded in accordance with standards established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii).

We will therefore uphold an arbitrator's denial of attorney fees unless the arbitrator's decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise unlawful, procedurally deficient, or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c). We afford "great deference to the Board (or an arbitrator standing in the place of the Board) on questions of entitlement to attorney fees." <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, 98 F.3d at 1311.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The governing statute for fee awards in this context, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), provides that an adjudicator may require an agency to pay the employee's reasonable attorney fees if the employee is the prevailing party and the adjudicator determines that payment by the agency "is warranted in the interest of justice." This court has identified five non-exclusive factors that the Board (or an arbitrator) may consider in determining whether a fee award is in the interest of justice. Those factors, first identified by the Board in <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 420 (1980), and known ever since as the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors, are the following:</p>

<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Where the agency's action was "clearly without merit" (&#x00A7; 7701(g)(1)), or was "wholly unfounded," or the employee is "substantially innocent" of the charges brought by the agency;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Where the agency initiated the action against the employee in "bad faith," including:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;Where the agency's action was brought to "harass" the employee;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;Where the agency's action was brought to "exert improper pressure on the employee to act in certain ways";</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;Where the agency committed a "gross procedural error" which "prolonged the proceeding" or "severely prejudiced" the employee;</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In challenging the arbitrator's decision denying the request for fees, the union makes essentially three arguments. First, the union contends that under the applicable standards, the arbitrator was required to award fees. Second, the union contends that the arbitrator improperly failed to apply the findings he made in his decision on the merits to the question whether to award fees. And third, the union argues that the arbitrator's failure to provide reasons for his decision to deny attorney fees requires that the decision be reversed.[1] The court will address the three arguments in the order presented above.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;In its opening brief, the union argued at several points that the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 504; 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d), governs the attorney fee award in this case. The union did not press that argument in its reply brief or at oral argument, and it is clear that it is unavailing. The Equal Access to Justice Act applies only to a "civil action," 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d)(1)(A), or an "adversary adjudication," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 504(a)(1). The latter term is defined exclude adjudications involving "the selection or tenure an employee," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 504(b)(1)(C); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 554(a)(2). <span class="Italic">See Gavette v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 808 F.2d 1456, 1461 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) ("Here, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 504...does not apply to the board proceedings because the case does involve tenure. Also inapplicable is section 2412(d)(3) of 28 U.S.C....because <span id="page_2432"></span>the present case is not an 'action for judicial review of an adversary adjudication.'"); <span class="Italic">Olsen Dep't of Commerce, Census Bureau</span>, 735 F.2d 558, 562 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;The union's third argument--that the arbitrator erred by failing to provide an explanation for his decision not to award fees--has more force.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This court has held that "[t]he principal constraint upon the Board's section 7701(g) discretion to determine when an award is warranted arises from the Board's duty to exercise that discretion reasonably, which necessarily includes the duty to articulate a rational explanation for each award." <span class="Italic">Price v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 398 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (quoting <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 434).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That principle decides this case.&#x2003;In order for this court to be able to conduct its reviewing responsibility, even on a matter as to which the adjudicator is given broad deference, it is ordinarily necessary for the adjudicator to provide some sort of explanation for its action. That is a principle frequently reiterated in administrative law decisions in various contexts. As the Supreme Court explained in <span class="Italic">Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass'n v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co</span>., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting <span class="Italic">Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States</span>, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)), "[t]he scope of review under the 'arbitrary and capricious' standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency. Nevertheless, the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a 'rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.'"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, a court will "uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency's path may reasonably be discerned." <span class="Italic">Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc</span>., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974). But a reviewing court "may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency's action that the agency itself has not given." <span class="Italic">Motor Vehicle Mfrs</span>., 463 U.S. at 43; <span class="Italic">see also SEC v. Chenery Corp</span>., 332 U.S. 194, 196-97 (1947) ("It will not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency's action....").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the procedural requirements governing adjudicative hearings under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 556, 557, do not apply to Merit Systems Protection Board and parallel arbitration proceedings, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 554(a)(2), it is nonetheless instructive that the Act, which sets forth principles broadly applicable to federal administrative proceedings, provides that all decisions by adjudicators in cases in which a hearing is required to be held "shall include a statement of...findings and conclusion, and the reasons or basis therefor, on all material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 557(c)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This court and others have made the same point in different contexts.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fla. Power &#x0026; Light Co. v. Lorion</span>, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985) ("[I]f the reviewing court simply cannot evaluate the challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it, the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation."); <span class="Italic">Palantir USG, Inc. v. United States</span>, 904 F.3d 980, 994 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting <span class="Italic">Sierra Club v. Gorsuch</span>, 715 F.2d 653, 660-61 (D.C. Cir. 1983) ("If there is reasoned decisionmaking lurking behind such agency behavior, it is yet to be articulated. For agency action to be upheld, it must not only be explainable; it must be explained."); <span class="Italic">Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States</span>, 238 F.3d 1324, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("[E]ven if the agency is not obligated to provide reasons, a court may nonetheless order the agency to provide explanation if such an explanation is required for meaningful judicial review."); <span class="Italic">Kitchens v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 535 F.2d 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 1978) ("The statement of reasons need not include detailed findings of fact but must inform the court and the petitioner of the grounds of decision and the essential facts upon which the administrative decision was based."); <span class="Italic">Kowal v. United States</span>, 412 F.2d 867, 873-74 (Ct. Cl. 1969) ("If an administrative conclusion is affirmed because of the existence of evidence which might support a ground not set forth, a court runs the danger of upholding a decision never in fact made.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That principle has been applied repeatedly in the context of attorney fee awards.&#x2003;Although such awards are typically reviewed for an abuse of discretion, courts have been careful to insist that the adjudicators responsible for considering attorney fee awards provide a sufficient explanation for their decisions to facilitate appellate review. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983) ("We reemphasize that the district court has discretion in determining the amount of a fee award. This is appropriate in view of the district court's superior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters. It remains important, however, for the district court to provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award."); <span class="Italic">Biery v. United States</span>, 818 F.3d 704, 710 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (same); <span class="Italic">Wagner v. Shinseki</span>, 640 F.3d 1255, 1261 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (same); <span class="Italic">Libas, Ltd. v. United States</span>, 314 F.3d 1362, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (reversing denial of fee award where trial court did not "sufficiently explain its basis for denying the EAJA petition for attorneys' fees and expenses"; holding that trial court's discretion over attorney fee award "is not without limits and the abuse of discretion standard does not dilute our meaningful examination of the trial court's decision").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In some instances, the matter may be so clear that the failure of the adjudicator to provide an explanation for its action will be harmless error, so that this court can enter judgment in accordance with the ruling below despite the absence of an explanation for that ruling. But this is not such a case. In fact, the circumstances of this case illustrate why an explanation of the reasons for a ruling such as the denial of fees is typically critical to judicial review of that ruling.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">When an arbitrator grants or denies attorney fees, the arbitrator must set forth specific findings supporting his or her determinations on each pertinent statutory requirement under &#x00A7; 7701(g). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 577, 582 (2012). Where an arbitrator's attorney-fee determination is deficient, the Authority "take[s] the action necessary to assure that the award is consistent with applicable statutory standards." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3020</span>, 64 FLRA 596, 597-98 (2010) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Agric., Animal &#x0026; Plant Health Inspection Serv., Plant Prot. &#x0026; Quarantine</span>, 53 FLRA 1688, 1695 (1998)). If an award does not contain the findings necessary to enable the Authority to assess the arbitrator's legal conclusions, and those findings cannot be derived from the record, then the attorney-fee issue will be remanded to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator, absent settlement, so that the requisite findings can be made. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA at 582. <span class="Italic">See also, e.g., AFGE, Local 1148</span>, 65 FLRA 402, 404 (2010).

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator's award--which provides a one-sentence, unexplained denial of attorney fees--does not discuss or apply any of the statutory requirements set forth above. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA at 582. Moreover, the record is insufficient for the Authority to determine whether the Arbitrator's denial of attorney fees is consistent with those requirements. As the Arbitrator is the appropriate authority under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.807(a) for resolving the fee request, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to address whether the Union's fee request satisfies the requirements of the BPA and &#x00A7; 7701(g).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator stated in the fee award that she "considered the Agency's objections, but [found] no reason to challenge anything...on [the petition's] [i]nvoice." However, in making this finding, the Arbitrator did not set forth any factual findings to support her conclusion that the Union's attorney-fee petition was reasonable.[21] The Authority notes that while the Union's attorney submitted copies of his previous attorney-fee awards based on apparently similar arbitrations, these previous fee awards provided a lower customary billing rate than what the Union's attorney requests now.[22] Likewise, the Arbitrator awarded the Union's requested attorney-fee petition for 147.95 total hours of work without making any determination as to the reasonableness of the hours expended given the attorney's experience and the complexity of the case.[23] In light of the Agency's numerous challenges to the attorney-fee petition and the utter paucity of factual findings by the Arbitrator, we find that the Arbitrator failed to set forth sufficient factual findings to support the award of attorney fees. Therefore, we find that the Arbitrator's grant of fees is contrary to the BPA.</p>

For example, the agency knew or should have known it would not prevail because the [g]rievant had plainly performed the duties of a properly classified higher-grade position and had not been compensated."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator concluded that attorney fees were not warranted in the interest of justice because, among other reasons, the Agency did not act with knowledge that it could not prevail on the merits of the case. The only specific interest of justice factor cited by the Union is that the Agency knew or should have known it would not prevail. Because the Union provides no further explanation as to why the Arbitrator's specific factual finding should be overturned, and does not specify that attorney fees are warranted under any of the other interest of justice factors, the Union has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator erred. Accordingly, we find that the denial of attorney fees is not deficient as contrary to the Back Pay Act, and we deny the Union's exception. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216</span>, 50 FLRA 48, 50 (1994); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, Cal.</span>, 49 FLRA 820, 823 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1482 and Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps, Barstow</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-46.html">70 FLRA 214</a>, 214-15 (2017), determined that an award was sufficiently specific that adopted the reasoning in the agency's brief to deny a fee request resulting from mitigation of a disciplinary action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its brief, the Agency responded that the Union was not the prevailing party because the Arbitrator reduced, but did not reverse, the suspension. As to the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors, the Agency argued that, because the Arbitrator found that the grievant deserved discipline, he was not substantially innocent and the discipline was not clearly without merit or wholly unfounded. The Agency also asserted that it acted in good faith because the Agency's deciding official relied upon evidence obtained from a law-enforcement investigation of the altercation to determine the appropriate discipline, and the Arbitrator did not find any disparate treatment between the grievant and the other employee involved in the altercation. And, finally, the Agency argued that the Arbitrator's mitigation of the suspension did not establish that it knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. In particular, the Agency asserted that the deciding official relied on "trustworthy" evidence from the law-enforcement investigation and followed the parties' collective-bargaining agreement in deciding the appropriate discipline; therefore, the Agency had no reason to know that the Arbitrator would not sustain the fourteen-day suspension. Consequently, according to the Agency, the Union was not entitled to attorney fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the fee award, the Arbitrator denied the Union's petition. The fee award states: "Having considered the authority and argument presented, the Arbitrator found the position taken by the Agency...in its [brief]...to be well taken."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When resolving a request for attorney fees, arbitrators must set forth specific findings supporting their determinations on each pertinent statutory requirement.[9] Here, in denying the Union's fee petition, the Arbitrator stated that he found the Agency's position in its brief "to be well taken." The Agency contends that the Arbitrator's statement indicates that he "adopted the...authorities, findings, and arguments" that were set forth in the Agency brief. We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 342</span>, 69 FLRA 278, 279 (2016) (citing <span class="Italic">NAGE, SEIU, Local 551</span>, 68 FLRA 285, 289 (2015)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency brief addresses each pertinent statutory requirement for attorney fees, and argues why the Union is not entitled to attorney fees under each requirement. Thus, we find that the fee award, read together with the Agency brief, sufficiently explains the Arbitrator's determinations on each pertinent statutory requirement. In this regard, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Newport, Rhode Island (Navy)</span>,[13] which the Union cites. In <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, the arbitrator stated that she had "considered" both parties' arguments, but made no findings regarding which arguments she relied on in determining to grant fees.[15] In contrast, the Arbitrator here stated that he considered the arguments of both parties and that he found the Agency's position "to be well taken." The remaining decisions cited by the Union in its exceptions are similarly inapposite.[17]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In conclusion, we find that the Arbitrator adopted the detailed analysis set forth in the Agency brief. Therefore, the Union's sole exception--that the fee award is deficient because the Arbitrator failed to articulate specific findings regarding each statutory requirement for attorney fees--lacks merit. Because the Union does not explain, in its exceptions, why any of the adopted analysis is contrary to the requirements of the Back Pay Act, there is no basis for setting aside the fee award as contrary to law.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator considered and disallowed specific hours claimed by the Union after considering the parties' submissions, the length of the investigative file (only 247 pages), the nature of the case (as involving a fourteen-day suspension), and the length of the hearing (two days).

<p class="noindent">The requirement of a crafted award in a counsel fee case extends to the underlying entitlement to fees as well as to the reasonableness of the fees claimed.

<p class="noindent-1">In resolving whether an award of attorney fees is reasonable as required by the Back Pay Act, the Authority has taken into account court decisions applying other federal fee-shifting statutes with a similar requirement. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Def., Def. Fin. &#x0026; Accounting Serv., </span>60 FLRA 281, 286 (2004) (applying <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart, </span>461 U.S. 424 (1983) (<span class="Italic">Hensley</span>)). In particular, consistent with <span class="Italic">Hensley, </span>the Authority reviews contested awards of attorney fees for the number of hours requested to ensure that the number of hours expended was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>When arbitrators have not made specific factual findings to support their conclusions that the number of hours expended is reasonable, the Authority has remanded to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator for further findings. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Detroit, Mich., </span>64 FLRA 794, 797 (2010) (<span class="Italic">VAMC</span>). In this regard, remands are appropriate because the arbitrator, as the fact-finder, is in the best position to make determinations as to the reasonableness of the number of hours expended. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the foregoing precedent is expressly based on not only the Back Pay Act, but also other federal fee-shifting statutes, we apply this approach in this case involving an award of fees under the FLSA. <span class="Italic"></span>Here, in view of the Agency's multiple challenges to specific expenditures of time of the Union's attorneys, the Arbitrator failed to set forth sufficient factual findings to support Attorney Fees Award No. 1. Accordingly, we remand the matter of the number of hours reasonably expended in relation to Attorney Fees Award No. 1 for specific findings by the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent">Assuming that the arbitrator provides a reasoned explanation of a fee award, FLRA defers to the arbitrator's findings if they are consistent with the requirements "interest of justice" standard under the Back Pay Act, <span class="Italic">VAMC N. Chicago and AFGE Local 2107</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v52/52-037.html">52 FLRA 387</a>, 398 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fee petition does not present an opportunity for reexamination of the merits of the underlying award or of the personnel action treated by the underlying award.&#x2003;The determination of whether the interest of justice is met ought to be made on the basis of the facts as they were determined by the award on the merits, not through reargument and reexamination of those facts during litigation over fees. The Authority made that point in <span class="Italic">DOD, Defense Distribution Region East, New Cumberland and AFGE Local 2004</span>, 51 FLRA 155, 159-60 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not dispute that the Arbitrator awarded attorney fees in conjunction with his original award of backpay.&#x2003;Instead, the Agency argues that, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 532.511(b)(4), the grievants could not legitimately recover this backpay for exposure to toxic chemicals because of their earlier receipt of an award of EDP for asbestos exposure and that, therefore, they suffered no reduction in pay. We reject the Agency's argument as an attempt to collaterally attack the Arbitrator's original award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority recognized in <span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark</span> <span class="Italic">Office and Patent Office Professional Association</span>, 22 FLRA 7, 10 (1986), when a party fails to file timely exceptions to an arbitration award under section 7122(a) of the Statute, the award becomes final and binding and the Agency must take such actions as are required by the award. As explained by the court in <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 775 F.2d 727, 735 (6th Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_2435"></span>[s]ince an award becomes final and must be implemented if the parties fail to file an exception within the required period, the necessary implication is that a party can no longer challenge the award by any means. It has become final for all purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency did not file exceptions to the original award. Under the terms of section 7122(b) of the Statute, and as the Agency here concedes, the Arbitrator's original award of backpay became final and binding. Consequently, the Agency was for all purposes unequivocally obligated to comply with that award and cannot now challenge any of its terms. <span class="Italic">See Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 1409 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (court affirmed the Authority's determination that, in an unfair labor practice proceeding brought as a result of an agency's refusal to comply with an arbitration award, the agency could not attack the arbitrator's contractual jurisdiction in the original proceeding).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency asserts that it is now challenging only the supplemental award of attorney fees, in fact it argues here that the grievants suffered no compensable reduction of compensation, a contention that directly challenges the Arbitrator's contrary conclusion in the original award. As such a contention may not be raised at this stage of the proceedings, the Arbitrator's original award remains intact. Therefore, that award satisfies the statutory requirements that the grievants were affected by an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the withdrawal or reduction in the grievants' pay and differentials and that the fees were awarded in conjunction with an award of backpay on correction of the unjustified personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent">Exceptions to a supplemental award of counsel fees should not be turned into a untimely reexamination of the underlying award on the merits of the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VA Northport VA Hosp. and AFGE Local 1843</span>, 67 FLRA 325, 326 (2014) (rejecting argument that award involving fees was clarification of the merits award).</p>
