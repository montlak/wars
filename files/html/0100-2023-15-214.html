<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-213"><span class="space">a.</span> Constitutional Analysis</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In the context of trademark infringement litigation, the Federal Circuit said of First Amendment interests, In re: Elster, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20220224155">___ F.4th ___,</a> ___ (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2732"></span>The First Amendment interests here are undoubtedly substantial. "Whatever differences may exist about interpretations of the First Amendment, there is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of that Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs." <span class="Italic">Mills v. Alabama,</span> 384 U.S. 214, 218 (1966); <span class="Italic">see also N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan,</span> 376 U.S. 254, 269 (1964) ("The general proposition that freedom of expression upon public questions is secured by the First Amendment has long been settled by our decisions."); <span class="Italic">Hustler Mag., Inc. v. Falwell,</span> 485 U.S. 46, 50 (1988) ("At the heart of the First Amendment is the recognition of the fundamental importance of the free flow of ideas and opinions on matters of public interest and concern."). Indeed, "speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government." <span class="Italic">Garrison v. Louisiana,</span> 379 U.S. 64, 74-75 (1964).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In particular, "the right to criticize public men" is "[o]ne of the prerogatives of American citizenship." <span class="Italic">Baumgartner v. United States,</span> 322 U.S. 665, 673-74 (1944). Such criticism "does not lose its constitutional protection merely because it is effective criticism and hence diminishes [public figures'] official reputations." <span class="Italic">N.Y. Times,</span> 376 U.S. at 273. To the contrary, the First Amendment "has its fullest and most urgent application" to speech concerning public officials. <span class="Italic">Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy,</span> 401 U.S. 265, 272 (1971). Laws suppressing the right "to praise or criticize governmental agents" generally cannot be squared with the First Amendment. <span class="Italic">Mills,</span> 384 U.S. at 219.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Issues of First Amendment protections arose in <span class="Italic">Prescott v. DHHS</span>, 6 MSPR 252, 259-60, 6 MSPB 216 (1981), involving a health science administrator removed for expressing disagreement with agency policy to persons outside the agency. Those individuals were urged to lobby to change agency policy to conform with the ideas advanced by the appellant. Speech of government employees enjoys First Amendment protection if, after balancing the interests of the employee and the employer, the conclusion is reached that the employee's interest in speech outweighs the government's interest as an employer in efficient management. Determining that the appellant distorted the position of the agency in his communications in order to elicit a response supportive of a grievance he had pending about agency policy, and concluding that the communications to outsiders disrupted agency operations, the Board resolved that the communications were unprotected. Discharge was sustained. The Board went on to consider whether the removal was in reprisal for the grievance filed by the appellant or for his whistleblowing activities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Farris v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 568, 572, 13 MSPB 200 (1983), the appellant was discharged for charges that included distribution near an employees' entrance of a flyer critical of postal management. Concluding that the conduct was protected by the First Amendment, the Board cited <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> and decided that at the heart of the inquiry was not whether the speech was true or false, but whether it was disruptive to the employment relationship. The employees who received the pamphlet reacted with apathy. The Board discerned no disruption justifying discipline for distribution of the flyer. The Board declined to presume disruption from the distribution of the flyer. The appellant was not a supervisor; he did not directly criticize superiors by name; he had no position of significant responsibility or influence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A different result was reached in <span class="Italic">Osokow v. OPM</span>, 25 MSPR 319, 323-24 (1984). Appellant distributed leaflets outside his agency building calling two named supervisors incompetent. The leaflet was essentially a grievance with no public support. There was no exposure of OPM dereliction or wrongdoing--only the appellant's expression of dissatisfaction with his supervisors. The Board discounted the appellant's suggestion that grievance and appeals processes, being slow, justified his actions. Although the appellant was off duty during the leafleting and it was conducted outside the government office, the effect of impugning the supervisors was to destroy close working relationships and to undermine the ability of the agency to carry out its mission. There was evidence of disruption of the office routine as a result of the leafleting, conduct having a possibly adverse effect on the appellant's ability to carry out his duties as an investigator. The Board concluded that the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balance tilted in favor of the agency. The First Amendment did not require the agency to tolerate action it reasonably believed would disrupt the office, undermine supervisory authority, and destroy close working relationships. Dismissal was sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Santos v. Customs Serv.</span>, 642 F.2d 21 (1st Cir. 1981) (affirming removal of an employee who, during the period of a disciplinary suspension, circulated comments and leaflets that attacked the charges against him to coworkers and others outside the agency who were unconnected with the dispute, with the only effect being to lessen the respect and confidence in the integrity of the Customs Service); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Goldwasser v. Brown</span>, 417 F.2d 1169 (D.C. Cir. 1969) (no constitutional protection for personal views expressed by a civilian Air Force language teacher to foreign language students when the expression of those views detracted from the appellant's instructional responsibilities).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A free speech case was presented in <span class="Italic">Brown v. FAA</span>, 15 MSPR 224, 226 (1983). The appellant was a supervisory air traffic control specialist who, during the strike of the air traffic controllers, appeared before a group of controllers and in remarks reported on national television said, "I'm so happy that you're together--stay together please--because if you do you win." At the meeting the supervisor also told the controllers that he wished they would return to work. In comments to a news reporter, he said that although he supported some of the strikers' demands, the strike was illegal. The agency fired Brown for supporting the strike.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sustaining the dismissal, the Board approached the First Amendment claim regarding the supervisor's speech through the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> test by balancing the needs of free speech versus the needs of the employer in conducting an efficient public service. Factors relevant to the analysis included whether: the speech was knowingly or intentionally false; it related to a matter of public concern; it interfered with the maintenance of either discipline by immediate superiors or harmony among coworkers; it was critical of supervisors with whom the speaker maintained the kinds of close working relationships supporting a persuasive claim that personal loyalty and confidence were necessary to their proper functioning; the speech impeded the employee's proper performance of his daily duties; and whether the speech interfered with the regular operation of the office. Also cited by the Board was <span class="Italic">Connick v. Myers</span>, 461 U.S. 138 (1983), holding that if disciplinary action is involved, First Amendment protection for a public employee's speech extends only to speech on matters of public concern. The Court noted in <span class="Italic">Connick</span> that "when a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern, but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest, unless there are present the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate forum to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee's behavior." Consistent with <span class="Italic">Pickering</span>, <span class="Italic">Connick</span> held that the government's burden in justifying a specific personnel action depends on the degree of public concern involved in the subject matter of the speech. The Board concluded that the issues before it were whether the appellant's speech involved a matter of public concern and, if so, what protection was afforded to that speech.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the Board discerned little public concern about the comments because they were made in a local union hall and were directed to the striking controllers at the facility. The remarks did not have significance for the public in terms either of air travel safety or the issues involved in the strike. The speech did not contribute to the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> concept of free and open debate vital to an informed decisional process by the electorate. Only limited First Amendment protection was applicable. The public interest in the content of the speech was tangential. Determining that the speech tended to encourage the controllers in their strike, the Board concluded that pursuant to <span class="Italic">Connick</span>, because close working relationships were necessary to fulfill the agency mission, considerable deference to the employer's judgment concerning discipline was appropriate. The employer was not required to allow events to unfold to the extent of disruption in the office and destruction of working relationships before taking action. The agency acted properly. Although there was no evidence that the supervisor's remarks had a specific effect on any controller, the speech had a clear potential for strengthening the strikers' will to strike. The speech was contrary to the supervisor's obligation to assist the agency in its efforts to fulfill its mission. Management could not be expected to retain confidence in the ability of the appellant to function as a supervisor worthy of respect by his subordinates, peers, and supervisors. The appellant's limited First Amendment interest in speaking out on a matter only tangentially related to a matter of public concern did not require the agency to tolerate conduct it reasonably believed would undermine its ability to fulfill its mission of service to the public in a time of national emergency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board Member Devaney dissented in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>. He argued that because the remarks were given national attention, it was clear that they were about a topic of national interest; further, there was no evidence of adverse impact upon the workplace or diminished confidence in the supervisor by coworkers and subordinates. At most, Devaney argued, the penalty should not have exceeded a demotion to a nonsupervisory position, even if the speech was unprotected and had some nexus and adverse effect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown</span> reached the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 735 F.2d 543, 548-49 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Accepting the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> analytical model as controlling, the court balanced the interests. On the agency's side were the seriousness of the strike, the fact that the remarks were made during the grace period allowed for strikers to return to their jobs, Brown's position as a supervisor to whom employees could be expected to look for guidance, the encouragement to continue the strike implicit in the remarks, and the display of managerial disunity inherent in the remarks. Weighing in for the employee were the lack of evidence that the remarks dissuaded any controllers from returning to work, the fact that the comments were made during off-duty hours, the lack of agency instructions barring conversations between supervisors and the press or strikers, and the low-level supervisory position held by Brown. Balancing these interests, the court determined that in the national emergency presented by the strike, the interests of the agency outweighed Brown's interest in free speech. The nexus analysis was similar to that of the constitutional analysis concerning the free speech issue; the relation between service efficiency and discipline was the same as the balance between free speech and agency interests in maintaining disciplinary control over speech by supervisors. Considering mitigation, the court noted that some of Brown's statements attempted to secure the return of the strikers; Brown had shown <span id="Page_2733"></span>loyalty in working long hours during the strike; he had a service record of 25 years; and the remarks were brief and ambiguous. The court suggested:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e recognize the considerable discretion which the employing agency rightfully must exercise in this area....&#8197;Nevertheless, we believe that Brown's case is exceptional....&#8197;Perhaps it is not far off the mark to characterize the agency's action, in Brown's isolated case, as one of overreaction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court reversed the removal and remanded the case for mitigation. On remand, the Board decided to demote Mr. Brown with the least possible reduction in grade to a nonsupervisory position. The Board justified its action, involving mitigation of the penalty, on the basis that the appellant breached his supervisory duty of loyalty and cooperation at the time when the need for trust was most acute. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 21 MSPR 572, 573 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stanek v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 805 F.2d 1572, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1986), considered the discharge of an employee who wrote to and solicited direct comments on agency programs from persons affected by agency operations. Although the matters at issue were of public importance, the employee was not favored under the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing test:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence establishes that Stanek, through his Paradox paper, set up a private clearinghouse for state highway research needs. The evidence also establishes that the FHWA, through its various programs and affiliates, had set up its own system for collecting highway research information from the states. If you did what Stanek wanted, probably you did not do what FHWA wanted. Stanek's program directly and substantially interfered with the FHWA's program. Stanek also ignored supervisors' requests to clear all outgoing correspondence with them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Common sense suggests that an agency cannot function correctly where an employee establishes an unauthorized quasi-official "office" that directly competes in function with an existing government program. A predecessor court noted the general rule that "[m]anagement cannot function effectively unless it operates 'with one voice' <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis others</span>." <span class="Italic">Brousseau v. United States</span>, 640 F.2d 1235 (Ct. Cl. 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Stanek's Paradox paper system is particularly objectionable because Stanek's assertions that he would send the collected information to congressional committees was likely to entice the states to send him their information, on the belief that their needs would receive more direct priority than through official government channels. We hold, therefore, that the FHWA's interest in maintaining a coherent system of coordinating its research needs outweighs Stanek's interest in commenting publicly on STRS.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Addressing the reasonableness of the removal penalty in <span class="Italic">Stanek</span>, the court observed, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1580:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...There is substantial evidence on record that the charges were very serious, that Stanek ignored various warnings and reprimands by his supervisors regarding his unauthorized activities and, therefore, that an additional reprimand or suspension would be insufficient to deter Stanek from repeating his conduct. It is easy to imagine how long a General Motors engineer would last if he repeatedly proclaimed to press and public his opinion that Chrysler cars were superior. It is only in government that activities, potentially disruptive and destructive of morale, enjoy the protection they do under law but, as shown above, we follow our highest court in recognizing that a line must be drawn somewhere. We also note that the board found the penalty imposed to be consistent with the agency's penalty tables....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit once again addressed public criticism in <span class="Italic">Fiorillo v. DOJ, Bureau of Prisons</span>, 795 F.2d 1544, 1550-51 (Fed. Cir. 1986). A GS-8 senior officer specialist at a Bureau of Prisons correctional facility made some comments to newspapers critical of prison management. The comments were published. The employee was suspended and demoted for conduct that could bring discredit upon the institution. An arbitrator sustained the agency action and the case was brought to the court. The test for review of the speech under <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> and <span class="Italic">Connick</span> was:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...If petitioner's public condemnation of the administration of Terminal Island is "'a matter of legitimate public concern' upon which 'free and open debate is vital to informed decisionmaking by the electorate,'"...censure by the agency in the form of suspension and demotion cannot be condoned; whereas, if he spoke "upon matters only of personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances," this court "is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Whether an employee's speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by [its] content, form, and context...as revealed by the whole record." <span class="Italic">Connick</span>....&#8197;In addition, to be given "whistleblower" status and thus the protections under 5 USC 2302(b)(8), the <span class="Italic">primary</span> motivation of the employee must be the desire to inform the public on matters of public concern, and not personal vindictiveness. <span class="Italic">See</span> 461 U.S. at 148. Here, the newspapers that quoted petitioner related his allegations (a) that a female inmate and a female employee were sexually attacked five years previously, (b) that breaches of national security had existed in the prison, and (c) that "the prison is still 'saturated with corruption.'" We are satisfied that the arbitrator did not err in determining that the record as a whole indicated that "the grievant's motive for releasing such generalized and objurgatory statements to the press was for personal reasons and not to inform the public of matters of general concern," so that petitioner was not entitled to protection as a "whistleblower" under section 2302(b)(8). Although portions of petitioner's "speech" to the press were related to items about which the public was concerned in years past, the "news" was stale, and the newspaper articles were essentially the airings of petitioner's personal complaints. Mere publication does not clothe them with First Amendment protection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner's attempt to parse the transmitted information to demonstrate that the "personal" attributes attached only to one or two sentences of the information miss the mark. It is the nature of the whole communication that must be reviewed to determine whether it is of "public concern"--not sentences taken in isolation. In this case, petitioner's press conferences as a whole "reflect one employee's dissatisfaction with [his supervisor] and an attempt to turn that displeasure into a cause celebre."...A complaint "not otherwise of public concern does not attain that status because its subject matter could, in different circumstances, have been the topic of a communication to the public that might be of general interest."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying the balancing test, the <span class="Italic">Connick</span> Court stated that it is not necessary for the agency to prove that the efficiency of the service would be promoted by the employee's adverse action, but only that, under the circumstances, the potential harm is reasonably apprehensible....&#8197;In this case, the agency has demonstrated that petitioner possesses a propensity for making at least some baseless public allegations against the agency. The agency was not unreasonably concerned that petitioner's statements would have adversely affected the discipline and morale at Terminal Island. Under the circumstances, deference to the agency's judgment is appropriate....&#8197;Accordingly, we cannot fault the arbitrator's determination that petitioner's suspension and demotion would promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The opinion in <span class="Italic">Fiorillo</span> prompted a dissent by Judge Newman, who believed that the appellant's statements were clearly of public concern, that they were promoted by a lawsuit filed by the appellant that was well within his constitutional right to file, that the statements were not shown to have disrupted the efficient operations of the Bureau, that the court had an obligation to scrutinize the published articles more carefully and to give no deference to an arbitrator's findings on constitutional issues, and that the court incorrectly applied the tests of <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> and <span class="Italic">Connick</span>. The judge also felt that the Bureau's policy statements were constitutionally overbroad and therefore impermissibly applied to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may have a regulation that prohibits employees from taking actions adversely affecting the confidence of the public in the government. A critical statement to an outsider falls within the regulation. The Board then determines whether the regulation has been violated and, if so, the Board determines any First Amendment defense. Whether the employee's speech is on a matter of public concern is examined first. If the matter is one of public concern, the communication is then analyzed to determine whether it undermines the agency's confidence in the appellant's ability to deal with members of the public and whether it has a significantly negative impact on the agency's image. The better and protected course, the Board implied, would be to bring the allegation of agency wrongdoing to "the attention of appropriate officials, such as the agency's Inspector General or the Special Counsel." <span class="Italic">Jackson v. SBA</span>, 40 MSPR 137, 146 n.2 (1989) (suggestion to an outsider of agency racial discrimination, resulting in charges of insubordination and the violation of agency standards of conduct).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Voorhis v. DHS</span>, 116 MSPR 538, 550 n.5, 2011 MSPB 67 (2011), disclosures of government information from a confidential law enforcement agency's database for the purpose of influencing a political campaign were not constitutionally protected, although the appellant unsuccessfully argued that the purpose of the disclosure was to demonstrate mismanagement of a government program:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not challenged the administrative judge's disposition of his First Amendment claim. Nonetheless, we disagree with his conclusion that the appellant's disclosures were not protected under the First Amendment on the grounds that they were made in his capacity as a Special Agent. Initial Decision at 38, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Garcetti v. Ceballos,</span> 547 U.S. 410 (2006) (statements made by public employees pursuant to their official duties are not protected under the First Amendment). The record reflects that the appellant's disclosures clearly were not made pursuant to his official duties and, therefore, we reject any reliance on <span class="Italic">Garcetti</span>. Rather, we conclude that the correct approach to the appellant's First Amendment claim is to review it under the traditional <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> analysis; we have done so and find that the government's concern in protecting against unauthorized access and disclosure of law enforcement information outweighs the appellant's interest in providing evidence of allegedly objectionable plea bargaining practices to a political campaign. <span id="Page_2734"></span><span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Education of Township High School District 205,</span> 391 U.S. 563 (1968).</p>
