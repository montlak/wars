<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-147"><span class="space">b.</span> Bulletin Board</h5>
<p class="noindent">The union has no statutory right to use an agency bulletin board. <span class="Italic">DOD, Dept. of Air Force, 31st Combat Support Group, Homestead AFB and NFFE Local 1167</span>, 13 FLRA 239, 245 (1983) (ALJ Decision). An agency does not interfere with protected rights by directing a union officer to remove a poster from a passageway outside the employee's office space. Permission to post material may be subject to restrictions or limitations. There is no general statutory right to post material in other public areas on agency property. Access to bulletin boards or to other public areas for posting material remains within the agency's discretion to authorize, either by the negotiated agreement or past practice. <span class="Italic">FEC and NTEU</span>, 20 FLRA 20, 21 (1985), <span class="Italic">modified</span>, 34 FLRA 1120 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">OPM offered its recommendations concerning union use of bulletin boards in its April 12, 2022, Guidance on Implementation of EO 14025: Highlighting Union Rights to Access and Communicate with Bargaining Unit Employees, in the FAQ section:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2)&#x2003;Do agencies have to allow the union access to agency bulletin boards?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies are strongly encouraged to allow union access to agency bulletin boards to facilitate implementation of the policies outlined in EO 14025. Agencies have discretion to authorize access to government property to employee groups. In 5 CFR &#x00A7; 251.202, OPM regulations state in part that "[a]n agency may provide support services to an organization when the agency determines that such action would benefit the agency's programs or would be warranted as a service to employees who are members of the organization and complies with applicable statutes and regulations." It further states that "[a]gencies may provide Government resources support to organizations (such as space for meeting purposes and the use of agency bulletin boards, internal agency mail distribution systems, electronic bulletin boards and other means of informing agency employees about meetings and activities) in accordance with appropriate General Services Administration regulations contained in title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The mere provision of such support to any organization is not to be construed as Federal sponsorship, sanction, or endorsement of the organization or its activities."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While these regulations provide a framework for consulting and communicating with non-labor organizations representing Federal employees, they acknowledge that certain types of support can be provided to employee organizations. In the case of labor unions, this type of support is normally achieved through the collective bargaining process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA or Authority) case law has addressed this issue. The FLRA has found that a union has no statutory right to use agency bulletin boards unless authorized at management discretion through a negotiated agreement or past practice. In <span class="Italic">Federal Election Commission and NTEU</span>, 20 FLRA 3, the Authority upheld the AJ's decision that stated in part, "Since unions and employees do not have a statutory right to post material on bulletin boards, it follows that there is no general statutory right to post material in other public areas on agency property. Thus, access to bulletin boards or to other public areas for posting material remains a matter within an agency's discretion to authorize, either by way of provision in the parties' negotiated agreement or as a matter of past practice in allowing such access to its employees." With this in mind, agencies are strongly encouraged to exercise their discretion and engage unions through collective bargaining and allow union access to agency bulletin boards to facilitate implementation of the policies of EO 14025.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has also ruled that, where an agency allows employees to post non-work-related materials on agency bulletin boards, they must also allow the union to post union-related materials. In <span class="Italic">DOD Dependents Schools, Mediterranean Region, Naples, American High School (Naples, Italy and Will Schussel</span>, 21 FLRA 849 (1986), the Authority adopted the ALJs conclusion and findings, which stated in part, "...where an agency grants its employees a privileged means of communication, such as a bulletin board for posting a variety of non-work-related personal items and messages, the agency may not prohibit the posting of messages and notices related to unions and collective bargaining."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM encourages agencies to apply this recommendation to <span class="Italic">virtual "bulletin boards"</span> and not limit application of this recommendation to physical bulletin boards located in agency facilities. For example, if the agency has an Intranet site, an internal site available only to personnel for purposes of finding and sharing information, an agency could include information regarding names and contact information for the union officials representing bargaining unit employees and post the collective bargaining agreements covering these bargaining units for all employees to access.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3)&#x2003;Can the union post anything on agency bulletin boards?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While a union can establish the right to post on agency bulletin boards through collective bargaining, an agency can establish publication standards that outline the requirements for what is allowed to be posted <span id="Page_1364"></span>on bulletin boards. As long as the publication meets that standard, however, the union should be allowed to post the material. In <span class="Italic">Scott Air Force Base, IL and NAGE, Local R7-23</span>, 34 FLRA 1129 (1990), the Authority stated, "Where a right of access to agency property has been established by past practice, an employer would reasonably tend to discourage union activity in violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute if...the employer removes union material from the employer's property where the union had been permitted to post notices and the posted material meets the employer's established standards."</p>
<p class="noindent">Once the agency grants its employees a privileged means of communication, e.g., a bulletin board for posting a variety of nonwork-related personal items and messages, the agency may not prohibit the posting of messages and notices related to unions and collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">DODDS, Mediterranean Region, Naples Am. High School and Schussel</span>, 21 FLRA 849, 863 (1986) (ALJ Decision). Removal of materials by management employees from the union bulletin board, after the agency agreed to permit the union to use the bulletin board, interfered with protected rights. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Prison Sys., FCI Milan and AFGE Local 1741</span>, 17 FLRA 1023, 1037 (1985) (ALJ Decision), <span class="Italic">modified</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 34 FLRA 1129 (1990), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. An employer may not remove a union newsletter from the employer's bulletin board if the employees and the union were permitted to post personal and official union notices. By removing and prohibiting future posting of those notices, the agency directly interfered with the right of union officials to communicate with and represent employees in the unit, and the agency interfered with the right of unit employees to seek assistance from their union representatives. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, OWCP, Branch of Special Claims and Garland</span>, 11 FLRA 77, 83 (1983) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may insist that its publication standards be met when the union seeks to post information on an agency bulletin board (in the case before FLRA, an electronic bulletin board), as explained in <span class="Italic">DOD, Army Reserve Personnel Command and AFGE Local 900</span>, 55 FLRA 1309, 1314 (2000), involving an agency policy that precluded posting of annoying, harassing, lewd, or offensive material:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois</span>, 34 FLRA 1129, 1136 (1990) <span class="Italic">(Scott)</span>, on which the General Counsel relies to support its exceptions, the Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Where a right of access to agency property has been established by past practice [use of the Agency newspaper, in that case], an employer would reasonably tend to discourage union activity in violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute if....&#8197;(2) the employer removes union material from the employer's property where the union had been permitted to post notices <span class="Italic">and the posted material</span> <span class="Italic">meets the employer's established standards[.]</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">34 FLRA at 1136, emphasis added. The Respondent does not dispute the appropriateness of applying <span class="Italic">Scott</span>. Consistent with this precedent, the Judge found that the Respondent did not violate section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute because the material at issue "plainly violated established Command Policy on the use of e-mail," that prohibited the sending of "annoying, harassing, lewd, or offensive material." The General Counsel makes only a limited challenge to this finding, asserting that the Judge erred in basing it on "his opinion that the messages were violative of the policy," rather than "evidence in the record that anyone at the Respondent actually applied the Command Policy when deciding to order CCA to remove the messages." According to the General Counsel, an "adverse inference should be drawn because the Respondent did not supply evidence that it, in fact, applied the policy." The General Counsel also argues that "the material met the Respondent's established standards."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel points to nothing in <span class="Italic">Scott Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force Base, </span>or any other precedent, that supports its assertion that the Judge erred in determining that the message, in fact, violated the Agency's established standard. The General Counsel also does not provide support for its argument that the Respondent bore the burden of establishing this factual element. Accordingly, the General Counsel has not established that the Judge erred in this regard, or provided a basis for our drawing an adverse inference from the Respondent's failure to provide evidence of its reasoning. <span class="Italic">See, U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark</span> <span class="Italic">Office, </span>54 FLRA 360, 370 (1998) (it is axiomatic that the General Counsel bears the burden of establishing each and every element of an alleged unfair labor practice in order to establish a violation of the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the record contradicts the General Counsel's argument that there is no evidence supporting a conclusion that the memorandum at issue did not meet the Respondents' standard. In asserting that "the evidence...does not support a finding that standards or a policy was ever applied," and that reliance on the policy by the Judge is "after-the-fact," the General Counsel does not take into account the message that the Respondent sent to explain its actions. The February 2 message to the Union states that on January 29 a derogatory message was removed, and that subsequently another was removed for the same reason. Although "derogatory" messages are not explicitly included in the policy statement, the Judge explains that calling Cannon "an insulting name, in a derogatory manner...was annoying, constituted harassment and was offensive[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we find that the General Counsel did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency removed the material contrary to its established standards. As such, we conclude that removal of the material did not violate section 7116(a)(1).[6] Consequently, we order that this allegation of the complaint be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We note that the reference to "loose Cannon" would likely be protected in other labor relations contexts, such as "robust debate." Here, the communications had to meet the <span class="Italic">employer's </span>standards.</p>
<p class="noindent">A bulletin board notice posted by a union representative protesting the agency's treatment of an employee through its referral of the employee to a particular Employee Assistance Program counselor was protected, and various actions against the union representative constituted a ULP in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Florence and AFGE Local 1300</span>, 59 FLRA 165, 171-73 (2003), applying the test of "flagrant misconduct" to assess actions of employee and employer:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If conduct that exceeds the boundaries of protected activities is established, the conduct loses its protection under the Statute and can be the basis for discipline. If the conduct retains its protection, it cannot be the basis for discipline. "In effect, in such a case, it is not legitimate for an agency to discipline for conduct occurring during the course of protected activity that" does not exceed the boundaries of protected activities. <span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Office of Internal Affairs, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 1500, 1516 (1998) (<span class="Italic">OIA</span>). Under the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny </span>framework, the agency has the burden of establishing its affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence, and the GC has the overall burden of establishing the violation by a preponderance of the evidence on the record as a whole.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues on exceptions that the posting and distribution of the flyer did not constitute protected activity under the Statute because: (1) it was prohibited by Article 7, Section (n) of the parties' agreement; and (2) the content of the message itself removed it from statutory protection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The Judge correctly determined that the posting and distribution of the flyer were not prohibited by Article 7, Section (n) of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a defense to an unfair labor practice complaint is governed by the interpretation and application of specific terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the Authority must ascertain the meaning of the provision. When a judge's interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement is challenged on exceptions, the Authority must decide whether the judge's determination is supported by the record and by the standards and principles of interpreting collective bargaining 172 agreements applied by arbitrators and the federal courts<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 57 FLRA 515, 519 (2001); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, INS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 52 FLRA 256, 261 (1996); <span class="Italic">IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 47 FLRA 1091, 1111 (1993). Therefore, the issue to be resolved in this case is whether the Judge's interpretation of the cited provision of the parties' agreement is supported by the record and by the standards and principles of interpreting collective bargaining agreements applied by arbitrators and the federal courts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously noted, Article 7, Section (n) of the parties' agreement provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The parties agree that they and their representatives will not make statements or post notices in inmate access areas which would endanger staff or the security of the institution.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that "[t]he plain language of section (n) prohibits notices which would endanger staff or the security of the Facility." The Judge specifically found that there was no evidence that the flyer endangered staff or the security of the facility. He found, instead, that the flyer was posted in highly restricted areas where inmates have only limited access. He further found that there was no evidence by the Respondent showing how its staff would be endangered. The Judge noted that only two employees complained about the flyer and neither asserted that the flyers were a threat to them or the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Judge's interpretation of Article 7, Section (n) is supported by his factual findings and the record as a whole<span class="Italic">. See Air Force Material Command, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins AFB, Ga.</span>, 53 FLRA 1092, 1093 (1998) (Authority looks to whether judge's factual findings and record as a whole support judge's conclusion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this result, we reject the Respondent's contention that the Judge's analysis requires the agency to prove that actual harm occurred before the Respondent can remove a posting and still be protected by Article 7, Section (n). The Judge's interpretation of this provision does not require a showing of actual harm; it does, however, require a showing of how the staff or security of the facility would be endangered. As stated above, the Judge specifically found that the Respondent failed to show how the staff or security of the facility would be endangered. This finding is fully supported by the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1365"></span>2.&#x2003;The distribution and posting of the flyer did not exceed the boundaries of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, when the alleged discrimination concerns discipline for conduct occurring during protected activity, a necessary part of the respondent's defense is that the conduct constituted flagrant misconduct or otherwise exceeded the boundaries of protected activity<span class="Italic">. Davis-Monthan AFB</span>, 58 FLRA 636 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the Respondent's assertion that given the personal and defamatory nature of the flyer, the Union representative's conduct was "outside the broad range of protected activit[y]." The Respondent relies on facts that are contrary to the Judge's factual findings, which are supported by the record. The Judge found that while the flyer did mention the EAP Counselor by name, "it contained no derogatory or defamatory statements" about her or the position she held. The Judge also found that the Respondent failed to show that either the EAP Counselor's ability to perform her duties as a psychologist to inmates, or the EAP program, was harmed by the flyer. Furthermore, the Judge noted that the psychologist did not testify at the hearing and, therefore, there is no way to know the impact of the flyer on her personally other that the "unsupported speculation offered by Respondent."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Respondent has failed to show that the Union representative's conduct constituted flagrant misconduct or otherwise exceeded the bounds of protected activity. Accordingly, we deny the deny the Respondent's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Judge correctly found that the Respondent did not have legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for referring the Union representative's conduct to the OIA for investigation, for conducting an SIS investigation and for subsequently proposing discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously stated, once the GC makes the required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, the burden then shifts to the agency to establish, as an affirmative defense, that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for its action; and (2) the same action would have been taken even in the absence of protected activity<span class="Italic">. Davis-Monthan AFB</span>, 58 FLRA 636 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent asserts that it had legitimate justifications for its actions and that it would have taken the same action absent the Union representative's protected activity. However, the Respondent relies on factual assertions that, as noted previously, are contrary to the Judge's factual findings. Among other things, the Judge found that the flyer was not derogatory or defamatory; it did not disrupt agency operations; it was not seen by inmates; and it did not harm either the psychologist's ability to perform her duties as a psychologist to inmates, or the EAP program. The Judge further found that, while the contents of the flyer may have been offensive to some, the Respondent's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff was not affected, particularly in light of the fact that the Union representative desisted from the activity once he was ordered to do so by the Associate Wardens.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Put another way, the Respondent's alleged legitimate reason for taking the disciplinary action here is actually a relitigation of whether or not the employee was engaged in protected activity that was otherwise inappropriate. In that regard, however, we have already concluded that the employee's conduct fell within the bounds of protected activity that is not otherwise inappropriate. As a result, and in the absence of some other proffered reason for its actions, it makes no sense (or difference) for the Agency to now argue that it had a legitimate basis for its actions--that legitimacy has already been disproven. It also is meaningless for the Agency to argue that it would have taken the same action in any event--it has cited no reason for its action other than the one that has already been disproven. While the Agency argues that its actions are proper under <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, its lack of any other basis for its actions makes resolution of this case more like a traditional protected activity analysis: if the employee's activity is inappropriate, the Agency may discipline him; if not, the disciplinary action is improper<span class="Italic">. See generally Davis-Monthan AFB</span>, 58 FLRA at 636; <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 120 (Where a respondent's motive is found to be pretextual, "unless the respondent establishes that there was an additional lawful (nonpretextual) motive for its allegedly discriminatory action, it is not necessary to determine whether the respondent would have taken the disputed action even without the unlawful motive.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Judge found, and we agree for the reasons stated by him, that the Respondent failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it had a legitimate reason for its actions. Accordingly, we deny the Respondent's exception.</p>
