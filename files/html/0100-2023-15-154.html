<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-153"><span class="space">12.</span> Refusal to Submit to Search or Drug Test</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is of the opinion that if an employee believes that he is the victim of an illegal search, he should not resist. The remedy is to challenge the evidence later used. <span class="Italic">Clark v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 20 MSPR 152, 153-54 (1984) (appellant resisted an attempt by agency security guards to search her bags as part of a "surprise inspection" of her baggage). <span class="Italic">Clark</span> commented on the need ordinarily to comply with a search request:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue in this case is simply whether appellant knowingly resisted the security officers in the attempted performance of their duty....&#8197;Since these officers were engaged in good faith and colorable performance of their duty, appellant had no right to forcefully resist the request of the officers in the performance of that duty, even assuming the invalidity of their search. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Cunningham</span>, 509 F.2d 961 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (no right to forcefully resist arrest); <span class="Italic">United States v. Ferrone,</span> 438 F.2d 381 (3d Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 402 U.S. 1008, 91 S. Ct. 2188, 29 L. Ed.2d 430 (1971) (no right to resist search pursuant to an invalid search warrant). A defective search is no defense to a charge of resisting execution thereof. That issue is resolved through a later legal mechanism to suppress the evidence garnered in the allegedly illegal search. <span class="Italic">See Ferrone, supra</span>.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Ferrone</span> court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Society has an interest in securing its members the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Society also has in interest, however, in the orderly settlement of disputes between citizens and their government; it has an especially strong interest in minimizing the use of violent self-help in the resolution of those disputes. We think a proper accommodation of interests requires that a person claiming to be aggrieved by a search conducted by a peace officer pursuant to an allegedly invalid warrant test that claim in a court of law and not forcibly resist the execution of the warrant at the place of search. The development of legal safeguards in the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment fields in recent years has provided the victim of an unlawful search with realistic and orderly legal alternatives to physical resistance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">438 F.2d at 390, <span class="Italic">quoted</span> in <span class="Italic">United States v. Peifer</span>, 474 F. Supp. 498, 504 n.6 (E.D. Pa. 1979). The same reasoning would apply to the warrantless search in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The later challenge to evidence suggested by <span class="Italic">Clark</span> may be inefficacious. The Board does not apply the exclusionary rule. [Refer to Chapter 4 for cases concerning exclusion of "<a href="0100-2023-11-152.html#sec4-153">Drug Testing</a>" evidence on the basis of constitutional challenges.] Another, better remedy might be a lawsuit for monetary damages against the responsible federal officials for invasion of a constitutionally protected right against unreasonable search, the so-called <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> suit. [<span class="Italic">Bivens</span> is discussed in Chapter 17, "<a href="0100-2023-24-152.html#sec17-148">Actions for Damages Against Individuals and Government; <span class="Italic">Bivens.</span></a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the employee should obey first and grieve later, an employee who refused to sign a consent for prospective searches of his car because he felt that a search was unconstitutional or an invasion of privacy should not have been removed: there was no unconstitutionality, but the employee's refusal caused no interference with his ability to perform work. Removal was mitigated to a 30-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Mode v. TVA</span>, 20 MSPR 228, 231 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Grissom v. TVA</span>, 7 MSPR 387, 388, 7 MSPB 264 (1981) (discussed later concerning defenses to insubordination). Removal was sustained for refusal to submit to <span id="Page_2627"></span>a strip search prompted by suspicion of prison officials that the appellant was carrying drugs into the prison on the day the search was ordered. A reasonable suspicion by prison officials justified the ordering of a strip search without a search warrant. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOJ</span> (Fed.

Speaking for the Court, Justice Kennedy, noting that the regulations posed only limited threats to the privacy rights of the covered employees, in contrast to the compelling government interest in testing without individualized suspicion, observed:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We believe that the decrease of the potential catastrophic harm in lives lost resulting from an impaired ATCS justifies the agency's program of testing air traffic control specialists, and therefore, compels the finding that the agency's program of random drug testing, in these circumstances, was reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 109 S.

Moreover, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has specifically upheld the constitutionality of the agency's drug testing program. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v.

Therefore, we find no error in the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency's drug testing was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal was an appropriate penalty for an electronics technician who, while working in an air traffic control facility, refused to submit to random drug testing, <span class="Italic">Watson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the appellant's Fourth Amendment contention we find that the administrative judge erred in not addressing the constitutionality of the agency's random drug-testing program. In <span class="Italic">Malone v. Department of Justice</span>, 13 MSPB 81, 14 MSPR 403, 406 (1983), the Board held that it had no authority to consider the constitutionality of statutes. The instant case, however, does not involve the constitutionality of a statute. Rather, it concerns the reasonableness of the agency's random drug-testing program. The Board considered this issue in <span class="Italic">Shelledy v. Department of Transportation</span>, 49 MSPR 257, 261-263 (1991), and found that the agency's random drug-testing of air traffic control specialists did not violate the constitutional prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. The Board stated that, in determining whether a search is reasonable, consideration was to be given to the benefits gained from that search. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 262. The Board found "that the decrease of the potential catastrophic harm in lives lost resulting from an impaired ATCS justifie[d] the agency's program of testing air traffic control specialists, and, therefore, compel[led] the finding that the agency's program of random drug testing, in these circumstances, was reasonable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 262. Moreover, we note that, in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. Skinner</span>, 885 F.2d 884, 891-93, 898 (D.C. Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 110 S. Ct. 1960, 109 L. Ed.2d 321 (1990), the court specifically upheld the constitutionality of the agency's random drug-testing program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, we find, likewise, that the agency's random drug-testing of electronics technicians does not constitute an unreasonable search. The agency stated in the notice of proposed removal that random drug-testing was necessary because the position of electronics technician involved "immense responsibility for the lives and property of others" and that "[c]onstant alertness of mind and soundness of judgment are basic to the position." The agency also stated that random drug testing was necessary to "preserve the public's and user's confidence" in the aviation system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the hearing, the agency presented the testimony of its Airway Facility Sector Manager that electronics technicians performed "very critical work" and that they "maintain[ed], calibrate[d] and adjust[ed] facilities, which, if improperly done, could result" in airplane crashes. The agency also submitted various statements relating to the high safety requirement of the appellant's position, including statements from Edward Kelly, Deputy Director of Systems Maintenance Service at the FAA in Washington, D.C., and Melvin Yoshikami, Manager of the Airways Facilities Division of the FAA in Seattle, Washington. Mr. Kelly explained the functions of an electronic technician, which included "servicing of equipment," "corrective maintenance," and responsibility for "control, navigation, radar and communications machinery that allow[ed] safe operation and positive control of aircraft both in the sky and on the ground at airports."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Yoshikami stated that, "[i]n order to perform their duties satisfactorily, electronics technicians must be continuously alert and able accurately to examine and maintain complex electronic equipment," and that improper certification of equipment "could result in unsafe conditions directly, and potentially tragically, affecting the national airspace system." The appellant does not deny that his position of Electronics Technician involves serious safety responsibilities as stated by the agency. Thus, we find that the random drug-testing of electronics technicians by the agency is reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no merit to the appellant's contention that the "obey then grieve" rule should be suspended in this case. In <span class="Italic">Gragg</span>, 13 MSPR at 299, the Board, citing <span class="Italic">Walker v. Birmingham</span>, 388 U.S. 307, 87 S. Ct. 1824, 18 L. Ed.2d 1210, <span class="Italic">reh. denied</span>, 389 U.S. 894, 88 S. Ct. 12, 19 L. Ed.2d 202 (1967), stated that "individuals do not have the unfettered right to disregard a law, rule or regulation merely because substantial reason exists regarding the constitutionality or validity of that law, rule or regulation." It noted, though, that "in certain limited circumstances employees may disobey an order which would place them in a clearly dangerous situation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The circumstances of the instant case do not fall within this exception. Therefore, we find that the appellant improperly failed to obey the agency's instructions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find no merit to the appellant's contention that no nexus was shown between his misconduct and the efficiency of the service. It is well established that refusal to follow proper instructions adversely affects the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blevins v. Department of Army</span>, 26 MSPR 101, 104 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 790 F.2d 95 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table); <span class="Italic">Gragg</span>, 13 MSPR at 301. The appellant's refusal to comply with his supervisor's order to submit to drug testing in accordance with the agency's random drug testing program constituted a refusal to follow proper instructions. Therefore, a nexus existed between the appellant's misconduct and the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency challenges virtually every basis on which the administrative judge relied in finding that mitigation of the penalty was warranted. The agency contends that the administrative judge erred in finding that it accorded better treatment to employees who tested positive for drugs than to those who might have been drug free, but who refused drug testing. It argues that it is obligated to provide reasonable accommodation to employees suffering from a drug-addiction handicap, but that, when employees refuse to take the drug test, it cannot determine whether they are entitled to reasonable accommodation. We <span id="Page_2628"></span>find that the administrative judge's comparison between drug-addicted handicapped employees and employees who refuse drug testing is inapposite inasmuch as different types of misconduct and procedures are involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not support the administrative judge's finding that the agency had predetermined the penalty. Melissa Allen, the agency's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration, submitted an affidavit in regard to this issue. In her affidavit, Ms. Allen averred that the agency's procedures required the initiation of action to remove an employee who occupied a safety or security sensitive position and who refused to provide a urine sample for an agency-administered test. She noted that Chapter X, Section III.B., of the Drug Testing Guide stated that the supervisor should initiate action to remove an employee for failure to take a drug test. The initiation of a removal action, however, is not equivalent to mandating removal. Ms. Allen further averred as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Department also recognizes that the ultimate decision concerning the appropriate type of disciplinary action that may be imposed depends upon the circumstances of each individual case. In fact, I am aware that in the case of at least two DOT employees who refused to submit to a random drug test and received notices of proposed removals, the respective deciding officials ultimately determined that removal was unwarranted and lesser penalties were imposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the deciding official testified that he had not been directed by anyone to remove the appellant and that he considered mitigation of the penalty. While he stated that he felt his discretion was somewhat limited by the drug program's disciplinary provisions, he felt that he had the authority to assess the appropriate penalty. He gave two specific examples of circumstances he felt would have warranted a lesser penalty and stated that he would consider any other reason offered to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge erred in concluding that the fact that the deciding official listed only two specific mitigating circumstances showed that he failed to properly consider mitigation. It is not a deciding official's responsibility to provide a list of circumstances that might have caused him to adopt a lesser penalty. Rather, the deciding official is only required to consider all of the relevant mitigating factors that actually exist in a given case and exercise management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spearman v. United States Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 135, 141 (1990); <span class="Italic">Gleason v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 MSPR 547, 550 (1988). In the instant appeal, the deciding official testified that he considered mitigation but believed that the offense was very serious, that if a lesser penalty were imposed it would render the agency's drug program ineffective, and that it would send a message to the work force that employees could avoid taking the drug test. Thus, we find that the deciding official properly considered the appropriateness of the penalty and that the administrative judge's conclusion that the deciding official "had merely gone through the motions of decisionmaking" is unsupported by the record. Likewise, we find unsupported by any legal or other authority the administrative judge's determination that the deciding official's lack of personal knowledge of the case and the fact that he did not prepare either the proposal or the removal notices constituted mitigating factors. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981) (the Board will review an agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we find that the appellant received timely and adequate notice of the test and was clearly on notice of the consequences of his failure to submit to the test. The appellant's reliance on his attorney's advice is unpersuasive as a mitigating factor because it is well established that an employee must obey a proper supervisory order and challenge it later. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gragg</span>, 13 MSPR at 299. The appellant's action of taking a drug test on his own did not constitute compliance with his supervisor's orders, and sanction of such behavior would seriously undermine the agency's drug-testing program. In this regard, we disagree with the administrative judge's statement that a lesser penalty would not affect the drug-testing program because the appellant had been discreet. We find that this view is unrealistic inasmuch as such a matter generally becomes common knowledge among the workforce and would tend to influence other employees' behavior.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the administrative judge relied heavily on his assessment that the appellant was a good prospect for rehabilitation, in large part because the administrative judge determined that the appellant had subsequently indicated his willingness to comply with the agency's drug-testing program. The appellant, however, did not give an unqualified statement that he would comply. At the hearing, the appellant was asked if he was refusing to take the test at that time. He answered, "No." When asked why he had changed his position, he stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I have a little better understanding about it, about the whole program. I think that if I was going to random urinalysis from the Government now, I think that I would insist--I wouldn't request, but I would insist--on having a sample sent to a laboratory of my choice, or I would escort them with a sample of my urine to a laboratory of my choice so that I could make sure that their system is reliable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's testimony is not an unqualified statement of his intent to comply with future orders. Rather, it seems to impose a significant condition and change the agency's program. Thus, we find distinguishable from the instant appeal the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Mode</span>, 20 MSPR at 231, and <span class="Italic">Grissom v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 7 MSPB 264, 7 MSPR 387, 388 (1981), upon which the administrative judge relied in finding that the appellant's "objectively reasonable, albeit mistaken, belief" that the agency's drug-testing program violated his constitutional rights was a mitigating factor to be considered in determining the reasonableness of the penalty. In <span class="Italic">Mode</span>, 20 MSPR at 231, the Board found that the appellant was unaware that he could have obeyed the agency's order and then taken appropriate action to determine his constitutional rights, but that, once he understood his rights, he would not continue to refuse to comply with the agency's directive. In <span class="Italic">Grissom</span>, there was no indication that the appellant would continue to refuse to comply with the agency's orders. In the present appeal, however, the evidence indicates that the appellant, who now understands his rights, will continue to refuse to fully comply with the agency's drug-testing program. Thus, he lacks a good potential for rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">Mode</span>, 20 MSPR at 231.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, despite the favorable mitigating factors, including the fact that the appellant tested negative for drug use, and his 11 years of satisfactory service, we find that removal was reasonable under the circumstances of this case. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 306.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Watson</span> was sustained on judicial review, although the court engaged in an internal debate about the constitutionality of the drug testing program at the time of its application to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Watson v. Dept. of Transp.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 91-3558). <span class="Italic">Hatley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 164 F.3d 602, 603-05 (Fed. Cir. 1998), concluded that random drug testing for a firefighter was constitutionally valid:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution provides that "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated...." The Supreme Court has held that the collection of urine to test for alcohol or other drugs is a search within the protection of the Fourth Amendment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"There are few activities in our society more personal or private than the passing of urine. Most people describe it by euphemisms if they talk about it at all. It is a function traditionally performed without public observation; indeed, its performance in public is generally prohibited by law as well as social custom."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Because it is clear that the collection and testing of urine intrudes upon expectations of privacy that society has long recognized as reasonable, the Federal Courts of Appeals have concluded unanimously, and we agree, that these intrusions must be deemed searches under the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n</span>, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989) (quoting <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab</span>, 816 F.2d 170, 175 (5th Cir. 1987)). However, that a search falls within the protection of the Fourth Amendment does not render the search illegal. The Amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches and seizures<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 619 ("[T]he Fourth Amendment does not proscribe all searches and seizures, but only those that are unreasonable.") Thus we look to see if the drug testing program to which Petitioner was subjected was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The jurisprudence concerning the constitutionality of searches and seizures developed primarily in the context of police searches of citizens suspected of having committed crimes. These cases implemented the general principle that the reason for conducting the search must be legally adequate and, absent exigent circumstances, this adequacy must be evaluated in advance of the search through the process of the search warrant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 621-22. On this background, the demand for a urine sample from a person who is not suspected of wrongdoing, to be provided without meeting the requirements for a search warrant, has engendered vigorous debate in the context of concern about fundamental freedoms. The Supreme Court instructs that neither the absence of suspicion regarding the person to be searched nor the intrusiveness of collecting a urine sample is dispositive of the constitutionality of a random drug test. Each test program must be evaluated for reasonableness, in its circumstances. <span class="Italic">Skinner</span>, 489 U.S. at 624. <span class="Italic">See Chandler v. Miller</span>, 520 U.S. 305, 117 S. Ct, 1295, 1301 (1997) ("When such 'special needs'--concerns other than crime detection--are alleged in justification of a Fourth Amendment intrusion, courts must undertake a context-specific inquiry, examining closely the competing private and public interests advanced by the parties.") Thus, balanced against the intrusion into Petitioner's privacy, we must evaluate the public interest in this particular drug testing program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner was a firefighter. The safety of others was in his hands, and an <span id="Page_2629"></span>impairment due to drug use could well have led to otherwise avoidable injury or death. It is generally established that employees responsible for the safety of others may be subjected to drug testing, even in the absence of suspicion of wrongdoing. Employees who have been held to be subject to random drug testing without violation of the Fourth Amendment include pipeline operators, airline industry personnel, correctional officers, various transportation workers, Army civilian guards, civilian workers in a military weapons plant, Justice Department employees with clearance for top-secret information, police officers carrying firearms or engaged in drug interdiction efforts, and nuclear power plant engineers. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab</span>, 489 U.S. 656 (1989) (Customs Service employees seeking promotion or transfer to positions which required them to carry firearms).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the government's compelling interest in keeping its firefighters free of drugs outweighs the expectation of privacy of these employees. The random drug testing program, as set forth in the regulations here applicable, is reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner alleges that the drug testing program violates Articles 3 and 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Board did not analyze these charges, and Petitioner complains that his allegations of human rights violations have been "unconscionably ignored."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government states that the Merit Systems Protection Board does not have authority to consider such allegations. We do not reach this question of authority, for we conclude that this resolution of the United Nations, which is directed to torture, summary execution, genocide, slavery, and other acts uniformly condemned by the community of nations, does not reach the humiliation which Petitioner states he would experience in complying with the agency's drug testing requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner raises other arguments such as that the drug testing program violates the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against compelled self-incrimination and constitutes an <span class="Italic">ex post facto</span> law. These arguments have been considered and rejected by the Court. In the circumstances of this case, they are meritless.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit determined that the Board properly sustained removal of an individual who failed to take a random drug test, <span class="Italic">Pollock v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 369 Fed. Appx. 133, 138 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Pollock presents three arguments to support his claim that the Board abused its discretion. We reject all three arguments and address each in turn. First, Mr. Pollock argues that his collective bargaining agreement and Executive Order 12,564 require the Navy to place Mr. Pollock in an alternative position and refer him to treatment for failure to provide a urine sample. Mr. Pollock's argument is not supported by any specific evidence. Mr. Pollock may be referring to the Navy's notice of random drug testing signed by Mr. Pollock. In that notice, the Navy warned that "[i]f you refuse to furnish a urine specimen o[r] fail to report for testing as directed, you will be subject to the same range of discipline as a verified positive test result for illegal drug use." The range of discipline "includ[ed] removal from the Federal Service." The notice further provided that if Mr. Pollock was found to have used illegal drugs, he would "be subject to the following...administrative actions mandated by Executive Order 12[,] 564." Those administrative actions included immediate removal from a TDP "through reassignment, detail, or other personnel action" and referral "to the Civilian Employee Assistance Program." The notice never explained, however, that employees who refuse or fail to submit to drug testing will be entitled to the remedial measures in Executive Order 12,564. It only warned that such employees are subject to the same range of <span class="Italic">discipline</span> as an employee who is found to use illegal drugs, including removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Navy's notice comports with Executive Order 12,564. That order applies to "employee[s] who [are] <span class="Italic">found</span> to use illegal drugs." Exec. Order No. 12,564 &#x00A7; 5(a), 51 Fed. Reg. 32,889 (Sept. 15, 1986) (emphasis added), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7301 (2006). Specifically, the order states that "[a]gencies shall, <span class="Italic">in addition to any appropriate personnel actions</span>, refer any employee who is found to use illegal drugs to an Employee Assistance Program for assessment, counseling, and referral for treatment or rehabilitation as appropriate." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added). The order does not, however, address the appropriate personnel actions for employees who refuse or fail to take a drug test as required by the order. Refusal or failure to take a drug test presents a different problem for an agency. Employees who refuse or fail to take a drug test can prompt others to act similarly, undermining the agency's drug-testing program. <span class="Italic">See Watson v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. 509, 519 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 983 F.2d 1088 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). If other employees could decline to take a random drug test without providing documentation for their excuse, the Navy Drug Free Workplace Program could not serve its intended purpose. Almost any creative, but unsubstantiated, excuse could relieve a TDP employee from providing a urine sample.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal was sustained in <span class="Italic">Westmoreland v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 49 MSPR 574, 577 (1991), on charges that a GS-12 Aviation Safety Inspector was AWOL and refused to take a drug test. The appellant apparently took unauthorized leave after learning she was to be tested, depriving the agency of its opportunity to administer the test at the time of its choice. Refusal to take the test carried a mandatory penalty of removal. Discounted was the defense that the action was in retaliation for pursuit of an EEO case. Discounted as a mitigating factor was the claimed urgent nature of the leave request. Removal of a GS-12 Community Corrections Contract Oversight Specialist for refusal to take a drug test was sustained, <span class="Italic">Garrison v. DOJ</span>, 67 MSPR 154, 165 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 72 F.3d 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant had seventeen years of successful service with no prior disciplinary record. His last five summary performance ratings of record were all "Exceeds Fully Successful" and he received a number of commendations and awards. Nonetheless, the agency's table of penalties provides for removal for a first offense of the analogous charge of "Refusal to undergo a search of person or property." The appellant occupied a secondary law enforcement officer position and, as such, is held to a high standard of conduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jones v. Department of the Army</span>, 52 MSPR 501, 506 (1992). Moreover, the appellant occupied a position of fiduciary responsibility, and his refusal to submit to drug testing impacted on his trustworthiness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kane testified that the appellant had previously signed a statement indicating that he understood that a refusal to submit to drug testing could result in disciplinary action, including removal. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, 49 MSPR at 518-19. The appellant's misconduct impeded the agency's ability to maintain a drug-free workplace and was inconsistent with the agency's law enforcement mission. Even assuming that he had a good-faith, albeit mistaken, belief that the instruction to take the drug test violated his constitutional rights, this factor does not warrant mitigation of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, 49 MSPR at 519-20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, in light of the seriousness of the appellant's misconduct, we find that the penalty of removal is reasonable under the facts and circumstances of this appeal.</p>
