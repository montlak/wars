<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-22"><span class="space">a.</span> Timing of Events</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">As a general observation applicable to all stripes of constructively adverse resignations, retirements, demotions, and kindred actions, events complained of leading to a constructive adverse action must be reasonably proximate to the action. The Board may give no weight to incidents that occurred too remote in time from a resignation or retirement claimed to be adverse. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOD</span>, 85 MSPR 310, 313-14 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11 (2000) (without agreeing with the AJ that in all involuntary resignation cases, the examination of circumstances should include a period no more than six months prior to the resignation, the Board determined that the AJ did not abuse discretion by limiting the examination of events to those six months; the circumstances extant immediately prior to the date of the resignation are most relevant in determining the voluntariness of the action); <span class="Italic">Gregory v. FCC</span>, 79 MSPR 563, 569 &#x00B6; 12 (1998) ("The Board has approved excluding from consideration incidents that occurred too remote in time from an appellant's resignation."); <span class="Italic">Bates v. DOJ</span>, 70 MSPR 659, 663-72 (1996) ("We find that the cumulative effect of years of unremitting interference with her radio transmissions and the realization that no relief was in sight finally constituted the appellant's 'last straw,' and led to her resignation."); <span class="Italic">Wood v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 24, 28-29 (1989) (under the particular circumstances of the case, the AJ did not err by limiting the testimony of witnesses to a period of approximately six months before the appellant's resignation); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. USDA</span>, 260 F.3d 1336, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("The level of evidentiary weight the MSPB must grant to events temporally further from Shoaf's resignation than the agency's post-transfer conduct is within its discretion; yet, such events must, at a minimum, be considered to place activity and inactivity more immediately preceding Shoaf's retirement into the proper context."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Gerges v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 89 MSPR 669, 673-79 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-20 (2001) (determinative was the absence of a worsening trend of events toward the time of the appellant's absence from the agency); <span class="Italic">compare</span> <span class="Italic">Caveney v. Office of Admin.</span>, 57 MSPR 667, 670 n.2 (1993) (although the general focus is on events immediately preceding a resignation <span id="Page_1918"></span>or retirement, the Board is not precluded from considering circumstances not immediately preceding the action), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 20 MSPR 571, 573 (1984) (AJ did not err in determining that the resignation was not involuntary when the appellant was on LWOP continuously for the year preceding his retirement and he unilaterally made the retirement request before the expiration of his leave without prompting by the agency), and <span class="Italic">Powers v. VA</span>, 43 MSPR 626, 630 (1990) ("The focus in an alleged involuntary resignation is on the circumstances immediately preceding the appellant's action." (citing <span class="Italic">Filliben v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 31, 34 (1987)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board summarized the law on the temporal scope of examination of events surrounding a coerced resignation, <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOD</span>, 85 MSPR 310, 313-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-13 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While we do not agree with the AJ's statement during the hearing that in every case the Board will look only to the six-month period prior to an alleged involuntary resignation in determining whether working conditions were intolerable, we nevertheless find that the appellant has not shown that the AJ abused his discretion in this appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf. Gregory v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 79 MSPR 563, 569 &#x00B6; 12 (1998) (the AJ did not abuse her discretion in not granting a motion to compel discovery as to matters that occurred in 1995, when the appellant alleged that she resigned involuntarily two years later); <span class="Italic">Wood v. Department of the Navy,</span> 43 MSPR, 24, 28-29 (1989) (no error under the facts of that case by the AJ in limiting the testimony of witnesses to the time period of approximately six months before an alleged involuntary resignation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the AJ erred when he failed to apply a totality of the circumstances analysis in determining whether working conditions were so intolerable that she had to resign. In this regard, the appellant claims that the AJ attributed no probative weight to events occurring more than six months before her April 12, 1998 resignation. The appellant contends that although the AJ relied on <span class="Italic">Gregory</span> and <span class="Italic">Wood</span> for this finding, the rationale for a six-month limitation set forth in <span class="Italic">Wood</span> "is not evident," and a <span class="Italic">per se</span> limitation practically assures the presentation of an incomplete picture, especially when an employee is exhausting complaint or grievance procedures before resigning. The appellant contends that events occurring more than six months prior to an alleged involuntary resignation should be considered when they are part of an ongoing, continuous course of harassment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the AJ referred to a generalized six-month <span class="Italic">per se</span> limitation in excluding testimony during the hearing, an examination of the transcript reveals that the testimony was excluded because it was too remote and therefore immaterial. Moreover, he did not apply such a limitation in the initial decision. The AJ correctly found that the appellant must establish by preponderant evidence that working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in her position would have felt compelled to resign, and cited <span class="Italic">Gregory</span> and <span class="Italic">Wood</span> for the principle that "[t]he circumstances existing immediately before the actual date of the resignation are most relevant in determining the voluntariness of the appellant's action." This is an accurate statement of Board case law. <span class="Italic">See Caveney v.</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Administration,</span> 57 MSPR 667, 670 n.2 (1993) (generally, the focus in an alleged involuntary resignation is on the circumstances immediately preceding the appellant's action); <span class="Italic">Powers v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 43 MSPR 626, 630 (the focus in an alleged involuntary resignation is on the circumstances immediately preceding the appellant's action), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 918 F.2d 187 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table); <span class="Italic">Filliben v. Department of the Navy,</span> 34 MSPR 31, 34 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even where the Board has expressly set forth the totality of the circumstances test or cited to <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration,</span> 68 MSPR 513 (1995), which applies that test, the Board has found that under certain circumstances events may be too remote in time to have affected a reasonable person's decision to resign. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gregory,</span> 79 MSPR 563, at 568-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 12; <span class="Italic">Bates v.

Supp.2d 59, 66 (D.D.C. 1998) (beratings by a supervisor, which allegedly occurred five years before a resignation, were too remote and isolated for the court to recognize them as intolerable working conditions that would drive a reasonable person to quit). A general rule focusing on more recent events does not, however, preclude the Board from considering circumstances not immediately preceding the resignation in appropriate cases. <span class="Italic">Caveney</span>, 57 MSPR at 670 n.2; <span class="Italic">see Bates,</span> 70 MSPR at 663 (the cumulative effect of years of unremitting interference with her radio transmissions and the realization that no relief was in sight constituted the appellant's "last straw" and led to her resignation); <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 61 MSPR 539, 551-52, 557-58 (1994) (the agency's denial of a promotion on September 7, 1989, in reprisal for whistleblowing was a factor in the intolerable working conditions resulting in a May 30, 1990 resignation, eight months later), <span class="Italic">aff'd on recons.,</span> 68 MSPR 513 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the AJ considered alleged intolerable working conditions existing more than six months before the appellant's resignation but found them either unproven, not intolerable, or too remote in time to have had an impact when the appellant resigned in April 1998. For example, the AJ found that an incident in the spring of 1997 in which a coworker who would later become the appellant's supervisor allegedly unplugged and/or destroyed one of the appellant's air fresheners after several employees complained about its strong smell did not create intolerable working conditions and was too remote in time to show that intolerable working conditions existed at the time of the appellant's resignation. The AJ also found that the actions of a former supervisor who threatened the appellant in 1992 and 1993, and who was thereafter removed from the work area and subsequently retired, were too remote in time to establish that working conditions in 1998, under a different supervisor, were intolerable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern no error in the AJ's findings regarding the remote events identified by the appellant. Although the appellant claims that the AJ improperly "compartmentalized" the agency's acts to determine whether working conditions were intolerable, instead of analyzing the cumulative effect of the agency's conduct, we disagree. The appellant referred to a variety of separate, specific incidents as proof of her alleged mistreatment. The AJ had little choice but to assess each incident separately, but there is no indication in the initial decision that he failed to consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the appellant's resignation. The AJ simply found as to each incident that the appellant had failed to prove it or that the incident had not "contributed to a working environment so intolerable that it forced the appellant to resign."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lentz v. Dept. of Interior</span>, SF-0752-15-0363-I-1 (NP 1/11/2016), summarized decisions examining timing of events leading to a resignation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that the administrative judge erred by dismissing incidents remote in time to his resignation, i.e., the LOR, or his nonselection to various agency positions. However, even where the Board has expressly set forth the totality of the circumstances test or cited to <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 513 (1995), which applies that test, the Board has found that, under certain circumstances, events may be too remote in time to have affected a reasonable person's decision to resign. <span class="Italic">See Searcy v. Department of Commerce</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 281, &#x00B6; 13 (2010) (5 months' lapse of time undercuts the appellant's assertion that working conditions were intolerable) (citing <span class="Italic">Terban v. Department of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1025 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (discussing that evidence that a relatively short period of time elapsed between the alleged coercion and the employee's resignation is probative of involuntariness)); <span class="Italic">Bates v. Department of Justice</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 659, 663-66 (1996) (finding that an incident that occurred approximately 2 years prior to the employee's resignation was too remote in time to have caused her to resign and to have rendered her resignation involuntarily). Here, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to adequately explain how the issuance of the May 15, 2014 LOR, or the work expectations within that LOR, created intolerable working conditions that caused him to resign on February 11, 2015, 9 months later, especially in light of the fact that he had taken leave and was not performing the expectation/duties of his position for the 3 months prior to his resignation. As to his nonselection to positions in May 2012, November 2013, and April 2014, the administrative judge found that, while the appellant felt disappointment over his nonselections, the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege why such disappointment would cause him to resign.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit emphasized the significance of events at or near the time of a resignation, <span class="Italic">Vazquez v. MSPB</span>, 296 Fed. Appx. 20 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"A resignation is either voluntary or involuntary on the date it was submitted, and jurisdiction must be determined as of that date." <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1244 (Fed. Cir. 1991). As such, the period of time between the allegedly coercive act and the resignation is "the most probative evidence" of involuntariness. <span class="Italic">Terban v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The longer the time between the coercive acts and the resignation, the less involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, an employee's decision to resign is presumed to be voluntary, and an employee seeking to demonstrate otherwise is required to satisfy an objective and "demanding legal standard." <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329 (quoting <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124). The doctrine of coercive involuntariness "does not apply to a case in which an employee decides to resign or retire because he does not want to accept a new assignment...." <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124 (internal citations omitted). The so-called <span class="Italic">Fruhauf</span> test for establishing involuntary coercion by an agency requires the employee to show (1) the agency effectively imposed the terms of the resignation; (2) the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign; and (3) the employee's resignation was the result of improper agency acts. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329; <span class="Italic">see also Fruhauf Sw. Garment Co. v. United States</span>, 126 Ct. Cl. 51, 62, 111 F. Supp. 945, 951 (Ct. Cl. 1953)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Vazquez argues that his resignation was the result of a series of improper acts resulting in a hostile work environment leaving him no choice but to resign. We agree with the Board's conclusion rejecting his alleged circumstances as insufficient, even if true, to make his later resignation a constructive removal because he had the option to transfer, rather than resign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1919"></span>The record shows, and Mr. Vazquez has not contested, that he never requested a transfer from the ship at any point during his nine-month assignment even though he could have done so after only four months. Mr. Vazquez argues that his history would follow him and that he would end up with unfavorable jobs on a new vessel. But, "the fact that an employee is faced with an unpleasant situation or that his choice is limited to two unattractive options does not make the employee's decision any less voluntary." <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There was no error in the AJ's conclusion that Mr. Vazquez's allegations, even if true, do not establish that he involuntarily accepted the terms of the agency, that circumstances permitted no other alternative, or that the resignation was the result of coercive acts of the agency. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1344; <span class="Italic">see Fruhauf</span>, 126 Ct. Cl. at 62. We have carefully examined each of Mr. Vazquez's claims; however, because the Board's decision was in accordance with the law, we affirm the dismissal of Mr. Vazquez's constructive removal claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. EEOC,</span> DC-0752-15-0733-I-1 (NP 2/29/2016) ("'The most probative evidence of involuntariness will usually be evidence in which there is a relatively short period of time between the employer's alleged coercive act and the employee's retirement.' <span class="Italic">Terban v. Department of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2000). We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the appellant did not prove that he was subjected to a working environment that would have compelled a reasonable person to resign. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Axsom v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 605, &#x00B6; 16 (2009) (finding that the appellant was on extended leave prior to his decision to resign, and thus had little, if any, contact with any allegedly hostile supervisors in the months leading up to his resignation, which further weakened any inference that any alleged harassment and discrimination on their part weighed heavily in his decision).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Coome v. SSA</span>, DE-0752-12-0218-I-1 (NP 8/15/2013), noted the significance of events closest in time to the action claimed to be involuntarily and determined that the standards used to assess the involuntariness of an action are not the same as the standards applied by EEOC in a hostile environment case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that the administrative judge erred in giving little weight to the incidents of retaliation on which the appellant prevailed in her equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint because they were remote in time. The most probative evidence of involuntariness will usually be evidence in which there is a relatively short period of time between the employer's alleged coercive acts and the employee's retirement. <span class="Italic">Terban v. Department of the Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The appellant's decision to continue working for more than 16 months after the incidents that formed the basis of her EEO complaint weakens any inference that they weighed heavily in her decision to retire. <span class="Italic">See Axsom v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 605, &#x00B6; 16 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the administrative judge erred in failing to equate the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) administrative judge's finding of harassment with a finding of coercion. Under EEOC's standards, a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment occurs when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc</span>., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993). The EEOC's standard of an abusive working environment differs from the standard in Board cases that the improper acts by the agency were so pervasive that it left the appellant no choice but to resign or retire. The administrative judge did not err in failing to equate the two standards.</p>
