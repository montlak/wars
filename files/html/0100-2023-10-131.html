<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-131"><span class="space">a.</span> Witness List</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether or not assistance will be needed to secure the appearance of witnesses, as part of the prehearing submissions the parties will be required to provide the AJ with a list of witnesses they desire to call, describing generally the subject matter of witness testimony. This is done so that the AJ may evaluate the list and approve witnesses with relevant testimony. 5 CFR 1201.41(b)(8), (10) (2022). It may occur that the AJ does not disapprove witnesses unless objection to the relevance of their testimony is raised by one of the parties; the practice varies. Some AJs scrutinize the list even without objections. If one party raises an objection concerning the production of witnesses, the AJ must determine whether to order the appearance of that witness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board summarizes the use of witness lists at Chapter 7, section 1 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">REQUESTS FOR WITNESSES</span>. The parties are required by the standard hearing notices to provide the AJ with a list of witnesses and a brief summary of their expected testimony. The AJ must rule on all requests for witnesses. The request must be approved if the AJ finds that the expected testimony of the witness appears to be relevant, material, and not unduly repetitious. Generally, the rulings will be made prior to the hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are limits on the formality of a witness lists ordered from the parties. The AJ may not order a synopsis of the witnesses' testimony. <span class="Italic">Pope v. Dept. of Transp</span>., <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/POPE_SE07528210074_OPINION_AND_ORDER_256077.pdf">12 MSPR 93</a>, 99 n.9, 10 MSPB 645 (1982) (only a general statement of testimony demonstrating relevance is required). The rule was restated: in permitting discovery, an AJ may order the production of affidavits or other recorded statements made by parties or potential witnesses, but he may not order the preparation and production of synopses of anticipated testimony to be delivered by one party to another. This holding has no bearing upon the AJ's authority to require the parties to file a list of witnesses expected to be called at the hearing, together with a general indication of how their testimony would be relevant and material to the proceedings. <span class="Italic">Affsa v. USDA</span>, 7 MSPR 446, 452 n.1, 7 MSPB 314 (1981). An appellant may not complain that an agency fails to disclose the substance of witnesses' testimony in an agency witness list if the appellant could have determined the substance of that testimony during discovery, e.g., through deposition. <span class="Italic">Ramos v. VA</span>, 4 MSPR 516, 519, 5 MSPB 46 (1981). But the list must be meaty enough to suit the taste of the AJ. Should a witness list be unspecific and the appellant fails to supply additional details about prospective witnesses on the AJ's request--often during discussion that occurs during the prehearing conference following prehearing submissions--the appellant cannot complain if the witnesses requested are denied. <span class="Italic">Arnstein v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 515, 517 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ wants more detailed information than a party provided in a witness list relating to the reasons for calling a witness, the AJ may require a written submission providing that information. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 659, 663 (1988). The required specificity is different as to subpoenas. A subpoena request should be supported "by a showing that the evidence sought is direct material to the issues involved in the appeal." 5 CFR 1201.81(c) (2022). Under earlier Board regulations, requests for subpoenas were to list the names of prospective witnesses and the facts expected to be proved through them. <span class="Italic">Hutchins v. DOJ</span>, 7 MSPR 645, 647, 7 MSPB 475 (1981). A party does not have a right to file a rebuttal to an order excluding witnesses, <span class="Italic">West v. DOJ</span>, 26 MSPR 576, 577 n.2 (1985), although objections to the ruling, discussed below, should be made.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smets v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SMETS_JANICE_R_SF_0432_10_0699_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_668638.pdf">117 MSPR 164</a>, 167 n.*, 2011 MSPB 97 (2011), noted, but did not fully discuss, the AJ's exclusion of witnesses as to whom no proffer could be made because the witnesses were apparently not interviewed by the appellant or her representative before the prehearing submission:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the administrative judge improperly rejected her witness requests because the appellant's representative did not speak with certain proposed witnesses and thus could not make a proffer of their testimony. The appellant has not shown, however, that the administrative judge abused her discretion to exclude witnesses under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(8), (10) upon finding that the appellant's representative did not follow the administrative judge's instructions and the testimony in question was not otherwise relevant. <span class="Italic">See Franco v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 322, 325 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Layton v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, SF-1221-14-0805-W-1 (NP 12/9/2015) ("The administrative judge conditioned approval of witnesses on certification from the parties that they had discussed or attempted to discuss the anticipated testimony with the requested witnesses. The appellant did not comply with the administrative judge's order. It is well settled that an administrative judge has broad discretion to control the course of the hearing before him.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even the appellant's own appearance is controlled through the prehearing process, and the appellant will not be heard to complain that he was not permitted to testify fully if he did not correctly handle the prehearing arrangements for his own appearance, <span class="Italic">Reid v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 648, 654-55 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the administrative judge improperly compelled him to testify and then limited his testimony on cross-examination by his representative....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We note that the appellant first indicated that he would testify at the hearing but that, during the hearing, the appellant's counsel indicated that he would not testify. The agency then moved to call the appellant as a witness on the basis that it had relied on the appellant's prior <span id="Page_1418"></span>representation that he would testify. The administrative judge granted the motion and limited cross-examination by the appellant's counsel to those issues raised on direct examination. Because the appellant waited until the hearing began before indicating that he would not testify, we find no abuse of discretion by the administrative judge in limiting his testimony....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, because the appellant did not intend to testify at the hearing, and was not aware that he would be called by the agency as a witness until after the hearing began, we find it incredible that he intended to rely on his own testimony to prove his affirmative defenses....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The prehearing conference (or a written submission in advance of the conference) is the time and place for objections to be lodged to witnesses. On occasion, a party seeking to avoid the hearing testimony of an individual called by the opposition will offer to the AJ (presumably after prehearing submissions are filed and before the prehearing conference) an objection to a witness listed in the opposing party's prehearing submission, sometimes accompanied, depending on the nature of the objection, by a written statement by the prospective witness disclaiming knowledge of an event. The Board appears to accept the practice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schaules v. USPS</span>, 19 MSPR 390, 392 (1984) ("Both of those witnesses submitted written statements declaring that they were unable to see whether appellant had in fact struck his supervisor because their view was obscured by a file cabinet."). If an objection to a witness is filed before the prehearing conference, the AJ is alerted that the witness will require some attention during the prehearing conference. Objections or none, during the prehearing conference the AJ may ask for more information about the need for particular witnesses, and the AJ will listen to objections made during the conference to particular witnesses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The use of a witness list should not become an impediment in the hearing process. Some consideration should be shown by the AJ for the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant, <span class="Italic">Gallegos v. FDIC</span>, 90 MSPR 159, 164 n.1 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, the appellant alleges in her petition that the AJ erred in denying her request to have a witness, Joe O'Brien, an editor for the Hartford Courant newspaper, served with a subpoena to testify on her behalf or to submit an affidavit. The appellant alleges that the AJ would not allow O'Brien to testify based on his determination that he had no record that she had submitted his name as a witness. The appellant, however, stated in her prehearing submission that a sworn statement from O'Brien would corroborate her version of events. Given her <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, this was sufficient notice that she was requesting O'Brien as a witness on her behalf. Accordingly, on remand, the AJ shall address the appellant's request for the presence of O'Brien as a witness in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One employee had but two days to provide a witness list to the AJ. The list was a day late. The appellant was told on the day of the hearing that the agency witnesses he called would not be present. The AJ declined, given the late witness list, to continue the hearing to provide for the presence of the witnesses. That was error: the appellant had no chance to secure the testimony by alternate means and was denied a proper hearing. The continuance should have been granted. <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. Military Sealift Command</span>, 24 MSPR 96, 98 (1984). Despite the Board's admonitions that witness lists should not obstruct the hearing process, the Board can enforce their use to achieve that result. In <span class="Italic">Perez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 32, 38 (1988), the appellant was not permitted to testify because he had not listed himself as a witness in any of several requests for identification of witnesses. When he finally listed himself as a witness in a late submission to the AJ, his testimony was not permitted at the hearing. Without commenting on the fact that the hearing is, by statute, for the sole benefit of the appellant, the Board sustained the refusal of the AJ to admit the appellant's testimony:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CALJ denied the appellant's request to be allowed to testify, sustaining the agency's objection to the request. In so doing, he noted the appellant's previous failure, despite numerous opportunities, to indicate his desire to include himself as a witness. We also note that the appellant has not shown specifically that he was prejudiced by the CALJ's denial of his request. The appellant submitted a lengthy reply to the notice of proposed removal, which was considered by both the agency and the CALJ. As the agency argues in its response to the petition for review, it is not likely that the appellant would have testified in a manner inconsistent with his written reply or with the witnesses he called on his behalf. Further, we note that the appellant was represented at all times during his appeal. We therefore discern no error or abuse of discretion in the CALJ's ruling in this regard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ omits a listed witness from the prehearing conference memorandum, the party seeking that witness must inform the AJ in writing of the omission or object to the memorandum or order; lacking notice or objection, the Board will preclude the party from raising the matter of missing witness through PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kranz v. DOJ</span>, 62 MSPR 630, 635-36 (1994). The rule that an objection must be preserved extends to specific denial or exclusion of a witness. The party whose witness is denied must then object to the exclusionary ruling or the matter is not properly preserved for review by PFR. <span class="Italic">McCarty v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 177, 181 (1995); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 363, 368 (1997) (failure of the appellant to object to the denial of witnesses before or at the hearing precludes the appellant from doing so on the PFR). There seems no good reason to require an objection or "exception" to be lodged to the exclusion of a witness listed for hearing; the necessity for the witness is preserved by the justification offered in the witness request. No regulation requires that approach. The AJ is well aware that denial of a requested witness is contrary to the stated desire of a party.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a party knows at the time of the prehearing submission that a given witness may be unavailable at the time of the hearing, a substitute or alternate witness may be listed and that individual will be allowed to testify unless there is a showing of prejudice to the opposing party. An example of the use of a substitute witness is provided in <span class="Italic">Richard v. DOD</span>, 66 MSPR 146, 156-57 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the administrative judge's decision to allow the agency to substitute a witness at the hearing, an administrative judge has the authority to rule on offers of proof and receive relevant evidence, and to order the production of evidence and the appearance of witnesses whose testimony would be relevant, material, and nonrepetitious. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.41(b)(3), (b)(10). Here, the agency asserted that one of its approved witnesses was unable to testify due to a personal emergency. The administrative judge permitted the agency to make the substitution upon finding that the testimony of the substitute witness was relevant to the agency's burden of proving a legitimate management reason for the reassignment, and was not repetitious. Although the appellant objected to the substitution on the ground that she had insufficient time to prepare for the substitute witness, the administrative judge offered to provide the appellant with additional time to prepare for cross-examining the witness. Moreover, the agency had included the substitute witness on its original witness list, along with a summary of his expected testimony. The agency informed the appellant on June 3, 1994, that it would try to have the substitute witness approved as a witness at the June 6-7, 1994 hearing, and the appellant filed a June 3, 1994 motion requesting that the agency be limited to the witnesses approved during the prehearing conference. The appellant did not, however, request the testimony of any rebuttal witnesses....&#8197;We therefore find that the appellant has not shown that the administrative judge abused her discretion in admitting the relevant and nonrepetitious testimony and documentary evidence relating to the agency's substitute witness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Richard</span> should not be taken to mean that if a witness is unavailable on the day of a hearing, the choices are foregoing the testimony of that witness or securing a substitute witness. The AJ should allow the requested witness to testify on another day, either at the hearing room or by telephone; alternatively, a deposition could substitute for hearing testimony.</p>
