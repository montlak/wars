<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-156"><span class="space">a.</span> Causation Analysis; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span></span></h5>
<p class="noindent">FLRA summarized its views on the analytical requirements in reprisal cases in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot and Int'l Bhd. of Police Officers, Local 358</span>, 35 FLRA 113, 118-22 (1990), involving a claim that a promotion was unlawfully denied to a <span id="Page_1380"></span>local union president: in all cases of alleged discrimination, whether "pretext" or "mixed motive," the General Counsel must establish that the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity and that activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee concerning hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. If the General Counsel makes the required "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span>" showing, an agency will not have violated section 7116(a)(2) if it can demonstrate, by a preponderant evidence, that there was a legitimate justification for its action and the same action would have occurred in the absence of protected activity. The General Counsel may seek to establish, as part of its <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case, that the reasons asserted by a respondent for its are pretextual. The General Counsel may also, however, seek to establish as its <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case only that the respondent took action based on consideration of protected activity and, after presentation of a respondent's evidence of nondiscriminatory reasons, seek to establish that those reasons are pretextual:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before discussing the specific facts of this case, we wish to address the analytical framework to be applied in cases alleging violations of section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute. In particular, we note the Union's assertion that once the General Counsel made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of discrimination, the burden "should have shifted" to the Respondent to demonstrate that it would have reached the same decision in the absence of Mr. Webber's protected activity. In response to this assertion, we emphasize two points.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the burden of proof always rests with the General Counsel. Section 2423.18 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations provides that "[t]he General Counsel...shall have the burden of proving the allegations of the complaint by a preponderance of the evidence." This is true in all cases of alleged discrimination, including "pretext" and "mixed motive" cases. In fact, the analytical framework applied to discrimination cases under section 7116(a)(2) is the same whether the case is labelled a "pretext" or a "mixed motive" case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In all cases of alleged discrimination, whether "pretext" or "mixed motive," the General Counsel must establish that: (1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">22nd Combat Support Group (SAC), March Air Force Base, California,</span> 27 FLRA 279 (1987) (<span class="Italic">March Air Force Base</span>). If the General Counsel fails to make the required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, the case ends without further inquiry. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Veterans Administration, Washington, D.C. and Veterans Administration Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio,</span> 26 FLRA 114 (1987), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied sub nom. American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2031 v. FLRA,</span> 878 F.2d 460 (D.C. Cir. 1989); and <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah,</span> 25 FLRA 342 (1987), where the particular conduct engaged in by employees was found not to be protected under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See also Veterans Administration Medical Center, Leavenworth, Kansas,</span> 31 FLRA 1161 (1988) and <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland,</span> 18 FLRA 55 (1985), where there was no evidence of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if the General Counsel makes the required "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span>" showing, an agency will not be found to have violated section 7116(a)(2) if the agency can demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for its action; and (2) the same action would have been taken even in the absence of protected activity. For example, <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> 6 FLRA at 99 where the Authority referenced the approach taken by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle,</span> 429 U.S. 274 (1977) (<span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span>). In <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy,</span> which involved conduct protected by the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court established a "test of causation" for the purpose of "protect[ing] against the invasion of [protected] rights without commanding undesirable consequences not necessary to the assurance of those rights." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 286-87. The Court held that the burden was on the moving party to show that his/her conduct was protected and that this conduct was a motivating factor in the employment decision. At that point, the employer could demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would have reached the same decision even in the absence of the protected conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is erroneous to conclude, however, that because a respondent agency has an opportunity to establish that it had legitimate justification for taking the disputed action, the ultimate burden of proof shifts to the respondent to do so. The burden of proving the allegations of the unfair labor practice complaint rests solely with the General Counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, even if the General Counsel makes the required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, it is necessary to determine whether the General Counsel has proved the allegation in the complaint by a preponderance of the evidence. In this regard, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case consists only of "sufficient evidence...to get plaintiff past...a motion to dismiss[.]" Black's Law Dictionary 1071 (5th ed. 1979) (citation omitted). Only if the respondent offers no evidence in its support does a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>showing alone equate to proof by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (noting that courts use the concept of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case to mean "not only that plaintiff's evidence would reasonably allow conclusion plaintiff seeks but also that plaintiff's evidence compels such a conclusion if the defendant produces no evidence to rebut it.") (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If, in response to a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case established by the General Counsel, the respondent offers evidence, it is necessary to determine whether the respondent's evidence rebuts the General Counsel's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing. This determination is made on the basis of the entire record, including any evidence the General Counsel offers in rebuttal to the respondent's showing. If the respondent rebuts the General Counsel's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing by a preponderance of the evidence, thereby establishing that it would have taken the allegedly unlawful action even in the absence of protected activity, the General Counsel has not established a violation of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, "pretext" and "mixed motive" cases differ in one respect only: in a "mixed motive" case, both lawful and unlawful reasons (motives) for the respondent's actions have been established. Because both lawful and unlawful motives have been established, it is necessary to determine whether the respondent would have taken the allegedly discriminatory action even without the unlawful motive. <span class="Italic">See, for example, United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service and United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service,</span> <span class="Italic">New Orleans District, New Orleans, Louisiana,</span> 30 FLRA 1013 (1988) (involving the evaluation of an employee's performance while he served as a union steward) and <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 24 FLRA 851 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Martinez v. FLRA,</span> 833 F.2d 1051 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (concerning the discharge of an employee following the filing of grievances). In each of these cases, the respondent established a lawful motive for the action that was taken and demonstrated that it would have acted in the same manner even in the absence of the protected conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a "pretext" case, on the other hand, a motive asserted by a respondent to be lawful is found to be unlawful (pretextual). Accordingly, unless the respondent establishes that there was an additional lawful (nonpretextual) motive for its allegedly discriminatory action, it is not necessary to determine whether the respondent would have taken the disputed action even without the unlawful motive. <span class="Italic">See, for example, United States Forces Korea/Eighth United States Army,</span> 11 FLRA 434 (1983) (the Authority found that the respondent's refusal to approve an extension of the local union president's overseas tour of duty was motivated by his union activity and that the reason for denying the extension was pretextual).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the General Counsel may seek to establish, as part of its <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case, that the reasons asserted by a respondent for its allegedly discriminatory action are pretextual. The General Counsel may also, however, seek to establish as its <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case, only that the respondent took action based on consideration of protected activity and, after presentation of a respondent's evidence of nondiscriminatory reasons, seek to establish that those reasons are pretextual. In addition, an administrative law judge, or the Authority, may conclude that a respondent's asserted reasons for taking an action are pretextual, even if those reasons were not asserted to be such during the unfair labor practice hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note also the Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">March Air Force Base,</span> where the General Counsel asserted that the respondent had lowered an employee's performance appraisal because the employee had sought union assistance and filed a grievance. The respondent asserted that the appraisal was lowered for performance-related reasons. The administrative law judge found that the General Counsel had not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority disagreed with the judge's finding and concluded that "the alleged reasons for the lowered appraisal were pretextual." 27 FLRA at 282. The Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Judge...declined to draw an inference that the protected activity was a motivating factor in the treatment complained of by [the employee]. We find not only that such an inference is proper, but on careful consideration we conclude that the protected activity alone was the motivating factor, because the asserted performance-related reasons have not been established.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority emphasized its holding as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Since we find that the asserted reason for the [r]espondent's action was pretextual, this is not a case where both legitimate and improper motives are found which would require us to consider whether the [r]espondent would have acted as it did even absent the improper motive. In other words, this is not a "mixed motive" case, subject to the analysis outlined in <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span>[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 285 n.2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's statement in <span class="Italic">March Air Force Base</span> that it was unnecessary to determine whether the respondent would have taken the allegedly discriminatory action without the unlawful motive because no other motive was established is consistent with the analytical framework <span id="Page_1381"></span>discussed above. The Authority's statement concerning the applicability of <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy,</span> however, may be misleading. As previously noted, a respondent always may seek to rebut the General Counsel's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, whether or not that case includes evidence that the respondent's asserted reasons for taking the allegedly discriminatory action were pretextual. It is erroneous to conclude, therefore, that the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> analysis does not apply in a "pretext" case. Rather, a conclusion that a respondent's asserted reasons for taking allegedly discriminatory action are pretextual is based on consideration of all the evidence presented in a case, including evidence presented by a respondent to rebut the General Counsel's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that the analytical framework discussed herein is consistent with the framework applied in the private sector. The National Labor Relations Board (the Board) adopted the same test in discrimination cases arising under the National Labor Relations Act (the Act). <span class="Italic">See Wright Line,</span> 251 NLRB 1083 (1980), <span class="Italic">enforced,</span> 662 F.2d 889 (1st Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 455 U.S. 989 (1982). Under a regulatory scheme that is comparable to that of the Statute, the Board held that its General Counsel bears the burden of proving the existence of unlawful discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. An employer may attempt to rebut the General Counsel's allegations but this rebuttal is viewed by the Board as an affirmative defense. Although the Board characterized the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> test as a "shifting of burdens," the Board cautioned that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]his shifting of burdens does not undermine the established concept that the General Counsel must establish an unfair labor practice by a preponderance of the evidence. The shifting burden merely requires the employer to make out what is actually an affirmative defense...to overcome the <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case of wrongful motive. Such a requirement does not shift the ultimate burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">251 NLRB at 1088 n.11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board's application of <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> was sustained by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp.,</span> 462 U.S. 393 (1983). There, the Court emphasized that the General Counsel bears the burden of proving the elements of an unfair labor practice and that the employer's advancement of an affirmative defense does not alter the elements of an unfair labor practice that the General Counsel must prove under the Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 401.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, we reaffirm that the General Counsel bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an unfair labor practice has been committed. In a case involving alleged discrimination under section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute, the General Counsel must establish that the respondent's allegedly discriminatory action was motivated by consideration of protected activity. The General Counsel may also seek to establish, as part of its <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, that respondent's asserted reasons for taking the allegedly discriminatory action are pretextual, or after presentation of respondent's evidence of lawful reasons, may seek to establish that those reasons are pretextual. <span class="Italic">See Wright Line,</span> 251 NLRB at 1088 n.12 ("The absence of any legitimate basis for an action, of course, may form part of the proof of the General Counsel's case.") (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the General Counsel makes the required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, a respondent may seek to rebut that showing by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, the affirmative defense that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for its action; and (2) the same action would have been taken in the absence of protected activity. The analytical framework is the same in all cases involving alleged discrimination. <span class="Italic">Compare Wright Line</span>, 251 NLRB at 1083 n.4 ("under the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> test, there is no real need to distinguish between pretext and dual motive cases.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Application of Analytical Framework</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge concluded that the General Counsel failed to establish that Mr.&#x2003;Webber's nonselection was motivated by his Union activities. For the following reasons, we disagree with the Judge's conclusion. We find that Mr. Webber's Union activity was the sole reason for the cancellation of the selection register and that the Respondent did not demonstrate that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected activity. We further find that had the Respondent not unlawfully cancelled the selection register, Mr. Webber would have been selected for the lead guard position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our analysis requires an in-depth review of the testimony adduced at the hearing. We begin with a look at Mr. Webber's Union activities followed by an examination of the practice of lead guard selections.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates, and the Judge found, that Mr. Webber was an active Union president who was involved in several incidents "which may not have pleased management." At least two of the incidents involved direct confrontations with the Director of Administration. Other incidents were elevated to higher levels of management.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also indicates that for many years, possibly as long as 20 years, the selecting official for lead guard positions was the Chief of Police, who was the second level supervisor. With regard to this practice, the Respondent's personnel staffing specialist testified that prior to October 1986, at which time the selection register at issue was voided, "it would have been [the] Chief" who made lead guard selections. Additionally, the first line supervisor, who was designated the selecting official when the register was reissued, also testified that the Chief had always made selections in the past and that the first line supervisor was surprised when he was given the task of making the selection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also indicates that on learning of Mr.&#x2003;Webber's selection, the Director of Administration questioned the Chief as to why the Chief had been the selecting official. The Chief replied that he had always made the selections. The Director of Administration responded by saying "you're not going to do that any more. That's not the way I want to do it." The Director of Administration also asked the Police Captain why the Chief was the selecting official rather than the first line supervisor. The Police Captain replied "that's the way it had been done before, in the past[.]" The Director of Administration also testified that because of the size of the organization he was managing, he was unaware of who was making lead guard selections until the register at issue came to his attention. The Director of Administration testified that at that time, "I changed it."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent maintained throughout this proceeding that the register was voided because the correct procedure of having the first line supervisor be the selecting official for lead guard positions was not followed.&#x2003;In support of its position, the Respondent argued that: (1) the Director of Administration believed that because the first line supervisor had to supervise the lead guard, the first line supervisor should be able to decide with whom he wants to work; and (2) the position description of the first line supervisor and an agency regulation require the first line supervisor to make lead guard selections.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first reason asserted by the Respondent must be contrasted with the fact, noted by the Judge, that the employee selected for the lead guard position would not necessarily work under the first line supervisor. The record reveals that although applicants may know that a vacancy exists on a particular shift, a successful applicant for the position is not necessarily placed on that shift. This is so because other lead guards have an opportunity to bump into the shift. The selected employee would then be placed on the shift on which a vacancy was created by virtue of the exercise of bumping rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second reason advanced by the Respondent is that the first line supervisor is required by his/her position description and an agency regulation to be the selecting official. Neither the position description nor the regulation was introduced into evidence. In fact, the Respondent's personnel staffing specialist testified that neither of those documents specifically identified the first line supervisor as the selecting official. The specialist also stated that it was a violation of merit promotion procedures to allow the second level supervisor to make lead guard selections. When asked by the Judge how a long-standing policy of allowing the Chief to be the selecting official could exist where such a practice was claimed to be a violation of merit promotion procedures, the specialist replied "I can't give you an answer on that[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also indicates that the Director of Administration and the Police Captain expressed concern about the choice of Mr.&#x2003;Webber to occupy a lead guard position. The Director of Administration testified that "Mr. Webber was not a good choice" based on his conduct on the Respondent's premises. All of this conduct appears to have occurred during Mr. Webber's non-duty time with some of the conduct, though not all, involving representational activities. The Police Captain expressed his concern about the selection to the Director of Administration before the register was voided. As indicated by the Judge, the Police Captain also made statements to Mr. Webber's successor as Union president concerning Mr. Webber, and unions generally, which the Judge found to constitute "mild evidence of <span class="Italic">animus</span>." We note, additionally, the Respondent's concession that "Mr. Webber's representational activities may have contributed to a judgment as to his potential to be a [lead guard]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Respondent claimed, in its post-hearing brief to the Judge, that from the time the register was voided, "<span class="Italic">all</span> selections within the guard force have been made by the first line supervisors." However, the record contains no evidence that there were any lead guard selections following the selection action in this case. The evidence that was introduced indicated only that first line supervisors had made selections for Police Officer positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As indicated above, the Judge concluded that although he regarded the "course of events here as highly suspicious[,]" the General Counsel failed to establish that Mr. Webber's non-selection was motivated by his Union activities. In our view, the record clearly establishes otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that Mr.&#x2003;Webber was an active Union president and that he was engaged in protected activity when he was selected for the lead guard position. The selection of Mr. Webber was made in accordance with the long-standing practice of having the second level <span id="Page_1382"></span>supervisor serve as the selecting official. It was only when the Director of Administration learned of Mr. Webber's selection that the Respondent insisted upon following what it claimed to be the correct procedure of having the first line supervisor make the selection. However, no evidence was presented by the Respondent to demonstrate that this was the correct procedure or that there was a policy in effect of having the first line supervisor make lead guard selections. To the contrary, the Director of Administration testified that he was changing the policy and that the second level supervisor would not be making lead guard selections in the future. Moreover, the record establishes, and the Respondent concedes, that Mr. Webber's protected activity played a part in the decision that Mr. Webber was a poor choice for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the General Counsel has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the voiding of the selection register, which resulted in Mr. Webber not being selected for the lead guard position, was motivated solely by his protected activity. Therefore, we find that the Respondent's alleged reasons for its actions were pretextual. Accordingly, we find that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Air Force Materiel Command and AFGE Local 987</span>, 55 FLRA 1201, 1205 (2000), recapitulated <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that the Authority applies the analytical framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny </span>for resolving complaints of alleged discrimination in violation of section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Center,</span> <span class="Italic">Warner Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, </span>52 FLRA 602, 605 (1996). The same framework applies for resolving complaints of discrimination under section 7116(a)(4) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Federal Emergency Management</span> <span class="Italic">Agency, </span>52 FLRA 486, 490 (1996) <span class="Italic">(FEMA); Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Brockton and</span> <span class="Italic">West Roxbury, Massachusetts, </span>43 FLRA 780, 781 (1991) <span class="Italic">(VA, Brockton). Under Letterkenny, </span>the General Counsel establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>showing of discrimination by establishing that: (1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee. If the General Counsel fails to make the required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, the case ends without further inquiry. Once the General Counsel makes the required <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>showing, an agency may seek to establish the affirmative defense that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for the action; and (2) the same action would have been taken even in the absence of protected activity. The General Counsel may seek to establish that the agency's reasons for taking the action were pretextual. <span class="Italic">See Department of Commerce, NOAA,</span> 54 FLRA at 995.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we note that the Judge, in determining whether a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case of discrimination was established under the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny </span>framework, looked beyond the General Counsel's evidence and considered the record on a whole. The Judge's consideration of the entire record in making this determination is consistent with Authority case law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, North Atlantic Region,</span> <span class="Italic">Brookhaven Service Center, Holtsville, New York</span>, 53 FLRA 732, 746-48 (1997) (Authority adopted the judge's findings and conclusions where the judge considered the testimony of respondent's witnesses in determining whether a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case of discrimination had been established). <span class="Italic">See also Equal Employment</span> <span class="Italic">Opportunity Commission, Phoenix District, Phoenix,</span> <span class="Italic">Arizona, </span>50 FLRA 261, 263-64 (1995) (Authority considered the entire record in determining whether a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>showing of discriminatory motivation was established). Moreover, consistent with the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework outlined above, we find that the Judge appropriately determined that had a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>showing of discrimination been established, a more thorough evaluation and analysis of Respondent's affirmative defenses would have been necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Judge's conclusions that inferences of discriminatory motive are not warranted based on the timing and alleged disparate treatment of the grievants. As for inferences to be drawn based on the timing of management actions, the Authority previously has held that "[a]lthough closeness in time between an agency's employment decision and protected activity engaged in by a union may support an inference of illegal anti-union motivation, it is not conclusive proof of a violation." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Washington,</span> <span class="Italic">D.C., </span>37 FLRA 25, 37 (1990). <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center Northampton, Massachusetts</span>, 51 FLRA 1520, 1528 (1996); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, Frenchburg</span> <span class="Italic">Job Corps, Mariba, Kentucky, </span>49 FLRA 1020, 1033 (1994); <span class="Italic">General Services Administration, Region IX, San Francisco, California, </span>40 FLRA 973, 982 (1991); <span class="Italic">United States Customs Service, Region IV, Miami District, Miami, Florida, </span>36 FLRA 489, 496 (1990).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contests the Judge's finding that the GC established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation under &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2), based on the supervisor reporting the agent to the Joint Intake Center for lack of candor. Under &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) of the Statute, it is a ULP "to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization by discrimination in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment."[36] In <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot</span> (<span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>),[37] the Authority established the analytical framework for determining whether an agency action violates this provision of the Statute.[38] First, the GC must show by preponderant evidence: (1) that the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) that such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment.[39] If the GC proves these elements, then it has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation.[40] However, even if the GC makes the required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, the Agency will not be found to have violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) if it can demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for its action; and (2) the same action would have been taken even in the absence of protected activity.[41]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Judge found, and the Agency does not dispute, that the agent was engaged in protected activity when he reported to the PAIC--after retaining the Union steward as his representative in the matter--that the supervisor had denied him assistance during the September 17 shift.[42] In addition, the Judge found, and the Agency does not dispute, that the agent's protected activity motivated the supervisor's report to the Joint Intake Center. However, the Agency argues that the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case has not been established because the supervisor's report to the Joint Intake Center, and the subsequent investigation of the agent, did not affect a condition of the agent's employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[42]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> GC's Ex. 4 (agent's statement to PAIC concerning denial-of-assistance incident); Decision at 28; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Naval Air Station Alameda, Alameda, Cal</span>., 38 FLRA 567, 569 (1990) (stating that seeking union assistance is a "protected activity" under the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) prohibits retaliation for protected union activity "in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment[.]" Here, the record reflects that the agent was barred from receiving any promotion or being hired into a different position pending the results of the investigation into his alleged lack of candor. Moreover, the investigation subjected the agent to possible discipline or termination. Hence, the supervisor's retaliatory conduct was connected to specifically identified conditions of employment in &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2).[48] Accordingly, we find that the GC has established its <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, and we deny the exception.</p>

Section 7116(a) states that it is unfair labor practice for an agency, among other things, "(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this chapter...[and] (4) to discipline or otherwise discriminate against an employee because the employee has filed a complaint, affidavit, or petition, or has given any information or testimony under this chapter." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (a)(4). Under the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework, in order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, the OOC must show that: "(1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 118.

<p class="noindent-1">Although we have not yet had an occasion to consider the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework, we note that two other circuit courts have applied it for Federal Labor Relation Authority (FLRA) cases. <span class="Italic">See Pension Benefit Guar.

Neither party suggests a different framework should apply here, and after considering the matter, we conclude that the OOC Board properly considered this case under the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework. If the USCP's justification for its discipline is found to be pretextual, then it is unnecessary to determine whether it would have taken the action absent the protected activity because such actions, by definition, would not have been taken for nondiscriminatory reasons. <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, 35 F.L.R.A. at 120; <span class="Italic">see Golden State Foods Corp.</span>, 340 NLRB 382, 385 (2003).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VA, Brockton</span>, 43 FLRA at 781, the Authority stated that it applies the same analytical framework for resolving complaints alleging discrimination under section 7116(a)(4) of the Statute as it does in resolving discrimination complaints under section 7116(a)(2). That framework was set out by the Authority in its decision in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, the Authority reaffirmed that the General Counsel bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that an unfair labor practice has been committed. In cases of alleged discrimination, the General Counsel must establish that: (1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in activity protected by the Statute; and (2) such protected activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. Even when the General Counsel makes this requisite showing, an agency will not be found to have violated the Statute if the agency demonstrates that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for its action; and (2) the same action would have been taken even in the absence of protected activity.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;In its <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> decision, the Authority described the General Counsel's required showing as its "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span>" case. 35 FLRA at 118. Consistent with recent rulings by the Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit discussing burdens of proof, we reaffirm that, as used by the Authority, the term "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span>" case, as used in cases involving alleged violations of section 7116(a)(2) and (4) of the Statute, describes the elements that the General Counsel is required to establish in order to withstand a motion to dismiss the complaint; this case constitutes proof by a preponderance of the evidence if the respondent offers no evidence that it took a disputed action for legitimate reasons. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 118; <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="noindent-1">It is desirable for judges to expressly determine how the elements of the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> analysis apply in each case, and the Authority expects that they will do so. However, no authority is cited or apparent for the proposition that a failure to do so requires reversal. Moreover, case law suggests to the contrary. For example, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Ogden Service Center, Ogden, Utah and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 67</span>, 42 FLRA 1034 (1991), the Authority denied exceptions to an arbitration award finding that the agency had violated section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute.

<p class="noindent-1">The NLRB has found that even where the deciding official is ignorant of an employee's union activity, the discharge of that employee based in part on a discussion with a supervisor who is aware of the employee's union activity and hostile to the union is sufficient to constitute a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of a violation of section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act. <span class="Italic">Hambre Hombre Enterprises Inc.</span>, 228 NLRB 136 (1977), <span class="Italic">enf'd</span>, 581 F.2d 204 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>

<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit remanded <span class="Italic">PBGC</span> for reconsideration, chiding FLRA for examining only the conduct of some employees arguably similarly situated to the alleged discriminatee. The court suggested that factors identified by the MSPB under <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280 (1981) (including, among other factors, the nature and seriousness of an offense, its relation to the employee's duties, the employee's job level, the employee's past disciplinary record, the effect of the offense upon supervisory confidence in the employee's ability to perform), must be considered relevant to a disciplinary decision. To the extent that FLRA examines the conduct of similarly situated employees to ascertain disparity in treatment, FLRA must provide a reasoned explanation as to why and how the employees' actions are comparable. Comparability of offenses may encompass examination of the agency's treatment of managerial employees when the discriminatee is not a manager but is in a position of trust or high responsibility.</p>
<p class="noindent">After the D.C. Circuit's remand of <span class="Italic">PBGC</span>, FLRA sent the case back to its ALJ for additional findings, with leave to its judge to take additional evidence. <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. and NTEU</span>, 47 FLRA 595, 599-600 (1993), explained what the ALJ was to analyze:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether Power was subject to disparate treatment in this case, we must examine whether Power was treated differently from similarly situated employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">PBGC v. FLRA</span>, 967 F.2d at 667. In making such a determination, the Authority considers the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case. The Authority compares, among other things, the consistency of treatment received by an employee who engaged in protected activity with that received by other employees: (1) from the same supervisor...and (2) in the workplace as a whole, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 37 FLRA 161, 172-74 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in determining whether employees are similarly situated in circumstances where an adverse or disciplinary action was taken against an employee who engaged in protected activity and against one who did not, we find that it is relevant to compare: (1) the nature of the misconduct, <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. United States Postal Service</span>, 888 F.2d 1568, 1571 (11th Cir. 1989); (2) the positions the employees occupied, <span class="Italic">Reeves Brothers, Inc., Eagle and Phoenix Division</span>, 207 NLRB 51, 53-54 (1973); (3) the employees' past disciplinary records, <span class="Italic">Aratex Services, Inc.</span>, 300 NLRB 115, 116 (1990); and (4) the extent to which employees were previously warned that their conduct may result in discipline, <span class="Italic">Fast Food Merchandisers, Inc.</span>, 291 NLRB 897, 898-99 (1988). We also find that it is appropriate to examine the elements listed in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPR 280, 305-06 (1981) (<span class="Italic">Douglas</span>) that are relevant to a particular adverse action decision and the extent to which a respondent consistently relied on the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> elements, or any other factors, when imposing adverse or disciplinary actions. We note that the weight given to the above-noted factors may vary with the circumstances presented in a specific case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record before us is insufficient to make the determinations required by the court's remand. Specifically, with respect to Employee No. 6, the Judge made no findings and the record does not otherwise provide sufficient information to determine whether Employee No. 6 was similarly situated to Power. Further, with respect to Employee No. 9, the record shows that Employee No. 9 received a 60-day suspension for fighting on duty and for engaging in gross insubordination by refusing to follow his supervisor's repeated directions. Employee No. 9 had previously received warnings for engaging in similar misconduct, but the Respondent decided not to discharge him, as was originally proposed. However, despite the statement of one employee that Employee No. 9's supervisor was "afraid of him[,]" the record is unclear on the extent to which the Respondent considered the effect of Employee No. 9's misconduct on his supervisor's confidence in him in determining what disciplinary action to impose. Moreover, as to Employee No. 1, the record is unclear as to the extent of the warnings received by that employee in the spring of 1986 or any time prior to the imposition of discipline. The record is also unclear on the extent to which the Respondent considered Employee No. 1's potential for rehabilitation in deciding to suspend rather than discharge Employee No. 1....&#8197;Accordingly, we will remand this case to the Judge for further processing....</p>
<p class="noindent">In a decision following the remand, FLRA determined in <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. and NTEU</span>, 52 FLRA 1390, 1401-07 (1997), that Mr. Power was properly discharged. First, FLRA determined that an employer may discipline an employee for insubordinate conduct, including refusal to participate in the employer's investigation of misconduct, despite the employee's involvement in protected activity. Second, FLRA compared the circumstances and penalties involving other employees accused of misconduct and concluded that, whatever the similarities or distinctions, Power was not treated disparately by the agency and that the agency would have taken the same action absent Power's protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Mr. Power then appealed his case to the D.C. Circuit, but that court affirmed FLRA's denial of relief, <span class="Italic">Power v. FLRA</span>, 146 F.3d 995, 1000-01 (D.C. Cir. 1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Power now petitions this Court to reverse the FLRA's April 30, 1997 decision. He requests that the PBGC be ordered to offer him immediate reinstatement to his former (or a comparable) position with full backpay and interest and that it be instructed to expunge from its records all references to his removal, to post a notice to all employees admitting its error and to pay attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Power again advances several arguments, none of which has merit. First, we reject both of Power's "protected activity" claims under the FSLMRS. With respect to his repeated refusals to provide a writing sample, Power's pending grievance "over the exact subject matter for which the writing sample was requested," does not immunize him from responding to a supervisor's good faith request for rating material. Moreover, Power's assertion that he merely wished to be judged on his entire body of writing over the rating period does not explain his insubordinate behavior in submitting over 2,000 pages of unstapled, uncollated pages, many of which were totally irrelevant, including other individuals' court filings and LEXIS printouts. Power's strained argument--that he was engaged in a statutorily "protected activity" by tardily submitting nonresponsive documents in response to his supervisor's repeated and legitimate requests for writing samples--is without merit. We also reject Power's claim that his refusal to obey the management order to return the computer usage surveys was a statutorily "protected activity." We agree with the FLRA that "the information was...PBGC's property that Power obtained from an unauthorized source without PBGC's knowledge or consent" and that Power's "first obligation [was] to comply with [his] supervisory order[s], reserving any complaints or grievances for a later time." <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guar. Corp.</span>, 52 F.L.R.A. at 1617.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Power invokes for support the decision in <span class="Italic">United States Air Force Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City and AFGE</span>, which overturned the management's discipline of a union representative who was detained by security officers after refusing to leave a work area where he was attempting "to personally <span id="Page_1385"></span>serve copies of unfair labor practice charges filed by the Union on Activity supervisors who were named in the charges." 34 F.L.R.A. 385, 386 (1990). We find the decision inapposite because, as noted above, Power's insubordinate conduct was neither union-related nor statutorily protected. Nor was it "grounded" or "rooted" in any provision of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See NLRB v. City Disposal Sys., Inc.</span>, 465 U.S. 822, 831-32, 104 S. Ct. 1505, 79 L. Ed.2d 839 (1984). Moreover, <span class="Italic">United States Air Force</span> reaffirms "[m]anagement's right...to discipline a union representative for activities which 'are not specifically on behalf of the exclusive representative or which exceed the boundaries of protected activity such as flagrant misconduct.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 388-89 (quoting <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard, Long Beach, Calif.</span>, 25 F.L.R.A. 1002, 1005 (1987)). Finally, as we have repeatedly recognized, "[e]ngaging in union activities does not shield an employee from being fired." <span class="Italic">Avecor, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 931 F.2d 924, 928 (D.C. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Power also claims that the FLRA's dismissal of his wrongful termination claim is "arbitrary, irrational, unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, and is otherwise not in accordance with law." Notwithstanding his repeated efforts to re-write the facts of this case, characterizing his insubordination as "minor and inadvertent" and "mistaken violations of office protocol," we have already concluded that Power engaged in "many incidents of insubordinate conduct" and "multiple types of insubordination." <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guar. Corp.</span>, 967 F.2d at 660, 670. The facts underlying Power's termination are the same today as they were when this Court first heard the matter. Now, as then, the FLRA's conclusion that PBGC "had a legitimate justification for its action," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 666 (internal quotations omitted), is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result, the question on remand was simply whether Power would have been terminated even in the absence of protected activity. After comparing Power's circumstances to those of other disciplined employees, both the ALJ and the FLRA concluded that Power had not been treated disparately. While Power uses selective facts from the record in an attempt to recast his misconduct in a more favorable light, his attempts fail to demonstrate that the ALJ's and FLRA's findings lack substantial support in the record as a whole. Indeed, even if the case were closer, we would nonetheless affirm the FLRA because its findings, supported by substantial evidence, "may not be displaced on review even if the court might have reached a different result had the matter been before it <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">LCF, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 129 F.3d 1276, 1281 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Power next argues that the FLRA erroneously adopted and applied the factors outlined in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 5 M.S.P.B. 280, 305-06 (1981). Specifically, Power contends that the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors apply only to Merit Systems Protection Board cases and that the FLRA could not adopt those factors as its own because they had been developed by another administrative body. As we specifically noted in <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. FLRA</span>, however, "[i]t is, of course, for the FLRA to determine in the first instance what factors are relevant in deciding whether employees are similarly situated." 967 F.2d at 668. We then discussed in detail numerous <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to be considered after declaring that "many factors may be relevant in determining an appropriate sanction." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

AFGE Local 2145 and VAMC Richmond</span>, 64 FLRA 661, 664 (2010) (reviewing arbitration award on exception examining application of <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> analysis: "In this connection, although the Union asserts that the grievant was charged with AWOL for conduct that 'no other employee would ever be held accountable for[,]' the Union does not point to any instances where other employees were absent from work without requesting leave and were not charged with AWOL. Consequently, the record establishes that the second part of the Union's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework is not satisfied and, thus, no <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on protected activity has been established.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The motivational test involves shifting burdens of proof. In any case involving action affecting the conditions of employment of an employee known to be active in protected union activity, there is a suspicion or presumption that the action was motivated by the employee's protected activity. The presumption is rebuttable. If it is shown that the action was for legitimate reasons unrelated to protected union activity, and that the employee's protected activity played no part in the decision to take the action complained of, no violation occurs. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Office of Sec'y, Comptroller for Virgin Islands and AFGE Local 3514</span>, 11 FLRA 521, 532 (1983) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs and AFGE Local 1867</span>, 52 FLRA 874, 878 (1997) (satisfying threshold burden of establishing <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case establishes violation of Statute only if respondent offers no evidence in its defense). Although there may be some animus toward a union official because of union activities, there is no ULP if denial of a benefit, e.g., overtime, would have occurred without the animus. <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1501</span>, 22 FLRA 420, 421 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">Not every disparate treatment case hinges on complexities of mixed-motive analysis. FLRA determined in <span class="Italic">22nd Combat Support Group, March AFB and AFGE Local 3854</span>, 27 FLRA 279, 285 n.2 (1987), involving a claim that an appraisal was lowered because of union activities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since we find that the asserted reason for the Respondent's action was pretextual, this is not a case where both legitimate and improper motives are found which would require us to consider whether the Respondent would have acted as it did even absent the improper motive. In other words, this is not a "mixed motive" case, subject to the analysis outlined in <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274 (1977). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 6 FLRA 96 (1981).</p>
