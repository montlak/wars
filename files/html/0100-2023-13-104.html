<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-103"><span class="space">f.</span> Postal Service National and Other Collective Bargaining Contracts</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Many cases concerning light duty for employees returning from sick leave involve the Postal Service National Labor Agreement. The relation of contract light duty provisions and Board appellate status over denials of that status surfaced in the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Horner v. Schuck</span>, 843 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1988), involving an appeal from an alleged furlough. <span class="Italic">Schuck</span>, a consolidated appeal, included a number of Postal Service appellants who, because of non-job-related physical conditions, were given temporary or permanent light duty assignments and were then placed in nonpay, nonduty status when there was no work available within their job restrictions. The operative contract provisions for the employees were quoted in <span class="Italic">Schuck</span>, 843 F.2d at 1375-76:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ARTICLE 8: HOURS OF WORK</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1. Work Week.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The work week for full-time regulars shall be forty (40) hours per week, eight (8) hours per day.... Shorter work weeks will, however, exist as needed for part-time regulars.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3. Exceptions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The above shall not apply to part-time employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Part-time employees will be scheduled in accordance with the above rules, except they may be scheduled for less than eight (8) hours per service day and less than forty (40) hours per normal work week.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ARTICLE 13: ASSIGNMENT OF ILL OR INJURED REGULAR WORK FORCE EMPLOYEES</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3. Local implementation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Light duty assignments may be established from part-time hours, to consist of 8 hours or less in a service day and 40 hours or less in a service week. The establishment of such assignment does not guarantee any hours to a part-time flexible employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Number of Light Duty Assignments. The number of assignments within each craft that may be reserved for temporary or permanent light duty assignments, consistent with good business practices, shall be determined by past experience as to the number of reassignments that can be expected during each year, and the method used in reserving these assignments to insure that no assigned full-time regular employee will be adversely affected, will be defined through local negotiations. The light duty employee's tour hours, work location and basic work week shall be those of the light duty assignment and the needs of the service, whether or not the same as for the employee's previous duty assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4. General Policy Procedures</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;Every effort shall be made to reassign the concerned employee within the employee's present craft or occupational group, even if such assignment reduces the number of hours of work for the supplemental work force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;The reassignment of a full-time regular or part-time flexible employee to a temporary or permanent light duty or other assignment shall not be made to the detriment of any full-time regular on a scheduled assignment or give a reassigned part-time flexible preference over other part-time flexible employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D.&#x2003;The reassignment of a full-time regular or part-time flexible employee under the provisions of this Article to an agreed-upon light duty temporary or permanent or other assignment within the office, such as type of assignment, area of assignment, hours of duty, etc., will be the decision of the installation's head who will be guided by the examining physician's report, employee's ability to reach the place of employment and ability to perform the duties involved.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schuck</span> decided that the Board had jurisdiction to determine whether the employees were properly laid off in accordance with federal regulations and with the terms of the negotiated agreement, that is, because of a lack of work. The court determined that the "plain language of the agreement does not provide support for the agency's contention that it is entitled to place respondents in nonpay, nonduty status whenever work is unavailable within their job restrictions." The court went on to state as to one of the appellants in the consolidated case, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1378:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming the board improperly interpreted the agreement, the agency's actions were nevertheless improper with respect to the respondents in <span class="Italic">James</span> because the agency failed to carry its burden of establishing that on the dates in question it lacked sufficient work for those respondents to perform within their work restrictions. The board specifically found that the agency made no effort to place these respondents in other positions within the mail handlers craft which were encumbered by supplemental work force employees, in violation of Article 13, Section 4.A, of the collective bargaining agreement, which states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Every effort shall be made to reassign the concerned employee within the employee's present craft or occupational group, even if such assignment reduces the number of hours of work for the supplemental work force. After all efforts are exhausted in this area, consideration will be given to reassignment to another craft or occupational group within the same installation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Campbell v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 646, 656 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21 (2003), also discussed a provision of a Postal Service contract setting parameters for light duty work involving lifting restrictions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 8, 2002, the agency issued a decision letter on the proposal to place her on enforced leave. According to this letter, the proposal was proper, based on the information that the agency had at that time, i.e., the limit on lifting to 0 pounds. The letter further explains that the appellant's June 24 restrictions needed clarification, that the Reasonable Accommodation Committee met with the appellant and her representative on July 26, and that the agency received adequate documentation on August 5 clarifying what she could and could not do. On that basis, the agency returned the appellant to work on August 6. The appellant has not disputed the facts asserted in the August 8, 2002 decision letter. As the administrative judge noted, the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) provides that employees must be able to lift the equivalent of 15 pounds to be eligible for light duty. Therefore, until the agency received Dr. Watson's certificate increasing the appellant lifting limitation to 15 pounds, it had no obligation under the CBA to offer her light duty. There is no documentation in the record, nor has the appellant alleged, that the agency affirmatively instructed the appellant not to return to work in her regular position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the June 24 certificate from Dr. Watson increased the appellant's lifting ability to 15 pounds, it indicated that other restrictions on walking, length of work day, and exposure to dust applied. The agency received this certificate on July 3, and sought clarification of these restrictions. When it received a more detailed explanation of the restrictions on August 5, it placed her on light duty. The appellant did not allege in her response to the administrative judge's order that she submitted any further information to the agency before August 5. We agree with the administrative judge that, under the circumstances, the agency's delay in returning the appellant to work on light duty does not constitute a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Campbell</span> was summarized in <span class="Italic">Marino v. USPS,</span> PH-0752-09-0164-I-1 (NP 12/20/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant failed to show that the agency's delay in placing him in light duty status constituted a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Campbell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 21 (2003) (an agency's delay in returning an employee to work on light duty does not constitute a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction where the delay was caused by the need to clarify the employee's medical restrictions); <span class="Italic">Zysk v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 520, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 5 (2008) (requiring an employee to "clock out" when he reaches the limits of his medical restrictions is not a constructive suspension because an agency is not obligated to guarantee an employee a light duty assignment of 8 hours per workday or 40 hours per week). Further, the appellant failed to show that the agency improperly removed him from limited duty status based on his work-related hip injury. The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs indicated that he would not receive further benefits based on the limitations that the injury caused to his ability to perform the duties of his position. The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs indicated that the appellant could work full time, regular duty, with no restrictions. Further, the appellant's physician indicated that the appellant no longer had work restrictions due to his work-related injury. The physician stated that "all problems with [the appellant's] hip issues have been resolved and that he has no work restrictions relative to that hip."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mojarro v. USPS,</span> SF-0752-09-0163-B-1 (NP 12/10/2010), noted the availability to the USPS of a fitness for duty examination to resolve questions concerning an individual's ability to assume or resume light duty under the collective bargaining agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reiterates his argument from below that he submitted sufficient medical documentation to require the agency to permit him to return to work. This documentation consisted of four letters from Harry Lewis, M.D., dated from December 24, 2008, to April 16, 2009, in which Dr. Lewis released the appellant to return to work without restrictions. Those letters were inconsistent with the appellant's letters of December 19, 2008, and December 30, 2008, in which he stated that he was "ready to return to work" <span class="Italic">with</span> restrictions for his "foot problems." More importantly, the appellant's claim that he was ready to return to work was contradicted by other evidence in the record, including the appellant's statement during a January 27, 2009 Fitness For Duty (FFD) examination that he was still disabled and would not "last over one week" if he went <span id="Page_2107"></span>back to work. Given the conflicting information regarding the appellant's ability to return to duty, the administrative judge correctly found that the agency "had a legitimate need to require further information and assessment to determine [the appellant's] present ability to return [to work]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the agency did not have the authority to require him to submit to an FFD examination before offering him a light-duty assignment. In particular, he claims that the agency did not have the authority to order him to undergo a psychological evaluation under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(e)(1)(ii) because his position did not have medical standards and was not subject to a medical evaluation program. He also reiterates his argument from below that the agency violated the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Enforcement Guidance for Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act [EEOC Guidelines] by requiring him to take an FFD examination before making him a job offer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's obligations to provide light-duty assignments to employees who are recuperating from an injury are governed by the applicable collective bargaining agreement and the agency's Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM). Section 865.6 of the ELM authorizes the agency's physician to require an employee asking to return to duty following an absence for medical reasons to undergo an FFD examination when, as here, after reviewing the medical documentation submitted in support of the employee's request to return to work, the physician questions whether the employee can perform the essential functions of his position. Therefore, the administrative judge properly rejected the appellant's argument that the EEOC guidelines prohibited the agency from requiring the appellant to undergo a psychological FFD examination before allowing him to return to work. Further, because the agency had the authority to order the appellant to submit to a psychological FFD examination under the ELM, whether the agency had the authority to order such an examination under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(e)(1) is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant also reiterates his disability discrimination claim. As the administrative judge explained, absent an otherwise appealable action, allegations of discrimination are beyond the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980). Thus, because the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's construction suspension appeal, the Board does not have jurisdiction over his discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a constructive suspension appeal, the Board determined it lacked jurisdiction following a determination that the agency did not violate a collective bargaining agreement provision concerning grants of light duty in <span class="Italic">Zimmerman v. DOD</span>, PH-0752-14-0464-I-1 (NP 9/26/2014), involving a labor contract with the Defense Logistics Agency.</p>
