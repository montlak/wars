<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wonder v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 35 MSPR 209, 211-12 (1987), noted but did not decide what arrangements the Board must make to aid disabled appellants in its hearing procedures. The appellant, who settled his adverse action appeal, sought by motion the reimbursement of fees spent to engage an interpreter to assist the appellant in overcoming his deafness disability. The motion was denied. The Board concluded that the interpreter's assistance was not necessary to aid the appellant in reaching or understanding the written settlement. But the Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 29 USC 794, a handicapped employee may not "solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination...under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency...." In addition, the appellant has both a statutory and regulatory right to a hearing on his initial appeal to the regional office....&#8197;Therefore, reasonable accommodations "may have to be made" to assure "otherwise qualified handicapped individuals the meaningful access to which they are entitled." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Choate</span>, 469 U.S. 287 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that, on this record, the appellant has not demonstrated that he did not have meaningful access to the proceedings as they occurred. Thus, we need not decide whether there would have been a violation of 29 USC 794 if a hearing on the merits of the appellant's case had been held and an interpreter was not present. However, where the ability of a qualified handicapped individual to understand and communicate with counsel with regard to proceedings before the Board is impaired, the Board is obliged to provide an interpreter. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 29 USC &#x00A7; 794.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the <span class="Italic">Hearings Procedures Guide</span>, the Board adds some guidance concerning use of interpreters. Although the <span class="Italic">Hearings Procedures Guide</span> has been superseded by the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>, the <span class="Italic">Hearings Procedures Guide</span> is still used for training and orientation. The <span class="Italic">Guide</span> provides, at 22-23:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">F. INTERPRETERS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;Factors to Consider</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (22 USC Sec. 794), provides that a handicapped employee may not "solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination...under any program or activity conducted by any Executive Agency...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reasonable accommodation "may have to be made" to assure "otherwise qualified handicapped individuals the meaningful access to which they are entitled." <span class="Italic">Wonder v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 35 MSPR 209 (1987); <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Choate</span>, 469 U.S. 287 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1827(d) of title 28 United States Code provides for the use of interpreters in courts of the United States in proceedings involving the hearing impaired. Section 1827(b) provides that the education, training and experience of the individual in need of an interpreter are factors to be considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 43(f), the Court may appoint an interpreter, of its own selection and may fix the interpreter's reasonable compensation. However, Fed. R. Evid. 604 provides that an interpreter is subject to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence relating to qualification as an expert and the administration of an oath or affirmation to make a true translation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Rivera v. SSA</span>, DC-0752-15-0053-I-1 (NP 1/6/2017) (referring to Executive Order 13166, requiring agencies to provide a system allowing a Limited English Proficient person to meaningfully access the agency's services).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The right to an interpreter should not be abused. An AJ correctly sustained an agency objection when the appellant's representative began speaking Spanish during his direct examination of the appellant. The representative claimed that he was not examining the witness or giving her instructions, but was translating certain words so that the appellant would understand them. The Board suggested that the AJ's action was appropriate so that a proper verbatim record would be kept of the hearing. <span class="Italic">Sanches-Mariani v. Dept. of Army</span>, 14 MSPR 545, 546 (1983); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Young v. VA</span>, 83 MSPR 187, 192 (1999) (appellant, who was represented, did not allege any specific example of a problem he had understanding English at hearing or how any misunderstanding affected his ability to present evidence or argument). The Federal Circuit determined that the Board correctly denied an interpreter to an appellant who appeared to be proficient in English, <span class="Italic">Rivera v. SSA</span>, 692 Fed. Appx. 634, 636 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concluded that Mr. Rivera's removal satisfied the requirements of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause because the lack of an interpreter did not hamper his ability to respond to the proposed removal. Substantial evidence supports this finding because his position as a Translator required him to possess "knowledge of both English and Spanish at the level of a native-born speaker." Likewise, there is additional evidence that Mr. Rivera was proficient in English. For example, he did not request an interpreter during his proposed removal proceedings, but managed to respond to the charges and to correspond with the deciding official in coherent English. Because substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Mr. Rivera was capable of comprehending and responding to the evidence forming the basis of his removal, we affirm the Board's conclusion that the removal did not violate his Due Process rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rivera also contends that the Administrative Judge abused her discretion when she denied his request for an interpreter to aid him during his appeal. He claims that Executive Order No. 13166, titled "Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency (LEP)," entitles him to an interpreter. 65 Fed. Reg. 50,121, 50,121 (Aug. 11, 2000). Executive Order No. 13166 does not provide criteria to determine who qualifies as a person with limited English proficiency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Instead, Mr. Rivera and the Board both relied on the definition found on LEP.gov, which provides that LEP individuals are those who "do not speak English as their primary language and who have a limited ability to read, speak, or understand English." <a href="https://www.lep.gov/faqs/faqs.html">https://www.lep.gov/faqs/faqs.html</a> (last visited June 23, 2017).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 4 MSPR 70, 74, 4 MSPB 159 (1980), determined that if an appellant is under some type of mental disability during the adverse action appeal, it is the responsibility of the appellant or the representative to call that condition to the AJ's attention and to obtain a hearing continuance. But when an appellant demonstrated to a court that he may have been mentally impaired and unable to conduct his case before the Board, the court disregarded the Board's conclusion that the appellant had not provided sufficient documentation of the impairment and remanded the appeal to the Board for development of evidence of impairment and another decision on the merits. <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 776 F.2d 1063 (Fed. Cir. 1985). On remand, the Board decided the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conclusion that the appellant was incapable of presenting his appeal. <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 424, 425 (1986). [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-124.html#sec5-123">Issue of Mental Competence During Appeal Adjudication</a>," for decisions discussing the obligation of judges to ensure development of the record, particularly in cases involving mental disability of the appellant.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board provided guidance concerning the needs of disabled appellants in <span class="Italic">Stein-Verbit v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 72 MSPR 332, 343-44 (1996). The appellant sought to submit taped rather than written pleadings, a process the Board seemed willing to accept with more definite proof of the appellant's disability:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant states that she needs accommodation for her unspecified disability, referring to attachment 4 of her petition for appeal. The documents contained in attachment 4 describe an unspecified <span id="Page_1384"></span>neurological condition affecting the left side of the appellant's body. The most recent of these documents is dated in 1991. None of them state that the appellant's 1991 condition was chronic or permanent, they do not indicate any limitation on her ability to prepare written documents, and they do not describe the appellant's medical condition as it stands today. Consistent with the administrative judge's findings, the appellant has not provided current medical documentation showing what her disability is or how it affects her ability to follow customary Board procedures. Nevertheless, the appellant need not make the rigorous showing required to prove disability discrimination to obtain accommodation for Board proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is apparent from the record that the appellant has mobility problems and, as of 1993, required a scooter to get around the agency. The record does not reflect whether the appellant still uses a scooter, but the appellant has alleged that she requires transportation assistance from Metro Access. If the appellant needs reasonable assistance gaining physical access to Board facilities, she must describe what assistance she needs and the regional office will provide her that assistance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the appellant asks to submit audiotaped pleadings in lieu of written pleadings, we note that she has not explained why she is unable to submit written pleadings. In any event, the appellant conceded below that, despite the absence of any medical evidence justifying the requested accommodation, the administrative judge partially granted her request for accommodation by permitting the appellant to submit taped pleadings, subject to objection by the agency. She asserted, however, that this was unacceptable to her, although she did not explain why it was unacceptable. The appellant also asserts that she asked the administrative judge what she must do to show that she has a disability and requires accommodation, but the administrative judge has not responded to her questions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge's resolution of this issue was reasonable and within her discretion. The appellant may, if she desires, submit her pleadings in taped format and, if the agency objects, the administrative judge shall rule on the agency's objections at that time. If this accommodation is insufficient, the appellant must explain in detail why it is insufficient. This explanation must include a specific statement identifying her disability and detailing how it prevents her from submitting written pleadings. If the administrative judge deems the appellant's statement insufficient, she shall explain why it is insufficient and what the appellant must do to perfect the statement and afford the appellant the opportunity to perfect the statement. We encourage the administrative judge to make every effort to resolve the appellant's reasonable questions in this regard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Koch v. SEC,</span> DC-0752-10-0413-I-1 (NP 11/14/2011), determined that the request for a dismissal without prejudice to refile an appeal of a disabled employee would be addressed under the Board's abuse of discretion review rather than under the Board's regulations, 5 CFR Part 1207 (2022), "Enforcement of Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Programs or Activities Conducted by the Merit Systems Protection Board":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts in his petition for review that the administrative judge violated 5 C.F.R. part 1207 in declining to dismiss his appeal without prejudice to automatic refiling on September 14, 2010. He contends that she applied the wrong regulatory definition of "qualified individual with a disability" under 5 C.F.R. part 1207. He further contends that his requested accommodation under 5 C.F.R. part 1207--the dismissal without prejudice--is not an undue burden because the Board frequently grants such requests, particularly in cases where the appellant suffers from medical issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not provided a basis for the Board to consider his challenge to the administrative judge's ruling as a violation of 5 C.F.R. part 1207. Part 1207 is entitled "Enforcement of Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Programs or Activities Conducted by the Merit Systems Protection Board." A review of its provisions reveals that it is concerned with making the Board's proceedings accessible to disabled individuals. It does not provide an independent basis for contesting an administrative judge's case-related rulings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Vice Chairman Wagner concurred with the result, but not with the analysis of the <span class="Italic">Koch</span> majority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I disagree...with the majority's view that 5 C.F.R. part 1207 does not provide an independent basis for contesting an administrative judge's case-related rulings. The express purpose of the regulations set forth therein is to effectuate the statutory prohibition against discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities conducted by the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1207.101. There is no doubt that the adjudication of cases constitutes a program or activity of the Board such as to bring it within the ambit of part 1207. In fact, the regulations expressly provide that a party may file a pleading alleging discrimination on the basis of disability "in the adjudication of a case," and they further establish procedures for addressing such allegations, including requiring that the "judge to whom the case is assigned...decide the merits of any timely allegation..., and shall make findings and conclusions regarding the allegation either in an interim order or in the initial decision...." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1207.170(b). The appellant's challenge to the denial of his requests for dismissal without prejudice falls squarely under this provision and our consideration of his complaint of disability discrimination serves the broad purpose of part 1207. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1207.101.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant correctly observes that the administrative judge erred in her analysis of his complaint. The administrative judge found that the appellant, while disabled, was not a "qualified person with a disability," because the modification he requested, i.e., his request for dismissal without prejudice to accommodate his medical condition, "would result in a fundamental alteration of the appeals process." In making that finding, the administrative judge erroneously applied 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1207.103(i), which defines the term "qualified individual with a disability" only with respect to programs or activities under which a person is required to perform services or achieve a level of accomplishment. With respect to any other program or activity, such as the adjudication of a Board appeal, the term "qualified individual with a disability" is defined as "an individual with a disability who meets the essential requirements for participation in, or receipt of benefits from, that program or activity." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1207.103(ii). Because the appellant is disabled and is entitled to appeal his removal to the Board, he is a qualified individual with a disability for purposes of 5 C.F.R. part 1207, and therefore may not on account of his disability "be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity" conducted by the Board, including the appeals process. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1207.120(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant suffers a disability that is not known to the AJ, the appellant needs to let the AJ know what accommodation in the hearing process is required, <span class="Italic">Durham v. CFTC,</span> DC-1221-08-0791-W-2 (NP 12/17/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In particular, we have considered the appellant's arguments regarding the administrative judge's administration of the hearing. First, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in not providing her with "reasonable accommodation during the hearing." The appellant, however, fails to assert that she requested specific accommodations before or during the hearing, that any specific accommodation would have aided her case presentation, or that she was prejudiced by the lack of any specific accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Colleran v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-09-0285-B-1 (NP 9/24/2010), considered to be unavailing the appellant's protest on PFR that he could not effectively participate in his hearing because of symptoms of panic and anxiety:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant alleges that at the hearing, "it was like being in a daze, I was having anxiety/panic symptoms from this and don't recall and didn't comprehend many things that the AJ had said as well as the attorney's questions." However, at no time during the hearing did the appellant or his representative assert that the appellant could not proceed with the hearing or that he could not competently present his case based upon his anxiety and panic symptoms. Although it is clear that the appellant was audibly uncomfortable and nervous, and had difficulty completing sentences and comprehending questions, his representative, the agency's representative, and the administrative judge all repeated questions and broke down questions and concepts to help him. Therefore, the appellant has not shown that his medical condition posed an impediment at the hearing that deprived him of his right to a fair hearing.</p>
