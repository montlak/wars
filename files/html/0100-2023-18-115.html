<p class="Body-Text">Assume there are no inappropriate communications during the adverse action process. Also assume that the appellant's offense is well known and that before the completion of the reply process, the officials in a position to take action are known to favor adverse action. Is their predisposition reversible error? Although the Board recognizes that due process would be violated if an individual's basic rights were determined either by a biased decisionmaker or by a decisionmaker in a situation structured so that risk of unfairness is intolerably high, <span class="Italic">Salyers v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 19 MSPR 628, 629 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Svejda v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 7 MSPR 108, 7 MSPB 36, 37 (1981), <span class="Italic">post</span>), the Board allows deciding officials to be familiar with the facts of the case and to express a predisposition contrary to the appellant's interests. <span class="Italic">See Talton v. VA</span>, AT-0707-15-0094-J-1 (NP 2/10/2023) ("a deciding official's familiarity with the facts of a case and even an expressed predisposition contrary to the appellant's interests do not constitute a due process violation or harmful error. <span class="Italic">Martinez</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 37, &#x00B6; 11.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-18-082.html#sec11-83">Oral and Written Replies</a>," for decisions evaluating impermissible bias of deciding officials.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The word "intend" in a removal proposal does not show a predisposition of the agency to ignore any reply and disregard an appellant's adverse action rights. <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 72, 80 (1983). The law on the permissible first-hand involvement in, or knowledge of the circumstances leading to an adverse action proposal was summarized by <span class="Italic">Jennings v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-12-0283-I-1 (NP 11/21/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that it would be a violation of due process to allow <span id="Page_3295"></span>an individual's basic rights to be determined either by a biased decision maker or by a decision maker in a situation structured in a manner such that the risk of unfairness is intolerably high. <span class="Italic">See Svejda v. Department of the Interior</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 108 (1981). However, in <span class="Italic">Svejda</span>, the Board found that there is no general proscription of appointing a deciding official who is familiar with the facts of the case and who has expressed a predisposition contrary to the appellant's interests. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 111; <span class="Italic">see Baldwin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 383, 387 (1985) (the fact that the deciding official was somewhat familiar with the facts concerning the case and had concurred with proposing the removal did not proscribe his appointment as the deciding official); <span class="Italic">Beatty v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 436, 438 (1984) (there was no due process violation or harmful error committed where the deciding official was fully apprised of, and had concurred in, the desirability of demoting the appellant before considering his response to the proposal notice), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 765 F.2d 162 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with the Board's guidance in the cases cited above, the administrative judge found that the deciding official's first-hand knowledge of facts regarding the July 1, 2011 incident that gave rise to the charges against the appellant did not risk intolerably high unfairness to the appellant and therefore violate his due process rights. Further, the administrative judge properly found that the deciding official's presence at the threat assessment team meeting for the purpose of presenting what information he had to the team members also did not make the risk of unfairness intolerably high. The mere fact that the deciding official was fully apprised of, and had concurred in, the desirability of taking an adverse action before considering the appellant's response to the proposal notice was an insufficient basis on which to find a due process violation or harmful error. <span class="Italic">See Baldwin</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. at 387; <span class="Italic">Beatty</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. at 438.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency's offer, pursuant to the provisions of a negotiated agreement, to allow an employee the opportunity to resign or retire in lieu of receiving a removal proposal does not constitute a predetermination that the appellant will be removed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McBriarty v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Brenner also argues that the MSPB erred in rejecting his defense that Mr. Hipolit should have recused himself as the deciding official, given his prior knowledge and involvement in Mr. Brenner's case as a VA official. However, "[t]here is nothing inherently wrong with a deciding official's having background knowledge of an employee's prior work history or performance record" and "[n]othing in the [Act] limits the deciding official to being a neutral arbiter or requires that the deciding official be unfamiliar with the individual, the facts of the case, or the employee's prior conduct." <span class="Italic">Norris v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board recently reiterated a long-standing proposition that it would be a violation of due process "to allow an individual's basic rights to be determined either by a biased decisionmaker or by a decisionmaker in a situation structured in a manner such that [the] 'risk of unfairness is [i]ntolerably high.'" <span class="Italic">Martinez v.

We find no such intolerably high risk of unfairness here. Indeed, the fact that the deciding official was the Postmaster for the region, who was aware of recent instances of delayed mail issues in the appellant's facility and who had made decisions in the appellant's prior disciplinary matters, does not automatically disqualify him from being the deciding official in this matter. <span class="Italic">See Baldwin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 383, 387 (1985) (the fact that [the deciding official] was somewhat familiar with the facts concerning the appellant's case and had concurred with proposing the removal action does not proscribe his appointment as the deciding official); <span class="Italic">Svejda</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. at 111-12 (finding that even when a prior decision is reversed on procedural grounds, the deciding official in the earlier matter is not barred "simply for that reason" from performing the same function when the removal proceedings are reinstituted). Because we do not find any evidence to show that the deciding official acted improperly in his decision in this matter, the administrative judge correctly determined that the appellant did not prove her claim of a due process violation in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we alternatively considered the appellant's allegation of a due process violation as a claim of harmful procedural error, <span class="Italic">see Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1281 (Fed. Cir. 2011), the appellant fares no better. Harmful error under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) cannot be presumed; an agency error is harmful only where the record shows that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991).

<p class="Body-Text">The same result was reached in an unacceptable performance action. <span class="Italic">Beatty v. DHUD</span>, 20 MSPR 436, 438 (1984). A deciding official who stated, after reviewing an IG report, that he "pretty much knew" that such a serious offense would warrant appellant's removal was not unduly biased. At issue was whether the reply was given meaningful consideration, a factor established through testimony stating that it was given consideration and that consideration was given to lesser penalties than that proposed. <span class="Italic">Facciponti v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 18, 2009, the agency's Office of Inspector General (OIG) released an administrative investigation report entitled "Misuse of Position, Abuse of Authority, and Prohibited Personnel Practices Office of Information &#x0026; Technology." In the report, the OIG found that the appellant misused her position, abused her authority, engaged in prohibited personnel practices, failed to provide proper contract oversight, and did not properly fulfill her duties as a Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. The agency subsequently proposed the appellant's removal from her Senior Executive Service position of Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information Protection and Risk Management in the Office of Information and Technology (OIT) based on five charges: (1) misuse of her official position for the personal gain of a friend; (2) engaging in a prohibited personnel practice; (3) inadequate contract oversight; (4) inappropriate use of a contractor; and (5) inappropriate sharing of nonpublic contracting information. The notice of proposed removal identified Roger Baker, the Assistant Secretary for OIT, as the deciding official. The appellant presented oral and written replies to Mr. Baker regarding the five charges. Mr. Baker issued a decision sustaining all five charges (but only two of the three specifications of charge 1) against the appellant and directed that her removal was to be effective on February 5, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant timely refiled an appeal of her removal after the agency issued a final decision on her formal equal employment opportunity complaint. In a January 31, 2011 order, the administrative judge advised the parties that she had identified a possible due process violation. Specifically, she was concerned about whether the appellant received a meaningful opportunity to respond to the proposed action because Mr. Baker, the deciding official, concurred in the OIG draft investigative report, which formed the basis of the charges in the matter. The administrative judge provided the parties an opportunity to identify any material issue of fact in dispute with regard to the identified due process issue and to explain why a limited hearing was necessary in order to resolve such a factual dispute. The parties filed briefs in response to the administrative judge's order. The administrative judge cancelled the requested hearing after she notified the parties that she was reversing the agency's action based on finding that a due process violation occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge concluded in her initial decision that, prior to undertaking the role of decision maker in the appellant's removal, Mr. Baker "painstakingly reviewed evidence...and issued findings that he concurred in the various violations [identified by the agency's OIG in its draft investigative report]." Mr. Baker then acted as the deciding official and determined that, based on misconduct identified in the OIG's final report, removal was appropriate. For these reasons, the administrative judge found that the risk was too high that the appellant missed her "only meaningful opportunity [to] invoke the discretion of the decisionmaker" before her removal took place. ID at 14 (quoting <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 543 (1985)). The administrative judge found unavailing Mr. Baker's deposition testimony that he provided the appellant a meaningful opportunity to reply. The agency filed a petition for review, and the appellant filed a response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We grant the agency's petition for review to address the administrative judge's decision to reverse the agency's removal action based on her <span id="Page_3296"></span>finding that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights. Regarding this issue, the agency argues, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the administrative judge "misapplied and failed to consider direct and relevant [Board] precedent concerning pretermination procedural due process rights available to federal employees." Specifically, the agency argues that the administrative judge erred in her application of <span class="Italic">Svejda v. Department of the Interior</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 108 (1981), and in her failure to apply <span class="Italic">Facciponti v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 183 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Svejda</span>, the same official who had sustained an employee's unsatisfactory performance rating was later designated as the deciding official for the employee's proposed performance-based removal action. <span class="Italic">Svejda</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. at 110. The appellant claimed that his due process rights had been violated because the deciding official in the adverse action had also been the supervisor who had sustained his unsatisfactory rating. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 110-11. The Board explained that it would be a violation of due process "to allow an individual's basic rights to be determined either by a biased decisionmaker or by a decisionmaker in a situation structured in a manner such that [the] 'risk of unfairness is [i]ntolerably high.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 111 (quoting <span class="Italic">Withrow v. Larkin</span>, 421 U.S. 35, 58 (1975)). However, in <span class="Italic">Svejda</span>, the Board found the appellant's argument unpersuasive, concluding that there is no general proscription of appointing a deciding official who is familiar with the facts of the case and who has expressed a predisposition contrary to the appellant's interests. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 111; <span class="Italic">see Baldwin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 383, 387 (1985) (the fact that the deciding official was somewhat familiar with the facts concerning the case and had concurred with proposing the removal did not proscribe his appointment as the deciding official); <span class="Italic">Beatty v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 436, 438 (1984) (there was no due process violation or harmful error committed where the deciding official was fully apprised of, and had concurred in, the desirability of demoting the appellant before considering his response to the proposal notice), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 765 F.2d 162 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Svejda</span> for the proposition that an agency is not prohibited from appointing a deciding official who is familiar with the facts of the case and who has expressed a predisposition contrary to the appellant's interests. However, she found that "the deciding official [in this case] expressed a conclusion based on the evidence, not simply a predisposition." It is unclear why she found Mr. Baker's consideration of and concurrence in the findings of the OIG report constituted a "conclusion," whereas the deciding official's sustaining of an unsatisfactory performance rating in <span class="Italic">Svejda</span> was a mere "predisposition." In any event, the Board has previously concluded that the mere fact that the deciding official was fully apprised of, and had concurred in, the desirability of taking an adverse action before considering the appellant's response to the proposal notice was an insufficient basis on which to find a due process violation or harmful error in the absence of specific allegations indicating that the agency's choice of the deciding official made the risk of unfairness to the appellant "intolerably high." <span class="Italic">Beatty</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. at 438; <span class="Italic">see Baldwin</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. at 387.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also contends that the administrative judge failed to discuss <span class="Italic">Facciponti</span>, which it cited in its due process brief. In <span class="Italic">Facciponti</span>, the agency removed an employee for misconduct following an agency investigation. <span class="Italic">Facciponti</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. at 184. The deciding official testified that he saw the agency inspector's report concerning the misconduct long before the agency issued the proposal notice and that "he pretty much knew" that such a serious offense would warrant the appellant's removal from the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 185. The Board determined that the appellant had been afforded an opportunity to respond to the charges cited against him in the notice of proposed removal and, in fact, had responded both orally and in writing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board also credited the deciding official's testimony that he had considered the appellant's responses, as well as the appropriateness of lesser penalties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 185-86. Therefore, the Board found that the agency did not commit harmful error in removing the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 186. In subsequent similar cases, the Board concluded that the fact that the deciding official may have been predisposed to severely discipline an employee before receiving his response to the notice of proposed adverse action did not constitute harmful procedural error <span class="Italic">or a violation of law</span> if the appellant was afforded an opportunity to reply to the charges against him and, in fact, did submit a response that was considered by the deciding official before he made a final decision. <span class="Italic">Deskin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 505, 517-18 (1997); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 350, 353 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this matter, similarly, Mr. Baker saw an investigative report, the agency provided the appellant with notice of the charges, and the appellant responded both orally and in writing. Although the agency's deciding official in <span class="Italic">Facciponti</span> did not express his concurrence with the inspector's report, as Mr. Baker did here, he did testify that he was predisposed to remove the appellant. <span class="Italic">Facciponti</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. at 185. Because of the similarities between <span class="Italic">Facciponti</span> and this case, the agency correctly asserts that the administrative judge should have considered <span class="Italic">Facciponti</span> and addressed its relevance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the agency cites <span class="Italic">Withrow</span>, 421 U.S. at 58, in support of its position that there is a "strong presumption that agency deciding officials will discharge their duties in an unbiased manner." In <span class="Italic">Withrow</span>, the Supreme Court concluded that it was within the bounds of due process for a state medical examining board to perform both the investigative and adjudicatory functions in a physician licensing matter. 421 U.S. at 47-58. In doing so, the Court found that there is a presumption of honesty and integrity for those serving as administrative adjudicators. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 47. <span class="Italic">Withrow</span> does not address whether it is permissible for an agency deciding official to have previously been involved in the investigation leading to the adverse action in question. However, the Board has cited <span class="Italic">Withrow</span> for the proposition that due process is violated when an individual's basic rights are determined either by a biased decision maker or by a decision maker in a situation structured in a manner such that the "risk of unfairness is intolerably high." <span class="Italic">Svejda</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. at 111. The burden is on the appellant to establish actual bias or an intolerable risk of unfairness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At this stage, there has been no such showing. As explained above, a deciding official's familiarity with the facts of the case and expressed predisposition contrary to the appellant's interests does not constitute a due process violation or harmful error. <span class="Italic">Deskin</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 517-18; <span class="Italic">Baldwin</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. at 387; <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. at 353; <span class="Italic">Facciponti</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. at 185-86; <span class="Italic">Svejda</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. at 111; <span class="Italic">see McGhee v. Johnson</span>, 420 F.2d 445, 448 (10th Cir. 1969) (the fact that the same official decided an employee's removal in an earlier, procedurally flawed removal action did not invalidate the official's second determination to remove the employee). This is so even if the deciding official had gone so far as to concur previously in the desirability of taking the adverse action against the employee. <span class="Italic">Baldwin</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. at 387; <span class="Italic">Beatty</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. at 438. Furthermore, both the Board and our reviewing court have found that it is permissible for an individual to be both the proposing and deciding official in an action. <span class="Italic">E.g</span>., <span class="Italic">DeSarno v. Department of Commerce</span>, 761 F.2d 657, 660 (Fed.

Department of the Army</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 447, 449-52 (1987) (a deciding official's initial predisposition to decide against an employee is insufficient to vitiate the agency proceeding when the deciding official is willing to change his mind and fully considers all evidence of record, including the appellant's oral and written replies, before reaching his decision), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 854 F.2d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the administrative judge acknowledged the precedent allowing for the proposing and deciding official to be the same person, she dismissed the precedent as "not determinative" in this case. It does not appear that the administrative judge properly considered and applied the relevant precedent in this matter. Moreover, she did not hold a hearing and weigh the evidence in order to determine whether the appellant established actual bias or an intolerable risk of unfairness. Rather, the administrative judge seems to have assumed that Mr. Baker's views must have been impermissibly tainted in the course of reviewing and concurring in the draft OIG report. ID at 13-14 (noting that because Mr. Baker "painstakingly reviewed evidence...and then issued findings that he concurred in the various violations, the risk of unfairness [wa]s dangerously high and [wa]s contrary to the dictates of even the minimum of due process"). Because the administrative judge failed to hold a hearing, she was unable to consider all of the relevant evidence, especially any testimony Mr. Baker might provide. Accordingly, we find that remand is appropriate to allow the administrative judge to consider all of the relevant evidence and apply the relevant case law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That the deciding official had a role in deciding whether the appellant was AWOL did not bar that official from making the decision on the proposal to remove the employee for AWOL, <span class="Italic">Nunnery v. USDA</span>, DA-0752-15-0378-I-1 (NP 6/9/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant contends that the agency's choice of deciding official violated her due process rights because "the deciding official made the decision to have [her] issued AWOL; she should therefore not [have] been the Deciding Official...for the same AWOL that she instructed the supervisor to issue." The administrative judge did not address this argument in the initial decision, and therefore, we modify the initial decision to address the argument in the first instance on review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the hearing, the deciding official testified that, pursuant to agency policy, she was the approving official for any AWOL or leave without pay (LWOP) requests for employees in the agency's Financial Management Service Division. The deciding official explained that each pay period, after the appellant completed and submitted her timesheet, if the timesheet indicated that the appellant was absent without approved leave, she would consult with the appellant's supervisor to determine whether the absences should be designated as AWOL or LWOP. She further testified that if the appellant's supervisor reported that the appellant had called in, spoken to her, and explained that she was not coming to work, she granted the appellant LWOP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3297"></span>A deciding official's awareness of background information concerning the appellant, her concurrence in the desirably to take an adverse action, or her predisposition to impose a severe penalty do not disqualify her from serving as a deciding official on due process grounds. <span class="Italic">Lange v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as discussed previously, the deciding official's unrebutted testimony established that, in reaching her decision to remove the appellant, she did not consider any information besides the contents of the notice of proposed removal, the appellant's written response, and the appellant's prior discipline. Accordingly, the fact that the deciding official had prior knowledge of the appellant's absences, and designated those absences as AWOL or LWOP based on representations of the appellant's supervisor, fails to establish a violation of the appellant's due process rights. <span class="Italic">See Lange</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6; 11 (finding that a deciding official's involvement in an appellant's pre-removal Office of Professional Responsibility investigation did not violate the appellant's due process rights where the deciding official did not consider this involvement in his decision on the appellant's removal).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">To support his claim of bias, the appellant argues that it was patently unfair to use as the deciding official the same individual who granted permission to the Acting Director of Lifting and Handling to test the appellant. However, we disagree that this involvement presents an intolerably high risk of unfairness to the appellant sufficient to support a finding of a due process violation.[7] <span class="Italic">See Lange</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6; 10 (finding that a deciding official's knowledge of and involvement in the investigation that led to the appellant's removal did not violate due process). Other than rearguing that he should not have been selected for testing, which we already have addressed above, the appellant does not substantiate his claim that the deciding official "was unwilling to change his mind and fully consider all evidence of record." Therefore, we decline to find any due process violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The appellant does not argue that the agency's selection of a deciding official was harmful error.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee also has a due process right to have an unbiased decision maker adjudicate his case. <span class="Italic">Martinez v.

In <span class="Italic">Martinez</span>, the Board reaffirmed that an employee must assert "specific allegations indicating that the agency's choice of the deciding official made the risk of unfairness to the appellant 'intolerably high'" in order to establish a due process violation based upon the identity of a deciding official. 119 M.S.P.R. 37, &#x00B6; 7. As explained in <span class="Italic">Martinez</span>, a deciding official's awareness of background information concerning the appellant, his concurrence in the desirably to take an adverse action, or his predisposition to impose a severe penalty does not disqualify him from serving as a deciding official on due process grounds. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8. In <span class="Italic">Norris</span>, moreover, our reviewing court recently held that a deciding official's mere knowledge of an employee's background does not rise to the level of a due process violation unless "that knowledge is a basis for the deciding official's determination on either the merits of the underlying charge or the penalty to be imposed." 675 F.3d at 1354; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. ("Nothing in the regulations...requires that the deciding official be unfamiliar with the individual, the facts of the case, or the employee's prior conduct.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Norris</span> and <span class="Italic">Martinez</span>, the deciding official's knowledge and involvement in the appellant's pre-removal OPR investigation did not violate the appellant's due process rights. In support of her finding of a due process violation, the administrative judge relied upon three specific facets of the deciding official's knowledge and involvement in the OPR investigation: that he briefed a member of the agency's inspector general's office about the investigation in November of 2008 and added the appellant's supervisor as a subject of an OPR investigation; that he was assigned the initial responsibility to screen additional allegations of the appellant's misconduct not included in the proposed adverse action; and that he received a memorandum regarding OPR's final report into the appellant's conduct. None of these instances of involvement, however, were relied upon by the deciding official in considering the appellant's case, and together, they fail to illustrate an "intolerably high" risk of unfairness to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Martinez</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 37, &#x00B6; 7 (rejecting that a deciding official's prior "consideration of and concurrence in the findings" of an OIG report violated the appellant's right to due process). Rather, a deciding official only violates due process when he relies upon his personal knowledge of an employee's background, without notice to the employee, as "a basis for [his] determinations on either the merits of the underlying charge or the penalty to be imposed." <span class="Italic">Norris</span>, 675 F.3d at 1354; <span class="Italic">see also Martinez</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 37, &#x00B6; 11 (a deciding official's "familiarity with the facts of the case and expressed predisposition contrary to the appellant's interests does not constitute a due process violation or harmful error").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In opposition to the agency's petition for review, the appellant advances that the administrative judge found a due process violation "due to the failure of the agency to inform or notice" the appellant about the deciding official's prior involvement in the appellant's OPR investigation. This argument does not change our analysis. Under the <span class="Italic">Ward/Stone</span> line of authority, an agency need only inform an employee of a deciding official's knowledge or awareness of new and material information "personally known <span class="Italic">and considered</span> by the deciding official" in reaching his decision. <span class="Italic">Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 10 (2011) (emphasis added). In this case, where there is no evidence that the deciding official relied upon his past involvement in or knowledge of the appellant's OPR investigation when considering the appellant's proposed removal, there is no due process need to publish the deciding official's prior supervisory role over OPR to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11. Similarly, because the deciding official did not consider or rely upon documentation in his role as the deciding official to which he was only privy while overseeing OPR, there is no due process violation based upon the agency's failure to provide notice or produce such documentation to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Norris</span>, 675 F.3d at 1353-54 ("[A] deciding official's mere knowledge of prior misconduct by the employee obtained before the commencement of disciplinary proceedings does not constitute an improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon <span class="Italic">Norris</span> and <span class="Italic">Martinez</span>, which were both decided after the administrative judge issued her initial decision in this case, the initial decision's due process finding must be reversed.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, the Federal Circuit held that if a deciding official's consideration of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information does not violate due process, the Board should then analyze whether his consideration of such information constitutes harmful procedural error. 634 F.3d at 1281 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(f)). On remand, the administrative judge does not have to adjudicate a harmful procedural error defense because the appellant has not shown that the deciding official relied upon his personal knowledge of the appellant's OPR investigation in rendering his decision. The administrative judge, moreover, foreclosed the consideration of a harmful procedural error affirmative defense based upon the selection of the deciding official because the appellant was unable to specify "any agency rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement that was violated." The appellant has not challenged this ruling through a cross-petition for review.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Because there is nothing improper about an agency's predetermination to remove an employee if the charges against him are proved, the employee must demonstrate that the agency would have been impervious if the proof failed to show that the facts were as charged. <span class="Italic">Schapansky v.

The Board sustained removal of an employee whose supervisor, serving as both proposing and deciding official, encouraged a complaining witness to file charges against the employee and suggested in various ways that he thought the employee was guilty before the investigation was completed. However, the supervisor had what he (and the Board) considered to be a solid basis for removal of the employee.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We must then view appellant's due process contention in two possible lights. For if appellant has established either actual bias on the part of the decisionmaker, Mr. Fish, or has established that the situation created by the agency by its nature established an intolerably high risk of unfairness, then appellant's procedural due process rights have been violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to specific bias, appellant contends that Mr. Fish as the agency's deciding official considered appellant's performance on a feasibility study in reaching his decision on the removal action even though it was not a part of the proposal notice and was found acceptable by the <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> committee. While the record reflects, as appellant asserts, that the deciding official disagreed with the conclusion of the committee in that respect, the Board finds this insufficient evidence of bias in light of the lack of evidence to indicate that performance on this study formed a part of the reason for removal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the possibility of bias inherent in the agency's designation of an individual who had reviewed appellant's performance and found it <span id="Page_3299"></span>wanting as the deciding official in the subsequent removal action, the Board finds that there is no general proscription of the appointment as a deciding official of a person who is familiar with the facts of the case and has expressed a predisposition contrary to the appellant's interests. <span class="Italic">Keeney v. United States</span>, 150 Ct. Cl, 53 (1960).

McGhee v. Johnson,</span> 420 F.2d 445 (10th Cir. 1969).
