<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-8"><span id="Page_1209"></span><span class="space">b.</span> Failure to Request Bargaining; Form and Timing of Request; Inaction</h5>
<p class="noindent">As a general rule, an agency or activity is free to make changes in conditions of employment not covered in a collective bargaining agreement following timely notice of the proposed change to the union and provided there is no timely bargaining request by the union. The same rule, however, is not applicable to those conditions of employment embodied in a negotiated agreement. To hold otherwise would destroy the integrity of the agreement and disrupt the labor harmony the agreement was designed to foster. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 7 FLRA 688, 696 (1982) (ALJ Decision) (ULP through unilateral change in dues revocation procedures because of agency's unfounded belief that change had been agreed to by union). According to <span class="Italic">PBGC and NAGE Local R3-77</span>, 59 FLRA 48, 50-51 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an agency has an obligation to bargain, then it can satisfy that obligation by reaching agreement with the union, or bargaining in good faith to impasse over negotiable proposals submitted by the union. This obligation to bargain is predicated on the union's submission of negotiable proposals. An agency may refuse to bargain where it contends that the proposals submitted by the union are nonnegotiable<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of HUD</span>, 58 FLRA 33 (2002) (HUD). However, the agency acts at its peril if it then implements the proposed change in conditions of employment<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of HHS, SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 39 FLRA 258, 262-63 (1991). If <span class="Italic">all </span>pending union proposals are nonnegotiable, then the agency will not be found to have violated the Statute by implementing the change without bargaining over them. However, if <span class="Italic">any </span>pending union proposals are negotiable, then the agency will be found to have violated the Statute by implementing the change without satisfying its obligation to bargain over the negotiable proposals and either reaching agreement or declaring impasse<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Bastrop, Tex.</span>, 55 FLRA 848, 852 (1999) <span class="Italic">(FCI Bastrop</span>) (then-Chair Segal concurring on other grounds). In a ULP case, the respondent has the burden of demonstrating that all proposals on the table were nonnegotiable; the GC does not have the burden to establish their negotiability<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States DOJ, INS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 56 FLRA 351, 356 (2000) (then-Member Cabaniss dissenting on other grounds).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, in determining whether an agency committed an unfair labor practice by failing to bargain when making a change in conditions of employment, the first inquiry is whether the agency had an obligation to bargain at all under the circumstances. If it did, then the next inquiry--whether the agency satisfied its bargaining obligation--may focus on the negotiability of the union's proposals and the agency's response to those proposals.</p>
<p class="noindent">The determination of whether bargaining was requested will be determined realistically, with consideration of the circumstances involved in the proposed change in conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">DOD, DCA, Peterson AFB and AFGE Local 1867,</span> 61 FLRA 688, 693-94 (2006), provided the analysis when a bargaining request was made several times over the course of discussions involving a likely reduction in force:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's exceptions call into question whether the Union was obligated to submit proposals within a certain time frame prior to implementation. The Respondent cites several decisions to support its contention that the Union's failure to submit proposals constitutes a waiver of bargaining. Exceptions at 2, 11-15<span class="Italic"> (citing PBGC</span>, 59 FLRA 48; <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 24 FLRA 786 (1986); <span class="Italic">DMNA</span>, 8 FLRA 307 (1982); <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 2 FLRA 333 (1979)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, adequate notice of a proposed change in conditions of employment triggers the exclusive representative's responsibility to request bargaining over the change. <span class="Italic">See United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kan</span>., 55 FLRA 704, 715 (1999) (<span class="Italic">USP, Leavenworth</span>). Failure to take such action may result in a finding that the union has waived its bargaining rights. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C.</span>, 44 FLRA 575, 582-83 (1992). For the reasons that follow, we find that the decisions relied on by the Respondent are distinguishable, that the Union did not waive its right to bargain, and that the Union was denied the opportunity to engage in impact and implementation bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">PBGC</span>, the Authority stated that the "obligation to bargain is predicated on the union's submission of negotiable proposals[,]" and that "[i]f <span class="Italic">all</span> pending union proposals are nonnegotiable, then the agency will not be found to have violated the Statute[.]" <span class="Italic">PBGC</span>, 59 FLRA at 50 (emphasis in original). The Authority did not hold, however, that a union must submit proposals as part of a bargaining request. As the Authority has consistently held, a union may request bargaining, request additional information, or request additional time. <span class="Italic">See USP, Leavenworth</span>, 55 FLRA at 715<span class="Italic"> (citing Materiel Command, </span>51 FLRA at 1535).[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Authority has determined that "parties may define limits on rights, including bargaining rights under the Statute." <span class="Italic">Materiel Command</span>, 51 FLRA at 1536 (<span class="Italic">citing FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, Seattle, Wa.</span>, 14 FLRA 644 (1984)). In this respect, the parties in <span class="Italic">Materiel Command</span> by contract agreed that "the Union will submit written proposals to the Labor Relations Office not later than 15 workdays after receipt of employer's notification." <span class="Italic">Materiel Command</span>, <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1533 n.1 <span class="Italic">(citing</span> Article 33, Section 33.02(b)) of the parties' agreement. Accordingly, to the extent we stated in <span class="Italic">Materiel Command</span> that "[t]he Authority has long held that once adequate notice is given, the union must act to submit proposals, request additional information, or request additional time" we clarify that requirement applies only when parties have agreed to it. In the absence of such agreement, a union must merely request to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">INS,</span> after reaching impasse during negotiations, the agency notified the union that it "would implement its proposed procedures...in two weeks, and invited bargaining during that two-week period." <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 24 FLRA at 788. The union in that case failed to submit proposals, and there is no evidence in the record that it requested additional information or requested additional time. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 788, 790. Accordingly, this decision is also distinguishable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">DMNA, </span>the Authority determined that the union could not properly require the agency to submit proposals prior to bargaining. As the Authority determined, the union's actions were, "tantamount to a refusal to bargain concerning impact and implementation." <span class="Italic">DMNA</span>, 8 FLRA at 320. Nothing in <span class="Italic">DMNA</span> establishes that a union waives its right to bargain by failing to submit proposals; the decision establishes only that a union cannot require an agency to submit proposals over a proposed agency implemented change as a condition of bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union reiterated its prior request to bargain after receiving the Respondent's June, 2002 RIF notice. In response to this request the Agency did not bargain and instead informed the Respondent that the issue was non-negotiable. Moreover, after issuing RIF notices in October of 2002, and after receiving yet another request to bargain, the Agency did not do so. Therefore, because the Union had an outstanding request to bargain prior to the October 15, 2002, notification and another request to bargain prior to implementation in January of 2003, the Respondent had a duty to bargain over the impact and implementation of this RIF prior to issuing RIF notices or implementing the RIF in January of 2003. As the Union was denied the opportunity to engage in impact and implementation bargaining, the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Admin. Medical Ctr., Memphis, Tenn.</span>, 42 FLRA 712, 713 (1991). As such, we deny the Respondent's exceptions to the Judge's decision finding that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">If it is possible that bargaining might occur as to either the substance or impact of a change, the union need not label its proposals in a particular way to preserve its right to bargain<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson and AFGE Local 2924</span>, 42 FLRA 1267, 1267 (1991). But somehow the union must respond, without regard to the labels attached to the response. If a union is provided notice of a change in working conditions and fails directly to request bargaining, replying only that it has not received proper notice under its agreement, the union may have waived its opportunity to bargain. <span class="Italic">SBA and AFGE Local 1099</span>, 15 FLRA 522, 524 (1984). The union must make its desires known to management. Knowledge of a union's proposals is not a sufficient basis to find a violation of the duty to bargain. There must be a clearly communicated request to bargain and a refusal to do so. Submission of proposals to FSIP does not constitute a bargaining demand to the agency. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Council 214</span>, 22 FLRA 15, 18 (1986). Although a union may waive its bargaining right by failing to request bargaining following adequate notice of a proposed change in conditions of employment, the union's response that the agency abide by its enforceable agreements is not inaction; it is an affirmative of an existing right. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOD, Am. Forces Radio &#x0026; Television Broadcast Ctr. and AFGE Local 2776</span>, 59 FLRA 759, 761 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">If a collective bargaining agreement contains a clause requiring the initiation of a bargaining request within a set period of time after notice from management of an intended change, the union meets its bargaining obligations, and places responsibility on management to meet its bargaining responsibilities, by initiating at least an interim proposal, e.g., maintenance of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, coupled with a request for information that may lead to subsequent proposals after the information is received and evaluated. The D.C. Circuit explained the progressive nature of bargaining in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-136 v. FLRA</span>, 363 F.3d 468, 475-77 (D.C. Cir. 2004), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 60 FLRA 446 (2004) (imposing bargaining order and <span class="Italic">status quo </span>remedy):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Authority found that the Union's August 31 proposal was timely submitted under the CBA and interpreted the proposal as a request to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> pending completion of bargaining. Although the Medical Center never bargained over the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> proposal itself, the Authority determined that the Medical Center had complied with the proposal by maintaining the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> until the CBA's 15-day deadline for submission of proposals had run. The Authority found that the Medical Center had no obligation to consider the November 17 proposals, because they were not timely submitted. The Authority's determinations rest on an implausible interpretation of the CBA. Even assuming that the Authority has the discretion to interpret a collective <span id="Page_1210"></span>bargaining agreement where necessary to resolve an unfair labor practice claim, "we conclude that it abused that discretion...by reaching a result that is illogical on its own terms." <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA,</span> 963 F.2d 429, 439 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Accordingly, we set aside the Authority's dismissal of the first complaint as arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the CBA requires the Medical Center to notify the Union of any proposed changes to a condition of employment, and provides that the Union "shall have fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of notification to request bargaining and to forward written proposals" to the Medical Center. <span class="Italic">CBA</span> at 8, J.A. 258. The CBA authorizes the agency to implement its proposed changes "[i]f the Union does not request bargaining within the time limit." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 9, J.A. 259. Furthermore, the CBA provides that "[u]pon timely request by the Union, bargaining will normally commence within ten (10) calendar days, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its August 31 submission, the Union clearly and unequivocally (1) requested to bargain over the proposed parking changes, and (2) proposed "at this time" that the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> be maintained. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 236. It is undisputed that the August 31 submission was made within 15 days of notification of the proposed parking changes. The Union therefore met the CBA's deadline for requesting negotiation and submitting a written proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the same time, the Union requested further information on the basis of which it would formulate and submit further proposals. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Union was entitled to make such a request, and neither the agency nor the Authority suggests otherwise. Subject to limited exceptions, the Statute requires the Medical Center to respond to a Union request to furnish "data...which is reasonably available and necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B); <span class="Italic">see also Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 2343 v. FLRA,</span> 144 F.3d 85, 86-87 (D.C. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Wash., D.C. v. FLRA,</span> 1 F.3d 19, 22-23 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The Medical Center does not claim--and nothing in the record indicates--that the Union's information request in the instant case was somehow improper. Indeed, the Medical Center confirmed the legitimacy of the request by responding to it, albeit over two months later. Once the Union received the information it had requested, it promptly submitted its November 17 parking proposals--approximately 15 days after receipt of the information. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 58 F.L.R.A. at 441.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the CBA insulates the Medical Center from its duty to bargain over the Union's August 31 and November 17 proposals. Article 11, Section 2B of the CBA requires that the Union <span class="Italic">initiate</span> the bargaining process by "request[ing] bargaining" and "forward[ing] written proposals" within 15 days from notification of the proposed change. This provision clearly requires the Union to submit an <span class="Italic">opening</span> proposal within 15 days, and the Union met this requirement with its August 31 submission. But Section 2B cannot reasonably be interpreted to require the Union to put <span class="Italic">all possible</span> proposals on the table within that brief period, or to foreclose negotiation of any proposal submitted thereafter. Certainly nothing in the express language of Section 2B itself requires or supports this absurd reading of the parties' agreement. Moreover, Section 2C goes on to provide that, "[i]f the Union does not request bargaining within the time limit, the Employer may implement the proposed change(s)." <span class="Italic">CBA</span> at 9, J.A. 259. The clear import of this provision is that once the Union meets its obligation to submit a timely request for bargaining, the Medical Center is foreclosed from implementing a proposed change in conditions of employment without satisfying its duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to departing from the CBA's express terms, the Authority's reading of the CBA would lead to bizarre results. It appears to lock the Union into its initial bargaining position by permitting the agency to ignore as untimely any subsequent expression amplifying, supplementing, or clarifying the initial proposal. And it would effectively prevent the Union from developing proposals based on accurate information properly and timely requested from, but not promptly delivered by, the agency. The agency would need only delay its response to the Union's request for information until the 15 day period had elapsed--as the Medical Center did in this case--in order to avoid bargaining over any proposal submitted after that time. The agency would be rewarded, under this reading, for providing insufficient information when notifying the Union of proposed changes and for tardy responses to valid information requests. This cannot be the intended meaning of Article 11 of the CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that the Union's initial proposal requested maintenance of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> "at this time" does not alter our conclusion. Even if the Authority is correct in interpreting the Union's proposal to request maintenance of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> only "until the completion of bargaining," the Medical Center did not "comply" with this proposal--much less satisfy its bargaining obligations under the CBA and the Statute--merely by delaying implementation of changes until 15 days had elapsed. The Union timely initiated the bargaining process with its August 31 submission. Because the Medical Center failed to respond, however, bargaining was never even commenced, let alone completed. The Medical Center implemented its proposed changes without ever responding to the Union's request to negotiate and without ever bargaining over the Union's August 31 or November 17 proposals. In so doing, the Medical Center violated the CBA and committed an unfair labor practice under &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) by refusing to bargain in good faith over a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although a waiver is not ordinarily construed from silence, <span class="Italic">Metropolitan Edison Co. v. NLRB</span>, 460 U.S. 693, 708-10 (1983), the right to bargain may be waived by inaction.

The focus of the decisions is on the implication of waiver in situations presenting individual opportunities for negotiation. Past decisions determined that if the union made a specific request to bargain over the impact of a change that might itself be negotiable, the union could have waived the right to bargain over the decision. The union must be reasonably specific in its bargaining requests. If management announced a change in working conditions that was not negotiable, the union essentially waived its right to impact and implementation bargaining if it demanded to negotiate over the change itself and requested no impact bargaining. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Bureau of Standards, Boulder Lab., Plant Div. 283.00 and AFGE Local 2186</span>, 5 FLRA 823, 830 (1981) (ALJ Decision).

<p class="noindent">Although earlier decisions suggested that one waiver of bargaining rights does not waive a later bargaining opportunity, the earlier bargaining opportunity, once waived, is apparently not reactivated through the passage of time or through a second and later notice that the same employment condition will be changed. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Letterkenny Army Depot and NFFE Local 1442</span>, 58 FLRA 685, 685-86 (2003), concluded, over the dissent of Member Pope (and contrary to the decision of the D.C. Circuit reversing FLRA, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1442 v. FLRA</span>, 369 F.3d 548 (2004), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...As part of the Base Realignment and Closure process, the Respondent was directed by higher authority to transfer certain buildings to a local government. One of the buildings to be transferred was where the SAS was located. Thus, in April 1997 the Respondent notified the Union that it intended to close the SAS program between September 1998 and March 1999. Rather than submit bargaining proposals within the contractually-established ten day period for doing so, the Union (and three other unions also affected by this action) requested to discuss the proposed closure through the Labor-Management Partnership Committee (LMPC). Through the LMPC, the parties engaged in discussions. While it is clear that the Respondent attempted to maintain the SAS in as viable a form as it possibly could for as long as possible, it is also clear that the Respondent remained under direction of higher authority to dispose of the building.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In June 1999 the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the Respondent, alleging that the SAS had been improperly closed at that time (which was not the case) without the Respondent having fulfilled its obligation to bargain over that matter. The Union also withdrew from the LMPC in July 1999. The unfair labor practice charge, however, was dismissed in August 1999 based upon a finding that the Union should have submitted a timely bargaining demand when it was notified in April 1997 of the SAS closure decision. The Union received notice from the Respondent in January 2001 that the SAS program would be closed in August 2001. Although the Respondent and the Union then negotiated over the matter, the Respondent stated it had erroneously engaged in the negotiations and withdrew from those negotiations. In withdrawing from negotiations the Respondent stated its belief, based upon the earlier dismissed unfair labor practice charge, that any timely demand to bargain over closure of the SAS had to be in response to the Respondent's April 1997 notification to the Union. The SAS program was closed in August 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that the parties' agreement required the Union to request bargaining within ten calendar days of receiving notice of the SAS closure. Because the Union chose not to submit a demand to bargain in 1997, when it first received notice of the proposed closure, the Judge concluded that the Union waived its right to bargain. In so finding, the Judge expressly noted that neither the delay in closure nor the exploration of alternatives to closure could reasonably be construed as a recision of the decision to terminate the SAS program, especially as the Respondent was under order from higher authority to effect the closure. The Judge also concluded that there was nothing in the Union's January 2001 proposals that could not also have submitted in April 1997, when it first learned of the SAS closure. Accordingly, he dismissed the complaint and we agree. If delaying an adverse event for employees gave rise to new bargaining obligations by virtue of the passage of time, an employer would be deterred from attempting to reduce the impact of an adverse event through delayed implementation. The benefit provided employees through delay in the inevitable closure of an SAS should not result in a new bargaining obligation for the Agency. Otherwise, agencies will implement as soon as the right to bargain is satisfied or waived even when delay of the event is possible and beneficial to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit was more inclined to decide that changes in implementation dates, coupled with an intervening change in law that was material to the subject matter of the negotiations, renewed opportunities to request bargaining, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1442 v. FLRA</span>, 369 F.3d 548, 550-54 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner, Local 1442 of the National Federation of Federal Employees, represents non-professional employees at the U.S. Army's Letterkenny Depot in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. For years, the depot provided child-care services for both military and civilian employees. Union members not only sent their children to the depot's three child-care centers, but also worked there.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In April 1997, the depot's director of personnel and community activities sent a handwritten note to the union president, as well as to the presidents of three other unions that represent depot employees, regarding a decision by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) to transfer many of the depot's activities elsewhere. The note attached a list of "morale, welfare, and recreation activities" that the depot expected to discontinue because of the BRAC transfer--a list that included the three child-care centers--along with a projected time frame for the discontinuation of each. The projected time frame for the three centers was "September 1998/March 1999."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the union and the depot had a collective bargaining agreement that gave the union ten days after receiving notice of a change in working conditions to request bargaining, the union did not invoke this right after receiving the handwritten note. Instead, it submitted the child-care issue to the Labor-Management Partnership Council, a group composed of representatives from management and the four depot unions. The Council "provide[s] a forum for labor and management representatives to come together in full partnership to discuss issues critical to the depot [and] to make decisions on those issues."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In February 1999, with the child-care issue still on the Council's agenda, the depot announced that the Child Development Center (CDC), encompassing the depot's two childcare programs for pre-school children, would remain open until June of that year. It also announced that the School Age Services program (SAS), the third center and the one at issue in this case, would remain open until the end of August. After the CDC closed in June, the union filed an unfair labor charge, but the FLRA regional director declined to issue a complaint, in part because he concluded that the union's failure to request negotiations within ten days of the 1997 handwritten note--or, at the latest, within ten days of the depot's February 1999 announcement--waived the union's right to bargain under the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Meanwhile, the SAS remained open long after August 1999. In January 2001, the depot notified the four union presidents that the SAS would close on August 31 of that year. Less than ten days later the union requested bargaining over the closure, a request the depot initially agreed to. At their first bargaining session, management and the union reached agreement on four of the union's five proposals. The fifth proposal remained unresolved, however, even after the two sides were joined at a second session by a federal mediator. A further session with the mediator was scheduled but then canceled when the depot took the position that it actually had no obligation to bargain with the union regarding the closure of the SAS. Adopting the reasoning that the FLRA regional director had offered in declining to issue a complaint about the CDC closure, the depot contended that by failing to request bargaining within ten days of the 1997 handwritten note, the union waived its right to negotiate over the SAS closure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union filed an unfair labor practice charge, but following a hearing an administrative law judge rejected the charge, accepting the depot's view that by failing to request bargaining in 1997 within the time period specified by the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the union waived its right to bargain over the SAS closure. (Although the Federal Labor Relations Act does not include a ten-day limitations period, Authority precedent, unchallenged by the union, recognizes contractual limitations periods when evaluating the timeliness of bargaining requests<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,</span> 51 F.L.R.A. 1532, 1536, 1996 WL 408513 (1996).) Over a dissent, the Authority affirmed. We now consider the union's petition for review, mindful that "the Authority's decision may only be set aside if it is...'arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.'" <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Tex. Lone Star Chapter 100 v. FLRA,</span> 250 F.3d 778, 782 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A) (2000)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union first argues that its failure to request bargaining within ten days of receiving the 1997 handwritten note did not amount to a waiver of its bargaining rights because it submitted the child-care issue to the Labor-Management Partnership Council. The union points out that the collective bargaining agreement nowhere requires the union to submit issues to the Council within ten days (or any other time period) and that the Council's by-laws provide that an issue can be withdrawn from the Council if the parties are unable to resolve it through the Council process, at which point the issue "would revert to normal collective bargaining procedures." Noting that neither side ever withdrew the SAS issue from the Council, the union asserts that it cannot be deemed to have waived the right to bargain over that issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1212"></span>The problem with this argument, as the Authority's rejection of it suggests, is that it ignores the collective bargaining agreement's ten-day limitations period. The agreement plainly states that if the union fails to request bargaining within ten days, "negotiations are waived on the specific change(s) or implementation." Nothing in the agreement indicates that submitting an issue to the Council tolls the ten-day period. Indeed, if by submitting an issue to the Council at any time the union could revive its right to bargain over that issue after failing to seek negotiations within ten days, then the ten-day period would be meaningless. The section of the collective bargaining agreement providing that issues withdrawn from the Council revert to normal collective bargaining procedures merely ensures that the union will not forfeit bargaining rights <span class="Italic">that it has preserved</span>. In other words, if the union requests bargaining over an issue within the ten-day period, then a subsequent decision to submit that issue to the Council does not constitute a waiver of its bargaining rights. The collective bargaining agreement simply freezes the collective bargaining situation for as long as the parties attempt to address an issue in the Council. We thus reject the union's assertion that its submission of the child-care issue to the Council revived the bargaining rights that it waived by failing to request negotiations within ten days of receiving the handwritten note.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More meritorious is the union's alternative argument that the depot's 2001 notice gave the union a new ten-day window in which to request bargaining over the SAS closure. The Authority rejected this argument, noting that "neither the delay in closure nor the exploration of alternatives to closure could reasonably be construed as a rescission of the [1997] decision to terminate the SAS program." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Letterkenny Army Depot,</span> 58 F.L.R.A. No. 166, 2003 WL 21690708, at *2 (July 14, 2003). Moreover, the Authority said, "[i]f delaying an adverse event for employees gave rise to new bargaining obligations by virtue of the passage of time, an employer would be deterred from attempting to reduce the impact of an adverse event through delayed implementation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are unable to reconcile the Authority's reasoning with its own case law. Authority precedent provides that before unions have any obligation to request bargaining over proposed changes, they must receive adequate notice of the changes<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kan.,</span> 55 F.L.R.A. 704, 715, 1999 WL 641923 (1999) ("Adequate notice of a proposed change in conditions of employment triggers the exclusive representative's responsibility to request bargaining over the change."). To be adequate, "[n]otice...must be sufficiently specific and definitive to...provide the exclusive representative with a reasonable opportunity to request bargaining. For example, the notice must apprise the exclusive representative of the...planned timing of the change." <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, Memphis Dist.,</span> 53 F.L.R.A. 79, 82, 1997 WL 358858 (1997) (citation omitted). Notices that omit the timing of a change are therefore inadequate<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill Air Force Base,</span> 41 F.L.R.A. 690, 698, 1991 WL 147040 (1991) (finding a notice inadequate because "it did not specify either the number of employees to be placed in a nonpay status or the expected date of the actions"); <span class="Italic">U.S. Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office,</span> 2001 WL 1035062, at *42, (F.L.R.A. May 24, 2001) ("PTO's...notice was not adequate as it did not state or otherwise indicate when hiring and/or implementation of the plan or payments of the recruitment bonuses would be offered or commenced."). We see no basis for reaching a different result where, as here, the timing of a change deviates significantly from what appears in a notice. Either way, the union lacks accurate information about the timing of the change as actually implemented and may therefore be unable to make an informed decision about whether to request bargaining over the change.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Authority neither explained why it viewed this case differently than those in which notices omit timing information nor even acknowledged its own case law requiring that notices provide such information, its short opinion did cite with evident approval the ALJ's statement that "there was nothing in the Union's January 2001 proposals that could not also have [been] submitted in April 1997, when it first learned of the SAS closure." <span class="Italic">Letterkenny,</span> 2003 WL 21690708, at *2. That statement is incorrect. In 1999, <span class="Italic">after</span> the union received the handwritten notice, Congress authorized federal agencies to use funds appropriated for salaries to lower the cost of employee child care<span class="Italic">. See</span> Pub. L. No. 106-58, &#x00A7; 643(a), 113 Stat. 430, 477 (1999). Agencies could do this by, for example, providing tuition assistance to children attending private child-care facilities<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 792.218 (2004) ("The bill includes non-Federal center-based child care as well as care in family child care homes...."). One of the five proposals the union submitted for bargaining in 2001 related to such tuition assistance. Indeed, the two sides were still negotiating over just this proposal when the depot withdrew from negotiations. The Authority's ruling thus rests on a factual inaccuracy, i.e., that "there was nothing in the Union's January 2001 proposals that could not also have [been] submitted in April 1997." In fact, as the union points out, the ruling required it to do the impossible: "to have presented its proposal on childcare tuition assistance <span class="Italic">prior to</span> the time government-wide regulations authorized agencies to use appropriated funds for this purpose."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The intervening change in law not only undermines the Authority's reasoning but also distinguishes this case from <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service,</span> 20 F.L.R.A. 403, 1985 WL 46457 (1985), on which the Authority relies. In <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> the Authority held that a two-year delay in the implementation of a proposed change created no new bargaining obligation because "the nature and degree of the impact of the change in 1983 did not differ from the impact that was foreseeable when Respondent developed its plan in 1981." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 406. But here, contrary to the Authority's contention, the new law did affect the impact of the SAS closure. Specifically, the law gave the depot a new way to mitigate the loss of child-care services, i.e., offering tuition assistance to employees who moved their children from the closed SAS facility into private child-care programs, and thus provided the union with a reason to request bargaining--a reason it lacked in 1997<span class="Italic">. IRS</span> therefore provides no support for the Authority's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also reasoned that a contrary ruling would encourage employers to implement changes sooner rather than later even if delayed implementation was possible and could benefit employees.&#x2003;An employer would do this, the Authority explained, because if it had previously notified the union about a proposed change and discharged any obligation it had to bargain over the change (either because the two sides finished bargaining or because the union waived its bargaining rights), then delaying implementation would force it to take on new bargaining obligations. This reasoning suffers from two defects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, and most important, it runs counter to Authority cases holding that notices are inadequate unless they include information about the planned timing of a proposed change<span class="Italic">. See supra</span> pages 552-53. If employers can alter the timing of proposed changes long after providing notice, then the requirement that notices include timing information is weakened if not eliminated. To be sure, the Authority may depart from its precedent, but as we have explained, "[a]n agency changing its course must supply a reasoned analysis indicating that prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed, not casually ignored." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Rural Elec. Coop. Ass'n v. SEC,</span> 276 F.3d 609, 615 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting <span class="Italic">Greater Boston Tel. Corp. v. FCC,</span> 444 F.2d 841, 852 (D.C. Cir. 1970)). The Authority failed to do so in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Authority overlooks that an employer having no further obligation to bargain over a change can inform the union that it will delay implementation of the change only in exchange for the union's agreement that the delay will give rise to no new bargaining obligations. A union may, of course, reject such an offer and instead wait to see whether the employer will delay implementation irrespective of the union's willingness to waive new bargaining rights. The point is simply this: what the Authority calls "sound policy reasons" for its decision are unpersuasive because a contrary decision would in fact not force employers to choose between taking on new bargaining obligations and implementing a proposed change sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that the depot had an obligation to negotiate with the union over the 2001 closure of the SAS. Although the union waived its right to bargain over the "September 1998/March 1999" closure that the handwritten note announced, that waiver did not forfeit the union's right to bargain over a closure that occurred several years after the proposed time frame contained in the note.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress passed the Federal Labor Relations Act to encourage collective bargaining between federal employees and their employers.&#x2003;It did so after finding that such bargaining is "in the public interest" because, among other things, it "contributes to the effective conduct of public business" and "facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes between employees and their employers involving conditions of employment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a) (2000). While the Act imposes obligations as well as benefits on federal employees, obligations with which the Authority must ensure compliance, we believe the Authority's reasoning in this case reflects an inappropriate willingness to erect barriers to collective bargaining that are inconsistent with the text and purposes of the statute. Thwarting Congress's intent to promote collective bargaining, such barriers are not "in the public interest" because they hamper realization of the benefits that such bargaining produces.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The petition for review is granted and the case is remanded to the Authority for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand, FLRA entered a retroactive bargaining order and required a posting. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Letterkenny Army Depot and NFFE Local 1442</span>, 60 FLRA 456 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">Unless there is contract coverage, once management provides specific notice to the union of a decision to exercise a reserved right, e.g., institution of a RIF, the union is then obliged to request bargaining if that right is to be exercised as to the impact and implementation of the management decision<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">DOD, Dept. of Army, Hq., Ft. Sam Houston and AFGE Local 2154</span>, 8 FLRA 623, 624 (1982) (ALJ Decision). If the agency notified the union of proposed midterm changes, <span id="Page_1213"></span>the union essentially waives its right to bargain by submitting no proposals. The obligation to bargain is contingent on there being something to bargain about. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Council 214</span>, 10 FLRA 281, 292-93 (1982) (ALJ Decision). Although bargaining is required over changes in duties or in program operations affecting employees, the union must come forward with specific proposals. The union may not insist that management develop the guidelines governing the changes and then seek to negotiate on those guidelines. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 25 FLRA 248, 254-55 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">In limited circumstances, the union's bargaining request may be futile, unnecessary. The obligation to request bargaining, and the issue of waiver, is not triggered if the change in employment conditions is presented as already having been "decided upon," i.e., a <span class="Italic">fait accompli</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Willow Grove ARS and NAGE Local R3-32</span>, 57 FLRA 852, 856 (2002), <span class="Italic">reconsideration granted, result unchanged</span>, 58 FLRA 277 (2003). <span class="Italic">DHS Customs &#x0026; Border Prot. and NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 916, 921 (2010), reviewing an arbitrator's award, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also contends that the Arbitrator erred by finding that the Union did not waive its right to bargain.&#x2003;A union does not waive its right to bargain over a change when the change is announced as a <span class="Italic">fait accompli </span>and a request to bargain would be futile. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Avionics Ctr., Indianapolis, Ind.</span>, 36 FLRA 567, 572 (1990). In this regard, the Arbitrator found that the director's letter "made clear that it was implementing its plan, not inviting the Union to discuss it." According to the Arbitrator, "[t]his was not, and cannot be twisted to be, a proposal and invitation." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Arbitrator also found that the issuance of the director's memo on the same date as the director's letter was evidence that the Agency was unilaterally implementing the disputed changes. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>These factual findings support the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Union did not waive its right to bargain, and we deny this exception.[5] <span class="Italic">See IRS</span>, 64 FLRA at 432.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We also note that the Arbitrator found that, because the Union filed a grievance, it did not waive its right to bargain. In <span class="Italic">POPA v.

Cir. 1989), the court held that the union's protest of proposed changes and the filing of a ULP charge alleging a failure to bargain "did not waive its right to bargain[.]" The court noted that the principal remedy for such a ULP is a bargaining order and concluded that the filing of the ULP did not waive the right to bargain "as much as initiate it." <span class="Italic">POPA</span>, 872 F.2d at 455. Although it is unnecessary to rely on the Arbitrator's alternative rationale for finding no waiver, we note that the court's decision provides additional support for the Arbitrator's conclusion.</p>

<p class="noindent">A union will not be deemed to acquiesce to a change of working conditions, waiving implementation bargaining, if the union is under the impression that management does not intend a change and management makes no attempt to correct the union's impression after management becomes aware of it. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Office of Program Operations and Field Operations, Sutter Dist. Office and AFGE Local 3172</span>, 5 FLRA 504, 516-17 (1981).

<p class="noindent">A union does not waive bargaining rights if, in response to management's announced intent to change working conditions, the union protests that management is committing a ULP and the union requests management to stay the changes until the ULP is resolved.

<p class="noindent-1">[T]he union met with the agency and requested that the agency not implement the changes until a ruling was obtained as to their legality....&#8197;The union's protest against the change and its inquiry into legal remedies did not waive its right to bargain, as much as initiate it. Moreover, the union actually filed an unfair labor practice complaint....</p>
<p class="noindent">As a general rule, management is not required to bargain if it provides the union reasonable notice of changes in working conditions and if the union waits until after those changes are implemented to request bargaining. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Council 214</span>, 51 FLRA 1532, 1536-38 (1996), explained in the context of a contract that compelled reasonable notice of changes from management and submission of union proposals within 15 days after that notice, subject to extensions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority evaluates the timeliness of a union's proposals under either the parties' agreed upon contractual time limits or the Statute. With respect to contractual time limits for submitting proposals, the Authority has found that parties may define limits on rights, including bargaining rights under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Federal Aviation Administration, Northwest</span> <span class="Italic">Mountain Region, Seattle, Washington</span>, 14 FLRA 644 (1984) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>, <span class="Italic">Northwest</span>). With respect to the Statute, the Authority has consistently found that an agency need only provide "reasonable notice" and that the adequacy of such notice is determined in light of the facts and circumstances of a particular case<span class="Italic">. See Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service, Region I (Boston, Massachusetts)</span>, 16 FLRA 654 (1984) (Authority upheld ALJ's finding that the nature of the proposed change, as well as 10 days notice provided to the union was sufficient, and that union's 11th hour proposals were untimely); <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service (District Region, National Office Unit)</span>, 14 FLRA 698, 700 (1984) (union's proposals, nearly three weeks after notification was given and on the same date as the validation study was scheduled to begin, were untimely).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regardless of which standard is used to determine whether a union's demand to bargain is timely, the Authority has long held that once adequate notice is given, the union must act to submit proposals, request additional information, or request additional time<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Division of Military and Naval Affairs, State of New York, Albany, New York</span>, 8 FLRA 307, 320 (1982).

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The record is devoid of any evidence, and the General Counsel does not contend, that any past practice existed whereby the Union could reserve a "post-implementation" bargaining opportunity in the event it failed to meet the section 33.02(b) deadline of submitting proposals within 15 workdays. Moreover, the Authority has sanctioned "post-implementation" bargaining in only limited situations. In <span class="Italic">Headquarters, 127th Tactical Fighter Wing, Michigan Air National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard, Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan</span>, 46 FLRA 582, 586-87 (1992), the Authority upheld the Judge's finding that the Union was entitled under the Statute to bargain after implementation over matters that became evident only at that time. The Authority has also found that a union is entitled to bargain after an agency terminates an unlawful practice, a situation where the Statute does not require the agency to afford a union the opportunity to engage in pre-implementation bargaining<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics</span> <span class="Italic">Command, Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah</span>, 17 FLRA 394 (1985). There is no argument or evidence that either situation is present in the case now before us. Moreover, there is no argument that the facts and circumstances of the instant case warrant extending the "post-implementation" opportunities beyond these two situations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The waiver that occurs when the union fails to request bargaining within the time set by a contract was emphasized in <span class="Italic">VA Johnson Med. Ctr. and NAGE Local R5-136</span>, 58 FLRA 432, 434-35 (2003) (on review, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-136 v. FLRA</span>, 363 F.3d 468 (D.C. Cir. 2004), <span class="Italic">post</span>, following remand, 60 FLRA 446 (2004)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 11, &#x00A7; 2 of the agreement clearly specifies that proposals will be forwarded within 15 days following notification of a management change and that bargaining will normally commence within 10 days thereafter. The Respondent argued before the Judge and the Authority that nothing in that provision authorizes the Union to have additional time--beyond 15 days--to submit proposals. The Respondent also argued that the provision does not condition the submission of timely proposals on the receipt of information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree and find in agreement with the Respondent, that the proposals submitted by the Union outside of the contractual 15-day period were untimely filed under that negotiated provision. As there is no assertion or evidence that the parties agreed to an extension of time to allow the Union to submit proposals after the contractual 15-day period, we find that the Respondent did not violate the Statute by refusing to bargain over untimely submitted proposals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Materiel Command </span>[55 FLRA 10 (1998)] (agency that implemented proposed changes after a union failed to offer proposals within a 15-day contractual deadline or an agreed-upon extension date did not violate the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>proposal, we find that it was timely submitted under the contract. However, we find that the Respondent did not fail to fulfill its bargaining obligation for the following reasons. First, the record establishes that changes identified in management's notice to the Union were not made until <span class="Italic">after </span>the Union submitted its untimely proposals. In this respect, the Union president testified that, "[i]t was after we received the information and we submitted our proposals that they made changes." Tr. at 24. Although there was no actual bargaining with respect to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> proposal, the Respondent, in fact, complied with the proposal because it maintained the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>well beyond the contractual period authorizing bargaining. In addition, no additional proposals were offered during the contractual 15-day period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>proposal contemplates that some future bargaining by the parties would occur. However, as mentioned above, there is no assertion or evidence that the parties agreed to an extension of time to allow the Union to submit proposals after the 15-day period. Thus, there was nothing further to bargain and the Respondent had no obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> until a non-existent bargaining obligation was concluded.</p>
<p class="noindent">On review, in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-136 v. FLRA</span>, 363 F.3d 468, 475-77 (D.C. Cir. <span id="Page_1214"></span>2004) (following remand, 60 FLRA 446 (2004) (imposing bargaining order and entering <span class="Italic">status quo </span>remedy)), the court disagreed with FLRA's analysis and determined that the union properly initiated bargaining within the contractual time period by requesting maintenance of the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>and requesting information from the agency about the actions it was planning to implement as to patients' use of an employee parking lot. The union was privileged to make an initial, timely proposal to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, to request information to use in developing further proposals, and to continue to submit proposals after the initial time allowed for requesting bargaining. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Eng'rs, Memphis Dist. and NFFE Local 259</span>, 53 FLRA 79, 82 (1997) (adequate notice of proposed change in employment conditions triggers representative's responsibility to request bargaining over change; failure to request bargaining in response to adequate notice of proposed change may waive representative's bargaining right).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the union's request to bargain is submitted before the change, but at the 11th hour, it is untimely. Management's responsibility to delay a change or justify the refusal to delay by a showing of exigent circumstances arises only after the union submits a timely bargaining request, and then only if the bargaining cannot be completed prior to the implementation date. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Region I and NTEU</span>, 16 FLRA 654, 671 (1984) (ALJ Decision). The union did not waive bargaining rights by submitting proposals after a management-imposed deadline for impact bargaining. Before the deadline the union requested a bargaining session that was scheduled after the deadline. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Lowry AFB and AFGE Local 1974</span>, 16 FLRA 1104, 1117 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">A union waived its right to impact bargaining concerning a decision to implement performance expectations when management told the union that it would implement the performance expectations a week later.

Ctr., and NTEU</span>, 16 FLRA 749, 750 (1984). A letter of April 6 that provided a deadline of April 21 for receipt of proposals concerning implementation of some changes affecting working conditions was sufficient notice to the union, although no implementation date was stated. It was clear that implementation would be prompt, and the time provided for the response was reasonable. The union waived its right to bargain over impact by its failure to meet the reply deadline. <span class="Italic">GSA and AFGE</span>, 15 FLRA 22, 24 (1984).

When the union waited, without reason, until two days before the agency-announced date for implementation of changes in overtime assignment practices, the union lulled the agency into believing that the union accepted the new procedure and elected not to bargain. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Region I and NTEU</span>, 16 FLRA 654, 670 (1984) (ALJ Decision). A request for a negotiability determination nine months after a management practice was implemented could not be considered a timely request to bargain. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Council 214</span>, 22 FLRA 15, 18 (1986) (Proposals 3 &#x0026; 5). A union might waive its right to bargain over impact if it was informed of a change in working conditions, e.g., the institution of performance expectations, but the union continued to request information that management could not yet provide rather than submitting proposals to management on the basis of what was already known and was, in the judgment of FLRA, a sufficient basis for bargaining proposals. <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City Serv. Ctr. and NTEU</span>, 18 FLRA 693, 694 (1985). Management does not commit a ULP by implementing changes through a reorganization after bargaining with the union, adopting some union proposals, and declaring others nonnegotiable, if the union had not submitted other proposals or filed a negotiability appeal. <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1501</span>, 20 FLRA 768, 769 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 33 FLRA 454, 470-71 (1988) (although agency declared union proposals nonnegotiable at time it set for implementation, actual implementation did not occur until many weeks later; union submitted no other proposals before actual implementation).</p>

If management informs the union of a prospective change in working conditions, the union submits a batch of proposals, and management refuses to negotiate on some as nonnegotiable and states that others are negotiable, management does not commit a ULP as to the concededly negotiable proposals if the changes are later implemented and the union did not request bargaining on those proposals in the interim. There is no ULP when management requests that the union supply an explanatory statement of intent, so as to determine negotiability, if changes are implemented after the union does not respond to management's inquiry. In <span class="Italic">SSA Northeastern Program Serv. Ctr. and AFGE Local 1760</span>, 18 FLRA 437, 437-38 (1985), FLRA drew an analogy to <span class="Italic">Div. of Military and Naval Affairs, New York and New York State Council of ACT</span>, 8 FLRA 307, 320 (1982) (ALJ Decision) (exclusive representative may not ignore management request for specific proposals, await implementation of proposed action, and then submit bargaining proposals in effort to perfect its request to negotiate on impact and implementation; once on notice of management's intent to exercise reserved rights, union has obligation to either respond with appropriate proposals, request additional information, or request additional time to prepare to submit union position on impact and implementation).</p>
<p class="noindent">A union proposal is timely if it responds reasonably expeditiously under the circumstances and if the union was not on notice of the date that management intended to implement the changes that led to the proposal. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Midwest Reg'l Office, Chicago and NTEU Chap. 95</span>, 16 FLRA 141, 144 (1984). A union did not waive its bargaining rights as to the establishment of break times if, when supervisors modified break scheduling, the union contacted the appropriate supervisor involved upon learning of the change. <span class="Italic">Army Reserve Components Personnel and Admin. Ctr. and AFGE Local 900</span>, 19 FLRA 290, 292 (1985). Impact bargaining was not waived when the union submitted only one counterproposal. It was clear that the union was interested in continuing impact bargaining over a decision to reassign some employees. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Gov't Fin. Operations Hq. and NTEU</span>, 11 FLRA 334, 346 (ALJ Decision). Although an office move occurred only two days after the agency received union proposals about the procedures and arrangements concerning employees adversely affected by the move, the agency was required to bargain. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Dallas Dist. and NTEU Chap. 46</span>, 19 FLRA 979, 980 (1985).</p>
