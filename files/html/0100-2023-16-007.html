<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-7"><span class="space">C.</span> OPM APPROVAL OF APPRAISAL SYSTEM</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency must have OPM approval of its performance appraisal system before its implementation and before taking actions against employees under Chapter 43<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 430.209 (2022); <span class="Italic">Lee v. EPA</span>, 115 MSPR 533, 547 &#x00B6; 24, 2010 MSPB 240 (2010) ("in the absence of OPM approval, a chapter 43 action must be reversed regardless of the appellant's performance"); <span class="Italic">Cole v. IRS</span>, 25 MSPR 564, 565 n.* (1985) (harmful error doctrine does not apply to the issues of approval of the agency performance appraisal plan by OPM); <span class="Italic">Young v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 73, 78, 7 MSPB 7 (1981) (agency did not assert that an OPM-approved performance appraisal system was in effect). Although the requirement of OPM approval, and proof of that approval, generated cases during the first few years following enactment of the 1978 Reform Act, the question of OPM approval is now seldom an issue. Agencies' responses to appeals from performance-based actions generally include a copy of the OPM letter approving the agency's appraisal system.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under<span class="Italic"> Wells v. Harris</span>, 1 MSPR 208, 1 MSPB 199 (1979), a prohibited personnel practice was committed by an agency that took unacceptable performance actions against employees before an approved appraisal system was in place. Once a system is in effect, the significant question will be what effect a deficiency in the system or appraisal process has upon a performance-based action. <span class="Italic">Wells</span> cautioned at n.79:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our holding addresses only the application of &#x00A7; 4303 to employees for whom no performance appraisal system has been established pursuant to &#x00A7; 4302. We do not intimate that procedural or operational defects in appraisal systems established by an agency give rise to &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) [now 2302(b)(12)] prohibited personnel practices whenever &#x00A7; 4303 actions under such appraisal systems are initiated. In any such case, to establish a &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B) defense an employee must show that the decision was "based on" a prohibited personnel practice in the particular case, i.e., that the procedural or operational defect in the appraisal system amounted to a prohibited personnel practice affecting the particular decision in a way that was harmful to the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without a challenge to OPM approval of the appraisal system, the approval is ordinarily presumed by the Board, <span class="Italic">Mallory v. USDA,</span> DC-0432-13-0347-I-2 n.4 (NP 6/8/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, the Board will presume that OPM has approved the agency's performance appraisal system; however, if an appellant has alleged that there is reason to believe that OPM did not approve the agency's performance appraisal system or significant changes to a previously approved system, the Board may require the agency to submit evidence of such approval. <span class="Italic">Lee v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 5 (2010). The appellant has not contested this factor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Daigle v. VA</span>, 84 MSPR 625, 630-31 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (1999), announced that the Board will presume, unless there is a challenge, that an agency appraisal system was approved by OPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the Civil Service Reform Act, Congress "reestablished the connection between performance appraisals and within-grade pay raises based on ALOC [acceptable level of competence] determinations that had been broken by the Federal Salary Reform Act of 1962." <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 1 MSPR 505, 523 (1980). In subsequent cases, such as <span class="Italic">Callan v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy,</span> 23 MSPR 6 (1984), the Board remanded the appeal to the administrative judge on the issue of whether the agency could establish that it had OPM approval of its performance appraisal system. In <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Army,</span> 23 MSPR 657, 663 (1984), the Board found that presiding officials (administrative judges) could require proof of an OPM-approved appraisal system, to be admitted and <span id="Page_2877"></span>considered at any time during the proceeding below. Since that time, Board procedure has required that administrative judges routinely notify agencies to produce evidence of OPM's approval of the performance appraisal system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the agency's burden of proof was an important element in the early implementation of the new law, this case provides an opportunity to revisit the merits of continuing the current Board policy. Twenty years have passed since the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act. There is no statutory requirement for renewing approval of an agency's performance appraisal system once in place, and we are unaware of any agency which has not received OPM approval of its performance appraisal system. Therefore, we conclude that it is no longer necessary to perpetuate an outmoded paperwork requirement. However, if an appellant alleges that there is reason to believe that an agency is not in compliance with the law, the Board may require an agency to submit evidence that it has received OPM approval of its performance appraisal system.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Upon challenge, a critical element of the agency performance case is a demonstration of OPM's approval of its appraisal system. On April 9, 1981, the Deputy Managing Director of the Board wrote to the Chief Appeals Officers (regional chief administrative judges) concerning OPM review and approval of performance appraisal systems. The memo stated that in any appeal from an action based on unacceptable performance processed under 5 CFR Part 432 and requiring evidence of an approved performance appraisal plan, the evidentiary requirement would be met by a showing that the agency concerned had an agencywide plan approved by OPM and that a plan developed by a subordinate organization was approved by the agency headquarters. The memo also noted that an appeal could place at issue whether the performance appraisal plan was consistent with, or deviated from, an agencywide plan approved by OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Beg v. DHHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/BEG_OBAID_DC_0432_13_3191_I_1_FINAL_ORDER_1315143.pdf">DC-0432-13-3191-I-1</a> (NP 7/5/2016) ("If an employee alleges that there is reason to believe that the agency's performance appraisal system lacks OPM's approval, then the Board may require the agency to submit evidence of such approval. <span class="Italic">Daigle v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6; 12 (1999). Here, we have found no evidence in the record indicating that the appellant ever challenged whether OPM had approved the agency's performance system.&#8197;...Thus, absent a specific challenge, we find that the administrative judge properly presumed that OPM approved the agency's performance appraisal system.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fitzsimmons v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> NY-0432-10-0212-I-1 (NP 6/16/2011) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Fitzsimmons v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 476 Fed. Appx. 246 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP)), noted the obligation of the appellant to raise with the AJ any concern about whether the agency appraisal system was approved by OPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim, that his removal must be reversed because the agency did not prove that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) approved the agency's performance appraisal system, is without merit. The appellant admits that he did not challenge whether OPM had approved the agency's performance appraisal system. Because the appellant did not raise such a challenge, his claim regarding OPM approval is unavailing. <span class="Italic">Adamsen v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 6 (2011); <span class="Italic">Daigle v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6; 12 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rangel v. DHS</span>, 310 Fed. Appx. 385 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) (issue of OPM approval of an agency appraisal system must be timely and affirmatively raised in an arbitration case if the issue is to be preserved on judicial review as a challenge to the resultant award); <span class="Italic">Perkins v. Dept. of Interior</span>, CB-7121-12-0020-V-1 (NP 10/24/2013) ("As the agency points out in its response to the appellant's request for review, agency proof of OPM approval of its performance management system is not required unless the appellant alleges that there is reason to believe that an agency is not in compliance with the law in this regard. <span class="Italic">Daigle v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6; 12 (1999).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the Board may consider and decide whether there is sufficient proof of OPM approval of an appraisal system even when an appellant apparently did not raise the issue on appeal or in a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stenmark v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 59 MSPR 462, 467-69 (1993). During the early years of the Reform Act, there was considerable litigation and guidance about the seemingly simple burden of proof required to establish approval of a plan by OPM. <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 16 MSPR 397, 400 (1983), determined that if an agency introduces into the record of a performance case regulations creating an appraisal system, those regulations are presumed valid unless shown by the appellant to be contrary to law, e.g., lacking the approval of OPM. Even so, there was a difference between a minimal showing and no showing of compliance with OPM requirements<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 18 MSPR 377, 379 (1983) (following remand); <span class="italic">cf. Laminack v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DA-0432-20-0177-I-1 (NP 7/6/2022) (treating as an agency "rule," not a contract, statements in an agency's submission to OPM concerning its appraisal system).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For a time it seemed as though the presumption of regularity created by an agency regulation pursuant to <span class="Italic">McKenzie</span> was overruled. The Board considered OPM approval of an appraisal system in 1984 in <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 657, 663 &#x0026; n.5 (1984). The Board declined to take official notice of the existence of an OPM-approved system. That approval was neither common knowledge nor readily verifiable. Nor would the Board initially agree to a general rebuttable presumption of OPM approval. The burden of proof was placed on the employer to demonstrate the requisite approval by substantial evidence. The evidence could consist of documentary or testimonial evidence (or through a letter from OPM or an affidavit concerning OPM communications by an agency official with knowledge of the approval).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But now if the agency introduces its own appraisal system regulation stating that the system meets the statutory requirements of the Reform Act and OPM regulations, the regulation will be considered, without a challenge, sufficient to establish by substantial evidence OPM approval of the system. <span class="Italic">Salonga v. Dept. of Army</span>, 28 MSPR 628, 630 (1985); <span class="Italic">Macie v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 28 MSPR 611, 614 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Shorter v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 28 MSPR 622, 625 (1985), <span class="Italic">overruling</span> <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 25 MSPR 116, 117 n.1 (1984)). Under<span class="Italic"> Shorter</span>, 28 MSPR at 625:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]here a regulation contains language...that the agency has complied with 5 USC Chapter 43, the Civil Service Reform Act, or other relevant statutes and regulations in the development of its performance appraisal system or plan, the agency will be deemed to have met its burden of...proving that it has an OPM-approved performance appraisal plan, except where rebuttal evidence casts doubt on the accuracy or authenticity of the agency's submission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency regulation lacking the information referenced in <span class="Italic">Shorter</span> is insufficient to establish OPM approval. <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Army</span>, 28 MSPR 634, 637 n.3 (1985). <span class="Italic">White</span> also appeared to hold that an agency may not establish OPM approval in one appeal and then rely on that case subsequently without adhering to the requirement that some proof be adduced to show OPM approval in response to each appeal filed. <span class="Italic">Pennel v. USDA</span>, 32 MSPR 429, 431 (1987), noted that "final agency regulations that contain no 'adulterations' or markings to suggest that they are draft regulations or regulations undergoing material revisions, and that state that the agency's performance appraisal system has been approved by OPM, constitute sufficient evidence to establish OPM approval of that system." <span class="Italic">Pennel</span> rejected a challenge to an agency regulation that stated as its duration "one year from issuance date unless previously terminated or reissued" when there was nothing to indicate that the regulation was scheduled to expire on any given date and the appellant did not allege that the appraisal plan expired or was changed. The Federal Circuit accepted as proof of the appraisal system letters from OPM stating its approval of the agency plan. <span class="Italic">Adkins v. DHUD</span>, 781 F.2d 891 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In addition, with some concern as to the Board's handling of the issue, the Federal Circuit agreed in 1986 that an agency regulation reciting OPM approval of an appraisal plan was sufficient proof of that approval (lacking contrary evidence). <span class="Italic">Chennault v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 796 F.2d 465 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Army</span>, 28 MSPR 648, 650 (1985) (following <span class="Italic">Shorter</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although it should be easy for an agency to demonstrate OPM's approval of its appraisal plan, when challenged the agency must still provide record evidence of that approval. <span class="Italic">Stenmark v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 59 MSPR 462, 467-68 (1993), catalogued the deficiencies in the agency's proof: the agency did not submit a copy of its appraisal system; the removal proposal referred to an agency order, but that order was a training manual rather than a performance appraisal system; the OPM letter approving the agency's appraisal system did not identify the appraisal system by order number; and an order that was referenced was not placed in the record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Adamsen v. USDA</span>, 563 F.3d 1326, 1330-32 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Adamsen v. USDA,</span> 116 MSPR 331, 341, 2011 MSPB 49 (2011) (Member Rose dissenting)) ("Ms. Adkins's unsworn statement, identifying no firsthand knowledge of the relevant events and no factual basis to support a claim that OPM had issued a letter in January 1996 approving the agency's November 1995 performance appraisal system, is on its face unreliable hearsay."), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is a challenge to the nature of OPM's approval concerning a component of an appraisal system, e.g., the number of critical element appraisal levels, MSPB considers the agency submission to OPM, a Form 1631, and other proof, <span class="italic">Laminack v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DA-0432-20-0177-I-1 (NP 7/6/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the history of the approval process for the OPM Form 1631, as well as the statements of those involved in seeking such approval, provide a useful aid to our interpretation of this ambiguous document. In this regard, we recognize that the Board has suggested that a "lack of clarity" regarding OPM's approval of an agency's appraisal system may be resolved by "examination of the OPM Form 1631," along with an affidavit or declaration from a credible witness with actual knowledge of the approval. <span class="italic">Adamsen v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (2011). Indeed, probative hearsay evidence in this regard may meet the substantial evidence standard. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 14. Under appropriate circumstances, an unrebutted declaration under penalty of perjury may prove the facts it asserts. <span class="italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon our review of the above evidence and the circumstances behind the approval process for the agency's performance appraisal system, we interpret the OPM Form 1631 as approving the agency's use of Pattern E, which was the pattern used in this case. We therefore find that the agency has proven by substantial evidence that OPM approved <span id="Page_2878"></span>the performance appraisal system under which the agency took the performance-based action in this case. In any event, courts may permit the substitution of one word for another when, among other things, a word is the obvious result of a clerical error. 2A Shambie Singer &#x0026; Norman Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction &#x00A7; 47:36 (7th ed. 2021). Here, it is clear that the number "5" in section 4 of the OPM Form 1631, in the space for the minimum number of appraisal levels, is a clerical error that should have been a number "2" to provide maximum flexibility.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit expects an agency to prove OPM approval of an appraisal system in an arbitration case to the same extent that proof is required before the MSPB, <span class="Italic">NATCA v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 91-3524):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government's "evidentiary problem" is more than "serious." It is fatal. The only evidence of OPM approval of the FAA system introduced was attorney argument contained in a post-hearing brief submitted to the arbitrator. Attorney argument does not constitute evidence....&#8197;In order for the Board or an arbitrator to sustain an agency action under 5 USC 4303, the agency must prove its case by substantial evidence. 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(A). Here, the record before the arbitrator contains <span class="Italic">no</span> evidence of OPM approval of the FAA standards....&#8197;The arbitrator's decision sustaining the FAA's demotion of Shuffler is therefore reversed.</p>
