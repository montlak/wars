<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-42_2"><span class="space">b.</span> Not All Charges Sustained</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is expected to scrutinize penalties carefully when fewer than all charges are sustained. In <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 757 F.2d 1281, 1285 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the appellant was fired on five charges. Four were dropped during the Board appeal. The Board sustained the discharge on the basis of the remaining charge. Rejecting this result, the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The five charges upon which the petitioner's removal was originally based were of varying degrees of severity. The remaining charge, constituting the sole basis for the removal action, appears to be one of the least egregious. While it may be appropriate to uphold removal when the agency drops charges, this is not such a case in view of this single remaining charge. <span class="Italic">Cf. Power v. United States</span>, 531 F.2d 505, 509, 209 Ct. Cl. 126 (1976) (employee's removal not sustained for minor offense when agency failed to prove more serious offenses). We agree with the presiding official that Hagmeyer's action represents immaturity rather than culpability, particularly in light of his good record. By transferring <span id="Page_5210"></span>him to the White House, the agency could only have concluded that while he was not suitable for recruiting duty, petitioner was a particularly responsible officer for other types of duty and worthy of rehabilitation....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer</span> result was reiterated in <span class="Italic">Kline v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 808 F.2d 43, 45 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases in which the appropriateness of the penalty is at issue and where some of the initial charges have not been sustained, the presiding official's decision to sustain the penalty should contain a reasoned explanation demonstrating that all relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors were properly considered.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Texeira v. USPS</span>, 267 Fed. Appx. 950, 953-54 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP), remanded for reconsideration of a penalty imposed for a split charge of falsification of time records and failure to follow proper timekeeping procedures. The falsification charge was not sustained by the Board, but the Board allowed its penalty determination to be influenced by the agency deciding official's belief that the remaining charge involving failure to following timekeeping procedures was intentional, when the factual findings by the AJ were to the contrary:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find merit in Texeira's second contention that the penalty must be reconsidered by the agency in light of the Board's dismissal of the falsification charge. When falsification was not proved, the original penalty was too severe. We do not lightly review agency disciplinary decisions. These are necessary to promote the efficiency of government service. <span class="Italic">Parker v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 819 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1987). We give deference to the agency's judgment unless a penalty violates a statute or regulation or is "so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Villela v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 727 F.2d 1574, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (citing<span class="Italic"> Power v. United States,</span> 531 F.2d 505 (Ct. Cl. 1976)). The Court has written that our review of M.S.P.B. decisions must allow the Board "wide latitude in fulfilling its obligation to review agency disciplinary actions." <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Serv. v. Gregory,</span> 534 U.S. 1, 6-7 (2001) ("It is not for the Federal Circuit to substitute its own judgment for that of the Board.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But our deference to the Board's wide latitude is not unlimited. Agencies and the Board are obligated responsibly to consider and balance relevant factors for each individual case before selecting an appropriate penalty; and the Board has listed twelve factors--so called <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors--to assure that the punishment "strikes a responsible balance within tolerable limits of reasonableness." <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Admin.,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981). Pertinent here, the Board in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> wrote:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Whenever the agency's action is based on multiple charges some of which are not sustained, the presiding official should consider carefully whether the sustained charges merited the penalty imposed by the agency. In all cases in which the appropriateness of the penalty has been placed in issue, the initial decision should contain a reasoned explanation of the presiding official's decision to sustain or modify the penalty, adequate to demonstrate that the Board itself has properly considered all relevant factors and has exercised its judgment responsibly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 306. Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Kline v. Department of Transportation,</span> 808 F.2d at 45, our court addressed, as we again do here, the question whether the Board correctly upheld a penalty when only one of several charges against an employee had been proved. We vacated the penalty and remanded the case to allow the agency's deciding official to determine an appropriate penalty for the single proved charge. We there emphasized that the deciding official made no finding about what the penalty would be if fewer than all charges were proved. We wrote: "[The] record does not demonstrate that the presiding official identified, balanced and then considered the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in determining that the sustained charge warranted the penalty imposed." 808 F.2d at 46.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the record here does not support the AJ's statement that the decisionmaker Sarno "considered demotion to be appropriate even if [Texeira] had not attempted to defraud or deceive the agency." Sarno did not so testify, neither did he write nor imply in his decision that he would have imposed the same discipline for a mere timekeeping error. Sarno testified: "I was losing trust and faith in her." And he testified: "I believe she did it on purpose to do something for a friend and she made a huge mistake." And he testified: "She paid somebody that didn't deserve to get paid. I think she did it on purpose. She did it for a friend and it was wrong."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This record demonstrates a decisionmaker imposing a severe penalty because he believed the agency had proved Texeira guilty of purposeful falsification, not just the failure to make a correct entry of vacation time. The agency has not yet articulated what less severe sentence should be imposed when it proved only a much less severe charge. The first of the twelve factors listed in the Board's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> decision is "the nature and seriousness of the offense." The agency decisionmaker gave no rational basis for imposing a severe sentence on a less serious charge. When that factor was not properly considered, the penalty imposed was disproportionate to the proved charge and unsupported by substantial evidence. We remand for reconsideration of the penalty to be imposed on the lesser charge only.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit summarized its views on penalty determinations when not all charges are sustained, <span class="Italic">Guise v. DOJ</span>, 330 F.3d 1376, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases in which this court has upheld fewer than all the charges against an employee, the court has not invariably remanded for a new penalty determination. Instead, the court has considered the number and seriousness of the charges sustained as compared to the number and seriousness of those that have not been sustained. When we have invalidated most of the charges against the employee, or the invalidated charges are the most serious charges, we have vacated the penalty and remanded for reconsideration of the penalty in light of the significant change in the number and seriousness of the sustained charges. <span class="Italic">See Grafton v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 864 F.2d 140, 144 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Southers v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 813 F.2d 1223, 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Moreover, when there is some indication that the agency would have regarded the sustained charges as insufficient to justify the penalty imposed, we have vacated the penalty and remanded with directions that the Board remand the case to the agency for redetermination of the appropriate penalty. <span class="Italic">See Modrowski v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 252 F.3d 1344, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2001). However, when the majority of the charges are sustained and the charge or charges that are not sustained are relatively minor compared to the sustained charges, and when there is no indication that the agency would have adopted a different penalty in the absence of the unsustained charge, we have upheld the penalty without the need for a remand. <span class="Italic">See Kumferman v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 785 F.2d 286, 291-92 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The inquiry in such cases is akin to a harmless error inquiry, under which an appellate court is required to uphold the decision of a lower tribunal if the court is satisfied, "with fair assurance," that "the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error." <span class="Italic">Kotteakos v. United States</span>, 328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S. Ct. 1239, 90 L. Ed. 2d 1557 (1946).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Guise</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Hathaway v. DOJ</span>, 384 F.3d 1342, 1353-54 (Fed. Cir. 2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the situation where not all charges brought against an employee are upheld, any previous penalty may be called into question. This court's recent decision in <span class="Italic">Guise v. Department of Justice</span>, 330 F.3d 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2003), speaks to the situation before us in this case. <span class="Italic">Guise</span> dealt with two different situations. The first one is where the agency indicated that it would have imposed a different penalty if fewer than all the charges were sustained. In such a case, remand to the agency is required. Here the DEA did not indicate that it desired a lesser penalty be imposed should the Board decline to sustain any of the charges brought against Mr. Hathaway. The second situation is where, as here, the agency gave no indication that it would have imposed a lesser penalty. In such a case, <span class="Italic">Guise</span> requires that we consider "the number and seriousness of the charges sustained as compared to the number and seriousness of those that have not been sustained." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1381. When the most serious charges or a majority of the charges have been invalidated, it may be appropriate for us to "vacate[&#8197;] the penalty and remand[&#8197;] for reconsideration of the penalty in light of the significant change in the number and seriousness of the sustained charges." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Southers v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 813 F.2d 1223, 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (remanding to the Board where the "bulk of the charges ha[d] been reversed" with the direction that the penalty of removal be considered).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our precedent in <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246 (Fed. Cir. 1999), requires that in such circumstances the case return to the Board rather than the agency. Although the Board cannot "independently institute a new penalty" because that would violate the agency's sole discretion to determine penalty,<span class="Italic"> id</span>. at 1258-59, the Board does have the authority to "mitigate the maximum reasonable penalty so long as the agency has not indicated either in its final decision or during proceedings before the Board that it desires a lesser penalty to be imposed on fewer charges," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1260. That being the case, under <span class="Italic">LaChance</span>, the case may be remanded to the Board for a possible mitigation of the penalty to be imposed. <span class="Italic">See Russo v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 284 F.3d 1304, 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case before us, there is no question that, under the <span class="Italic">Guise</span> standard, a remand is required. The two most serious charges, charges 1 and 3, have been reversed, while the least serious charge, an inadvertent omission, is the only charge we have sustained. Furthermore, we cannot say that the AJ would have upheld the penalty of removal based just on charge 2. Significantly, the AJ stated that the first charge, conduct prejudicial to DEA, would, on its own, "<span class="Italic">certainly be insufficient</span> to warrant the maximum possible sanction of removal," and the AJ relied on the combined severity of the three charges to affirm the penalty. <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span> at 20 (emphasis added). The "significant change in the number and seriousness" of the charges against Mr. Hathaway requires that we remand to the Board in this case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Petroski v. NASA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3020), made the point that the Board must independently evaluate a penalty, not simply defer to the agency deciding official, when less than all of the charges are sustained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, petitioner contends that, in this case, imposition of the penalty of removal amounted to an abuse of discretion. We agree and reverse the AJ's affirmance of the penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5211"></span>This court will not disturb a penalty "unless it exceeds the range of permissible punishment or is 'so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion.'" <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 772 F.2d 887, 889 (Fed. Cir. 1985). To earn that deference, selection of the penalty must have been based upon a responsible balancing of the relevant factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 5 MSPR 280, 296-308 (1981). If an agency's action is based on multiple charges, and if some of the charges are not sustained, the Board's decision "to sustain the penalty should contain a reasoned explanation demonstrating that all relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors were properly considered." <span class="Italic">Kline v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 808 F.2d 43, 45 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ sustained the penalty of removal after sustaining only three of the five charges which supported the removal penalty. It appears that, in doing so, the AJ deferred almost entirely to the decision of the agency's deciding official. The problem with that approach is that it appears from the record that the agency's decision to remove was based upon the combination of all five charges, rather than upon a single sustained charge or a combination of sustained charges. Therefore, the AJ should have independently balanced the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in light of only the sustained charges, particularly since the charge of threatening a fellow employee, which was considered to be the most serious charge by the deciding official, was one of the charges not sustained by the AJ.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we hold that the penalty of removal is not within the limits of reasonableness for the sustained charges. In this regard, we find particularly relevant the mitigating circumstances identified by the AJ--namely, petitioner's unblemished 19-year prior government service record, the brief three-month time-frame in which petitioner's misconduct occurred, the fact that petitioner felt that she was unjustly passed over for promotion, the apparent shortcomings of petitioner's supervisor, and the fact that at least two of petitioner's coworkers apparently were conspiring against her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner's penalty is reduced to a suspension of three months.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goines v. USDA</span>, 113 Fed. Appx. 925, 928 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) (when the Board erred in sustaining a charge but the court can nonetheless be satisfied with fair assurance that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, the court should affirm the Board's decision); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Whiteley v. DOJ,</span> 137 Fed. Appx. 337, 341 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP) (court declined to remand a case for redetermination of a removal penalty when a less serious charge arguably could not be sustained).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One court held that should the Board sustain a discharge, but for less than all the charges against the employee, and should the Board's analysis indicate that the sustained reason "may well" constitute a basis for a finding that the action taken would promote service efficiency, the Board's treatment of the charges is inadequate. Determining that the Board's function is to review rather than to order the dismissal of federal employees, a court stated the issue was not whether dismissal was reasonable, as assessed by the Board, but whether the employer still desired to impose dismissal. On that issue, the court remanded the case to the employer, DHUD, to determine if the discharge was too harsh for the charge sustained. <span class="Italic">Wild v. DHUD</span>, 692 F.2d 1129 (7th Cir. 1982). This approach is not generally followed. Instead, the Board may reassess the penalty without a remand to the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 F.3d 563, 567 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (stating, on remand, that "[t]he agency or the board is a more suitable body [than the court] for determination of penalties," but specifically leaving to the Board the task of determining the penalty on remand). But in In a well-publicized example of a reversal, the Federal Circuit set aside removal of an employee accused of theft of $2.10 worth of soap in <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081, 1083 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the court directed the Board to order the employing agency to redetermine the penalty on remand, a result that evoked a strong dissent from Judge Nichols, who thought the penalty determination should be undertaken by the Board without deference to the agency determination</p>
