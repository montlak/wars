<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-162"><span class="space">2.</span> Claims Based on State Law; Westfall Act; Federal Tort Claims Act; Defamation; Tort Action Arising From Assault; No FEAR Act; Religious Freedom Restoration Act; FECA</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The decisions just discussed principally involve claims by federal employees based on federal law. It would be anomalous if employees could be precluded from suing on federal law claims and be allowed to present analogous claims under state law in state or federal court. The analysis of cases presenting claims in federal courts for what amount to common law torts becomes even more complex. Some courts dismiss the claims because they are impliedly precluded by the remedies of the Civil Service Reform Act or kindred statutes. Some courts examine the impact of the Westfall Act, leading to an analysis of whether the lawsuit against an individual addresses acts or omissions of that individual within the scope of that person's duties. If it is determined that the acts or omissions are covered, the lawsuit is converted to a claim against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The Federal Tort Claims Act creates liability for certain types of cases normally redressable through state law, but that statute also excludes liability for other actions, notably defamation. The substitution of the government for individual defendants is a matter of some significance, for once the government becomes the defendant through the Westfall Act, the limitations of the Federal Tort Claims Act apply. This means that some causes of action, e.g., defamation, may be barred as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McAdams v. Reno</span>, 858 F. Supp. 945 (D. Minn. 1994) (also reviewing case law concerning judicial review of determination by Attorney General (or her designee, the U.S. Attorney) to substitute government for federal employee sued in his or her individual capacity), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">McAdams v. Reno</span>, 64 F.3d 1137 (8th Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A court determined that the remedial scheme of the Civil Service Reform Act preempted a lawsuit based on state law claims by a manager against union officials that the manager believed were making unfounded complaints about his actions as a manager. <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. IFPTE</span>, 306 Fed. Appx. 168 (5th Cir. 2009). But <span class="Italic">Anderson v. United States</span>, 364 Fed. Appx. 920, 921-24 (5th Cir. 2010), without reaching preemption claims, determined that a lawsuit by a supervisor could proceed under Texas law against a subordinate who allegedly defamed the supervisor through statements made in a whistleblowing complaint to the Office of Special Counsel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff/Appellant Cathy Anderson is a Group Supervisor in the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review of the Social Security Administration ("SSA"). Scot Stier is a Case Intake Assistant in that office. Stier's duties as a Case Intake Assistant included reviewing and analyzing cases from SSA claimants to ensure sufficiency of the evidence, preparing case summaries, communicating with claimants about their claims, and, when requested, receiving and reviewing incoming mail. At all relevant times, Appellant was Stier's supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In July 2007, Appellant proposed a three-day suspension of Stier for his alleged failure to properly process a large amount of mail that had been assigned to him. On October 2, 2007, Stier wrote a letter to the Disclosures Unit of the Office of Special Counsel ("OSC"), alleging that Appellant had been "confiscating" mail from SSA claimants and "holding on to it" for more than a year, rather than allowing the mail to be properly distributed for review. Stier claimed that Appellant's actions violated the claimants' <span id="Page_5407"></span>due process rights and that her actions were a "gross mismanagement and abuse of authority."[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The record indicates that the OSC concluded its investigation against Appellant and took no action against her. Stier, however, was ultimately suspended by the SSA temporarily for failure to perform his duties. Stier subsequently filed a "Whistleblower" claim with the Merit Systems Protection Board, alleging that the SSA retaliated against him for writing his complaint letter about Appellant to the OSC. The MSPB held, however, that Stier had been reprimanded for his failure to do his job and not for his purported whistleblowing activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 29, 2008, Appellant filed a Petition in Texas Civil District Court, claiming that Stier's letter to the OSC had defamed her. In the alternative, Appellant claimed that Stier's letter had caused her intentional infliction of emotional distress. On November 14, 2008, the Government--acting on Stier's behalf--removed the case to federal district court. The Government also filed a motion to substitute itself as Defendant in the case. As grounds for removal and substitution, the Government argued that Stier had been acting within the scope of his employment when he wrote the allegedly defamatory statements. Accordingly, the Government argued that the exclusive remedy for Appellant's claims was the Federal Tort Claims Act ("FTCA"), and that the proper Defendant was the Government. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2679(b)(1), (d). The Government attached a certification from the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Texas asserting that Stier was acting within the scope of his employment for purposes of the FTCA. A week later, the Government moved for dismissal of the entire case, arguing that Appellant had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and that her claims were otherwise barred by the FTCA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 9, 2008, the district court granted the Government's motion to substitute parties and dismissed Stier from the case. Also on that day, the district court issued a final order of dismissal. Appellant now appeals both the order substituting parties and the order dismissing the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin with the district court's order substituting the Government as Defendant. The entirety of that order states: "Scot A. Stier is dismissed, and the United States of America is substituted under the Federal Torts Claims Act."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FTCA provides the exclusive remedy "for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death arising or resulting from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting <span class="Italic">within the scope of his office or employment...</span>." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2679(b)(1) (emphasis added).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, acting on proper authority for the Attorney General, certified that Stier was acting within the scope of his employment when Stier wrote the allegedly defamatory letter. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 15.4(a).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Minyard,</span> the plaintiff sued Minyard (her employer) and her direct supervisor for defamatory comments that her supervisor had made in response to a workplace misconduct investigation. <span class="Italic">Minyard,</span> 80 S.W.3d at 578. The court held that the supervisor had acted outside the scope of his employment when defaming the plaintiff because there was no evidence that the supervisor's comments "were referable to any duty owed to Minyard, or, in other words, were in furtherance of Minyard's benefit, and for the accomplishment of the object for which the employee was hired." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 579. The court noted that "Minyard's policies require employees to participate in workplace misconduct investigations," as the supervisor did when he defamed the plaintiff, arguably giving rise to a duty by the supervisor to speak to the investigators. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Nevertheless, the court held that no vicarious liability existed because "these policies do not demonstrate that [the supervisor's] defaming [the plaintiff] to [another worker] during the investigation would further Minyard's business and accomplish a purpose of [the supervisor's] job." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Minyard</span> is analogous to the instant case. Like the supervisor in <span class="Italic">Minyard</span>, Stier made his allegedly defamatory comments as part of what would become a workplace misconduct investigation. However, assuming Appellant's allegations to be true, Stier's comments were not in furtherance of his specific duties as a Case Intake Assistant, but made out of a personal vendetta to punish Appellant for her recommended suspension. Stier was not "acting for the employer's benefit" when he lied about Appellant, nor were his defamatory comments "to accomplish an objective of his job." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 578 (citations omitted). Indeed, as the court in <span class="Italic">Minyard</span> stated, "[t]here is a critical distinction between defaming someone to one's employer and defaming someone for one's employer." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 579. Moreover, Stier did more than mentally turn aside from his duties. He deviated from his normal courses of action to fabricate a story that Appellant was harming others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite noting the similarities to <span class="Italic">Minyard,</span> the Government argues that Stier was acting within the scope of his employment because Stier's letter complained of Appellant withholding claimants' mail, and Stier's duties included processing correspondence in a timely manner. The Government further argues that we have already held that government agents who allegedly defamed another in the course of their duties were shielded from defamation claims because their comments "were incident to the discharge of [their duties]." <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez,</span> 129 F.3d at 770-71.[2] <span class="Italic">Rodriguez,</span> however, is distinguishable. In <span class="Italic">Rodriguez,</span> two federal agents were specifically tasked by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms ("ATF") to make statements on the agency's behalf to third parties about a particular work-related incident. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 770. One of the agents also had a duty as supervisor to inform his subordinates of the event. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Government also cites <span class="Italic">Aversa v. United States,</span> 99 F.3d 1200, 1207-08, 1213 (1st 2 Cir. 1996). <span class="Italic">Aversa,</span> however, is a First Circuit case that applies New Hampshire law regarding scope of employment, not Texas law. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1210. Its ruling is therefore not apposite.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, however, no one at the SSA specifically tasked Stier to report on his supervisor's behavior, nor was it a specific function of his work duties. Instead, Stier gratuitously provided the allegedly defamatory statements to the OSC while doing nothing to seek relief through his own chain of command. Stier may perhaps have had a general duty to report misconduct or illegal activity. Moreover, such a report, if true, may ultimately facilitate the performance of his duties. However, this general duty is not the same as being specifically tasked by one's superiors to provide information to third parties about a particular incident, nor is it akin to a supervisor's duty to keep his subordinates informed of relevant events. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez,</span> 129 F.3d at 770-71; <span class="Italic">see also Crouch v. J C Penney Corp., Inc.,</span> 337 Fed. Appx. 399, 403 (5th Cir. 2009) ("If statements made by an employee to his employer about another employee as part of a <span class="Italic">required</span> workplace investigation cannot give rise to defamation [by vicarious liability], JCP cannot be liable for defamation simply because it <span class="Italic">allowed</span> employees to report misconduct to HR.") (emphasis in original). Accordingly, we do not find the facts in <span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span> dispositive.[3] In conclusion, Stier was not hired nor tasked with supervising Appellant and reporting on her behavior. Any purported duty to do so in order to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse was tangential to his duties as a <span id="Page_5408"></span>Case Intake Assistant. Assuming Appellant's allegations are true (which we must at the pleadings stage), Stier's defamatory letter was not "for the accomplishment of the object for which [he] was hired," <span class="Italic">Minyard,</span> 80 S.W.3d at 577, and therefore was not "within the scope of his office or employment," &#x00A7; 2679(d)(1). Accordingly, the Government erred in certifying Stier's actions, and the district court erred in substituting the Government as Defendant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Indeed, the court in <span class="Italic">Minyard</span> distinguished the statements of the ATF agents in <span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span> by noting that "the defamatory statements [in <span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span>] were the kind that the employees were 'authorized and expected to make and were closely connected to the performance of their duties.'" <span class="Italic">Minyard,</span> 80 S.W.3d at 579 (quoting <span class="Italic">Rodriguez,</span> 129 F.3d at 771). We do not find the same case here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Summarizing the case law concerning a defamation claim linked to alleged personnel actions, <span class="Italic">Roth v. United States</span>, 952 F.2d 611, 614-16 (1st Cir. 1991), concluded that the claim was preempted by the Reform Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA was meant to provide a comprehensive framework for personnel policies governing federal employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Saul v. United States</span>, 928 F.2d 829, 833 (9th Cir. 1991), citing S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 3, 53 (1978); <span class="Italic">Montplaisar v. Leighton</span>, 875 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1989). In the course of that endeavor, Congress set out procedures for challenging "prohibited personnel practices." 5 USC 2302. The prohibited personnel practices covered by the CSRA include "personnel actions" that transgress the law's merit system principles--merit system principles which require the federal sovereign to treat its employees fairly and shield them from capricious actions, personal vendettas, favoritism, and the like. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Saul</span>, 928 F.2d at 833. The thrust of Roth's allegations is that the combination of Harlan's aspersions and conduct demeaned Roth and subjected her to arbitrary action. Thus, the threshold question is whether Harlan's antics, as Roth portrayed them, would qualify as a prohibited personnel practice within the contemplation of the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the CSRA, personnel actions include "corrective action[s]." 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii). The corrective action category is a capacious one, encompassing a wide variety of conduct affecting federal employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Saul</span>, 928 F.2d at 834. The slanderous utterances that Roth bemoans, while allegedly untrue, nevertheless concerned her job performance. Those comments reflected a profound disagreement between Harlan and Roth about the manner in which Fontes' termination proceedings--and, perhaps, termination proceedings generally--should appropriately be conducted. Harlan's behavior, as described in the complaint, to the extent that Roth retains standing to pursue it...was similarly job-related. In sum, an objective assessment of the complaint leaves no doubt that Roth was attempting to sue over utterances and associated acts which reflected dissatisfaction with her work within the FAA and which focused upon substantial conflicts anent agency policy and procedures. For CSRA purposes, then, Roth's complaint, no matter how generously it might be read, alleged a prohibited personnel practice, that is, a personnel action violative of the merit principles. <span class="Italic">Accord</span> <span class="Italic">Saul</span>, 928 F.2d at 834.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This conclusion sounds the death knell for Roth's statement of claim. It is now beyond serious question that the CSRA preempts state-law challenges to prohibited personnel practices in the federal workplace. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Berrios v. Dept. of Army</span>, 884 F.2d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding that, where the CSRA pertains, defamation claims touching upon prohibited personnel practices are preempted); <span class="Italic">Montplaisir</span>, 875 F.2d at 8 (holding former government employees' private tort action against union lawyers to be preempted by "the comprehensive nature of the [CSRA's] remedial scheme"); <span class="Italic">Broughton v. Courtney</span>, 861 F.2d 639, 643 (11th Cir. 1988) ("If plaintiff's state law claims...are within the scope of the coverage of the CSRA, then the actions are preempted by the CSRA."). As we stated on an earlier occasion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The legislative history of the CSRA establishes beyond dispute that Congress intended that statute to provide an exclusive procedure for challenging federal personnel decisions....&#8197;"The history and intent of the CSRA plainly prefigures that collateral district court jurisdiction would impede the ideals of fast, efficient management and greater uniformity in the judicial review process."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Berrios</span>, 884 F.2d at 31-32 (quoting <span class="Italic">Tucker v. DMA</span>, 607 F. Supp. 1232, 1240 n.6 (D.R.I. 1985)). It follows inexorably that Roth's claim is preempted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To this point, the drill is straightforward. Roth, however, has a fallback position. She says that, in her case, administrative remedies have been almost, if not entirely, foreclosed by the bodies from whom she has sought succor, viz., the Merit Systems Protection Board and its Office of Special Counsel (both citing lack of jurisdiction). In addition, she points out that administrative remedies, even if available, make no provision for damage awards to deserving complainants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The short answer to these assertions is that they are <span class="Italic">nihil ad rem</span>. As to Roth's complaint about the lack of an accessible administrative mechanism, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that, even where the CSRA provides no guaranteed forum, "preemption of...work-related tort claims is necessary to fulfill congressional intent." <span class="Italic">Saul</span>, 928 F.2d at 843. As to Roth's grievance concerning the unavailability of damage awards, <span class="Italic">Montplaisir</span> controls. There, in addressing a near-identical remonstrance, we responded: "That injured employees might be left without a means of recovering money damages is a necessary consequence of the [comprehensive nature of the CSRA] . Congress, in its wisdom, was fully entitled to prefer administrative enforcement to civil trials." <span class="Italic">Montplaisir</span>, 875 F.2d at 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We will not paint the lily. We suggest that the Supreme Court, in its landmark decision construing the CSRA, has itself provided a powerful refutation of Roth's lack-of-remedy argument:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The question is not what remedy the court should provide for a wrong that would otherwise go unredressed. It is whether an elaborate remedial system that has been constructed step by step, with careful attention to conflicting policy considerations, should be augmented by the creation of a new judicial remedy....&#8197;That question obviously cannot be answered simply by noting that existing remedies do not provide complete relief for the plaintiff. The policy judgment should be informed by a thorough understanding of the existing regulatory structure and the respective costs and benefits that would result from the addition of another remedy....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Bush v. Lucas</span>, 462 U.S. 367, 388, 103 S. Ct. 2404, 2416, 76 L. Ed.2d 648 (1983). On the basis of <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, as explicated in <span class="Italic">Berrios</span>, <span class="Italic">Montplaisir</span>, and <span class="Italic">Saul</span>, we find Roth's lamentations about the inadequacies of administrative relief under the CSRA to be an exercise in irrelevancy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since civil service reform became a legislative reality in 1978, the Supreme Court "has jealously guarded CSRA against innocuous judicial incursions." <span class="Italic">Montplaisir</span>, 875 F.2d at 3; <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Rivera v. United States</span>, 924 F.2d 948, 951 (9th Cir. 1991) (stating that "Congress's purpose in enacting the CSRA was to channel grievances and disputes arising out of government employment into a single system of administrative procedures and remedies"). We are obliged to do no less. Considering the CSRA's breadth and the comprehensive, integrated nature of its remedial scheme, we believe the field is...fully occupied, leaving little, if any, room for state-law tort anodynes. Indeed, "[p]erforming the requisite analysis...leads to the inescapable conclusion that Congress intended to preempt state-law tort actions." <span class="Italic">Montplaisir</span>, 875 F.2d at 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need go no further. In general, a federal employee whose position comes within CSRA's reach may seek redress for the untoward effects of a prohibited personnel practice only through the panoply of remedies that CSRA itself affords. Roth's case, as she has stated it, is completely engulfed within this generality.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In view of our disposition of this matter, we need not consider the government's alternative asseveration that the plaintiff's complaint, insofar as it seeks an award of damages, is also barred under the Federal Tort Claims Act, more specifically, 28 USC 2680(h) (precluding maintenance against the federal sovereign of "[a]ny claim arising out of...slander"). By the same token, it would be supererogatory for us to decide the plaintiff's motion to supplement the record; with or without supplementation, the show has closed.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A lawsuit based on assault by one federal employee against another was not within the Federal Tort Claims Act, but that statute permitted litigation of a claim based on the agency's failure to investigate the tortfeasor or to take the steps necessary to protect the plaintiff from the individual who assaulted him. <span class="Italic">Matsko v. United States</span>, 372 F.3d 556, 559-62 (3rd Cir. 2004), discussed the government's liability (not treating the liability of the employee who conducted the assault):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our task is to decide whether Kotor's outburst was within the scope of his government employment. We assess whether Kotor was acting within the scope of his employment under the law of Pennsylvania, because that is where the incident occurred<span class="Italic">. See</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1346(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see also Aliota v. Graham,</span> 984 F.2d 1350, 1358 (3d Cir. 1993). In Pennsylvania, courts apply the Restatement (Second) of Agency's &#x00A7; 228 to determine whether conduct is within the scope of employment. Section 228 considers four prongs indicative of conduct within the scope of employment: (1) the conduct is of the kind the employee is employed to perform; (2) the conduct occurs within the time and space of employment; (3) the conduct is actuated at serving the employer; and (4) any force used is foreseeable by the employer<span class="Italic">. Fitzgerald v. McCutcheon,</span> 270 Pa. Super. 102, 410 A.2d 1270, 1272 (1979) (citing &#x00A7; 228). Unless the litigant satisfies each prong, the court will conclude that the act in question was not within the scope of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we must articulate what "act" we are contemplating. Matsko argues that the District Court erred when it defined Kotor's assault as the "act in question." He asserts that the relevant act was Kotor's retrieval of his chair, the use of which was integral to his job as a MSHA inspector. Simply stated, Matsko characterizes the act incorrectly. We will not focus on the minimally offensive conduct--retrieval of the chair--when it was the aggregate of Kotor's actions that caused Matsko's injury. The retrieval of the chair would have been the act in question only if no assault had occurred. Plainly, an assault happened. Therefore, to determine whether Kotor was acting within the scope of his employment, the relevant "act" began when Kotor approached Matsko and ended when Kotor assaulted him, using excessive force<span class="Italic">. See Costa v. Roxborough Mem'l Hosp.,</span> 708 A.2d 490, 494 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1998) (defining the conduct in question to be the intentional assault).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That the &#x00A7; 228 test is applicable is uncontested, as is the fact that Kotor's conduct occurred within the time and space of his employment. Like the District Court, however, we are not persuaded that Matsko has satisfied, or could satisfy, the other three prongs of &#x00A7; 228. Defying both the first and fourth prongs, Kotor's mine inspector job description does not involve or even contemplate violence.[7] Contrary to the third prong, Kotor's act was motivated by personal animus, rather than any intent to serve the United States.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The cases that Matsko cites from Pennsylvania state courts to show that force is sometimes within the scope of employment are distinguishable because each involved a job description in which force was implicit<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;After assaulting Matsko and taking back the chair, Kotor commented: "I remember the last time I talked to you--you hung up on the phone on me."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even reading the facts in the light most favorable to Matsko, as we are required to do, we cannot conclude that Kotor was acting within the scope of his employment when he assaulted Matsko. Thus, the District Court was correct that &#x00A7; 2679(b)(1) of the FTCA does not provide a waiver of the United States' sovereign immunity to create liability for Kotor's assault.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Judge Weis would hold that Kotor's conduct was within the scope of his employment. However, recovery would be denied because the exception to the waiver of sovereign immunity for "assault and battery" under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2680(h) would apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, Matsko asserts that his claim fits within the FTCA's special treatment of assaults by investigative or law enforcement officers. The United States is not liable for claims involving assault, battery, or other intentional torts by federal employees, unless the government actor was an investigative or law enforcement officer. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2680(h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we are bound by our earlier precedent, we conclude that Kotor should not be treated as an "investigative or law enforcement officer" for purposes of determining whether sovereign immunity attaches. While Kotor was an inspector for the MSHA, which included authority to inspect mines and investigate possible violations, the FTCA did not intend to bring within its scope actions by "officers" not within the bounds of an investigation<span class="Italic">. See Pooler v. United States,</span> 787 F.2d 868, 872 (3d Cir. 1986) (noting that Congress intended the investigative officer exception to apply only to conduct "in the course of a search, a seizure, or an arrest").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Matsko suggests that under <span class="Italic">Carlson v. Green,</span> 446 U.S. 14, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed.2d 15 (1980), we must read the &#x00A7; 2680(h) exception more broadly than in <span class="Italic">Pooler</span> to encompass all activities undertaken by investigative officers<span class="Italic">. See Wright v. United States,</span> 719 F.2d 1032, 1034 (9th Cir. 1983) (refusing to limit the exception to the context of a search, seizure, or arrest); <span class="Italic">Sami v. United States,</span> 617 F.2d 755, 760 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (same). We need not determine whether <span class="Italic">Pooler'</span>s narrow reading was mistaken, because employees of administrative agencies, no matter what investigative conduct they are involved in, do not come within the &#x00A7; 2680(h) exception<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., EEOC v. First Nat'l Bank of Jackson,</span> 614 F.2d 1004, 1007-08 (5th Cir. 1980) (refusing to apply the exception to an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission agent). Because Kotor is not covered by the FTCA's investigative or law enforcement officer provision, the District Court was correct that no waiver of sovereign immunity applied to Kotor's intentional tort. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2680(h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, because Kotor was not acting within the scope of his employment during the intentional assault, nor does he qualify as an investigative or law enforcement officer, the District Court was correct that the FTCA does not apply. Thus, we affirm the dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Liability for the negligence of Kotor's supervisors and coworkers</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The District Court also dismissed Matsko's claim that the United States was negligent by not preventing his injuries. The Court stated that the FTCA did not waive sovereign immunity for such a claim and "[p]laintiffs...failed to cite any law or precedent to support their argument that this matter is encompassed in a statutory provision, other than the FTCA." We conclude that the District Court prematurely dismissed this claim, and will reverse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that a government employee acting outside the scope of his employment committed an injurious assault or battery will not preclude liability against the government for negligently allowing the assault to occur<span class="Italic">. Sheridan v. United States,</span> 487 U.S. 392, 401-02, 108 S. Ct. 2449, 101 L. Ed.2d 352 (1988) (considering whether the intentional tort exception to waiver precluded a separate claim for liability based on the government's negligence). "In a case in which the employment status of the assailant has nothing to do with the basis for imposing liability on the Government, it would seem perverse to exonerate the Government because of the happenstance that [the assailant] was on the federal payroll." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 402, 108 S. Ct. 2449.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The alleged negligence in this claim stems from the United States' undertaking a duty to protect Matsko when it invited him to a meeting at the MSHA offices.[10] As in <span class="Italic">Sheridan,</span> this duty is entirely separate from any <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span> claim for Kotor's actions. Therefore, even if the United States cannot be held liable for Kotor's actions based on its status as his employer, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2680(h), it may be without sovereign immunity for negligence by other MSHA employees, who were within the scope of their own employment, in not stopping the injurious behavior<span class="Italic">. Sheridan,</span> 487 U.S. at 402-03, 108 S. Ct. 2449.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;Whether the government owed a duty to Matsko must be resolved under the law of Pennsylvania, because that is where the incident occurred<span class="Italic">. See</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1346(b)(1). In Pennsylvania, the Restatement (Second) of Torts &#x00A7; 344 makes a possessor of land liable to invitees to his property for "physical harm caused by the accidental, negligent, or intentionally harmful acts of third persons." <span class="Italic">Moran v. Valley Forge Drive-In Theater, Inc.,</span> 431 Pa. 432, 246 A.2d 875, 878 (1968).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Contrary to the government's argument, Matsko's negligence claim is not a subterfuge to mask an otherwise precluded claim. Matsko's premises liability theory does not stem from negligent hiring, training, or supervision, but arises solely out of the &#x00A7; 344 duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed in the prior section, it is clear that Kotor was acting outside the scope of his employment. Taking Matsko's allegations as true, however, under &#x00A7; 228 the other MSHA employees were within their scope of employment at the time Matsko was attacked. Kotor's supervisors and coworkers were performing their jobs to further the MSHA's mission at the time of the assault, and were mere bystanders by virtue of the fact that the MSHA offices were an open floor plan. Because <span id="Page_5410"></span>Matsko has sufficiently alleged that the MSHA employees were acting within the scope of their employment, and it is at least arguable that they were negligent,[11] the District Court erred by holding that the FTCA did not waive sovereign immunity. The question of actual negligence should be resolved on the merits, rather than in a jurisdictional challenge.[12] <span class="Italic">See Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. &#x0026; Loan Ass'n,</span> 549 F.2d 884, 892 (3d Cir. 1977) ("it is incumbent upon the trial judge to demand less in the way of jurisdictional proof than would be appropriate at a trial stage"). We hold, therefore, that the District Court erred by dismissing the claim as barred by the governmental immunity and, accordingly, will reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;One could question whether the United States, by and through the MSHA officers, knew that Kotor had a propensity for violence or whether the MSHA officials had time to intervene to stop Kotor. Under the uncontested facts, however, Matsko has sufficiently pleaded the existence of the duty, breach, and causation elements of his negligence claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;The parties disagree about whether it was appropriate for the District Court to consider factual issues before the government had filed an answer<span class="Italic">. Compare Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. &#x0026; Loan Ass'n,</span> 549 F.2d 884, 891-92 (3d Cir. 1977) (noting that a "12(b)(1) factual evaluation may occur at any stage in the proceedings, <span class="Italic">from the time the answer has been served</span>") (emphasis added) <span class="Italic">with Berardi v. Swanson Mem'l Lodge No. 48,</span> 920 F.2d 198, 200 (3d Cir. 1990). We need not resolve this issue, because on the record before us, we have no indication that facts pertinent to the question of whether the government was negligent were contested.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we will affirm in part and reverse in part. Insofar as Matsko claims that the United States is liable for the negligence of Kotor's supervisors and coworkers, his lawsuit should not have been dismissed. In all other respects, the District Court's order was proper.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-24-139.html#sec17-135">Federal Tort Claims Act</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an unusual situation, <span class="Italic">McDonnell v. Cisneros</span>, 84 F.3d 256, 258-62 (7th Cir. 1996), determined that employees could not bring a tort case based on harm suffered as a result of an arguably overzealous and improperly conducted investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct of the employees who were investigated. Declining to permit a civil claim on a theory approximating reverse sexual harassment, under <span class="Italic">McDonnell</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not consider the claims of sexual harassment in this case frivolous, although we agree that it was right to dismiss them. Title VII does not prohibit sexual harassment as such, but it does prohibit discrimination, on grounds of sex, in working conditions. When a female worker is sexually harassed by male coworkers or supervisors, the result is to make the workplace less bearable for her because she is a woman than it is for the men who work beside her and, being male, are not harassed....&#8197;Unfounded accusations that a woman worker is a "whore," a siren, carrying on with her coworkers, a Circe, "sleeping her way to the top," and so forth are capable of making the workplace unbearable for the woman verbally so harassed, and since these are accusations based on the fact that she is a woman, they could constitute a form of sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">Winsor v. Hinckley Dodge, Inc.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 79 F.3d at 1000; <span class="Italic">Spain v. Gallegos</span>, 26 F.3d 439, 442 (3d Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Jew v. University of Iowa</span>, 749 F. Supp. 946, 958 (S.D. Iowa 1990). By a further stretch of the concept a male supervisor for whom life is made unbearable by baseless accusations that he is extorting sexual favors from his subordinates could also be thought a victim of sexual harassment. The accusations are based on the fact that he is a man--that is, on the difference in sex between him and the persons he is accused of abusing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we conclude that a claim of sexual harassment might arise from verbal harassment of a pair of male and female employees falsely accused of sexual hanky-panky in derogation of their duty to their employer, we do not think it can do so in the circumstances detailed at such length in the complaint. The plaintiffs' employer received a complaint of job-related sexual misconduct by them. Although the complaint was lurid and anonymous, the plaintiffs do not argue that their employer was obliged or even entitled to ignore it. Employers who disregard charges of sex-related misconduct by their employees run a considerable risk of being sanctioned for having tolerated sexual harassment. It behooved HUD to investigate the charges against the plaintiffs, and since the plaintiffs were employed in the department's investigative arm the department had to turn to another department for investigators. For this reason and to preserve an appearance of impartiality, HUD had to give the bloodhounds a long leash. Police officers, FBI agents, and other persons engaged in the investigation of misconduct, whether criminal or civil, sometimes stray across the indistinct line that separates vigorous from abusive investigation. The Defense Department's investigators may have done so in this case. The question is whether an investigation of sexual harassment that exceeds the proper limits is itself a form of actionable sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The objections to such an extension of the concept of sexual harassment are both practical and doctrinal. The practical objection is that it places the employer on a razor's edge. A parallel concern figured in this court's and the Supreme Court's decision that state welfare workers, who can be liable under the Constitution for removing children from parental custody without good cause, should not also be liable under the Constitution for failing without good cause to remove children from parental custody. <span class="Italic">DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services</span>, 812 F.2d 298, 303 (7th Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 489 U.S. 189, 203, 109 S. Ct. 998, 1007, 103 L. Ed.2d 249 (1989). The employer who fails to investigate a charge of sexual misconduct will be liable under Title VII, should the charge turn out to be meritorious, for having failed to exercise due care to prevent sexual harassment. E.g., <span class="Italic">Carr v. Allison Gas Turbine Division</span>, 32 F.3d 1007, 1011-12 (7th Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Saxton v. American Tel. &#x0026; Tel. Co.</span>, 10 F.3d 526, 535 (7th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Cortes v. Maxus Exploration Co.</span>, 977 F.2d 195, 199 (5th Cir. 1992). But if, because the employer wants to demonstrate how seriously he takes such charges, the investigation oversteps the proper bounds, causing humiliation to the targets of the investigation, the employer will, under the interpretation of the law that the plaintiffs urge in this case, also be guilty of sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The law does sometimes place people on a razor's edge, where they face liability for doing either too much or too little. But here we are being asked to extend the law to bring about this result, and we are reluctant to do this. We are especially reluctant because Congress has made specific provision with respect to the legal remedies of victims of improper investigation by federal officers--which brings us to the doctrinal objection to the extension of accepted principles that the plaintiffs seek. If, as alleged, the investigators in this case told the people whom they were interviewing that the plaintiffs had engaged in job-related sexual misconduct, then, because the statement was false and defamatory, the investigators committed the tort of defamation, for which the plaintiffs could sue them. But the investigators would have a defense of qualified immunity. <span class="Italic">Buckley v. Fitzsimmon</span>, 509 U.S. 259, 275-78, 113 S. Ct. 2606, 2617-18, 125 L. Ed.2d 209 (1993); <span class="Italic">Siegert v. Gilley</span>, 500 U.S. 226, 234, 111 S. Ct. 1789, 1794, 114 L. Ed.2d 277 (1991). Since the amendments to the Federal Tort Claims Act made by the Westfall Act, Pub. L. 100-494, in 1988, they would have something even better--a right, upon certification by the Attorney General that they were acting within the scope of their employment, to substitute the United States as the party defendant <span class="Italic">and</span> the Tort Claims Act for whatever law might otherwise apply. 28 USC 2679(b)(11), (c), (d)(4); <span class="Italic">see</span> also Pub. L. 100-694, &#x00A7; 2. The United States is not liable under the Tort Claims Act for defamation by its employees. 28 USC 2680(h). One effect of the Westfall Act is therefore to preclude our plaintiffs' potential defamation claim (which arose after the Act went into effect) against the Defense Department's investigators.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plaintiffs' counsel pointed to the Federal Tort Claims Act's exclusion of defamation as a reason for wanting to shoehorn the investigators' misconduct into Title VII. The exclusion weakens rather than strengthens the plaintiffs' case. When Congress crafts particular remedies for particular wrongs, the presumption is that these are the exclusive remedies and that such limitations as they may embody are not to be circumvented by extending a more generally worded statute over the subject of the more specific one. E.g., <span class="Italic">Seminole Tribe v. Florida</span>, [517 U.S. 44], 116 S. Ct. 1114, 1132, 134 L. Ed.2d 252 (1996); <span class="Italic">Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Ass'n.</span>, 453 U.S. 1, 14-15, 101 S. Ct. 2615, 2623-24, 69 L. Ed.2d 435 (1981). The Tort Claims Act makes specific provision for suits arising out of abuses by federal investigators in a proviso to 28 USC 2680(h) that conspicuously omits defamation from the list of abuses that can impose liability on the United States under the Act. The plaintiffs are trying to use Title VII, which does not have any specific provision with regard to federal investigators, to amend the Tort Claims Act and circumvent the Westfall Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McDonnell</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Flanagan v. Ashcroft</span>, 316 F.3d 728, 730 (7th Cir. 2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We agree with the district court's conclusion that this case is on all fours with <span class="Italic">McDonnell</span>; indeed, the allegations are nearly identical. The agents argue that their case is different because <span class="Italic">any</span> investigation into their conduct would have been unwarranted; the very decision to investigate the complaint, they insist, is evidence of harassment. We see no important distinction, however, between a decision to investigate and the extent of an investigation. Moreover, the agents' suggestion that an employer is not <span class="Italic">entitled</span> to investigate a sexual harassment complaint is untenable, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Malik,</span> 202 F.3d at 105 ("[A]n employer's investigation of a sexual harassment complaint is not a gratuitous or optional undertaking; under federal law, an employer's failure to investigate may allow a jury to impose liability on the employer."); <span class="Italic">McDonnell</span>, 84 F.3d at 260 ("Employers who disregard charges of sex-related misconduct by their employees run a considerable risk of being sanctioned for having tolerated sexual harassment.")...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Tort Claims Act does not support a claim of a negligent violation of the Privacy Act, <span class="Italic">Coleman v. United States</span>, 912 F.3d 824, 835 (5th Cir. 2019):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5411"></span>As noted above, the FTCA waives the United States government's sovereign immunity only "under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1346(b)(1). The Supreme Court has "consistently held that &#x00A7; 1346(b)'s reference to the 'law of the place' means law of the State--the source of substantive liability under the FTCA." <span class="Italic">F.D.I.C. v. Meyer</span>, 510 U.S. 471, 478 (1994). As such, it is well-established that a federal agent's failure to fulfill duties imposed upon him solely by federal statute cannot stand alone as a basis for suit under the FTCA. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Smith</span>, 324 F.2d 622, 624-25 (5th Cir. 1963) (noting that the FTCA "simply cannot apply where the claimed negligence arises out of the failure of the United States to carry out a statutory duty...[as] [t]he nature of the claim...is simply not one which would be asserted against 'a private person' under the laws of the State"); <span class="Italic">Art Metal-U.S.A., Inc. v. United States</span>, 753 F.2d 1151, 1157-58 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (explaining that the FTCA "makes the United States liable in accordance with applicable local tort law.... Duties set forth in <span class="Italic">federal law</span> do not, therefore, automatically create duties cognizable under <span class="Italic">local tort law</span>.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, when the FTCA is used as the vehicle for bringing invasion of privacy or wrongful disclosure allegations against agents of the United States, the pertinent inquiry is whether the federal agents violated applicable state tort laws--not whether the federal agents violated the elements of the federal Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs v. Abrahamson</span>, 964 F. Supp.2d 1268, 1272-73 (D.

United States</span>, 257 F. Supp.2d 37, 45 (D.D.C. 2003) ("Unless plaintiff can establish a duty under District law to keep employee records such as security clearance application forms confidential, she cannot state a claim for negligence under the FTCA.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A lawsuit was brought against a government employee under a state tort theory in <span class="Italic">Jamison v. Wiley</span>, 14 F.3d 222, 226-28, 237 (4th Cir. 1994). The Fourth Circuit explained the relation of the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Westfall Act, and individual liability in, as it considered a complaint of alleged sexual assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and remanded the case for further consideration by the district court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act, commonly known as the Westfall Act, was passed in response to the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Westfall v. Erwin</span>, 484 U.S. 292, 108 S. Ct. 580, 98 L. Ed.2d 619 (1988), which significantly narrowed the scope of the absolute immunity that federal employees had traditionally enjoyed for common law torts committed within the scope of their employment. Before 1988, it was widely understood that federal employees were absolutely immune from personal liability for common law torts committed while they were acting "within the outer perimeter of [their] line of duty." <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., General Elec. Co. v. United States</span>, 813 F.2d 1273, 1277 (4th Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Barr v. Matteo</span>, 360 U.S. 564, 575, 79 S. Ct. 1335, 1341, 3 L. Ed.2d 1434 (1959) (plurality opinion). In <span class="Italic">Westfall</span>, however, the Supreme Court held that such immunity is not available unless the challenged conduct is <span class="Italic">both</span> within the outer perimeter of the employee's official duties <span class="Italic">and</span> "discretionary in nature." 484 U.S. at 298, 108 S. Ct. at 584. This meant that federal employees were now exposed to personal liability for any common law torts committed in the course of their official duties, unless they could show they were exercising governmental discretion at the time of the conduct in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court in <span class="Italic">Westfall</span> recognized that by introducing into the doctrine of official immunity such an inquiry into the "discretionary" nature of the challenged conduct--similar to the one that had bedeviled courts for years in litigation under the Federal Tort Claim Act (FTCA)[1] --it was not only creating the potential for considerable complexity, but also making it difficult for federal employees to obtain dismissals based on official immunity at the summary judgment stage or earlier. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 299-300, 108 S. Ct. at 585. It therefore expressly invited Congress to establish "[l]egislat[ive] standards" to define the scope of the official immunity available to "federal employees involved in state-law tort actions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 300, 108 S.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The FTCA, which generally waives the United States' sovereign immunity with respect to state tort actions against it for injuries caused by the negligence of its employees acting within the scope of their employment, 28 USC 1346(b), contains a provision expressly excepting from that limited waiver of sovereign immunity all claims based on the discretionary acts or omissions of federal employees. 28 USC 2680(a). The courts have struggled for years to define the scope of this so-called "discretionary function" exception to the FTCA. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 14 C. Wright, A. Miller &#x0026; E.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress promptly responded by passing the Westfall Act, which "establish[es] legislative standards to govern the immunity of Federal employees who have allegedly committed state common law torts." <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 100-700, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 4, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1988 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 5945, at 5947 (1988). As the Act's legislative history reveals, Congress' primary concern was that the <span class="Italic">Westfall</span> decision would expose federal employees--particularly low-level "rank and file" employees who exercise little discretion in carrying out their duties--to unprecedented personal liability, with predictable adverse consequences for the routine administration of the government's business. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 5946-47; <span class="Italic">see</span> Pub. L. No. 100-694, &#x00A7; 2(a)....&#8197;The Act's stated purpose therefore was to "protect Federal employees from personal liability for common law torts committed within the scope of their employment, while providing persons injured by the common law torts of Federal employees with an appropriate remedy against the United States." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 2(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The centerpiece of the Act was &#x00A7; 5, which amended the FTCA to provide that an FTCA action against the United States is the sole remedy for any injury to person or property caused by the negligent or wrongful acts of a federal employee "acting within the scope of his office or employment," "exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding for money damages...against the employee whose act or omission gave rise to the claim." 28 USC 2679(b)(1). The purpose of this "exclusive remedy" provision was to give federal employees an absolute immunity from common law tort actions that was functionally equivalent to--if not perfectly congruent with--the immunity that they had enjoyed under the common law doctrine of <span class="Italic">Barr v. Matteo</span> before the <span class="Italic">Westfall</span> decision. H.R. Rep. No. 100-700, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> at 5947 ("the functional effect of [the Act] is to return Federal employees to the status they held prior to the <span class="Italic">Westfall</span> decision").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 6 of the Act contained several procedural provisions designed to implement the absolute immunity created by section 5. It authorizes the Attorney General to issue what has come to be called a "scope certification"--a certification that "the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose." 28 USC 2679(d)(1)-(2).

If the Attorney General issues a scope certification with respect to an action brought against a federal employee in state court, the action "shall be removed without bond...by the Attorney General to the [appropriate] district court of the United States," where it "shall be deemed" to be an action or proceeding against the United States under the FTCA and the United States "shall be substituted as the party defendant." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 2679(d)(2). The Act further provides that the Attorney General's certification with respect to an action brought against a federal employee in state court "shall <span class="Italic">conclusively</span> establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Attorney General refuses to issue a scope certification with respect to an action pending in either federal or state court, the Act permits the employee to "petition the court to find and certify that the employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2679(d)(3). If the court so certifies, the action "shall be deemed" to be an action against the United States under the FTCA, and the United States "shall be substituted as the party defendant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the suit is pending in state court at the time the employee files the petition for certification, the Attorney General "may" remove the action to the appropriate district court for resolution of the disputed scope-of-employment issue, but the district court must remand the action to the state court if it finds, in considering the employee's petition for certification, that he was not acting within the scope of his office or employment.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Wiley concedes that some of the acts of which Jamison complains (e.g., the acts of alleged sexual assault and battery) were not within the scope of his employment, and that the district court properly refused to substitute the United States as defendant with respect to the claims arising out of those acts. But he maintains that other acts of which Jamison complains--in particular, the instances of unfair criticism of her job performance alleged in paragraph 5 of the complaint--were within the scope of his employment, and that the district court erred when it failed to sever the claims arising from those acts from the others and substitute the United States as defendant with respect to them. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether an employee's action falls within the scope of his employment under the Westfall Act is to be determined according to the rules of <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span> of the state in which the wrongful conduct occurred. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Carter</span>, 983 F.2d at 1322. As the district court recognized and Wiley now concedes, under Virginia law, an act is within the scope of employment only if it is "fairly and naturally incident to [the master's] business,...done while the servant was engaged upon the master's business and...done, although mistakenly or ill-advisedly, with a view to further the master's interests, or from some impulse or emotion <span id="Page_5412"></span>which naturally grew out of or was incident to the attempt to perform the master's business, and did not arise wholly from some external, independent, and personal motive on the part of the servant to do the act upon his own account." <span class="Italic">Sayles</span>, 242 Va. at 332, 410 S.E.2d at 634....&#8197;Applying these principles, the district court found, after hearing the testimony of both Jamison and Wiley, that the acts of non-sexual harassment alleged in paragraph 5 of the complaint were not within the scope of Wiley's federal employment, because they were not done with the intent to further the interests of Wiley's governmental employer, but resulted wholly from his "external, independent, and personal motive" to retaliate against Jamison for rejecting his sexual advances.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Heuton v. Anderson</span>, 75 F.3d 357, 359-61 (8th Cir. 1996), analyzes the procedures and complexities of litigation against federal employee defendants who seek protection of the Westfall Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plaintiffs work as meat inspectors for the United States Department of Agriculture, Food and Safety Inspection Service ("USDA"), and Anderson is their supervisor. They sued Anderson for defamation in Iowa state court after he allegedly posted a picture depicting Heuton as a momma pig and the other plaintiffs as suckling piglets.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the Westfall Act, 28 USC 2679(d) (1994), the United States Attorney General removed the case to federal court, certifying that Anderson was a federal employee acting within the scope of his employment at the time that the offending picture was posted. The Attorney General then asserted that the United States had been substituted as party-defendant by operation of law and moved to dismiss the case. Following an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate agreed that Anderson's conduct, assuming that he indeed engaged in it, fell within the scope of his employment and recommended that the district court substitute the United States as party defendant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The district court rejected the magistrate's recommendation. Because Anderson denied posting the picture, the court found that neither he nor the United States could maintain that his conduct fell within the scope of his employment. The district court further found that if Anderson did in fact post the picture, his conduct was not within the scope of his employment. The court therefore refused to substitute the United States as party defendant and remanded the case to state court. The district court stayed the remand order pending this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1988, Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims Act ("FTCA") in order to undo the effect of the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Westfall v. Erwin</span>, 484 U.S. 292, 108 S. Ct. 580, 98 L. Ed.2d 619 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Westfall</span>, 484 U.S. at 297-98, 108 S. Ct. at 584-85, the Court held that a federal employee was immune from a state tort action only if the employee was acting within the scope of his employment <span class="Italic">and</span> the conduct that caused harm was discretionary. The 1988 FTCA amendments, commonly known as the Westfall Act, broaden this immunity, providing that an action against the United States is the only remedy for injuries caused by federal government employees acting within the scope of their employment, regardless of whether the conduct in question was discretionary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 2679(d)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Westfall Act also establishes a process frequently called Westfall certification. After a federal employee is sued in a state court, the Attorney General reviews the case to determine if the employee was acting within the scope of his employment when the allegedly harmful conduct occurred. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 2679(d)(2). If the Attorney General certifies that the employee was acting within the scope of his employment, the case is removed to federal court. The Attorney General then notifies the district court that the United States should be substituted as party defendant for the federal employee. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Westfall certification does not conclusively establish that the United States should be substituted as party defendant....&#8197;If the plaintiff contravenes a Westfall certificate, the district court must determine whether the defendant was acting within the scope of his employment when the conduct in question occurred<span class="Italic">. Martinez</span>, [515 U.S. 417, 115 S. Ct., 2227], 2236-37. If the court finds that the employee was acting outside of the scope of his employment, the court must refuse to substitute the United States. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Anderson maintains that the district court erroneously refused to substitute the United States. In refusing to do so, the district court relied upon <span class="Italic">Wood v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States</span>, 995 F.2d 1122 (1st Cir. 1993) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), which held that, because &#x00A7; 2679(d)(2) of the Westfall Act speaks of an "act" or "incident" that occurred "within the scope of employment," the district court must refuse to substitute the United States if the Attorney General "den[ies] the occurrence of the basic incident charged." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1121-26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect, we believe that the First Circuit's approach is contrary to the language of the Westfall Act. We agree with the dissenting judges in <span class="Italic">Wood</span>...that nothing in the Westfall Act gives the district court the authority to refuse to substitute the United States on the ground that either the government or the employee denies the offensive conduct....&#8197;[W]e believe that such a ruling undermines the purposes of the Westfall Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress adopted the Westfall Act to confer immunity on all federal employees acting within the scope of their employment. Because it is illogical to assume that Congress intended to protect guilty employees but desert innocent ones, we decline to follow the holding in <span class="Italic">Wood</span> that the immunity provided by the Westfall Act is available only when the defendant-employee admits engaging in the harmful conduct. Furthermore, the Westfall Act allows a defendant-employee to petition the district court for certification and substitution when the Attorney General decides not to certify a case, <span class="Italic">see</span> 28 USC 2679(d)(3), and we find it instructive that this section, unlike &#x00A7; 2679(d)(2), makes no reference to an "act" or "incident." We again find it implausible that Congress intended to confer greater protection on an employee whose conduct the Attorney General refuses to certify than on an employee whom the Attorney General deems deserving of immunity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of whether Anderson was acting within the scope of his employment is governed by Iowa law. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 949 F.2d at 1012, n.7. In <span class="Italic">Sandman v. Hogan</span>, 261 Iowa 560, 154 N.W.2d 113, 114 (1967), the Iowa Supreme Court held that an employee acts within the scope of his employment when his "conduct is of the same general nature as that authorized or incidental to the conduct authorized," by the employer...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that all the evidence in the record indicates that posting the picture was unquestionably prohibited by the USDA, but that does not mean that the act was necessarily outside of the scope of Anderson's employment. In fact, by prohibiting Anderson from posting insulting pictures of his subordinates, the USDA asserted the right to "direct the means and manner of doing the work," and "the right of control over the employee." Furthermore, <span class="Italic">Sandman</span> indicates that conduct "in excess of the powers actually conferred on the servant" may fall within the scope of the employee's employment if the "act is necessary to accomplish the purpose of the employment and is intended for such purpose."...&#8197;Determining whether unauthorized conduct falls within the scope of employment, therefore, involves a subjective inquiry into the employee's intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We believe that if Anderson posted the picture he could well have been acting within the scope of his employment under either <span class="Italic">Jones</span> or <span class="Italic">Sandman</span>. The USDA Supervisor's Personnel Handbook indicates that Anderson's duties included communicating with, evaluating, and disciplining the plaintiffs. At the evidentiary hearing before the magistrate, Anderson's supervisor, Dr. Dores Ross, testified that Anderson had previously informed the plaintiffs that their work was sub-par and that they needed to carry out their duties more diligently. Anderson was particular concerned that the plaintiffs were defying his orders to stop understaffing the meat inspection line, a practice that violated USDA guidelines. Although the precise message conveyed by the picture is unclear, images of pigs generally connote sloppiness or slothfulness. The picture could therefore have been a disciplinary measure or, alternatively, a means of communicating Anderson's official disapproval of the plaintiffs' performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, however, the trial court did not undertake the subjective inquiry necessary to determine whether Anderson was acting within the scope of his employment. Indeed, there was no finding even as to whether Anderson was responsible for posting the picture. In disputed cases such as this, we agree with the <span class="Italic">Wood</span> dissenters (and with other circuits) that the district court must conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine all the facts relevant to the immunity question. <span class="Italic">Wood</span>, 995 F.2d at 1134, 1138 (Coffin, dissenting); <span class="Italic">Kimbro</span>, 30 F.3d at 1509; <span class="Italic">Melo</span>, 13 F.3d at 747. The Attorney General's certification acts as <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence that Anderson's conduct was within the scope of his employment. Therefore, at the evidentiary hearing, the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that Anderson was not acting within the scope of his employment. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 949 F.2d at 1012.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the district court finds that Anderson did not post the picture, then he was at all times properly acting within his role as supervisor and he is entitled to have the United States substituted as party defendant. If it finds that he posted the picture to discipline the plaintiffs or comment officially on their performance, then his conduct, albeit improper, was "incidental to the conduct authorized" for supervisors, <span class="Italic">Sandman</span>, 154 N.W.2d at 114, and the court must also substitute the United States. In either instance, the case must be dismissed because the Federal Tort Claims Act precludes suits against the United States for defamation. 28 USC 2680(h). If, on the other hand, the court finds that Anderson posted the picture for reasons unrelated to a desire to do his job as the plaintiffs' supervisor, then it must decide whether it ought to remand the case to state court or proceed to try the matter itself....</p>
