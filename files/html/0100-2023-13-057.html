<h2 class="h2" id="sec5-58"><span class="space">VIII.</span> APPROPRIATE ARRANGEMENTS</h2>
<p class="noindent">As a general proposition, a proposal does not operate as a negotiable procedure if it directly interferes with the right of the agency to assign work, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 26 and IRS, Atlanta Dist.</span>, 22 FLRA 314, 326 (1986), but 5 USC 7106(b)(3) states that nothing in the section shall preclude any agency and labor organization from negotiating appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under the section by management officials. Bargaining over arrangements avoids the extreme restriction over negotiable subjects that would occur if the management right to assign work was read in a "categorically broad way." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">INS v. FLRA</span>, 4 F.3d 268, 272 n.7 (4th Cir. 1993). Yet limitations remain on arrangements bargaining. "Section 7106(b)(3) does not make negotiable a matter that is inconsistent with law." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1931 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Weapons Station, Concord</span>, 32 FLRA 1023, 1068 (1988) (Provision 36); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1655 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Dept. of Military Affairs, Illinois Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 35 FLRA 740, 750 (1990) (Proposal 4 (involving cleanup time: "Section 7106(b)(3) does not make negotiable a matter that is inconsistent with law"). If an agency is compelled to take action by law, rather than through its discretion, proposals will not be considered under an arrangements test. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC, Newington</span>, 37 FLRA 500, 511 (1990) (statutory debt collection procedures). A proposal that "precludes an agency from exercising a management right inherently cannot constitute an appropriate arrangement." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. And NTEU</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 314 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l VA Council and VA</span>, 40 FLRA 1052, 1056 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury</span>). A significant limitation on arrangements bargaining was described in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-87 and Kansas Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (referred to throughout this <span class="Italic">Guide</span> as <span class="Italic">KANG</span>): a proposed arrangement is not negotiable if it excessively interferes with a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent">Arrangements bargaining is responsive. An arrangement is to meet the effect of the exercise of a management right. Under <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 45 FLRA 1256 (1992), negotiations for benefits could not be dubbed arrangements bargaining. A proposal does not become a negotiable arrangement by seeking a benefit unless an initial exercise of management discretion creates a need for that benefit to balance the adverse impact. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prison Locals, Local 3974 and DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, FCI McKean</span>, 48 FLRA 225, 230-31 (1993) (proposal for priority consideration of inside candidates for vacancies). The exercise of a management right may lead to a proper proposal for an arrangement that can lead to a financial benefit. Arrangements can include monetary relief. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and POPA</span>, 65 FLRA 290, 296 (2010) (set aside based on collateral estoppel in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO v. FLRA</span>, 672 F.3d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 2012)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[V]arious forms of monetary relief can constitute appropriate arrangements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NATCA</span>, 61 FLRA 437, 440-41 (2006) (proposal requiring compensation to employees whose promotions are delayed by management assignment of training); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1827</span>, 58 FLRA 344, 346-47 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring in part and Member Armendariz dissenting in part) (voluntary separation incentive payments).</p>

<p class="noindent">A straightforward statement of FLRA's criteria for evaluating proposals advanced as appropriate arrangements is provided by <span class="Italic">NTEU and PTO</span>, 53 FLRA 539, 545-46 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The approach for determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under section 7106(b)(3) is set out in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87</span> <span class="Italic">and Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under that approach, the Authority initially determines whether the proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. An arrangement must seek to mitigate adverse effects "flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992)....&#8197;The adverse effect need not flow from the management right that a given proposal affects. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 243 and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office</span>, 49 FLRA 176, 184 (1994) (Member Armendariz concurring in part and dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">PTO</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently "tailored" to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's right(s). <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>. As the Authority reaffirmed, relying on <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior, Minerals Management</span> <span class="Italic">Service, New Orleans, Louisiana </span>v. FLRA, 969 F.2d 1158, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Minerals Management Service</span>), section 7106(b)(3) brings within the duty to bargain proposals that provide "balm" to be administered "only to hurts arising from" the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">Immigration and</span> <span class="Italic">Naturalization Service</span>, 51 FLRA at 1319. That section of the Statute does not bring within the duty to bargain proposals that are so broad in their sweep that the "balm" would be applied to employees indiscriminately without regard to whether the group as a whole is likely to suffer, or has suffered, adverse effects as a consequence of management action under section 7106. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">PTO</span>, 49 FLRA at 184.</p>

In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The negotiation of arrangements clauses has become particularly important when FLRA applies a policy of enforcing arbitrators' awards applying arrangements negotiated by the parties without further analysis of management rights defenses unless the clauses abrogate rather than excessively interfere with the exercise of a management right. If the agency does not properly advance its management rights defenses to proposals in negotiations, it forfeits considerable protection of those rights when the negotiated arrangement is interpreted and applied in arbitration and then subject to limited FLRA review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Lewisburg and AFGE Council of Prisons Locals, Local 148</span>, 39 FLRA 1288, 1300 (1991) ("When an agency contends that an arbitrator's award enforcing a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement is contrary to section 7106(a), we will examine the provision enforced by the arbitrator to determine: (1) if it constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights; and (2) if, as interpreted by the arbitrator, it abrogates the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.,</span> 37 FLRA at 313-314."); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. And NTEU</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 314 (1990) ("We will examine the award for abrogation because an award that abrogates, that is, precludes an agency from exercising, a management right inherently cannot constitute an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3)....&#8197;Consequently, such an award is contrary to law and is deficient under section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute. Of course, if a contractual provision abrogates management's rights, any award enforcing that provision would also abrogate those rights and therefore would be contrary to law."). When FLRA reviews an arbitration award enforcing an arrangements provisions under an "excessive interference" standard, then management is permitted to engage in traditional negotiability arguments during the exceptions process. [The association between arbitration awards and management rights principles is explored at greater length in <a href="0100-2023-17-001.html#sec9-1">Chapter 9</a>, "Review of Arbitration Awards."]</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_580"></span>A proposal that infringes on a management right, e.g., determination of the technology to do work, may be negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) if it would not excessively interfere with management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-13-058.html#sec5-59">Excessive Interference</a>."] To apply that standard, FLRA considers whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its rights. To reach that determination, the union must offer support for its assertion by providing information concerning the nature and extent of the adverse effects, if any, on employees that might follow from the action of management. The record must also contain information addressing how the proposal ameliorates those adverse effects. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 229 and DHHS</span>, 22 FLRA 698, 700 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3509 and DHHS, SSA, Greenwood</span>, 46 FLRA 1590, 1623 (1993) (Proposal 26) ("It is not otherwise apparent to us how this proposal addresses or compensates for the adverse effects that the Union claims flow from that action."). Typical arrangements are provisions requiring an agency to exercise its management rights fairly and equitably. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Duluth and AFGE Local 3935</span>, 65 FLRA 588, 591 (2011) (reviewing arbitration award).</p>
<p class="noindent">The union may not rely on generalized statements that employees will be adversely affected by agency changes in working conditions without further explanation or elaboration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2062 and VA, New Orleans Reg'l Office</span>, 39 FLRA 857, 860 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2015 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv.</span>, 53 FLRA 967, 974 (1997) (rejecting arrangements argument because record did not establish how it was reasonably foreseeable that unit employees would be downgraded when agency established certain positions). The record must reflect the union's claim that the proposal is an appropriate arrangement. FLRA will not apply the test without a request from the union. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2663 and VAMC, Kansas City</span>, 31 FLRA 988, 990 (1988). It is insufficient to obtain FLRA review of the appropriate arrangements implications of a proposal for the union to make passing mention as to the lack of "excessive interference" of the proposal. Arrangements arguments must be properly developed. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1655 and DOD, Dept. of Military Affairs, Illinois NG</span>, 36 FLRA 75, 80 (1990). But the claim to negotiability based on an appropriate arrangements argument may be raised somewhat belatedly, for example, in response to the agency's statement of position. <span class="Italic">Portsmouth FEMTC and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span>, 34 FLRA 1150, 1158 n.2 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and NRC</span>, 43 FLRA 1279, 1281 (1992) (considering arrangements argument initially advanced by union in response to agency statement of position).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA considered a proposal under an arrangements theory, although that theory was not raised by the union, when the proposal was substantially the same as a proposal approved as an arrangement in another case. That approach is taken to "avoid the anomaly of conflicting results in similar cases." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Carson</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 168 (1993) (Proposal 13: "The Union does not specifically assert that the first and second disputed sentences of Proposal 13 are appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. However, as the two sentences are substantially similar to Proposal 5 in <span class="Italic">Portsmouth</span>, we will consider the issue in order to avoid the anomaly of conflicting results in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span>, 46 FLRA at 706."); <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 46 FLRA 696, 706 (1992) (although union did not advance arrangements theory to support negotiability of its proposal, FLRA did so to avoid "the anomaly of conflicting results in similar cases").

<p class="noindent">For the arrangements test to be applied, the union must demonstrate how the proposal relates to only adverse effects produced by the exercise of management rights. General proposals that would improve employee opportunities for advancement will not likely be found negotiable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2317 and Marine Corps Logistics Base, Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality, Albany</span>, 29 FLRA 1587, 1602 (1987). The ultimate effect of the proposed arrangement need not be precisely stated. It is sufficient to propose that management take every reasonable effort or attempt certain actions to ameliorate the effects of the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tidewater Va. FEMTC and Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth</span>, 42 FLRA 845, 855 (1991). But if it is not obvious or explained to FLRA how the proposal operates as an appropriate arrangement, FLRA will not make a determination of negotiability of the purported arrangement. <span class="Italic">Coordinating Comm. Of Unions and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing</span>, 29 FLRA 1436, 1446 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">Statutory constraints may trump arrangements bargaining. FLRA declined to approve the negotiability of an arrangement, involving a proposal for an alternative to special pay rates, necessitated by operation of statute rather than by the exercise of management rights in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and POPA</span>, 60 FLRA 839, 841-43 (2005), reviewing an arbitration award (although a substantially similar arrangement was later found negotiable in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and POPA</span>, 65 FLRA 290 (2010), <span class="Italic">post</span>, set aside by reason of collateral estoppel,<span class="Italic"> Dept. of Commerce, PTO v. FLRA</span>, 672 F.3d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 2012)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to management's right to retain employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. The Authority reviews questions of law <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv. V.</span> FLRA, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying a standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority determines whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that determination, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving whether an arbitrator's award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority first determines whether the award affects management's rights. <span class="Italic">See United States Small Bus. Admin.</span>, 55 FLRA 179, 184 (1999). If the award affects management's rights, then the Authority applies the two-prong test established in the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 146 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>), which is set forth in section IV.B. below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Effect on management's right</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to retain employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) is "the right to establish policies or practices that encourage or discourage employees from remaining employed by an agency." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1827</span>, 58 FLRA 344, 346 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring in part and Member Armendariz dissenting in part on other grounds). Further, "management's rights under [&#x00A7;] 7106 include the right to refrain from acting as well as the right to act." <span class="Italic">United States EPA</span>, 38 FLRA 1328, 1330 (1991) (citation omitted). <span class="Italic">Accord, e.g., NFFE, Local 2192</span>, 59 FLRA 868, 870 (2004) (citation omitted) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting in part on other grounds) (right to assign work encompasses right to refrain from assigning work). Thus, management's right to retain employees includes, as relevant here, the right to refrain from establishing policies that encourage employees to remain employed by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Special rates are, by law, a means to ameliorate recruitment and retention problems. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 530.303(a) ("OPM may increase the minimum rates otherwise payable under the pay schedules...to the extent it considers necessary to overcome existing or likely significant handicaps in the recruitment or retention of well-qualified personnel....") Additionally, the Arbitrator found that the negotiations that resulted in Section A.2 of the MA were prompted by concerns regarding recruitment and retention. Further, the Arbitrator found that the second sentence of Section A.2 was intended to address the adverse effect of special rate erosion by providing a monetary alternative to a special rate increase in the event that OPM denied the request for such an increase. Thus, Section A.2 was intended to be, as relevant here, a means to encourage special rate employees to remain employed by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award directs the Agency to engage in good faith discussions required by the second sentence of Section A.2. As interpreted by the Arbitrator, the second sentence of Section A.2 effectively requires the Agency to agree to an alternative to a special rate increase if the parties are able to devise a lawful alternative and if the Agency has sufficient funds to provide that alternative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As special rates are a means to encourage retention of employees, and as the award effectively requires the Agency to agree to an alternative to special rates, the award effectively requires the Agency (with the limited conditions discussed above) to agree to provide compensation that will encourage special rate employees to remain employed by the Agency. Accordingly, we find that the award affects management's right to retain employees, and we apply the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;BEP</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. 53 FLRA at 153. If it does, then under prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the Authority examines whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 154.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying prong I, it is undisputed that the Arbitrator was enforcing the parties' agreement, not an applicable law. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine whether the second sentence of Section A.2 of the MA was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. As the only subsection of &#x00A7; 7106(b) raised by the Union is &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, we address only that subsection. <span class="Italic">See NLRB</span>, 60 FLRA 576, 579-80 (2005) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring and Member Pope dissenting in part on other grounds) (Authority addressed only subsections of &#x00A7; 7106(b) raised by union). <span class="Italic">Cf. United States Dep't of the Army, Corps of Eng'rs, N.W. Div. &#x0026; Portland Dist.</span>, 60 FLRA 595, 597 (2005) (citation omitted) (Authority declined to address whether provision was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) where union did not raise &#x00A7; 7106(b)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a contract provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority first determines whether the provision is an arrangement. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA 978, 981 (2004). An arrangement must seek to mitigate adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, R.I. Chapter</span>, 55 FLRA 420, 426 (1999). The claimed arrangement must also <span id="page_581"></span>be sufficiently "tailored" to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of such right. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In this regard, &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) brings within the duty to bargain proposals and provisions that provide "balm" to be administered "only to hurts arising from" the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citation omitted). If the provision is an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right. [n3] <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA at 981. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the provision against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed previously, the Arbitrator found that the second sentence of Section A.2 effectively requires the Agency to provide an alternative to special pay rates, as long as the alternative is lawful and the Agency has sufficient funds to provide it. The Arbitrator also found that Section A.2 was intended to address the adverse effect of special rate erosion that would occur over time as non-special rate employees received locality pay increases. This adverse effect does not result from the exercise of any management right, but by the operation of law, specifically, the fact that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.606, special rate employees are not permitted to receive locality pay adjustments. Accordingly, Section A.2, as interpreted and enforced by the Arbitrator, ameliorates adverse effects that result from the operation of law, not the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that Section A.2 is an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the decision to eliminate paper files and to include a customer service element in the performance plans. Specifically, the Union asserts that elimination of the paper files adversely affects employees by requiring them to "spend virtually their entire work day tethered to a computer screen[,]" that computer images of patents are "inferior to" paper copies, that there are problems with conducting "key word" searches of old patents on computers, and that computer patents do not include "examiners' notes" that were in paper patents and which "facilitated the patent search" for examiners.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator found that the Agency was generally concerned during negotiations about eliminating paper files and improving customer service, the Arbitrator made no findings that the second sentence of Section A.2 was intended to ameliorate the alleged adverse effects cited by the Union. Additionally, there is no basis in the wording of the second sentence of Section A.2 to support such a conclusion. Further, although the Union cites hearing testimony asserting the adverse effects of eliminating paper files, the Union provides no evidence that the second sentence of Section A.2 was intended to ameliorate such adverse effects. For these reasons, we reject the Union's claim as unsupported.</p>
<p class="noindent">Employing a different analysis to address the situation of negotiation of a contract provision that provided a salary adjustment that the parties agreed to seek, but that OPM would not approve, as to a special statutory pay rate for patent examiners, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and POPA</span>, 65 FLRA 290, 291 (2010) (set aside by reason of collateral estoppel,<span class="Italic"> Dept. of Commerce, PTO v. FLRA</span>, 672 F.3d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 2012), <span class="Italic">post</span>), determined to be negotiable and enforceable in the context of arbitration a contract provision that required the parties to attempt to negotiate the adjustment desired for the employees. The issues before the arbitrator included these questions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Whether the [Agency] violated [&#x00A7;] A.2 of the [MA] when it refused to request OPM approval to increase the special pay schedule to maintain the 10% and 15% salary differentials following the increase in locality pay received by [GS] employees in the Washington, D.C. [area] in January 2003?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Whether the [Agency] violated [&#x00A7;] A.2 of the [MA] when it refused to engage in discussions to provide a substantially equivalent alternative following the increase in locality pay received by [GS] employees in the Washington, D.C. [area] in January 2003?</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA considered the negotiability objections posed to the contract article and pay adjustment mechanism described in the second <span class="Italic">PTO</span> issue, <span class="Italic">id.</span> At 295-96:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the arbitrator's determination in <span class="Italic">PTO I</span>, the Arbitrator in this case expressly determined that &#x00A7; A, including &#x00A7; A.2, constitutes an arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Award at 26. Although the Agency argues that the decision in <span class="Italic">PTO I </span>precluded the Arbitrator from making this determination, the Authority has acknowledged that the enforceability of a contract provision depends on the particular circumstances of each case. In this connection, the Authority has held that if a particular arbitrator's interpretation of a contract provision is inconsistent with a management right, then the award will be set aside, but "the contractual provision, susceptible to a different and sustainable interpretation by a different arbitrator, will not be affected." <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv.</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 314 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs Serv</span>.). <span class="Italic">Cf. NTEU</span>, 45 FLRA 1256, 1262 (1992) (in negotiability decision, Authority noted that union failed to demonstrate adverse effects and, "without addressing whether the Authority would conclude differently in another case," found that the provision was not an arrangement). As the Arbitrator was presented with different facts and arguments than were presented in <span class="Italic">PTO I</span>, we find that <span class="Italic">PTO I </span>did not preclude the Arbitrator from finding that &#x00A7; A is an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator erred on the merits in finding &#x00A7; A to be an appropriate arrangement, the Arbitrator found that the entire subject of special pay was negotiated "to provide a 'balm' to the Union which would ameliorate the adverse effects upon employees" of "the Agency's desire to exercise its management rights regarding the elimination of paper files[,]" among other things. Although the Arbitrator did not specify what management rights the Agency was exercising when it reduced the paper search files, the Authority previously has held, based on this Agency's undisputed assertions, that the Agency's determination to use a computerized patent-search system, rather than paper files, involved an exercise of the right to determine the methods and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See POPA</span>, 56 FLRA 69, 69, 87-91 (2000). Thus, Authority precedent supports the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agency's reduction of paper search files constituted the exercise of a management right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Council 215</span>, 60 FLRA 461, 464 (2004) (where arbitrator did not explain finding that agreement affected management rights, Authority relied on precedent to uphold finding). With regard to the Arbitrator's finding that the exercise of management's right adversely affected employees, before the Arbitrator, the Union submitted evidence regarding how the reduction of paper search files adversely affected employees. <span class="Italic">See </span>Opp'n, Attach., Tr. At 52, 67, 71-73, 160, 163-69, 173-74 (testimony that electronic versions were more difficult to read than paper files, did not contain helpful notes that paper files contained, and slowed down examiners' work in at least some instances). Accordingly, based on Authority precedent and the record in this case, we find that, by adopting the Union's position that the reduction in paper files adversely affected employees, the Arbitrator implicitly credited the Union's evidence of adverse effects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the management right affected by the award (the right to retain employees) is a right different from the management right that adversely affected employees (the right to determine the methods and means of performing work). However, the Authority has stated that, in determining whether a proposal or provision is an appropriate arrangement, "[t]he adverse effect...need not flow from the management right that a given proposal [or provision] affects." <span class="Italic">Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge # 1F</span>, 57 FLRA 373, 381 (2001). In addition, the Authority previously held that various forms of monetary relief can constitute appropriate arrangements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NATCA</span>, 61 FLRA 437, 440-41 (2006) (proposal requiring compensation to employees whose promotions are delayed by management assignment of training); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1827</span>, 58 FLRA 344, 346-47 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring in part and Member Armendariz dissenting in part) (voluntary separation incentive payments). Thus, the fact that the "balm" provided by &#x00A7; A is a potential increase in compensation does not demonstrate that the Arbitrator erred by finding &#x00A7; A to be an appropriate arrangement. Finally, with regard to the Agency's claim that &#x00A7; A is not sufficiently tailored to constitute an appropriate arrangement, the Authority does not apply a tailoring analysis in the arbitration context. <span class="Italic">See EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 116. Thus, the Agency's claim does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">Before the doctrine of collateral estoppel can be applied, it must be demonstrated that: (1) the same issue was involved in both cases; (2) that issue was litigated in the first case; (3) resolving it was necessary to the decision in the first case; (4) the decision in the first case, on the issue to be precluded, was final; and (5) the party attempting to raise the issue in the second case was fully represented in the first case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Energy W. Area Power Admin., Golden, Colo.,</span> 56 F.L.R.A. 9, 11 (2000) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Ill.,</span> 35 F.L.R.A. 978, 982 (1990)). If all five elements are met, the Authority is bound by its findings in the earlier case. <span class="Italic">See Scott Air Force Base,</span> 35 F.L.R.A. at 981. All five are met here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the first and second elements, in each proceeding the parties litigated the issue whether section A.2 constituted an appropriate arrangement or, more fundamentally, whether it constituted an arrangement at all. In <span class="Italic">Award I</span>, Arbitrator Evans "found that Section A.2 was intended to address the adverse effect of special rate erosion that would occur over time as non-special rate employees received locality pay increases." <span class="Italic">PTO I,</span> 60 F.L.R.A. at 842 (citing <span class="Italic">Award I</span> at 12). The Authority upheld this finding of intent but concluded that section A.2 was not--<span id="page_582"></span>indeed, could not--be an "arrangement" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) because it "ameliorate[d] adverse effects that result from the operation of law, not the exercise of a management right." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Award II</span>, Arbitrator Arrigo addressed the same issue, reaching a contrary conclusion. Recognizing that "'the essential facts and circumstances' in the case before him were 'substantially identical' to those found by the Authority in <span class="Italic">PTO I</span>," he therefore "found, in accordance with that decision, that &#x00A7; A.2 of the [Millennium Agreement] affected management's right to retain employees." <span class="Italic">PTO II,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 292 (quoting <span class="Italic">Award II</span> at 24-25). He nonetheless found that section A.2 was indeed an arrangement because "'the entirety of [&#x00A7;] A,' including &#x00A7; A.2, 'was negotiated as a <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> for the elimination of paper patents and the addition of customer service duties for employees'[--]two changes desired by the Agency and opposed by the Union." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Award II</span> at 24) (bracketed material deleted). In <span class="Italic">PTO II,</span> the Authority upheld this determination notwithstanding it had rejected the very same finding in <span class="Italic">PTO I</span> "as unsupported." 60 F.L.R.A. at 842-43. In short, despite contrary outcomes, the two FLRA decisions involved the same issue--namely, whether section A.2 constitutes an (appropriate) arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA contends the two cases did not involve the same issue because they involved different arbitrators interpreting section A.2 in different awards under different circumstances. According to the Authority, one arbitrator's interpretation of a contract provision should not be binding on a subsequent arbitrator's interpretation in a different proceeding. But it is not <span class="Italic">Arbitrator Evans's interpretation</span> in <span class="Italic">Award I</span> that is binding here--rather, it is <span class="Italic">the Authority's legal conclusion</span> in <span class="Italic">PTO I</span> that section A.2 does not qualify as an appropriate arrangement because it "ameliorates adverse effects that result from the operation of law, not the exercise of a management right." 60 F.L.R.A. at 842; <span class="Italic">see Scott Air Force Base,</span> 35 F.L.R.A. at 981 (on exceptions from arbitrator decision, "Authority is bound by its finding" in previous decision reviewing administrative law judge's unfair labor practice decision); ("The Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">PTO I</span> set aside the First Award as contrary to law...."). The force of the Authority's conclusion applies no less to the facts in <span class="Italic">PTO II </span>as to those in <span class="Italic">PTO I.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority further attempts to distinguish the cases by asserting that <span class="Italic">PTO I </span>involved a violation of section A.2's second sentence while <span class="Italic">PTO II </span>found a breach only of its first sentence only. <span class="Italic">PTO I,</span> however, made no distinction between the intent behind the first and the second sentences, stating: "Section A.2, as interpreted and enforced by the Arbitrator, ameliorates adverse effects that result from the operation of law, not the exercise of a management right." 60 F.L.R.A. at 842. Moreover, we do not see how the two intertwined sentences can be viewed in isolation from each other (or assigned different purposes) inasmuch as they operate together, in sequence, to offset the annual pay erosion resulting from "the fact that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.606, special rate employees are not permitted to receive locality pay adjustments," 60 F.L.R.A. at 842; <span class="Italic">see also Award I</span> at 12 ("Section A.2 set up a two-track process to deal with the potential of locality pay erosion. The first track is set forth in the first sentence of Section A.2. It requires PTO to submit a request to OPM for a special pay rate adjustment to keep-up with the locality pay awarded in the Washington, DC metropolitan area to GS employees. If that failed, which happened here, the parties ultimately agreed to go down a second track to find an alternative way to make-up for locality pay erosion (for 5 years)."). Thus, the "arrangement" issue was both involved and litigated in each proceeding.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;POPA argues the appropriate arrangement issue was not "litigated" in the first proceeding, asserting: "In <span class="Italic">PTO I</span>, Arbitrator Evans did <span class="Italic">not</span> address the issue of whether the [Millennium Agreement], or any part of it, was intended as an 'appropriate arrangement' within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). It simply was not an issue in the first arbitration case." The issue was thoroughly addressed, however, on review before the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third through fifth collateral estoppel elements are plainly satisfied: In <span class="Italic">PTO I,</span> the resolution of the "arrangement" issue was necessary in order to decide whether section A.2 was an appropriate arrangement so as to be enforceable under section 7106(b)(3) notwithstanding it affected the management right to retain employees; <span class="Italic">PTO I </span>was a final FLRA decision which was judicially unreviewable, <span class="Italic">see Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n v. FLRA,</span> 180 F. App'x 176 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (dismissing petition for review for lack of jurisdiction because "FLRA decision reviewing an arbitration award is statutorily foreclosed 'unless the order involves an unfair labor practice under section 711[6].'" (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1))); <span class="Italic">see also Scott Air Force Base,</span> 35 F.L.R.A. at 983 ("[U]nless and until a Federal court of appeals denies enforcement to a decision of the Authority, that decision must be treated as a final adjudicatory action."); and POPA and PTO were fully represented by counsel throughout each proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject Intervenor POPA's claim that the court lacks jurisdiction to address the collateral estoppel claim because PTO failed to raise it before the Authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 7123I ("No objection [*19] that has not been urged before the Authority, or its designee, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances."). Unlike our concurring colleague, we do not find it "questionable" whether PTO adequately raised the objection below. While it did not use the magic words "collateral estoppel," PTO nonetheless argued the substance of a collateral estoppel defense in its exceptions to <span class="Italic">Award II</span>. There, it cited <span class="Italic">PTO I </span>as "binding Authority precedent," in which "[t]he Authority has already determined that Section (A)(2) of the Millennium Agreement is not an arrangement" because it "'ameliorates adverse effects that result from the operation of law, not the exercise of a management right.'" The Authority understood this argument to implicate collateral estoppel. <span class="Italic">See PTO II,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 295 n.5 (rejecting argument "Arbitrator was collaterally estopped from finding &#x00A7; A.2 to be an appropriate arrangement" "[t]o the extent that the Agency's exceptions can be construed as [so] arguing"); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 301 (Member Beck, dissenting in part) ("[T]he arbitral proceedings and the Agency's exceptions are rife with collateral estoppel implications. Both parties and the Arbitrator recognized the implications of the Authority's prior decision and the Agency addressed the impact of that decision throughout its exceptions." (internal citations omitted)). We do as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that POPA was estopped from arguing section A.2 is an appropriate arrangement intended to lessen the adverse effects from the elimination of paper files and addition of customer service duties and that the Authority should have so held.[7] Accordingly, we grant PTO's petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;We see no reason to deviate, as our concurring colleague suggests, from the general rule that "a valid and final adjudicative determination by an administrative tribunal has the same effects under the rules of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, subject to the same exceptions and qualifications, as a judgment of a court." Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#x00A7; 83(1). It is true that that the rules are "'applied more flexibly to administrative adjudications than to judicial proceedings,'" Concurrence at 8-9 (quoting <span class="Italic">Clark-Cowlitz Joint Operating Agency v. FERC,</span> 826 F.2d 1074, 1080-81 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>))--to take into account that "an ambiguous or broadly worded statute may admit of more than one interpretation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 1080-81 n.5--but the rules nonetheless are applied. And this case involves no administrative peculiarity requiring that they be modified. Nor does this case suffer from the flaw--fatal in <span class="Italic">Clark-Cowlitz</span> that the party asserting preclusion (a losing power plant license applicant) was not a losing party in the earlier proceeding on which preclusion was premised. Rather, the applicant and the Commission had been "fellow travelers" on the prevailing side of the earlier proceeding. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 1080. Accordingly, the purpose underlying preclusion--which is "meant to provide an affirmative defense that one party to a prior proceeding may raise against another party that took an adverse position in that proceeding" and "to prevent parties from rearguing issues they have already lost," <span class="Italic">id</span>. At 1080 n.5--would not have been served. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Here, by contrast, the POPA sought to relitigate in <span class="Italic">PTO II </span>the issue it had lost in <span class="Italic">PTO I</span>. We thus face the classic issue preclusion scenario.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nothing in &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) requires that every unit employee be adversely affected by the exercise of a management right in order for a proposal to constitute an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, HCFA, Baltimore</span>, 44 FLRA 1405, 1461 (1992) (Proposal 15). It may be difficult to discern when or what management action adversely affects employees in a manner sufficient to trigger arrangements bargaining. Some effects will be obvious, e.g., announcement that a RIF will occur. Some effects are less well defined, as, for example, changes in performance standards. In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 26 FLRA 612, 615 (1987), discussing proposals involving performance appraisal, FLRA determined to be negotiable as an appropriate arrangement a proposal that employees be granted two hours to set up their desks and rearrange their work patterns for a new training assignment. The adverse effect was indirect: if the time sought was not granted, the employees' production would be adversely affected; they would have to devote production time to the tasks of rearranging their desks. If employees were measured for productivity on the basis of time that included rearrangement of their desks, the measurement of work performance would be inaccurate and detrimental. In a somewhat opaque holding, bearing on a proposal for limited duty assignments rather than use of leave for sick or injured employees given medical approval to return to work, FLRA attempted to distinguish degrees of potential and actual adverse impact required to trigger the appropriate arrangements test, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1625 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Air Station, Oceana</span>, 30 FLRA 1105, 1126 (1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, this provision does not address an adverse effect which results from the exercise of management's right to assign work. Rather, the proposal precludes the assignment of certain duties on the assumption that if they were assigned, there would be an adverse effect. That is, the proposal eliminates the <span class="Italic">possibility</span> of an adverse effect by precluding the Agency from exercising its right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">NFFE and Dept. of Navy, Naval Facilities Eng'g Command, W. Div.</span>, 36 FLRA 834, 839-41 (1990), as to proposals designed to eliminate the possibility of <span id="page_583"></span>adverse effects, FLRA announced it would consider those proposals as long as they addressed other than purely speculative or hypothetical concerns. Appeals would be considered on the basis of the circumstances presented if an adverse effect was reasonably foreseeable.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is up to management to challenge, or risk waiving objection to, a proposal advanced as an arrangement, <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 66 FLRA 213, 216 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Union's claims that the proposals are appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), to determine whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement, the Authority first considers whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">E.g., NATCA, Local ZHU</span>, 65 FLRA 738, 739-40 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Local ZHU</span>). The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>At 740. If the Authority finds the proposal to be an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an agency does not dispute that a proposal is an arrangement, the Authority will find that the agency concedes that the proposal constitutes an arrangement. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>At 739-40. Consistent with this precedent, as the Agency does not dispute that the Proposals 1 through 5 are arrangements, we find that the proposals constitute arrangements. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>At 740 (citing &#x00A7; 2424.32I(ii)(2)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the arrangements are appropriate, when an agency does not contest that a proposal is "appropriate," the Authority has weighed a proposal's demonstrated benefits "against the absence of asserted or demonstrated burdens" to find that the proposal was an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Here, the Union asserts that the proposals would benefit employees by mitigating the potential adverse effect on employees as a result of the implementation of the random audits process in those instances that are beyond an employee's ability to perceive. By contrast, the Agency does not contest that the proposals are "appropriate." Consistent with <span class="Italic">Local ZHU</span>, weighing the demonstrated benefits to employees against the absence of asserted or demonstrated burdens on management's rights, we find that Proposals 1 through 5 are appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Based on the foregoing, as the Agency argues that Proposals 1, 2, and 5 are outside the duty to bargain solely on management rights grounds, we find that Proposals 1, 2, and 5 are within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA draws some arguably arbitrary limits on arrangements bargaining. One notable limit is its refusal to entertain arrangements bargaining on proposals requiring alteration of performance standards. In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 26 FLRA 612, 615-16 (1987), FLRA ruled nonnegotiable as an arrangement a proposal that employees suffer no adverse impact for failing to follow any aspect of procedures in a training memo "when the circumstances are outside their control." The adverse impact on employees, adjusting to new situations without adequate guidance and the possibility of adverse effect on their performance evaluation, was not negotiable because it required an adjustment in performance standards. Relying on <span class="Italic">POPA and PTO</span>, 25 FLRA 384 (1987), FLRA declared that management's exercise of the right to assign work does not open up to negotiation a matter--the content of performance standards--otherwise outside the duty to bargain. A proposal purporting to be an appropriate arrangement may not impose substantive limitations on a management right "in and of itself." <span class="Italic">ACT, Wisconsin Chap. And Wisconsin Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 26 FLRA 682, 688 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1167 and Dept. of Air Force, 31st Combat Support Group, Homestead AFB</span>, 6 FLRA 577 (1981)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Other problems complicate characterization of what constitute appropriate arrangements. A proposal limiting the size of a competitive area could not be an appropriate arrangement because it interfered with the rights of nonunit employees and not because it interfered with an enumerated management right. <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l GSA Council, Local 1497 and GSA Region 3</span>, 24 FLRA 928, 930 (1986). If a proposal conflicts with a government-wide regulation, it is not negotiable, even if it could otherwise be said to involve a negotiable arrangement. <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l GSA Council, Local 1497 and GSA Region 3</span>, 24 FLRA 928 (1986) (repromotion rights); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097 and DOJ, Justice Mgmt. Div.</span>, 42 FLRA 412, 495 (1991) (Proposal 42 regarding "reasonable accommodation" for illegal drug users). But FLRA considered negotiability under the appropriate arrangements test (and rejected under an excessive interference analysis) after concluding a proposal violated a government-wide regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1458 and DOJ, U.S. Attorney, S. Dist. Of Florida</span>, 29 FLRA 3, 45 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">The union may not request that a segment of a proposal be considered as an arrangement if that segment is not readily severable from the remainder of the proposal. According to <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1409 and Dept. of Army, Aberdeen Proving Ground Support Activity</span>, 38 FLRA 747, 753-54 (1990), involving the issue of whether designation of "the commander" to perform a task concerning the performance award program violated management rights to assign work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We read the Union's arguments concerning the applicability of section 7106(b)(3) as applying to the proposal as a whole as opposed to singling out the phrase "at the Commander's discretion" as constituting, in and of itself, an appropriate arrangement. Moreover, a deletion of that phrase from the proposal would have no impact on the Union's stated purpose of establishing a procedure for recognizing and rewarding employees and providing consistency and equity to the awards program. Consequently, we do not construe the Union's arguments as presenting the question of whether the phrase "at the Commander's discretion," by itself, constitutes an appropriate arrangement....</p>
