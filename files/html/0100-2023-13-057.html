<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-58"><span class="space">d.</span> Time Pressure</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">As with resignations and downgradings, otherwise voluntary retirements may be viewed as coerced if management insists that decisions be made with undue haste. The Federal Circuit offered an analysis encompassing the element of coerced retirement, as well as the right to a hearing on the allegedly coerced retirement, in <span class="Italic">Staats v. USPS</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1123-27 (Fed. Cir. 1996), involving the timing of a retirement decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The governing background principles are these: A decision to resign or retire is presumed to be voluntary, and an employee who voluntarily retires has no right to appeal to the Board; the Board assumes jurisdiction over an appeal by an employee who has resigned or retired only if the employee shows that his resignation or retirement was involuntary and thus tantamount to forced removal<span class="Italic">. See Mueller v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States Postal Serv.,</span> 76 F.3d 1198, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Braun v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 50 F.3d 1005, 1007 (Fed. Cir. 1995). In order to overcome the presumption of voluntariness and demonstrate that a resignation or retirement was involuntary, the employee must satisfy a demanding legal standard. The two principal grounds on which employees have sought to show that their resignations or retirements were involuntary are: (1) that the resignation or retirement was the product of misinformation or deception by the agency, <span class="Italic">see Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984); and (2) that the resignation or retirement was the product of coercion by the agency, <span class="Italic">see Dumas v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 789 F.2d 892, 894 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish involuntariness on the basis of coercion, an employee must show that the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's resignation or retirement, that the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire, and that the employee's resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency. <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Roskos v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 213 Ct. Cl. 34, 549 F.2d 1386, 1389-90 (1977). An example of an involuntary resignation based on coercion is a resignation that is induced by a threat to take disciplinary action that the agency knows could not be substantiated. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Schultz</span> <span class="Italic">v. United States Navy,</span> 810 F.2d at 1136; <span class="Italic">Cosby v. United States</span>, 189 Ct. Cl. 528, 417 F.2d 1345, 1355 (1969); <span class="Italic">Autera v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 182 Ct. Cl. 495, 389 F.2d 815, 817 (1968). The Board has also found retirements or resignations to be involuntary based on coercion when the agency has taken steps against an employee, not for any legitimate agency purpose but simply to force the employee to quit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Caveney v. Office of Admin.</span>, 57 MSPR 667, 670 (1993); <span class="Italic">Rayfield v. Department of Agric.</span>, 26 MSPR 244, 246 (1985). <span class="Italic">See generally Roskos v. United States,</span> 549 F.2d at 1389-90.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As these examples make clear, the doctrine of coercive involuntariness is a narrow one. It does not apply to a case in which an employee decides to resign or retire because he does not want to accept a new assignment, a transfer, or other measures that the agency is authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant for the employee that he feels that he has no realistic option but to leave. As this court has explained, the fact that an employee is faced with an unpleasant situation or that his choice is limited to two unattractive options does not make the employee's decision any less voluntary. <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 750 F.2d at 942; <span id="Page_1997"></span><span class="Italic">Taylor v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 219 Ct. Cl. 86, 591 F.2d 688, 692 (1979). To adopt a different rule would enable an employee to defeat lawful agency action, such as a geographical transfer, by resigning in protest, appealing on the ground that the resignation was rendered involuntary by the hardship imposed by the transfer, and obtaining reinstatement (presumably with an immunity from the transfer) if the Board concluded that the employee retired unwillingly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Staats bases his appeal not on the merits of his coercion claim, but on a procedural issue--the denial of a purported statutory and constitutional right to a hearing on the coercion prong of his claim of involuntary retirement. This court's cases make clear, however, that neither the governing statute nor the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees him a right to an evidentiary hearing on a question pertaining to the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pertinent statute, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a), grants employees a right to a hearing on claims falling within the Board's jurisdiction, but the statute does not provide for a hearing on the question whether the Board has jurisdiction in a particular case, and the Due Process Clause does not mandate a hearing where the statute does not require that one be afforded. <span class="Italic">See Manning</span> <span class="Italic">v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.,</span> 742 F.2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (no statutory right to an evidentiary hearing with respect to jurisdictional determinations); <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 721 F.2d 355, 357 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (denial of a hearing on jurisdictional issues does not violate section 7701(a) or the Fifth Amendment). Instead, a hearing is required with respect to jurisdictional questions only if the employee makes a non-frivolous allegation that, if proved, would establish Board jurisdiction. Moreover, the requirement that an employee make a threshold nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction in order to be entitled to a hearing applies even with respect to a jurisdictional issue such as involuntariness, which is closely tied to the merits of the underlying claim<span class="Italic">. See Braun v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 50 F.3d at 1008; <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Sys.</span> <span class="Italic">Protection Bd.,</span> 789 F.2d at 894; <span class="Italic">Burgess v.</span> <span class="Italic">Merit Sys. Protection</span> Bd., 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has recognized that an employee can make a factual showing sufficient to call for a hearing on misrepresentation-based involuntariness, while falling short of the showing necessary to mandate a hearing on coercion-based involuntariness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 789 F.2d at 894-95....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly concluded that none of Staats' allegations constituted a legally sufficient, non-frivolous showing of coercion, as that term is used in this context. Staats' concerns about factors such as the likelihood of assignment to a transition center, the inconvenience of traveling to a transition center outside his normal commuting area, the prospect of subsequent relocation to a different area of the country, and the possibility that the "saved pay and grade" guarantee might not be permanent made the choice with which he was presented an unpleasant one, and perhaps justified his conclusion that his best option was to elect early retirement with the associated lump-sum salary payment. But Staats failed to show that the agency took, or threatened to take, steps that it was not legally entitled to take with respect to his future in the Postal Service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Staats has not suggested that the agency targeted him personally and used the reorganization as a pretext for engineering his removal. Nor, contrary to Staats' contention, was he given inadequate time to consider his options. Time pressure to make a decision has, on occasion, provided the basis for a finding of involuntariness, but only when the agency has demanded that the employee make an immediate decision. <span class="Italic">See Paroczay v. Hodges,</span> 297 F.2d 439, 441 (D.C. Cir. 1961)<span class="Italic">. See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Cosby v. United States</span>, 417 F.2d at 1355. When an employee has been given a period of time, such as two weeks, in which to consider his option, time pressure has not been regarded as a factor indicating involuntariness. <span class="Italic">See Latham v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 909 F.2d 500, 502 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Here, Staats had several months to consider his alternatives, including several weeks after the Postal Service had announced that employees subject to reassignment in the reorganization would not have their pay or grade reduced. In any event, the November 20, 1992, deadline simply represented the last date on which Postal Service employees would be eligible for the benefits of the early retirement and lump-sum bonus program; the pressure that Staats felt to act by that date was the product of his desire not to forfeit those benefits, which the agency was not required to offer in the first place. The timing of the early retirement option thus did not give rise to legally cognizable coercion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A period of several days to consider a retirement option was sufficient, <span class="Italic">Paul v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3150):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although Dr. Paul states that he had only a few days in which to make the decision, he does not argue surprise or that he was not fully aware of his alternatives, or that the longer notice period he requested (and was refused) interfered with his ability to make an informed decision. Precedent does not support Dr. Paul's argument that the short notice in and of itself amounted to coercion. <span class="Italic">See Perlman v. United States</span>, 490 F.2d 928, 932-33 (Ct. Cl. 1974) (time pressure of itself does not make a decision to retire involuntary, unless the time pressure interferes with the employee's ability to exercise informed choice); <span class="Italic">Lamb v. United States Postal Service</span>, 46 MSPR 470, 477 (1990) (a resignation decision made by an employee on the same day as an adverse action was not involuntary when the employee had ample time to make an informed decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hardmon v. VA</span>, AT-0752-17-0589-I-1 (NP 1/27/2023), found that time pressure did not warrant a retirement constructively adverse:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also signifi cant to the Board's involuntariness analysis is the existence of time pressure to make a decision regarding whether to retire. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 466, &#x00B6; 10 (2007). Here, on March 29, 2016, the appellant submitted a request to retire on December 31, 2016. On June 14, 2016, she updated her request so that she could retire on September 30, 2016. On August 15, 2016, she indicated that she wanted to retire as soon as possible. After being informed that the earliest she could retire was September 9, 2016, she decided to retire on that date. The appellant does not suggest that the agency proposed that she retire, and it appears that the decision to retire was entirely initiated by the appellant. This fact further supports our fi nding that the appellant's retirement was not involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 15 (noting that the decision to retire was "entirely self-initiated," in finding that a retirement was not involuntary).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Parrott v. MSPB</span>, 519 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (reviewing 104 MSPR 171 (2006)) (four hours was enough to consider a resignation; decision discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-13-026.html#sec6-27">Time Pressure</a>," concerning involuntary resignations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nineteen days notice of the agency's denial of LWOP, advance or donated leave requested by the appellant to care for a relative was sufficient to avoid the involuntariness of a retirement based on the appellant's need to continue the care, <span class="Italic">Remot v. VA</span>, CH-0752-15-0339-I-1 (NP 2/26/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge credited the appellant's assertion that she was not informed that her request for LWOP was disapproved until April 17, 2014, but found that the agency still provided her with sufficient time (19 days) to make other arrangements for her brother's care and return to work such that, to the extent she relied on the approval, if any, of the requested period of LWOP, the agency acted diligently in clarifying any potential misunderstanding. While the appellant disputes that the agency's actions afforded her enough time to make alternate arrangements for her brother's care before having to return to duty on May 6, 2014, the granting of 2 weeks to an employee to consider her options has not been regarded as time pressure indicating involuntariness. <span class="Italic">See Latham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 909 F.2d 500, 502 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Although the appellant argues that the agency should have granted her additional LWOP, the granting or denying of LWOP is discretionary with the agency. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Justice</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 669, 672 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant claims that the agency failed to explain why it did not allow her to borrow leave or to receive donated leave, it is of no moment because it is the appellant who bears the burden of proof as to jurisdiction in the case of an alleged involuntary retirement. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i). In any event, the appellant has not alleged that she made such a request or that the agency would have been obligated to grant it. Moreover, it is well established that the fact that an employee is faced with an unpleasant situation or that her choice is limited to two unattractive options does not make the employee's decision any less voluntary. <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In sum, the appellant has not shown that the administrative judge erred in finding that she failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of coercion by the agency concerning her retirement. <span class="Italic">See Staats v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (holding that the doctrine of coercive involuntariness does not apply where an employee decides to retire because he does not want to accept a measure that the agency is authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant for the employee that he feels he has no realistic option but to leave).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Advice from agency officials against a hasty retirement decision undercut an argument of time pressure, <span class="Italic">Nguyen v. MSPB</span>, 646 Fed. Appx. 980, 983-84 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Ms. Nguyen argues that she did not have adequate time to decide whether to retire or receive a demotion, and thus she was forced to retire. In situations where an employee has been forced to make an immediate decision, such as when an employer threatens an employee to "resign now, [or the supervisor] will press charges immediately," courts have found improper coercion sufficient to render resignations involuntary. <span class="Italic">Paroczay v. Hodges,</span> 297 F.2d 439, 440 (D.C. Cir. 1961); <span class="Italic">see also Middleton v. Dep't of Def.,</span> 185 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Ms. Nguyen has not alleged that she faced such circumstances. Rather, she simply alleges that Mr. Banks demanded a definitive answer as to whether or not she was retiring. Further, according to Ms. Nguyen's own statements, her supervisors told her to take her time in making a decision and that <span id="Page_1998"></span>the choice of whether and when to resign was hers, and hers alone. The Board did not err in finding that Ms. Nguyen's allegations here do not amount to improper coercion rendering her resignation involuntary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But only a couple days to make a retirement decision, caused by the agency's apparent manipulation of a VSIP option was enough, along with other detailed assertions relating to involuntariness, to carry an appeal to a hearing. <span class="Italic">Jones v.
