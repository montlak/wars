<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-354"><span class="space">c.</span> Impact of Collective Bargaining Contract</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Modeste v. VA</span>, 121 MSPR 254, 255-60 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-14, 2014 MSPB 44 (2014), determined that veterans must be able to compete for vacant positions without qualification as to the duration of the appointments; the right to compete is not limited to permanent, competitive service positions and that right cannot be restricted through provisions of negotiated labor agreements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, an honorably discharged veteran with over 6 years of military service, applied for a position with the agency as a Medical Administrative Specialist (Trainee). The agency's vacancy announcement solicited applications from all "United States Citizens" and noted that the position was a full-time temporary position not-to-exceed (NTE) 2 years. The agency did not select the appellant for the position and, in an undated letter, informed him that it had selected a current agency employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a complaint with the Department of Labor alleging a violation of his right to compete under VEOA, and subsequently filed a timely VEOA appeal with the Board. Following a hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision finding that the agency violated the appellant's right to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) by placing applicants into different groups for consideration based upon their status as internal or external applicants without regard to their preference eligibility or veterans' status. At the hearing, the agency's human resources officials testified that, pursuant to the agency's master labor agreement, applicants were divided into three groups--those who worked at the facility which posted the job vacancy; those who worked for the agency outside of the facility; and all others. The administrative judge rejected the agency's claim that the master labor agreement provided a valid basis for not considering the appellant's application, and he further found that the agency admitted that it never considered the appellant's application because it was not included among the group of applications from which the selectee was chosen (explaining that the selectee was a current agency employee and that the agency did not review the applications of external candidates).[1] Based upon the agency's admissions, the administrative judge found that the agency violated the appellant's right to compete for a vacant position under 5 <span id="Page_654"></span>U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), and he ordered the agency to reconstruct its hiring process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Although the Standard Form (SF)-50 the appellant submitted in connection with his application reflected that he was not an agency employee, he was actually serving in a term position with the agency at a different facility at the time of his application. ID at 5; IAF, Tab 9 at 39 and Tab 11 (SF-50 appointing appellant to term position effective May 2012). We find that this does not affect the outcome of this appeal, given the nature of the agency's violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has filed a petition for review raising two challenges to the administrative judge's initial decision. First, citing an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) website, the agency argues that it did not violate the appellant's right to compete because the position at issue was a temporary position and that the VEOA "can only be utilized when filling permanent, competitive service positions." Second, the agency asserts that the appellant's appeal is moot because, as a matter of law, the appellant is not entitled to the relief which the administrative judge ordered. The appellant has not responded to the agency's petition for review. For the reasons that follow, we find that the agency's arguments are unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge properly ordered corrective action based upon a violation of the appellantTs right to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304 (f)(1).</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reviewed the initial decision and agree with the administrative judge's well-reasoned and thorough analysis finding a violation of the appellant's right to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). At the hearing, several of the agency's human resources officials confirmed that the agency solicited applications from individuals both within and outside of its workforce and that, in considering those applications, it segregated applicants into different groups based upon the applicants' employment status with the agency without regard to their preference eligibility or veterans' status. The agency's witnesses, moreover, confirmed that the appellant's application for employment was not among those first considered because it did not reflect that the appellant was an employee of the agency and that the agency made a selection for the position without reviewing the applications from each group.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We concur with the administrative judge that such a fragmentation of applications, without regard to the applicants' preference eligibility or veterans' status, is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 7-10; <span class="Italic">Boctor v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 580, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (2009) (finding that the agency violated the appellant's right to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) when it solicited applications from outside of its workforce but failed to consider the appellant's). We further agree with the administrative judge that the agency's reliance on its master labor agreement as a justification for its actions does not excuse the agency's violation of the appellant's right to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). <span class="Italic">Cf. Gingery v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 175, &#x00B6; 10 (2010) (an agency's internal policy may not override applicable statutes, including 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1)); <span class="Italic">Boctor</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 580, &#x00B6; 9 (rejecting agency's claim that it was required to consider internal candidates before external candidates under its internal procedures).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 3304(f)(1) provides a preference eligible or veteran a right to compete for a vacant position, not just a permanent, competitive service position.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues on petition for review that the administrative judge erred in ordering corrective action because the vacancy at issue was for a temporary, NTE position and that the VEOA "can only be utilized when filling permanent, competitive service positions." The agency cites to an OPM website in support of its argument, which provides in relevant part that VEOA "is a competitive service appointing authority that can only be used when filling permanent competitive service positions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <a href="https://www.fedshirevets.gov/jobs/shav/index.aspx">www.fedshirevets.gov/jobs/shav/index.aspx</a>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3304(f)(1) of Title 5 provides that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[p]reference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for <span class="Italic">vacant positions</span> for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion principles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) (emphasis added). The statute's text unambiguously provides that a preference eligible or veteran shall not be denied the opportunity to compete for "vacant positions," and we find no support in the statutory text for the limitation advanced by the agency that the appellant's right to compete is limited to competition for a vacant permanent position. <span class="Italic">See Benedetto v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 530, 534 (1987) (the plain language of a statute controls absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Horner v. Benedetto</span>, 847 F.2d 814 (Fed. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's reliance on an OPM website in support of its argument does not change our analysis. Although OPM regulations concerning veterans' preference may be entitled to deference, informal information and guidance on an OPM website which has not been issued under the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures used in promulgating regulations are not entitled to the same deference accorded regulations. <span class="Italic">Jolley v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 104, &#x00B6; 13 (2007). While positions expressed in issuances such as these may be entitled to some weight, the amount of weight to be given depends in part on factors such as the consistency of the agency's position on the subject, the formality with which the position is expressed, and the persuasiveness of the position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that although the information cited by the agency is on an OPM website, which is intended to assist veterans, agencies, and the public understand and apply veterans' preference laws, the agency's reliance on this information is misplaced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the section of the OPM website cited by the agency is entitled "Special Hiring Authorities for Veterans." The legal issue raised by the appellant in this appeal, however, is a request for corrective action under the VEOA's remedial mechanism, and the appellant has not argued that he should have been appointed to the position in question under a special hiring authority. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Styslinger v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 13 n.6 (2007). The information provided by OPM on its website, therefore, addresses when an agency can rely on an applicant's preference eligibility or veterans' status in making a hiring decision and does not serve to restrict an appellant's right to compete for a vacancy under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Augustine v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 407, &#x00B6; 15 n.6 (2001) (discussing the noncompetitive appointment of certain veterans under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(f)(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.611).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, even if we were to read OPM's website as suggesting that an appellant has only a statutory right to compete for a permanent, competitive service position, which we do not, we would find that this guidance would not be entitled to deference because it is in clear contradiction to the text of the statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jolley</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 104, &#x00B6; 14 (rejecting OPM <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span> provision interpreting &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) because it includes no explanation for its interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), and it refers to no supporting authority); <span class="Italic">see also Vassallo v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 70, &#x00B6; 11 (2014) (finding OPM <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span> interpretation of term "agency" within 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) unpersuasive because of lack of legal analysis or support). As explained above, the text of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) clearly provides a preference eligible or veteran with the right to compete for "vacant positions" without qualification as to the duration of those positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, we have reviewed the Board's decisions applying 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), and we find no support for the agency's argument that an appellant's right to compete is limited to permanent positions of employment. The Board has consistently held that "under the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), all covered individuals, including current employees and those seeking initial federal appointments, must be permitted to compete when applications will be accepted from persons outside the hiring agency's workforce." <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 175, &#x00B6; 6. None of the Board's decisions hold or suggest that a preference eligible's or veteran's right to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) is confined to competition for a permanent position of federal employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's appeal is not moot because the agency must comply with the administrative judge's initial decision ordering corrective action and the appellant may be entitled to an award of damages.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we reject the agency's argument that the appellant's petition for review should be denied as moot because "the agency cannot hire the Appellant under the hiring authority of VEOA, which was the statutory basis on which he appealed and upon which the Administrative Judge erroneously relied." As explained above, we agree that the agency violated the appellant's right to compete by not considering his application under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). VEOA provides that, if the Board determines that an agency has violated a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference, it "shall order the agency to comply with such provisions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c; <span class="Italic">Deems v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 19 (2005). Accordingly, an appellant whose veterans' preference rights were violated concerning a selection process is entitled to a selection process consistent with law. <span class="Italic">Lodge v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 7 (2008). Because the agency has not yet reconstructed its selection process, and because the appellant could still request an award of damages, he has not yet received all of the relief to which he may be entitled, and his appeal cannot be dismissed as moot. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 356, 357 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reconstructing its selection process, we note that the agency must remove from the position in question any individual improperly appointed and that the agency must engage in a real reconstruction process, not merely one that is hypothetical. <span class="Italic">See Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2009). In removing any individual from the position in question, however, the agency need not remove the individual from federal service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_655"></span>If the veteran applies through a merit promotion announcement, VEOA is not violated if he does not secure consideration because his rating falls below the level set by a labor agreement, <span class="Italic">Barry v. DOD</span>, 702 Fed. Appx. 991, 991-992 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In early 2016, Mr. Barry, a preference-eligible veteran, applied for a vacant position as a Program Analyst posted by the Defense Logistics Agency (Agency). The vacancy announcement was posted as a merit promotion announcement. The announcement required candidates to submit a questionnaire, and candidates received a score based on their responses. Sixty applicants had a score of 100, and at least 16 applicants, including Mr. Barry, had a score of 98. Consistent with a Master Labor Agreement covering the position, the Agency established a "cut-off score" of 100 to fill the position. The Agency subsequently notified Mr. Barry that he was not eligible for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Mr. Barry identifies no legal error in the Agency's use of the merit promotion process or its adoption of a cut-off score of 100 to fill the vacancy. He claims the cut-off score was not equally applied between veterans groups, but substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that the Agency applied the same cut-off score to all applicants. The Board correctly applied the law to Mr. Barry's VEOA claim and substantial evidence supports its underlying findings.</p>
