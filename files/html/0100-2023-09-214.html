<h3 class="h3" id="sec2-211"><span class="space">F.</span> JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><a href="0100-2023-08-001.html#sec1-1">Chapter 1</a> constitutes a long essay on Board jurisdiction. In brief, "[t]he Board has limited jurisdiction, restricted by certain statutes and regulations." <span class="Italic">Flowers v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 167, 169 (1993). The Board always has jurisdiction to decide its jurisdiction. "While a decision of an adjudicatory agency like the Board as to its own jurisdiction is not the last word, it must assuredly be the first." <span class="Italic">Cody v. DOJ</span>, 7 MSPR 218, 228-29, 7 MSPB 127 (1981). "[T]he issue of Board jurisdiction is always before the Board and may be raised by either party or <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by an administrative judge or the Board at any time during a Board proceeding." <span class="Italic">Engler v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 109, 114 (1995); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Gainey v. USPS</span>, DC-0752-16-0167-I-1 (NP 9/2/2016) ("It is incumbent on the administrative judge to address jurisdiction <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> if there is reason to believe that jurisdiction might be an issue in the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 678 (1991)."); <span class="Italic">Styslinger v. Dept. of Army</span>, 105 MSPR 223, 231 &#x00B6; 12, 2007 MSPB 53 (2007) ("<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of the Army,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 9 (2000) ('The issue of Board jurisdiction is always before the Board and may be raised by either party or <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Board at any time during a Board proceeding.')"); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. USPS</span>, 92 MSPR 37, 43 n.2 (2002) (issue of jurisdiction may be raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Board any time during the proceeding); <span class="Italic">Giove v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 89 MSPR 560, 564 (2001) ("The existence of Board jurisdiction is a threshold issue in adjudicating an appeal, and the appellant bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence."). "[J]urisdiction is determined by the nature of the action at the time the appeal is filed." <span class="Italic">Fidler v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 440, 443 (1992). Board (and judicial) decisions apply retroactively to pending cases, but retroactive application is not compelled; by definition, a jurisdictional ruling may never be prospective only. <span class="Italic">Williams v. DOD</span>, 53 MSPR 23, 26 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Many appeals establish Board jurisdiction through identification of both an action defined by statute or regulation to be within the Board's jurisdiction and an adversely affected employee, the appellant, who is also classified by statute or regulation as an employee within the appellate jurisdiction of the Board. Some cases are not clearly within the jurisdiction of the Board, for example, when the employee's status does not permit him to appeal the action, or the action itself is normally considered voluntary--most commonly resignation or retirement--but is appealed as constructively adverse. Other cases, common in Board jurisprudence, require that Board jurisdiction be established through allegations involving both exhaustion of administrative remedies and averment of jurisdictional facts. Included in this group are Individual Right of Action appeals requiring both initial resort to OSC and pleading of <span id="Page_1190"></span>whistleblowing allegations that conform to statutory definitions of protected activity. These appeals, appeals by probationers, and appeals from individuals asserting constructive adverse actions, require a jurisdictional showing of facts going beyond <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Beadle v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 193, 197 (1989); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Herring v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 97-3443) ("Assuming that Ms. Herring is again asserting her claim of marital-status discrimination, her bare assertion of discrimination, without any factual allegations in support, is insufficient to confer jurisdiction on the Board<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Briscoe v. VA</span>, 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">A jurisdictional issue is usually brought to fore by the AJ at the onset of the case, either by a section in the acknowledgment order or in a jurisdictional show cause order. The AJ will allow the appellant to submit a response on jurisdiction within a set number of days and the agency will be informed that it has a set period to respond to the appellant's jurisdictional submission. The agency may raise the jurisdictional issue through a motion to dismiss the appeal. At times the AJ raises the issue through an order to show cause and the agency raises the same issue by motion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When it is an issue, ultimately "an appellant bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that his appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Keller v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 183, 187 (1996). To get to a hearing (on the merits, on jurisdiction, or both), the Federal Circuit noted in a restoration rights appeal, <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v. MSPB</span>, 659 F.3d 1097, 1101-02 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (Judge Newman dissenting), that it is the appellant's initial burden to establish jurisdiction by first making allegations of nonfrivolous jurisdictional facts and then proving those facts at a jurisdictional hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As this court has explained, "Congress has not 'directly spoken' to an employee's burden of proof for establishing the Board's jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1338 (quoting <span class="Italic">Chevron v. Natural Res. Def. Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984)). But 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(k) provides that the "Board may prescribe regulations to carry out the purpose of this section" and, as this court noted in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, "[p]ursuant to this statutory authority, the Board has promulgated regulations to carry out &#x00A7; 7701." 437 F.3d at 1338. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)] states that the "appellant has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, with respect to...[i]ssues of jurisdiction." In <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, this court held that this regulation is "neither 'arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute,' and is therefore entitled to deference and is lawful." 437 F.3d at 1338. As this court explained, "the regulation clearly requires that the claimant establish jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, independent of whether facts relevant to deciding the merits overlap with the facts relevant to deciding jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1340.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, this court distinguished numerous cases regarding Article III jurisdiction as inapposite in rejecting the view that Board "jurisdiction attaches when an employee makes non-frivolous claims." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1335 (citing <span class="Italic">Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl. Study Grp., Inc.</span>, 438 U.S. 59 (1978); <span class="Italic">Montana-Dakota Utils. Co. v. Nw. Pub. Serv. Co.</span>, 341 U.S. 246 (1951); <span class="Italic">Bell v. Hood</span>, 327 U.S. 678 (1946); <span class="Italic">The Fair v. Kohler Die &#x0026; Specialty Co.</span>, 228 U.S. 22 (1913)). <span class="Italic">Cf. Arbaugh v. Y&#x0026;H Corp.</span>, 546 U.S. 500 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, this court explained that "[t]here is nothing in the plain language of the statute requiring or even suggesting a non-frivolous standard...[nor that] Congress intended that, in cases in which jurisdictional issues and merits issues overlap, the Board is required to follow the standards for jurisdiction applicable to Article III courts." 437 F.3d at 1336. "[i]nasmuch as the Board is not an Article III court, we fail to see how the backdrop of standards applicable to Article III court jurisdiction suggests that Congress intended those standards to apply to this quasi-judicial administrative agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1337 (also finding "suggestions that Congress specifically did not intend concepts from Article III courts to be used by the Board.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As this court further explained in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, establishing jurisdiction at the Board is a two-step process. First, a petitioner must meet the threshold requirement of making non-frivolous allegations of fact which, if true, would be sufficient to establish the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1330. If the petitioner makes non-frivolous allegations to support jurisdiction, then and only then will the petitioner be entitled to a jurisdictional hearing at which the petitioner must prove jurisdiction by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1344 ("[O]nce a claimant makes non-frivolous claims of Board jurisdiction, namely claims that, if proven, establish the Board's jurisdiction, then the claimant has a right to a hearing. At the hearing, claimant must prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence."). After the petitioner has proven jurisdiction by preponderant evidence, then and only then is the Board free to reach the merits of the petitioner's appeal. "If the Board determines that the claimant fails to prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, then the Board does not have jurisdiction and the case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. When the Board lacks jurisdiction, "it cannot decide the merits of the case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1340.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board's jurisdiction is limited rather than plenary, and because the petitioner must prove jurisdiction by preponderant evidence, including on issues that overlap with the merits, it is crucial to identify at the outset the jurisdictional requirements of any given appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Judge Newman pointed out in her dissent in <span class="Italic">Bledsoe</span> what several judges of the Federal Circuit noted in past decisions: the distinction between jurisdiction (established by statute or regulation) and the ability to state a claim on the merits, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1106-09:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Bledsoe appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board, requesting review of the Postal Service's denial of her request for restoration to light duty service. The Board held a telephonic conference, requested evidence on the relevant factors, and upon consideration of the evidence and argument, and application of the prescribed standard of review, the Board concluded that the agency's decision should be affirmed. The Board then, curiously, did not affirm the agency's decision, but instead dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. This inapt and illogical resolution "obscures the issue," as the Supreme Court remarked in <span class="Italic">Arbaugh v. Y &#x0026; H Corp.</span>, 546 U.S. 500 (2006), counseling against "unrefined" jurisdictional rulings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Judicial opinions, the Second Circuit incisively observed, "often obscure the issue by stating that the court is dismissing 'for lack of jurisdiction' when some threshold fact has not been established, without explicitly considering whether the dismissal should be for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or for failure to state a claim." <span class="Italic">Da Silva</span>, 229 F.3d, at 361. We have described such unrefined dispositions as "drive-by jurisdictional rulings" that should be accorded "no precedential effect" on the question whether the federal court had authority to adjudicate the claim in suit. <span class="Italic">Steel Co.</span>, 523 U.S. at 91, 118 S. Ct. 1003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">546 U.S. at 511. As in <span class="Italic">Arbaugh</span>, the issue here is not whether the Board had authority to adjudicate Ms. Bledsoe's claim, but whether her claim was properly denied on the merits. As in <span class="Italic">Arbaugh</span>, the dismissal of the claim as outside the Board's jurisdiction "obscures the issue." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board undoubtedly has jurisdiction to decide whether to sustain the agency's denial of restoration, for the Board is assigned this jurisdiction by statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB found that Ms. Bledsoe had made non-frivolous allegations of the elements of her claim and considered the reasons given by the Postal Service for denying restoration. The Postal Service stated that there was no "necessary and productive work available" within Ms. Bledsoe's medical restrictions. The administrative judge, at a status conference with the parties, stated that "in order to raise a non-frivolous allegation that denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious, the appellant must identify a vacant position, or positions, within 50 miles" of her former work location, as this would constitute "specific, independent evidence corroborating her allegation that the denial was arbitrary and capricious." Ms. Bledsoe, aided by a union representative, identified three "door monitor" positions at her prior location, provided a description of the duties of this position, and explained why Ms. Bledsoe could perform those duties within her medical limitations. She also presented evidence and argument as to the seniority of various employees at that location, as well as medical evidence of her partial recovery. The Postal Service and Ms. Bledsoe presented opposing evidence and argument as to the availability of suitable positions within the commuting area and Ms. Bledsoe's suitability for those positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court has often reminded the lower courts and the administrative tribunals that "the term 'jurisdictional' properly applies only to 'prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction)' implicating that authority." <span class="Italic">Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick</span>, _ U.S. _, 130 S. Ct. 1237, 1243 (2010) (quoting <span class="Italic">Kontrick v. Ryan</span>, 540 U.S. 443, 455 (2004)). In <span class="Italic">Reed Elsevier</span> the Court reiterated the inaptness of "drive-by jurisdictional rulings":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In <span class="Italic">Arbaugh</span>, we described the general approach to distinguish "jurisdictional" conditions from claim-processing requirements or <span id="Page_1191"></span>elements of a claim: "If the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute's scope shall count as jurisdictional, then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue. But when Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1244 (quoting <span class="Italic">Arbaugh,</span> 546 U.S. at 515-16); <span class="Italic">see also Bell v. Hood</span>, 327 U.S. 678, 682 (1946) ("Jurisdiction, therefore, is not defeated as respondents seem to contend, by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover."). The standard of review is not an element of jurisdiction. The standard of "arbitrary and capricious" is deferential, not jurisdictional. In <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 978 F.2d 679 (Fed. Cir. 1992) this court explained that: "The forum had jurisdiction to hear the matter in the first instance--that is, subject-matter jurisdiction existed--as long as the petitioner asserted nonfrivolous claims," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 687-88, and pointed out that: "Sometimes the question of subject matter jurisdiction gets confused with the question of entitlement to relief, that is, whether a cause of action has been stated in the complaint, or later proved." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 686. Such confusion is here apparent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Entitlement to relief was the dispute in Ms. Bledsoe's appeal to the MSPB, not subject matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers &#x0026; Trainmen</span>, <span class="Italic">_</span> U.S. _, 130 S. Ct. 584 (2009), where the agency was the National Railroad Adjustment Board, the Court explained that "there is surely a starting presumption that when jurisdiction is conferred, a court may not decline to exercise it. The general rule applicable to courts also holds for administrative agencies directed by Congress to adjudicate particular controversies." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 590 (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Pruidze v. Holder</span>, 632 F.3d 234, 240 (6th Cir. 2011) ("[A]n agency cannot contract its power to hear claims that fall plainly within its statutory jurisdiction.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is set by statute. No statute states that jurisdiction is ousted if the petitioner does not make her case. The standard by which the Board reviews agency action is not a matter of jurisdiction, but of procedural law. A review of the evidence going to the merits leads to a decision on the merits, not denial or grant of jurisdiction depending on whether the petitioner wins or loses. <span class="Italic">See Bell</span>, 327 U.S. at 682 ("[I]t is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction."); <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, 978 F.2d at 687 ("[F]ailure of proof of an element of the cause of action means the petitioner is not entitled to the relief he seeks."). The Board incorrectly characterized its decision as jurisdictional, denying its own jurisdiction assigned by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). This court compounds the error. From this court's flawed "drive-by jurisdictional" analysis, I must, respectfully, dissent.</p>

Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 659 F.3d 1097, 1102 (Fed.

However, the Board's revised regulation, effective March 30, 2015, and applicable in any appeal filed on or after March 30, 2015, modified the burden of proof for establishing jurisdiction over restoration appeals to require only nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.57(b).").

<p class="Block-Quote1">While the existence of Board jurisdiction is the threshold issue in adjudicating an appeal, a jurisdictional determination would not be in the Board's interest of adjudicatory efficiency and fairness to the parties involved in an untimely appeal if the record is sufficiently developed to show that the appeal should be dismissed because no good cause exists for the untimely filing.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Alternatively, if an appeal is beyond the Board's jurisdiction, the appeal may be dismissed without a timeliness determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ford v.

On occasion the AJ may permit the parties to reserve a jurisdictional issue, such as veterans preference status, pending Board review of an initial decision on a merits issue, e.g., whether the agency engaged in a RIF or adverse action when appellants accepted positions during a reorganization. If, through its consideration of a PFR, the Board then determines that the merits issue requires further examination, the appeal returns to the AJ for analysis of that issue as well as the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burger v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 579, 583 &#x00B6; 12 (2001). The same result could occur if the merits issue were presented to the Board through an interlocutory appeal.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...An appeal within the Board's jurisdiction may be properly dismissed for failure to state a claim if the appellant cannot obtain effective relief before the Board even if his allegations are accepted as true. <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 524, &#x00B6; 7 (2006); <span class="Italic">Young v.

In appraising the sufficiency of an appeal, the Board follows the accepted rule that an action should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the appellant can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. <span class="Italic">Kennedy</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 524, &#x00B6; 7. Taking as true the allegations in the appellant's petition for appeal, we note that it is not beyond doubt that the appellant could not prove such a set of facts.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Miller</span> is tempered by the need of the appellant to establish nonfrivolous factual allegations supporting Board jurisdiction, and "nonfrivolous" allegations often really amount to a requirement of fairly detailed factual pleading. The amount of detail depends on the nature of the case and the approach of the assigned AJ. The ability to pursue an appeal and obtain a hearing depends on a statement of the claim with sufficient particularity to demonstrate that the appellant and his claim are at least arguably within the Board's jurisdiction. What is ordinarily required to avoid dismissal of an appeal is a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, constituting an allegation of fact that, if proved, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tedesco v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 90 MSPR 367, 372 &#x00B6; 9 (2001).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there are material facts in dispute concerning jurisdiction, the case should proceed to a hearing, sometimes dubbed a "jurisdictional hearing." To obtain a jurisdictional hearing, the appellant need only allege facts that, if proved, could establish a claim; the appellant need not make the jurisdictional showing by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Morman v. DOD</span>, 90 MSPR 197, 201 &#x00B6; 8 (2001). A nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction is not the same as proving facts that would establish the Board's jurisdiction over an appeal. <span class="Italic">Burger v. USPS</span>, 93 MSPR 582, 592 &#x00B6; 25 (2003);<span class="Italic"> see</span> <span class="Italic">Frison v. Dept. of Army</span>, 94 MSPR 431, 433 &#x00B6; 4 (2003) ("A nonfrivolous allegation is an allegation of fact that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal....&#8197;[A]n appellant need not allege facts which, if proven, definitely <span class="Italic">would</span> establish that the retirement was involuntary; he need only allege facts which, if proven, <span class="Italic">could</span> establish such a claim."). In practice, there are not many jurisdictional hearings. Jurisdiction is decided based on the evidence and argument submitted in response to a jurisdictional order or motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. If there are nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction, and if a hearing is requested on the merits, jurisdiction will likely again be discussed in the initial decision on the merits. An AJ could hold a jurisdictional hearing and a merits hearing on, for example, a constructive adverse action--jurisdiction and merits merging for disposition through an initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are mixed pronouncements on jurisdictional allegations. There is support for the proposition that jurisdiction is established by more than just allegations: the allegations should be sworn, or supported by evidence, and there is some contrary precedent. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Edem v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 64 MSPR 501, 503-06 (1994) ("Although the Board stated in <span class="Italic">Bedynek-Stumm</span> that the particular 'unsupported and unsworn assertions' made in that case were insufficient to establish a right to a jurisdictional hearing, 57 MSPR at 179, it did not hold that sworn statements are essential to establishing a right to a hearing, and no such requirement exists."). A review of the cases involving constructive adverse actions in <a href="0100-2023-13-001.html#sec6-1">Chapter 6</a>, and Individual Right of Action cases, in <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a>, and <span class="blue">USERRA</span> or <span class="blue">VEOA</span> cases in Chapter 1, shows that the caselaw requires different levels of initial jurisdictional allegations and evidence, depending on the nature of the appeal. Because it is not uniform, how properly to plead and provide evidence supporting jurisdictional allegations can be confusing. The amount of evidence necessary to support particularized allegations is generally left unsaid in MSPB acknowledgment orders. AJs' show cause orders are often so broadly stated that it is difficult to discern exactly where the pleading deficiencies lie and how they are cured.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If evidence is required to demonstrate jurisdiction, then the Board is really employing an attenuated form of summary judgment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marcino v. USPS</span>, 344 F.3d 1199, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Dick v. VA</span>, 290 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed.

Cir. 2006)), for the proposition that the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal if the employee makes nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction supported by affidavits or other evidence). Over time the Board and the Federal Circuit have established a variety of pleading standards to establish jurisdiction over significant components of the Board's caseload. These standards are not consistent. They are not precisely defined. [Readers should examine discussion of VEOA, USERRA, constructive adverse actions, and whistleblower <span id="Page_1192"></span>(IRA) appeals in this chapter as well as in Chapters <a href="0100-2023-08-001.html#sec1-1">1</a>, <a href="0100-2023-13-001.html#sec6-1">6</a>, and <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">13</a> of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> for cases that define what allegations and evidence has to be established in the underlying appeal to establish jurisdiction over these cases.] The safest route for an appellant to travel in establishing jurisdiction is to supply in the appeal, or in response to a show cause order, not only allegations but also evidence (through documents and affidavits or sworn statements) establishing facts supporting jurisdiction. That will not be required in every appeal, but it should be sufficient in any case, to establish jurisdiction--depending on whether allegations and evidence can be compiled that will meet the jurisdictional standards for the appealed action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Hurst v. GSA</span>, 2 MSPR 497, 499, 3 MSPB 21 (1980), if the issue involves jurisdiction, the facts or allegations supporting jurisdiction should not be raised for the first time in a PFR. The information ought first to be placed before the AJ. If the agency alleges in its response to the appeal that the employee's position is beyond the jurisdiction of the Board, e.g., the employee is in the excepted service, and if the appellant does not counter the allegation with an assertion that she occupies a position within the Board's appeals jurisdiction, the Board will not consider the appellant's jurisdictional argument raised in a PFR. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. FEC</span>, 33 MSPR 254, 256 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Gallucci v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 360, 365 (1995) (declining to consider the evidence of the appellant's argument that he expected his attorney to properly respond to the show-cause order from the AJ; there was no showing that the appellant contacted his attorney about responding to the order or that the lawyer misled the appellant on how or when to respond to the order). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Stewart v. TVA</span>, 77 MSPR 565, 567-68 (1998) (considering at PFR stage an agency jurisdictional submission timely filed but not considered by AJ); <span class="Italic">Di Iorio v. Holocaust Memorial Council</span>, 69 MSPR 100, 104 (1995) ("Although not argued by the appellant on review, we reopen this appeal on our own motion because we find that he raised a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction that entitled him to a jurisdictional hearing."); <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOJ</span>, 41 MSPR 353, 356 (1989) (the Board considered a jurisdictional allegation raised in a PFR because the AJ did not inform the appellant of what he needed to plead to invoke jurisdiction over his appeal). [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-066.html#sec5-66">Jurisdictional Issue</a>," for decisions explaining when evidence of jurisdiction may first be submitted with a PFR or with a request for reopening of a final decision.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The rule that jurisdictional information ought to be provided by the appellant to the AJ and not for the first time in a PFR, assuming fair notice of the jurisdictional issue when the appeal was pending before the AJ, does not necessarily operate in the reverse: lack of jurisdiction may be raised at any time during a proceeding. For example, lack of jurisdiction was raised when disability retirement was retroactively effective on or before the date of a removal. <span class="Italic">Morgan v.

<p class="Body-Text">There have been some direct, and a few indirect, critiques of the Board by the Federal Circuit for the Board's failure or inability to distinguish an appeal outside its jurisdiction from a case that the appellant fails to prove. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spruill v. MSPB</span>, 978 F.2d 679 (Fed. Cir. 1992). <span class="Italic">Walley v. VA</span>, 279 F.3d 1010 (Fed. Cir. 2002), distinguished an appeal outside the Board's jurisdiction and one within the Board's jurisdiction but decided against an appellant who fails to state or prove a claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have recently had occasion to review the question of whether Board jurisdiction is established by a non-frivolous allegation on a jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Based on a long line of this court's decisions, we concluded that the Board can properly reach the merits of a claim because a non-frivolous allegation is sufficient to confer jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. ("This court has held that the Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted his administrative remedies before the [Office of Special Counsel] and makes 'non-frivolous allegations'...."); <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 687-88 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("The forum had jurisdiction to hear the matter in the first instance--that is, subject-matter jurisdiction existed--as long as the petitioner asserted nonfrivolous claims."). Once the Board has jurisdiction, it may address the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under our decision in <span class="Italic">Yunus</span>, there are issues before the Board that are at one and the same time jurisdictional issues--requiring a non-frivolous allegation for Board jurisdiction--and merits issues--requiring a determination in favor of the employee if relief is to be awarded. As we discuss below, in the present context the question of whether a termination occurred because of a compensable injury is one of those issues. Board jurisdiction is established by a non-frivolous allegation of a termination because of a compensable injury, but the employee can succeed on the merits only if after a hearing there is a finding that such a termination occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1201.56 of the regulations, placing the burden of proof on the employee with respect to "jurisdictional issues," is plainly not concerned with the first issue of technical jurisdiction (the need for a non-frivolous allegation), but rather with the second issue (concerning the ultimate merits). It places the burden of proof on the employee at a merits hearing with respect to merits issues that are also jurisdictional issues. Thus, although the regulation characterizes the issues with which it is concerned as "jurisdictional" in nature, the regulation is directed, in fact, to the allocation of the burden of proof on the merits. The consequence is that if a merits issue is one that is also "jurisdictional," the burden of proof on that merits issue remains with the employee even though, as a technical matter, the Board's jurisdiction is established by a non-frivolous allegation. The Board itself has interpreted this regulation as governing the burden of proof on those issues that the Board has viewed as "jurisdictional." <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 430, 434 (2001); <span class="Italic">Giove v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 560, 564 (2001); <span class="Italic">Mobley v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 161, 164 (2000). We owe deference to the Board's interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Am. Express Co. v. United States</span>, 262 F.3d 1376, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2001). We accordingly conclude that this regulation allocates the burden of proof to the employee on merits issues which are also "jurisdictional issues."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 327 F.3d 1354, 1356-57 (Fed. Cir. 2003), Judge Plager expressed the court's distress concerning the continuing refusal or inability of the Board to distinguish jurisdictional analysis from analysis of the merits of a claim within the Board's jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court for more than ten years, beginning with <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 978 F.2d 679 (Fed. Cir. 1992), has tried to get the Board to clearly separate the issue of jurisdiction from that of the merits of a petitioner's case. We recently once again patiently explained the difference, and how that difference bears on a fair hearing process. <span class="Italic">See Yunus</span>, 242 F.3d at 1371-72 &#x0026; n.1; <span class="Italic">see also Langer v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 265 F.3d 1259, 1264-65 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Indeed, we held recently in <span class="Italic">Dick v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 290 F.3d 1356, 1361-62 (Fed. Cir. 2002), that an employee is not entitled to a hearing on the threshold issue of jurisdiction, because the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal if the employee makes non-frivolous allegations that the elements of his claim are satisfied. <span class="Italic">Langer</span>, 265 F.3d at 1265; <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, 978 F.2d at 687-88. Whether allegations are non-frivolous is determined on the basis of the written record. <span class="Italic">Dick</span>, 290 F.3d at 1361. Only after Board jurisdiction is established is the Board required to provide an employee with a hearing under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1), and that hearing is a hearing on the merits, not a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1362.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is axiomatic that at that hearing the appellant must establish the elements of his claim by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Langer</span>, 265 F.3d at 1265. Failure to do so is a failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted; it is not, repeat not, a matter of lack of subject matter jurisdiction to decide the merits. The consequence of such a failure is a judgment on the merits, not a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an oral argument in the summer of 2008, Judge Newman of the Federal Circuit succinctly explained to counsel: jurisdiction involves the right to complain, not the determination of the merits of the complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v. MSPB</span>, 659 F.3d 1097, 1101-02 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (dissent by Judge Newman) (distinguishing jurisdiction and the failure to state a claim with Board jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In practical application, the distinction between the failure to establish jurisdiction and the failure to state or prove a claim is unclear. The Board tends to merge the concepts when there is a jurisdictional issue, i.e., an appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction only if certain factual elements are proved by the appellant, for example, an IRA or USERRA claim. Among the other possible examples, the appellant may allege that his resignation or retirement was truly a discharge. The agency may file a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction or the AJ may, without motion, tell the appellant by letter or by a show-cause order that he must explain why the Board has jurisdiction over <span id="Page_1193"></span>the case. Unrepresented appellants may have particular difficulty figuring out how to respond. They may not be familiar with litigation practice or the peculiarities of Board jurisdiction. More than a few lawyers share the problem.</p>
