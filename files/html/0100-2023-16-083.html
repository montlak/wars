<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-84"><span class="space">a.</span> Leave; Schedule; Shift</h5>
<p class="noindent">Cancelation of leave for two employees, resulting in a change in their holiday plans, involved impact that was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> and was reasonably foreseeable. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Region IV, Miami and NTEU</span>, 19 FLRA 304, 311 (1985) (ALJ Decision). Unilateral changes in the practices concerning leave administration for employees seeking maternity leave was a ULP. <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow and AFGE Local 1482</span>, 33 FLRA 196, 202-03 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">56th Combat Support Group, MacDill AFB and AFGE Local 547</span>, 43 FLRA 1565, 1577 (1992) (ALJ Decision) (ULP when agency unilaterally implemented restriction on leave usage by employees and when it changed procedures used by those employees to request and obtain approval of leave). A change in the manner of filling out sick-leave slips required bargaining. <span class="Italic">AAFES, Ft. Carson and AFGE Local 1345</span>, 10 FLRA 235 (1982) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">A change in duty hours of employees requires impact bargaining. <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 85</span>, 30 FLRA 961, 987 (1988) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 33 FLRA 532, 544 (1988) (change in hours resulted in loss of about $2,000 annual premium pay and had effect or reasonably foreseeable effect on employee's conditions of employment); <span class="Italic">FCI and AFGE Local 2052</span>, 8 FLRA 604, 620 (1982) (ALJ Decision). Reassignment of employees from one shift to another requires an agency to bargain over impact and implementation. A change in unit employees' starting and quitting times requires impact bargaining. <span class="Italic">FCI and AFGE Local 2052</span>, 8 FLRA 604, 620 (1982) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force Accounting and Fin. Ctr., Denver and AFGE Local 2040</span>, 42 FLRA 1196, 1206 (1991) (changes altering schedules for as much as two hours were not <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> and required impact bargaining). An agency was required to negotiate impact when it increased the number of employees per shift and enlarged the duties of the positions on the shift. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Region I and NTEU Chap. 133</span>, 17 FLRA 843, 858 (1985) (ALJ Decision). Although <span id="Page_1323"></span>a decision to abolish a tour of duty and assign the employees to another shift was nonnegotiable, the impact of that decision was negotiable. <span class="Italic">VA Hines Hosp. and SEIU Local 73</span>, 16 FLRA 3, 17-20 (1984) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">INS, Honolulu Dist. Office and Nat'l INS Council, AFGE Local 2886</span>, 43 FLRA 608, 618 (1991) (ALJ Decision) (creation of new work shift for unit employees required impact and implementation bargaining); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org. and Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Nat'l Weather Serv.</span>, 37 FLRA 392, 397-98 (1990) (shift change concerned conditions of employment).</p>
<p class="noindent">Determining whether a change in conditions of employment, including assignment to shifts, has occurred involves a case-by-case analysis. If shift changes occur as a routine matter, then the reassignment from one shift to another does not constitute a change in employment conditions. <span class="Italic">INS, Houston Dist. and AFGE Local 3332</span>, 50 FLRA 140, 144 (1995). The result may be different if past practice does not sanction the schedule modifications. Unilateral changes in the working schedule of a group of employees was a ULP. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 3512</span>, 28 FLRA 409, 424 (1987) (ALJ Decision). But a change in the tour of duty for one employee in a base-wide unit was no more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, even though the employee lost some differential pay. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 20 FLRA 857, 860 (1985),<span class="Italic"> result reaff'd for different reasons on remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 33 FLRA 532 (1988). Changes in hours of work for TDY employees were within their job assignments and not a change in working conditions necessitating impact bargaining. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo and FEMTC</span>, 9 FLRA 784, 793 (1982) (ALJ Decision). Concerning what constitutes a nonnegotiable change in a tour of duty, refer to <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 33 FLRA 532 (1988).

<p class="noindent">Unilateral termination of a compressed work schedule for some employees was a ULP. It was immaterial that the flextime program was initiated at a time when the unit employees were unrepresented. <span class="Italic">DLA, Defense Indus. Plant Equip. Ctr., Memphis and AFGE Local 3986</span>, 44 FLRA 599, 614 (1992) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Sys. and AFGE Local 2028</span>, 60 FLRA 516, 518 (2004) (reviewing arbitration award: as explained in the OPM <span class="Italic">Handbook on Alternative Work Schedules</span>, although decision to establish compressed work schedule is at discretion of agency, nothing in Work Schedules Act authorizes unilateral action by agency where unit employees are concerned). A <span class="Italic">status quo </span>remedy was required for a unilateral AWS change. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Local 505</span>, 59 FLRA 387 (2003). But returning an employee to a regular schedule after the employee filled in for an employee on a compressed schedule was not a bargainable change in conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1633 and Debakey VAMC</span>, 70 FLRA 752, 753 (2018).</p>
<p class="noindent">A past practice of considering flexiplace proposals was improperly, unilaterally altered while related proposals were pending before FSIP. A <span class="Italic">status quo</span> remedy, with potential back pay relief, was ordered in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review and AFGE Local 3525</span>, 55 FLRA 454, 455-57 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(5) requires an agency to fulfill its obligation to bargain in good faith before changing conditions of employment, which may be established by past practice<span class="Italic">. See United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, Washington, D.C. and National Border Patrol Council, American Federation of Government Employees</span>, AFL-CIO, 55 FLRA 69, 75 (1999) (<span class="Italic">INS</span>) (Member Wasserman dissenting on other matters). An agency violates its obligation to bargain in good faith when it changes its past practice prior to the completion of bargaining.[2] <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 76 and cases cited therein. Accordingly, if the Respondent in this case implemented a change in conditions of employment prior to the completion of bargaining, then the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;There are limited circumstances where an agency does not violate its duty to bargain in good faith by changing the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> prior to the completion of bargaining<span class="Italic">. See INS</span>, 55 FLRA at 73 n.8. There has been no assertion that any of these exceptions apply here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for the Authority to find the existence of a past practice, there must be a showing that the practice has been consistently exercised over a significant period of time and followed by both parties, or followed by one party and not challenged by the other. <span class="Italic">See USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Region, Portland, Oregon and National Federation of Federal Employees, Forest Service Council, Region 6</span>, 48 FLRA 857, 860 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the record shows that both management and employees followed the practice of submitting and considering flexiplace requests, and that the practice was consistently exercised. Prior to the Union requesting the Panel's assistance, nine attorneys submitted such requests, and management considered each of these requests on the merits, granting eight of the nine. This process continued for over 2 years, a significant period of time<span class="Italic">. See U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C. and American Federation of Government Employees, National Council of Field Labor Locals, Local 1748</span>, 38 FLRA 899, 909 (1990) (16 months considered a significant period of time). This evidence supports the Judge's conclusion that a past practice existed of considering flexiplace requests on their merits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that only 2 percent of bargaining unit employees submitted requests.&#x2003;According to the Respondent, this number is insufficient to establish a past practice, consistent with <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1429</span>, 34 FLRA 606 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>), where the Authority concluded that union representation in 10 of 492 non-selection meetings did not constitute a past practice of union attendance at those meetings. This argument is unconvincing because, in this case, the Judge determined that the Respondent had considered on the merits every one of the requests made during the relevant time period. In contrast, in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, representation was not provided at most of the meetings. As 100 percent of the requests were considered by the Respondent on the merits, resolving the parties' dispute as to the exact percentage of unit employees who submitted the requests is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's other arguments concerning the existence of a past practice also are unconvincing. First, the Respondent's reliance on <span class="Italic">Daily News</span> is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Daily News</span>, the court held that an employer's unilateral termination of a policy providing for annual merit increases in pay constituted an unlawful refusal to bargain under section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 USC &#x00A7; 158(a)(5) (1988). The court concluded that the employer's policy for setting the amount of the raises was not completely discretionary because the employer was constrained by the established procedures for evaluating employees and by the fixed criteria for making each individual merit decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Respondent, because it exercised complete discretion to decide whether to grant flexiplace requests, the Respondent's decision not to consider flexiplace requests did not violate the Statute. In so arguing, the Respondent mischaracterizes the court as stating in <span class="Italic">Daily News</span> that, "if the employer had retained total discretion to consider whatever factors it chose in deciding whether to grant the increases, a deferment of the policy would <span class="Italic">not</span> have resulted in a violation of the NLRA." Exceptions at 5 (citing <span class="Italic">Daily News</span>, 73 F.3d 406, 412 n.3) (emphasis in Exceptions). The court actually stated that, if the employer "retained total discretion to grant the increases based on any factors it chose, [it] doubt[ed] that discontinuing the policy would have resulted in a violation...." <span class="Italic">Daily News</span>, 73 F.3d at 412 n.3. More importantly, the Respondent in this case is not charged with failing to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> with respect to the factors it used to consider flexiplace requests. Instead, it is charged with failing to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> with respect to considering the requests at all. Thus, whether the Respondent retained discretion with regard to the factors used to consider the requests is not dispositive.</p>
<p class="noindent">Changes in employees' shifts were of more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> impact when they affected the employees' ability to earn overtime, night differential, and Sunday premium pay. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Southwest Region, El Paso and NTEU</span>, 44 FLRA 1128, 1140 (1992) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Phoenix and AFGE Local 2382</span>, 47 FLRA 419, 424 (1993) (change was not <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, even though it caused only one employee to report an hour later, when it interfered with employee's ability to hold second job; "the effect of changes on bargaining unit employees need not be limited only to those experienced in the workplace").</p>
<p class="noindent">Allowing for the suggestion of some cases that a change in working conditions does not occur if the employee's job contemplates the change, <span class="Italic">Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 41 FLRA 690, 696-97 (1991), concluded that impact bargaining was required when the activity told several hundred on-call employees that they would be placed in nonpay status in a month's time because of lack of funding and work. FLRA rejected the notion that no bargaining was required when a condition of the employment of on-call employees was the ability to place them into nonpay status. The change was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>; the agency should have bargained over impact:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal employees, as a condition of their employment, are subject to RIF's and furloughs. The fact that Federal employees may be RIF'D or furloughed, however, does not alter the fact that the actual RIF or furlough constitutes a change in conditions of employment....&#8197;In our view, when an employee's status changes from being paid for working to not working and not being paid, such a change constitutes a change in conditions of employment whether it results from the termination of on-call employment or a RIF.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In agreement with the General Counsel, therefore, we find that being removed from the payroll, whether pursuant to the implementation of a RIF, a furlough, or by placement in a nonpay status, constitutes a change in affected employees' conditions of employment. Here, on-call employees were in a paid status before January 8, 1988, and, starting January 8, 1988, were placed in a nonpay status for a period of about 6 months. Because the placement of on-call employees in a nonpay status removed the employees from the payroll, we conclude that the Respondent changed the conditions of employment of affected on-call employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">INS, New York and AFGE Local 1917</span>, 52 FLRA 582, 587-88 (1996), FLRA modified its approach in <span class="Italic">Ogden ALC</span> as a result of a complaint that an agency failed to bargain over the impact of its decision concerning duration of employment of "when actually employed" (WAE) immigration inspectors when changes to their schedules were consistent with the terms of their appointments:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1324"></span>In finding that, by placing the WAEs in an inactive duty status, the Respondent changed those employees' conditions of employment, the Judge stated that he was constrained to follow the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">Ogden</span> and <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>. In <span class="Italic">Ogden</span>, the Authority found that the respondent changed conditions of employment of on-call employees when it placed those employees in a nonpay status. The on-call employees in that case were employed subject to periodic release to a nonpay status as a condition of their employment. The Authority held that "when an employee's status changes from being paid for working to not working and not being paid, such a change constitutes a change in conditions of employment whether it results from the termination of on-call employment or a RIF." <span class="Italic">Ogden</span>, 41 FLRA at 697. Accordingly, the Authority concluded that being removed from the payroll by placement in a nonpay status constituted a change in affected employees' conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, the Authority found, based on a stipulated record, that the respondents changed conditions of employment of temporary employees when they did not renew their temporary appointments. The Authority noted that it had addressed an analogous issue in <span class="Italic">Ogden</span>, and that in both cases the agency had the right to change the status of the employees as a condition of their employment, and the employees in both cases were informed of these conditions of employment at the time of their hiring. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Ogden</span>, the Authority found that the non-renewal of appointments of temporary employees was a change in conditions of employment for those affected employees because they were removed from the payroll when their appointments were not renewed. The FDIC petitioned for review of the Authority's decision and, in an unpublished memorandum, the court denied the petition for review without resolving the "change" issue. <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v. FLRA</span>, No. 93-1694 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 22, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that where actions are taken consistent with pre-established conditions of employment agreed to at the time of hiring and the evidence is insufficient to establish that such pre-established conditions of employment have been changed by a subsequent practice or express agreement of the parties, such actions do not constitute changes in conditions of employment that require bargaining. Therefore, we will no longer follow the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">Ogden</span> and <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> to the extent that they suggest that <span class="Italic">any</span> time on-call or temporary employees, or similarly situated employees, are placed in a nonpay status, such an action constitutes a change in those employees' conditions of employment. We stress, however, that a different conclusion may be warranted where the evidence is sufficient to establish that such pre-established conditions of employment have been changed by a subsequent practice or express agreement of the parties<span class="Italic">. E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Avionics Center, Indianapolis, Indiana</span>, 36 FLRA 567, 570-72 (1990); <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> <span class="Italic">Army Depot</span>, 34 FLRA 606, 611 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">Previously, although a decision to change tours of duty from eight to six hours a day for WAE employees was not in itself negotiable, the agency had a responsibility to negotiate the impact of the decision. A <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy was appropriate absent a showing that agency operations would be unduly disrupted or impaired. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Dallas Dist. and NTEU Chap. 46</span>, 13 FLRA 459, 472 (1983) (ALJ Decision). The agency was required to bargain concerning its decision to shut down operations on the day after Thanksgiving and require the use of annual leave, countered by a union impact bargaining proposal to allow the use of administrative leave for the day. <span class="Italic">Aberdeen Proving Ground and IAM Local 2424</span>, 21 FLRA 814, 821 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">The question of whether changes in working conditions were "substantial," in terms of a clause that required the agency to provide notice and an opportunity to bargain over "substantial changes in an established rotation system," was viewed with regard to the realities of the changes and their impact, e.g., modifications in rotations that affected 44 unit employees' assignments, duty locations, and sequence of rotation were substantial; no waiver was construed. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU Chap. 133</span>, 38 FLRA 770, 784-85 (1990).</p>
