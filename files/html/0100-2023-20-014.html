<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-15"><span class="space">b.</span> Complaint to Wrongdoer</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 2012, the law was that a protected disclosure of wrongdoing could not be made to the wrongdoer. He already knew of his conduct and, so the logic went, there was no "disclosure" of something earlier unknown. That state of affairs was substantially changed by 5 USC 2302(f), added by the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act amendments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)(1) A disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection (b)(8) because--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the disclosure was made to a supervisor or to a person who participated in an activity that the employee or applicant reasonably believed to be covered by subsection (b)(8)(A)(i) and (ii);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; the disclosure revealed information that had been previously disclosed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; of the employee's or applicant's motive for making the disclosure;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003; the disclosure was not made in writing;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003; the disclosure was made while the employee was off duty;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(F)&#x2003; the disclosure was made before the date on which the individual was appointed or applied for appointment to a position; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(G)&#x2003; of the amount of time which has passed since the occurrence of the events described in the disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;If a disclosure is made during the normal course of duties of an employee, the principal job function of whom is to regularly investigate and disclose wrongdoing (referred to in this paragraph as the "disclosing employee"), the disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection (b)(8) if the disclosing employee demonstrates that an employee who has the authority to take, direct other individuals to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action with respect to the disclosing employee took, failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take a personnel action with respect to the disclosing employee in reprisal for the disclosure made by the disclosing employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Addressing the retroactive effect of portions of the WPEA, <span class="Italic">Day v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DAY_THOMAS_F_DC_1221_12_0528_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_CONCURRING_AND_DISSENTING_OPINION_836324.pdf">119 MSPR 589</a>, 2013 MSPB 49 (2013) (Member Robbins concurring in part and dissenting in part), concluded that the expanded definition of the term "disclosure" as set forth in (f)(1) and (2) could properly be applied to cases pending at the time of the WPEA's enactment. <span class="Italic">Nasuti v. Dept. of State</span>, 120 MSPR 588, 591-92 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-6, 2014 MSPB 12 (2014), affirmed application of portions of the WPEA to cases pending with the Board on the WPEA effective date and went on to clarify what the Board believed was a misconstruction of its interpretation of preexisting law:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant portion of section 101 of the WPEA, which has been codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f), provides that a disclosure shall not be excluded from the coverage of the WPEA because it was made to a supervisor or to a person who participated in an activity that the discloser reasonably believed evidenced any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(1)(A); Pub. L. No. 112-199, &#x00A7; 101, 126 Stat. 1465, 1466 (2012); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). The statute also provides that a disclosure is protected under the WPEA regardless of the individual's motives for making the disclosure, even if the disclosure revealed information that had been previously disclosed, was not made in writing, was made while the employee was off duty, and regardless of the amount of time which has passed since the occurrence of events described in the disclosure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(1)((B)-(F); Pub. L. No. 112-199, &#x00A7; 101, 126 Stat. 1465, 1466 (2012). Finally, section 101 of the WPEA cited by the court in its decision, addresses disclosures made in the normal course of an employee's duties. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2); Pub. L. No. 112-199, &#x00A7; 101, 126 Stat. 1465, 1466 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although section 101, as discussed above, does not specifically address whether a disclosure lacks protection unless it is made to a person with authority to address the problem, the legislative history makes clear that section 101 of the WPEA was intended to reverse any decisions so holding. The Senate Report to the WPEA states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Section 101 of S. 743 overturns several court decisions that narrowed the scope of protected disclosures. For example, in <span class="Italic">Horton v. Department of the Navy</span> [66 F.3d 279 (Fed. Cir. 1995)], the court ruled that disclosures to the alleged wrongdoer are not protected, because the disclosures are not made to persons in a position to remedy the wrongdoing....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">These holdings are contrary to congressional intent for the WPA. The court wrongly focused on whether or not disclosures of wrongdoing were protected, instead of applying the very broad protection required by the plain language of the WPA....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 5 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that it will apply section 101 of the WPEA to cases pending before the Board when the WPEA was enacted. <span class="Italic">See Rumsey v. Department of Justice</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 259, &#x00B6; 14 (2013); <span class="Italic">Day v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6; 26 (2013). Accordingly, we conclude that section 101 of the WPEA applies to this case, and that, under section 101, there is no requirement that the employee make a disclosure to a person who is in a position to remedy the matter disclosed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even without the enactment of the WPEA, we note that, contrary to the Senate Report cited above, neither the Federal Circuit, nor the Board, had recently interpreted the WPA to preclude protection for a disclosure unless it was made to a person with actual authority to remedy the wrongdoing. In <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the court stated that "<span class="Italic">Willis</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 141 F.3d 1139 (Fed. Cir. 1998)] and <span class="Italic">Horton</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 F.3d 279 (Fed. Cir. 1995)] do not require that the reports must be made to a person with actual authority to correct the wrong." "No requirement of actual authority is found in the language of the statute, and we think it is quite clear that reports do not need to be made to those with authority to correct the alleged wrongdoing in order to be protected by the WPA." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board has similarly ruled that complaints to supervisors concerning wrongdoing by other employees, or other matters within the scope of the WPA, may constitute "protected disclosures," even if the supervisor lacks authority to directly correct the wrongdoing, <span id="Page_3636"></span>provided that the disclosure meets the other requirements of the statute. <span class="Italic">Dilorenzo v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 506, &#x00B6; 8 (2006). Whether the appellant's supervisor lacked authority to correct the alleged wrongdoing, or condoned it, does not preclude the appellant's disclosure from WPA protection. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. Accordingly, we conclude that the WPA, even prior to the enactment of section 101 of the WPEA, did not preclude the appellant's disclosure regarding alleged substandard and inadequate body armor from being protected.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Holmes v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-11-0263-B-3, n.5 (NP 4/15/2022) ("The WPEA expanded protection to disclosures made to the alleged wrongdoer and disclosures made during the normal course of duties. <span class="Italic">Day v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18, 26 (2013). The Board has found that this expansion constituted a clarification of--rather than a change in--existing law and, therefore, applied to cases already pending before the Board when it was enacted. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 26. Based on <span class="Italic">Day</span>, the remand administrative judge allowed the appellant to raise an affirmative defense of whistleblower retaliation even though her claim had been struck previously by the initial administrative judge under pre-WPEA law."); <span class="Italic">Heath v. Dept. of Army,</span> DA-1221-12-0654-W-1 (NP 9/11/2013) ("In <span class="Italic">Day</span>, we determined that the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act (WPEA) clarified the scope of what constitutes a protected disclosure under the WPA and held that the WPEA's clarified definition of a protected disclosure applies to cases pending before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2013 MSPB 49, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22, 26. Pursuant to the WPEA, disclosures made to alleged wrongdoers and disclosures made in the normal course of one's job duties are not excluded from the definition of a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(1)-(2); <span class="Italic">Day</span>, 2013 MSPB 49, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-19. Thus, whether or not the appellant made his disclosures within the normal course of his job duties, the appellant's disclosures are not barred by <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the 2012 WPEA, an employee's statement to his supervisor that the supervisor's conduct is inappropriate did not constitute a whistleblowing disclosure, <span class="Italic">Horton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 397, 401-02 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Horton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 F.3d 279 (Fed. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reviewing the appellant's claim that he made protected disclosures prior to the May 17, 1990 letter, we note that they consist mainly of workplace disagreements in which he approached his supervisor or staff members, and requested them to stop conduct which he considered offensive and inappropriate in the workplace, such as the May 16 incident when he requested the staff member to conclude her personal telephone call. The other claimed disclosure was the appellant's reply to his supervisor's November 22, 1989 letter cautioning the appellant for his refusal to listen to her and for "abusive language" in connection with an incident, where he had confronted a staff member in the presence of her husband and caused a shouting match between them and him by his conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's actions described above do not constitute disclosures. To "disclose" is "to expose; to make known; to lay bare; to reveal." <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span>, 417 (5th Ed. 1979). Since the appellant's requests were directed at the individuals engaging in the conduct, which the appellant deemed offensive, such requests did not reveal or uncover government wrongdoing. Similarly, the appellant's reply to his supervisor's caution letter cannot be considered a disclosure since it simply related the appellant's version of the incident with the staff member, as well as his alleged refusal to listen to his supervisor, and was only directed to her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 2302(b)(8) protects disclosures that an employee reasonably believes evidence illegal government activity, gross mismanagement or waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. In this connection, we note that the matters reported by the appellant were relatively trivial in nature and cannot be considered matters which a reasonable person in the appellant's position would believe to evidence any of the above-stated situations set forth at 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), including gross mismanagement and waste of funds<span class="Italic">. See Ramos v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 4 MSPB 446, 4 MSPR 388, 392 n.1 (1980). Accordingly, we find that these alleged disclosures were not protected and thus they do not entitle the appellant to corrective action under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, <span class="Italic">Horton</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Horton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 F.3d 279, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the court concluding that to be protected, disclosures should be made to those who can reasonably be expected to act upon them:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Horton states that he made four protected disclosures before the termination action was initiated on May 16, 1990. The Board found that Mr. Horton's three verbal disclosures made before his May 17 letter were not "whistleblowing" in terms of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). We agree that these actions were not the "disclosure" contemplated by statute, for these criticisms were made directly to the persons about whose behavior Mr. Horton complained, ostensibly for disciplinary or corrective purposes. The purpose of the Whistleblower Protection Act is to encourage disclosure of wrongdoing to persons who may be in a position to act to remedy it, either directly by management authority, or indirectly as in disclosure to the press. Criticism directed to the wrongdoers themselves is not normally viewable as whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the Board held that Mr. Horton's written reply to the Librarian's Letter of Caution early in his employment was not whistleblowing, although the Librarian was his supervisor, for the reply simply related Mr. Horton's version of the events about which he had been cautioned. The issue before the Board was not whether the Librarian had justifiably cautioned Mr. Horton; it was whether his reply was a protected disclosure. We agree that it was not.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reiterated its conclusions about the requisite level of whistleblowing, <span class="Italic">Randles v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3069):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Board, Dr. Randles alleged to have made his disclosures only to superiors and co-workers. The WPA does not protect disclosures to individuals who themselves are the subject of the disclosures. To rise to the level of a protected disclosure, the disclosure must be more than mere criticism directed to wrongdoers or supervisors who have no belief that the disclosure would result in disciplinary action against them.... The record shows no objections to any higher authority or outside audience.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board also concluded that disclosures to wrongdoers did not constitute whistleblowing, <span class="Italic">Visconti v. EPA</span>, 78 MSPR 17, 23 n.4 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant's disclosures could be interpreted as indirectly suggesting that the section chief was not doing his job, the disclosures were made to the alleged wrongdoer, rather than to persons who may have been in a position to act on and remedy them. This is not normally viewed as whistleblowing activity. <span class="Italic">See Horton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 F.3d 279, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("Criticism directed to the wrongdoers is not normally viewable as whistleblowing."); <span class="Italic">Woodford v. Department of the Army,</span> 75 MSPR 350, 359-60 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The lack of protection for disclosures to wrongdoers was reconfirmed in <span class="Italic">Huffman v. OPM</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1347-50 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (on order remanding the case to the AJ for further consideration, <span class="Italic">Huffman v. OPM</span>, 92 MSPR 429 (2002)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA makes it a prohibited personnel action to take or fail to take a personnel action because of "<span class="Italic">any</span> disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences--(i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) (1994) (emphasis added). Petitioner correctly points out that this language--"any disclosure"--was deliberately broad. The predecessor version of the current statute, enacted by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, was narrower, reciting that it was only a prohibited personnel action to take or fail to take a personnel action because of "<span class="Italic">a</span> disclosure of information by an employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) (Supp. III 1979) (emphasis added).[1] The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 amended this language to broaden the scope of disclosures covered by the WPA from "<span class="Italic">a</span> disclosure" to "<span class="Italic">any</span> disclosure." Pub. L. No. 101-12, &#x00A7; 4(a)(3), 103 Stat. 32 (emphases added). The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, explained the change as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Committee intends that disclosures be encouraged. The OSC, the Board and the courts should not erect barriers to disclosures which will limit the necessary flow of information from employees who have knowledge of government wrongdoing. For example, it is inappropriate for disclosures to be protected only if they are made for certain purposes or to certain employees or only if the employee is the first to raise the issue. [The Senate bill] emphasizes this point by changing the phrase "a disclosure" to "any disclosure" in the statutory definition. This is simply to stress that any disclosure is protected (if it meets the requisite reasonable belief test and is not required to be kept confidential).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 100-413, at 13 (1988) (italics in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;This legislative history of this law relates to a version of the WPA that President Reagan pocket-vetoed after the 100th Congress adjourned. In the 101st Congress, the WPA was reintroduced, passed, and signed into law on April 17, 1989. Congress did not release committee reports, but it is proper for us to look to the legislative history from the 100th Congress for guidance in interpreting the WPA, because the language did not change. <span class="Italic">See Amin v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 951 F.2d 1247, 1250 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress later amended section 2302 and other sections of the WPA in 1994.... [W]e note that the committees in 1994 criticized the Board for continuing to take a narrow view of what constitutes a protected disclosure. For example, the House report for the 1994 amendment stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Perhaps the most troubling precedents involve the Board's inability to understand that "any" means "any." The WPA protects "any" disclosure evidencing a reasonable belief of specified misconduct, a cornerstone to which the MSPB remains blind. The only restrictions are for classified information or material the release of which is specifically prohibited by statute. Employees must disclose that <span id="Page_3637"></span>type of information through confidential channels to maintain protection; otherwise there are no exceptions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">H.R. Rep. 103-769, at 18 (1994). So too the Senate report stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As indicated above, the plain language of the Whistleblower Protection Act extends to retaliation for "any disclosure," regardless of the setting of the disclosure, the form of the disclosure, or the person to whom the disclosure is made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 103-358, at 11 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 USCCAN 3549, 3559.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our decisions in <span class="Italic">Willis</span> and <span class="Italic">Horton,</span> we held that the WPA does not apply where an employee makes complaints to the employee's supervisor about the supervisor's own conduct. In <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, the aggrieved employee--William Willis--sent letters to his supervisor in which Willis was critical of the supervisor. <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, 141 F.3d at 1141. The agency thereafter ordered Willis to be reassigned, but he refused to accept the assignment and eventually retired<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. This court held that Willis's letters to his supervisor did not qualify as protected disclosures. In so holding, this court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Discussion and even disagreement with supervisors over job-related activities is a normal part of most occupations. It is entirely ordinary for an employee to fairly and reasonably disagree with a supervisor who overturns the employee's decision. In complaining to his supervisors, Willis has done no more than voice his dissatisfaction with his superiors' decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1143. The court therefore held that "Willis's disclosures to his immediate supervisors are not protected disclosures for the purposes of the WPA." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Horton</span>, the appellant--John Horton--had previously criticized the behavior of several fellow library staff members, including his supervisor, to the staff members themselves as well as to his supervisor. <span class="Italic">Horton</span>, 66 F.3d at 281. Mr. Horton's supervisor issued several warnings, at least one of which in writing, to Mr. Horton based on what the supervisor perceived as a confrontational attitude. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. After an incident in which Mr. Horton allegedly had a "tantrum" regarding a fellow library staff member, the supervisor initiated a removal action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This court held that Mr. Horton's verbal and written criticisms "were not the 'disclosure' contemplated by statute, for these criticisms were made directly to the persons about whose behavior Mr. Horton complained." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 282. We further noted that an allegation "directed to the wrongdoers themselves is not normally viewable as whistleblowing" under the WPA and that criticism directed directly at the wrongdoers does not further the purpose of the WPA "to encourage disclosure of wrongdoing to persons who may be in a position to act to remedy it, either directly by management authority, or indirectly as in disclosure to the press." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "disclosure" is defined in <span class="Italic">Webster's Dictionary</span> as "the act or an instance of disclosing: the act or an instance of opening up to view, knowledge, or comprehension." <span class="Italic">Webster's Third New International Dictionary</span> 645 (1968). That dictionary further defines "disclose" as: "2a: to expose to view...: lay open or uncover (something hidden from view) &#x003C;excavations <span class="Italic">disclosed</span> many artifacts&#x003E; b: to make known: open up to general knowledge." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (italics in original). <span class="Italic">See also Black's Law Dictionary</span> 477 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "disclosure" as: "The act or process of making known something that was previously unknown; a revelation of facts"); <span class="Italic">Random House</span> <span class="Italic">Webster's Unabridged Dictionary</span> 562 (2d ed. 1998) (defining "disclose" as: 1. to make known; reveal or uncover: <span class="Italic">to disclose a secret</span>. 2. to cause to appear; allow to be seen; lay open to view." (italics in original)). In other words, the term "disclosure" means to reveal something that was hidden and not known. It is also quite significant that Congress in the WPA did not use a word with a broader connotation such as "report" or state."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee reports or states that there has been misconduct by a wrongdoer to the wrongdoer, the employee is not making a "disclosure" of misconduct. If the misconduct occurred, the wrongdoer necessarily knew of the conduct already because he is the one that engaged in the misconduct.[2] The policies of the WPA hardly require a different result. The purpose of the statute is to encourage disclosures that are likely to remedy the wrong. <span class="Italic">Horton</span>, 66 F.3d at 282; <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, 141 F.3d at 1143. The wrongdoer is not such a person. Extending the WPA to cover reports to a supervisor of the supervisor's own misconduct would also have drastic adverse consequences. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, "[d]iscussion and even disagreement with supervisors over job-related duties is a normal part of most occupations." <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, 141 F.3d at 1143. If every complaint made to a supervisor concerning an employee's disagreement with the supervisor's actions were considered to be a disclosure protected under the WPA, virtually every employee who was disciplined could claim the protection of the Act. Although Congress intended that the WPA's coverage be broad, we think it unlikely that Congress intended the Act to extend that far, and we hold that it did not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;To be sure, there may be situations where a government employee reports to the wrongdoer that the conduct of the wrongdoer is unlawful or improper, and the wrongdoer, though aware of the conduct, was unaware that it was unlawful or improper. Nonetheless, the report would not be a protected disclosure. It is clear from the statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A), that the disclosure must pertain to the underlying conduct, rather than to the asserted fact of its unlawfulness or impropriety, in order for the disclosure to be protected by the WPA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) refers to "any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant <span class="Italic">which the employee or applicant</span> <span class="Italic">reasonably believes</span> evidences...a violation of any law, rule, or regulation (Emphasis added).</p>
