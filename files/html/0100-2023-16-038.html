<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-39"><span class="space">15.</span> Impassed Proposals; Incomplete Negotiations; Maintenance of <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Status Quo</span></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Refusal to accede to a union proposal does not alone demonstrate bad faith bargaining. The totality of the circumstances must be examined, including: the reasons for management's actions, its interest in avoiding inconsistent agency positions, and its interest in seeing an issue resolved in litigation pending in a court. <span class="Italic">Delaware NG and ACT, Delaware Chap.</span>, 10 FLRA 135, 145-46 (1982) (ALJ Decision). The agency is not required to agree to a particular proposal as part of its duty to bargain, and the union cannot insist that management relinquish that right through the negotiation process. 5 USC 7103(a)(12). Assuming that a proposal is within the duty to bargain, i.e., a proposal relating to conditions of employment that is not barred by management rights or government-wide or agency regulations supported by a compelling need, the remedy lies with the FSIP if the parties do not agree to the proposal. As to a proposal that is barred by a statutory condition, no agreement can be compelled. But refusal to agree cannot be wholly arbitrary. The refusal of an agency to approve a contract as a result of the agency's objection to a provision determined by FLRA to be negotiable in related cases constituted bad faith bargaining. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army and Air Force Nat'l Guard Bureau and ACT Montana Air Chap. 29</span>, 10 FLRA 553, 555 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to maintenance of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> during bargaining, FLRA's position, taken from the 1999 <span class="Italic">INS</span> case, <span class="Italic">post</span>, and other decisions that follow appears to be, in summary:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">an agency may lawfully implement changes when necessary to correct an unlawful practice;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">an agency that implements a change in order to correct an unlawful practice is only obligated to bargain after implementation over the impact and implementation of the change;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">an agency may lawfully implement a change when a union's proposals in response to the change are outside the agency's duty to bargain, e.g., where all union proposals are contrary to law, rule, or regulation, or the proposals concern matters that are already covered by an agreement between the parties<span class="Italic">, </span>or when the impact of the change on the conditions of employment of unit employees is <span class="Italic">de minimis;</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">a union may consent to a proposed change in conditions of employment, either explicitly through agreement or implicitly through action or inaction;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">an agency may implement changes in conditions of employment when a union fails to request bargaining within a reasonable period of time after being notified of proposed changes, fails to bargain, or fails to timely invoke the services of the Panel after the parties have reached impasse;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">when lawful implementation occurs because a union fails to request bargaining, the changes must be consistent with the changes of which the union was notified;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">an agency is required to delay making proposed changes to working conditions not only while bargaining is ongoing, but also after an impasse in bargaining has been reached, during FMCS and FSIP-related impasse procedures;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the agency is required to give the union appropriate notice that it considers bargaining at an impasse and that it intends to implement the proposed change in working conditions;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">once parties have reached an impasse in their negotiations and one party timely invokes the services of the FSIP, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> must be maintained to the maximum extent possible, i.e.,<span class="Italic"> </span>to the extent consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, in order to allow the Panel to take whatever action is deemed appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-61.html">73 FLRA 315</a>, 319 (2022) (Chairman DuBester concurring), while the parties are negotiating a successor agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(5) requires an agency to fulfill its statutory obligation to bargain in good faith over conditions of employment, which encompasses bargaining over the terms of a successor CBA.[41] Further, the Authority has held an agency violates &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5) when it fails to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> until the completion of bargaining.[42] The Arbitrator found the Agency implemented the Order prior to completing bargaining on six unresolved articles of the successor CBA, and the contract language implemented was inconsistent with the 2010 CBA. Therefore, the Agency's failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> until completing bargaining on the successor CBA was a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5) of the Statute. As such, we grant the Union's exception, and modify the merits award to include a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5).</p>

Separate provisions of the Statute are violated if working conditions are changed without justification during a period of negotiation or following a request for assistance from FSIP. A request for help from FSIP is not a precondition to a ULP charging the employer with an unlawful change of working conditions in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1, 5) during the negotiations and prior to impasse.

<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Introduction</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Statute, there are two distinct unfair labor practices that relate specifically to an agency's conduct of negotiations leading to a collective bargaining agreement. Section 7116(a)(5) provides that it is an unfair labor practice "to refuse to consult or negotiate in good faith with a labor organization as required by this chapter[.]" Section 7116(a)(6) more specifically provides that an agency may not "fail or refuse to cooperate in impasse procedures and impasse decisions as required by this chapter[.]" The Authority has long recognized that these separate provisions are interrelated because "the impasse resolution procedures of the Panel comprise one aspect of the collective bargaining process" referred to in section 7116(a)(5).[6] <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, 18 FLRA at 472.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Thus, an agency's refusal to cooperate in impasse proceedings is also considered a violation of the general duty to bargain stated in section 7116(a)(5). <span class="Italic">BATF, </span>18 FLRA at 472. For this reason, a finding of a violation of section 7116(a)(6) is nearly always accompanied by a finding of a violation of section 7116(a)(5). <span class="Italic">Id. But cf. U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Washington, D.C.</span>, 48 FLRA 306, 312 n.3 (1993) (<span class="Italic">EEOC I</span>) (respondent's failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>after impasse reached and union filed timely request for Panel assistance <span class="Italic">alleged </span>to violate section 7116(a)(6) but not section 7116(a)(5)); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban</span> <span class="Italic">Development and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban</span> <span class="Italic">Development, Kansas City Region, Kansas City, Missouri, 23</span> FLRA 435 (1986) <span class="Italic">(HUD) </span>(same). In such cases, the violation of section 7116(a)(5) is "derivative" of the section 7116(a)(6) violation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, and Social Security</span> <span class="Italic">Administration, Field Operations, Region II, </span>35 FLRA 940, 949-51 (1990) <span class="Italic">(SSA II). </span>As discussed in more detail <span class="Italic">infra</span>, however, the reverse is not true. For example, in cases where the Panel is not involved, a change in conditions of employment may constitute an "independent" violation of section 7116(a)(5); section 7116(a)(6) is not involved in such cases<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland, </span>39 FLRA 258, 262-63 (1991). In addition, a failure to maintain <span class="Italic">the status quo </span>after impasse has been reached and a timely request for assistance has been filed with the Panel violates section 7116(a)(5) even in situations where no violation of section 7116(a)(6) is alleged. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration, </span>35 FLRA 296,302 (1990) <span class="Italic">(SSA I).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our examination of the record in this case and applicable precedent makes evident that the Authority has not consistently defined the elements necessary to establish a violation of section 7116(a)(6). The Judge stated that a respondent is required to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>"[o]nce parties <span id="Page_1262"></span>reach an impasse...and one party timely invokes the services of the Panel...." Judge's Decision at 7-8 <span class="Italic">(citing BATF, </span>18 FLRA at 468-69). The Respondent agrees with the Judge's statement of precedent, and asserts that these two elements--existence of an impasse and timely invocation of Panel assistance--are necessary preconditions to any finding that a respondent has failed to "cooperate in impasse procedures and decisions," within the meaning of section 7116(a)(6). Despite the Judge's recitation of the standard as requiring an impasse, however, the Judge made no finding that the parties had reached impasse in this case--a failure that, according to the Respondent, was improper and constituted error....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Resolving the Respondent's exceptions requires us to determine what it means to "fail or refuse to cooperate in impasse procedures and decisions" under section 7116(a)(6). The question squarely presented is whether the mere filing of a request for Panel assistance is sufficient to establish that an agency's failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>constitutes an unfair labor practice under section 7116(a)(6). For the reasons fully explained below, we conclude that the General Counsel must establish more than the facts that implementation occurred at a time when a request for assistance was pending before the Panel: the General Counsel must establish that the implementation failed to cooperate with an impasse procedure or decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We emphasize that finding a violation of section 7116(a)(6) in circumstances where implementation occurs at a time when a request for Panel assistance is pending is unnecessary to enforce the obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>because such obligation is enforced under section 7116(a)(5). Therefore, as the approach to determining violations of section 7116(a)(5) remains unchanged, the modification adopted today to the framework for resolving section 7116(a)(6) claims does not, in any way, expand an agency's right to implement changes in conditions of employment prior to completing bargaining over the changes and participating in impasse procedures. In particular, the modification leaves undisturbed Authority precedent that finds it unlawful for an agency to implement changes in conditions of employment prior to the completion of bargaining, except in specific circumstances. We emphasize this here because it is misapprehended by the dissent, and we do not want our decision to leave agencies and exclusive representatives with any uncertainty on this central point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section IV.B. of this decision sets forth the doctrine that has been developed in Authority decisions for resolving complaints alleging that an agency violated section 7116(a)(5) and (a)(6) of the Statute by failing to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo, </span>and certain problems that have arisen in the application of that doctrine. In section IV.C. of this decision, we explain why a separate, implied obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>under section 7116(a)(6) is neither necessary nor supported by the wording, policies, or purposes of the Statute. In section IV.D., we explain the approach we will follow in deciding this and future cases where it is necessary to determine compliance with section 7116(a)(6). The modified framework we adopt is intended to both clarify the parties' obligations in circumstances such as those presented in this case, and to strengthen the Panel's important statutory role in assisting the parties to resolve negotiation impasses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Both Section 7116(a)(6) and Section 7116(a)(5) Have Been Interpreted to Require Maintenance of the <span class="Italic">Status Quo</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Agencies are required to complete negotiations and impasse procedures prior to making changes in working conditions, with certain exceptions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is a long established principle that "the duty to bargain under the Statute requires that a party meet its obligation to negotiate prior to making changes in established conditions of employment[.]" <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, 18 FLRA at 467<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., U.S. Immigration and Naturalization</span> <span class="Italic">Service, United States Border Patrol, San Diego Sector</span> <span class="Italic">San Diego, California, </span>43 FLRA 642, 652-53 (1991), <span class="Italic">enforced </span>12 F.3d 882 (9th Cir. 1993) <span class="Italic">(INS, San Diego). </span>This rule parallels the practice in the private sector under the National Labor Relations Act, where employers are also required to maintain working conditions during the course of bargaining. <span class="Italic">See National Labor</span> <span class="Italic">Relations Board v. Katz, </span>369 U.S. 736 (1962). <span class="Italic">See generally</span> Hardin, <span class="Italic">Developing Labor Law</span> 596-601 (3d Ed. 1995) (Hardin).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The federal sector collective bargaining scheme contains distinctive procedures not present in the private sector, including procedures for the resolution of bargaining impasses. These impasse resolution devices are intended to facilitate and, if necessary, impose, a resolution of impasses.[7] Chief among the impasse resolution devices contained in the Statute is the Panel, "whose job it is to suggest and if necessary, order terms of settlement between agencies and unions when they cannot agree." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA, </span>778 F.2d 850, 852 (D.C. Cir. 1985). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7119.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;In the private sector, bargaining impasses may remain unresolved, and parties may attempt to resolve them through economic tactics such as strikes and the unilateral implementation of changed working conditions by employers. <span class="Italic">See</span> Hardin at 696-97; <span class="Italic">see generally, National Labor Relations Board v. Insurance Agents International Union, </span>361 486, 488-89 (describing the role of economic weapons in private sector bargaining).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One result of the additional impasse resolution procedures imposed by the Statute is that an agency is required to delay making proposed changes to working conditions not only while bargaining is ongoing, but also after an impasse in bargaining has been reached, during impasse procedures. <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, 18 FLRA at 468. The agency is required to give the union appropriate notice that it considers bargaining at an impasse and that it intends to implement the proposed change in working conditions. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Immigration and Naturalization</span> <span class="Italic">Service, </span>24 FLRA 786, 790 (1986) <span class="Italic">(INS I); U.S. Customs Service, </span>16 FLRA 198, 200 (1984). Such notice provides the union reasonable opportunity to seek Panel assistance before the agency implements the change. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, the Authority has held that, "once parties have reached an impasse in their negotiations and one party timely invokes the services of the Panel, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> must be maintained to the maximum extent possible, <span class="Italic">i.e., </span>to the extent consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, in order to allow the Panel to take whatever action is deemed appropriate." <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, 18 FLRA at 469. In <span class="Italic">BATF, </span>the Authority held that the respondent violated both 7116(a)(5) and (a)(6) by implementing certain changes after the parties had reached impasse and the union had timely requested the Panel's assistance; the Authority also held, however, that the respondent's failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> did not violate either (a)(5) or (a)(6) as to other changes over which the respondent was not obligated to bargain<span class="Italic">. Id. </span>at 470.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to permitting an agency to implement changes when consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, the Authority has recognized other circumstances in which an agency may implement changed working conditions without violating section 7116(a)(5), in each of which the agency implements at its peril if the exception asserted by the agency is determined not to apply.[8] Similar defenses have been held to be available in cases alleging violations of section 7116(a)(6).[9] The Authority also has recognized that a union may consent to a proposed change in conditions of employment, either explicitly through agreement or implicitly through action or inaction. Thus, an agency may implement changes in conditions of employment when a union fails to request bargaining within a reasonable period of time after being notified of proposed changes, fails to bargain, or fails to timely invoke the services of the Panel after the parties have reached impasse. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">INS I, </span>24 FLRA at 790. In these situations, the agency has, in effect, <span class="Italic">satisfied </span>its bargaining obligation.[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;First, an agency may lawfully implement changes in conditions of employment when it is not obligated to bargain over the change. For example, an agency is not obligated to bargain over a change when the impact of the change on the conditions of employment of unit employees is <span class="Italic">de minimis. See Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire,</span> 45 FLRA 574, 576 (1992). Second, an agency may lawfully implement a change when a union's proposals in response to the change are outside the agency's duty to bargain. For example, where all union proposals are contrary to law, rule, or regulation, or the proposals concern matters that are already covered by an agreement between the parties, the agency is not required to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo. See, e.g., U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 39 FLRA 258, 262-63 (1991). Third, an agency may lawfully implement changes when necessary to correct an unlawful practice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, Conservation Division,</span> <span class="Italic">Gulf of Mexico Region, Metairie, Louisiana, </span>9 FLRA 543, 568 n.9 (1982). In this regard, an agency that implements a change in order to correct an unlawful practice is only obligated to bargain after implementation over the impact and implementation of the change. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Air Force, Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force Logistics Command, Ogden Air Logistics Center Hill</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force Base, Utah</span>, 17 FLRA 394 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Washington, D.C.</span>, 52 FLRA 459 (1996) (<span class="Italic">EEOC II</span>) (failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>after impasse was reached and union had filed request for Panel assistance did not violate the Statute where the matter over which the union sought to bargain was covered by the parties' collective bargaining agreement); <span class="Italic">EEOC I, </span>48 FLRA at 310 (Authority rejected on the merits the respondent's defense that it was not obligated to bargain over change implemented after impasse was reached and a request for Panel assistance was filed because effect of change on unit employee's conditions of employment was <span class="Italic">de minimis);</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, 42</span> FLRA 266, 271 (1991) <span class="Italic">(Air Force) </span>(Authority rejected on the merits the respondent's assertion that it was not obligated to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>after impasse was reached and a request for Panel assistance was filed because the union had waived its right to bargain over the change); <span class="Italic">BATF, </span>18 FLRA at 470 (Authority found that failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> as <span id="Page_1263"></span>to certain matters after impasse was reached and a request for Panel assistance was filed did not violate the Statute because the respondent had no obligation to bargain over those matters). We note that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">INS II, </span>44 FLRA at 1073, that the respondent was obligated to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>after impasse was reached and a request for Panel assistance was filed despite existence of a negotiability dispute over the union's proposals. <span class="Italic">Department of Justice, </span>995 F.2d at 48.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;When lawful implementation occurs because a union fails to request bargaining, the changes must be consistent with the changes of which the union was notified. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Customs Service</span>, 16 FLRA 198 (1981). When lawful implementation occurs because the parties have reached impasse and the union has failed to timely request the Panel's services, the changes may not exceed those encompassed by the agency's last proposal to the union. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,</span> <span class="Italic">Philadelphia District, </span>A/SLMR No. 673 (1976).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2. The Authority's standard for determining whether a failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> violate section 7116(a)(6) has been stated and applied inconsistently</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, 18 FLRA 466, the Authority held that an agency's implementation of changed working conditions when the parties had bargained to impasse and the matter was before the Panel violated both the general duty to bargain, enforced by section 7116(a)(5) of the Statute, and the specific duty to cooperate in impasse procedures, enforced by section 7116(a)(6) of the Statute. Because the obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> under section 7116(a)(5) was clear, <span class="Italic">BATF </span>did not impose any added obligations on agencies or unions. However, in requesting that the Authority issue a general ruling clarifying the parties' duties in this context, the Panel stated that unions interpreted <span class="Italic">BATF</span> as "prohibiting an agency from implementing a change in working conditions <span class="Italic">only</span> when the union involved has filed a request for Panel assistance." <span class="Italic">Order Denying</span> <span class="Italic">Request for General Ruling, </span>31 FLRA 1294 (1988) (emphasis added). In other words, according to the Panel, parties read <span class="Italic">BATF</span> as permitting implementation of changes in conditions of employment unless Panel assistance had been requested, without any requirement that there be an impasse in bargaining and without regard to the language of the <span class="Italic">BATF</span> decision indicating, that the obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>enforced by section 7116(a)(6) arose "once the parties had reached impasse and one party had invoked the services of the Panel[.]" <span class="Italic">BATF, </span>18 FLRA at 469. As the Panel described the effect of the unions' interpretation of <span class="Italic">BATF, </span>"labor organizations have filed...requests [with the Panel] in order to delay implementation of changes in working conditions." <span class="Italic">Order Denying Request for</span> <span class="Italic">General Ruling, </span>31 FLRA at 1294.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the requirement stated in <span class="Italic">BATF </span>that existence of an impasse is a prerequisite to enforcement of any obligation under section 7116(a)(6) to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo, </span>in at least one case decided subsequent to <span class="Italic">BATF, </span>the Authority held that the agency had violated section 7116(a)(6) by failing to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> despite the finding that the parties had not reached impasse at the time of the change. <span class="Italic">See VA, Decatur,</span> 46 FLRA at 345-46. The apparent departure in this decision from the impasse requirement set forth in <span class="Italic">BATF </span>was not acknowledged or explained by the Authority. In other cases, the fact that parties had reached impasse was noted in the Authority's decision but not relied on in finding a violation of section 7116(a)(6). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Department of Health and Human</span> <span class="Italic">Services, Social Security Administration, and Social</span> <span class="Italic">Security Administration, Field Operations, Region II, 35</span> FLRA 940, 948-51 (1990) <span class="Italic">(SSA II). </span>In yet another case, the Authority acknowledged that, under <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, <span class="Italic">the status quo </span>must be maintained "[o]nce parties reach an impasse in their negotiations and one party timely invokes the services of the Panel," but found a violation of section 7116(a)(6) without making any findings as to whether the parties had reached impasse at the time of the union's request for Panel assistance. <span class="Italic">See Air Force,</span> 42 FLRA 266.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">BATF</span> framework, as it has been implemented by the parties and the Authority and followed by the parties, implies that the invocation of the services of the Panel creates a new obligation on the part of the agency to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo. </span>However, the obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>that arises from the duty to bargain remains constant throughout the bargaining process. As noted above, it does not exist in circumstances where there is no duty to bargain, and it may be relieved by a union's failure to request bargaining, to bargain, or to request assistance of the Panel once a genuine impasse has been declared. Apart from <span class="Italic">VA</span>, <span class="Italic">Decatur,</span> however, there is no basis on which to conclude that the duty to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>turns solely on whether a party has, perhaps precipitously, filed a request for assistance with the Panel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts of this case illustrate the difficulties resulting from this inconsistent Authority precedent.&#x2003;The Respondent announced its proposed change in working conditions on May 20, 1992, and, for reasons that are contested, the parties engaged in only the most preliminary exchange of positions over the next 4 months. The Respondent unilaterally implemented the change on October 1, alleging that the Union's failure to bargain relieved it of its obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent never denied an obligation to bargain over the Manual.&#x2003;Nor did the Respondent assert that the parties were at impasse. Nevertheless, on receiving notice of the Respondent's intent to implement the Manual, the Union filed a request for assistance with the Panel. The Union took this action despite <span class="Italic">its</span>--the Union's--position that negotiations should continue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither party has asserted that, at either the time of the Union's request for Panel assistance or the time of the Respondent's implementation of the Manual, negotiations were at a stalemate. Instead, the parties' dispute has centered on "who was responsible for...preventing negotiations[.]" As such, this dispute would properly be resolved as an allegation--and consideration of any defenses thereto--that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(5) by failing to bargain in good faith. Nevertheless, the unfair labor practice complaint alleges that the Respondent violated sections 7116(a)(1), (5), and (6) of the Statute by "unilaterally implementing the changes [in working conditions described]...while the matter was pending before the Panel." In describing this theory of the Respondent's violation, the Judge found "irrelevant" considerations of "who was responsible for the failure to reach agreement on ground rules and therefore for preventing negotiations over the impact and implementation of the Respondent's decision to issue the new Manual."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent asserts that the Judge erred in not requiring proof that an impasse had been reached.[12] The General Counsel, the Charging Party, and the dissent, in contrast, view proof of impasse as unnecessary. In considering whether the Authority should follow the weight of its precedent, and find a violation of section 7116(a)(6) only in situations where an impasse has been reached (and a timely request for assistance has been filed with the Panel), or whether the Authority should agree with the General Counsel and follow <span class="Italic">VA</span>, <span class="Italic">Decatur</span> to find that an impasse is not necessary, it has become apparent that the premise of Authority precedent--that section 7116(a)(6) enforces an <span class="Italic">implied </span>obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>apart from any Panel procedure or decision--is itself problematic. Because, as discussed below, there is no support in the Statute for finding this implied obligation, and because it is unnecessary to do so in order to effectuate an agency's obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo, </span>we modify the Authority's framework to be applied in this and future cases for resolving complaints alleging violations of section 7116(a)(6) based on implementation of changes in conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;We note that basing the agency's obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> on both the existence of an impasse and proper invocation of Panel procedures would require the Authority to determine whether the parties had reached impasse at the time of the union's request for Panel assistance or whether the union's request was premature. There are significant difficulties with such a rule, which would place the Authority in the position of making determinations regarding such matters as whether, and when, parties have exhausted voluntary efforts to reach agreement and whether, and when, the Panel asserted or acquired jurisdiction over an impasse. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 CFR &#x00A7; 2470.2(e) (Panel's regulations define "impasse" as "that point in the negotiation of conditions of employment at which the parties are unable to reach agreement, notwithstanding their efforts to do so by direct negotiations and by the use of mediation or other voluntary arrangements for settlement."). In particular, these determinations involve issues that existing Panel processes do not inform. For example, we are aware of no requirement that the Panel make public its determinations regarding jurisdiction over requests for its assistance and, in this case, there is no evidence that, prior to the issuance of its decision resolving the ground-rules dispute in this case, the Panel stated whether it had jurisdiction. In addition, extensive fact-finding would appear necessary to make these determinations. For reasons set forth in this decision, it is unnecessary for the Authority to undertake such determinations, which the statutory scheme dictates be made in the first instance by the Panel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Nothing in the Statute indicates that a separate, implied obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> is imposed by section 7116(a)(6)</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1. The express terms of the Statute do not impose a separate, implied obligation under section 7116(a)(6)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the terms of the Statute and its purposes and policies persuades us that preventing the implementation of changes in conditions of employment prior to the completion of bargaining is an objective of the general duty to bargain enforced by section 7116(a)(5), and that nothing in section 7116(a)(6) separately requires an agency to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>in situations, such as the one now before us, where the Panel has not directed the agency to do so in its procedures or in a decision. Although the policy requiring maintenance of the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>where an impasse is pending before the Panel is indisputably <span id="Page_1264"></span>compelling, Authority decisions have not explained why the policy is not adequately accomplished by the requirement to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>under section 7116(a)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(5) requires an agency to fulfill its statutory obligation to bargain in good faith. That obligation encompasses, in turn, bargaining over terms and conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 USC &#x00A7; 7106(a)(12). The long-standing precedent that an agency violates its obligation to bargain when it unilaterally implements changes in conditions of employment is firmly rooted in these statutory provisions. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service, Region 1, Boston, Massachusetts</span>, 1 FLRA 398, 409 (1979) ("an agency and the exclusive representative shall meet and confer in good faith with respect to...matters affecting working conditions....&#8197;An agency is not permitted to alter or change such working conditions without first notifying the collective bargaining representative...and, upon request, bargaining about such proposed changes before they are put into effect.") <span class="Italic">(citing U.S. Army Finance and</span> <span class="Italic">Accounting Center Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, Indiana, </span>A/SLMR No. 651 (1976)). That is, except in the limited circumstances discussed above, <span class="Italic">supra n.8,</span> an agency's obligation to bargain in good faith includes the obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>until completion of bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, we find no support in the words of the Statute itself, or its legislative history, for reading into section 7116(a)(6) a separate requirement to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>merely because a request for assistance has been filed with the Panel. In this regard, section 7116(a)(6) states that it is an unfair labor practice "to fail or refuse to <span class="Italic">cooperate </span>in impasse <span class="Italic">procedures</span> and impasse <span class="Italic">decisions" </span>(emphasis added). Where these procedures or decisions direct the maintenance of the <span class="Italic">status quo, </span>a refusal to act in accordance with such direction is clearly a refusal to cooperate with the procedures or decisions. However, in the absence of such direction, there appears to be no foundation for inferring it. Nothing in the plain wording of section 7116(a)(6) supports a conclusion that a separate, implied obligation, in addition to that in section 7116(a)(5), is imposed. Moreover, the legislative history is silent on this matter, and the Authority has not explained how an implied requirement is grounded in section 7116(a)(6) of the Statute.[13]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;Similarly, although the requirement under existing Authority case law to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>once the Panel is involved in impasse resolution has been referenced in judicial decisions, no court has examined the propriety of, or the necessity for, the requirement, or has indicated whether this obligation emanates from section 7116(a)(5) or (a)(6). <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Department of Justice, </span>995 F.2d at 47-48 ("While a matter is pending before the Impasses Panel, under FLRA rule the parties must maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>to the extent consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency.") <span class="Italic">(citing BATF,</span> 18 FLRA 466); <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees v. FLRA, </span>893 F.2d 380, 382 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">NAGE v. FLRA</span>) ("Had the union properly invoked the services of the Impasses Panel, any...failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo (to</span> the extent consistent with its functions) would have been, under the Authority's rulings, an unfair labor practice in violation or 5 USC &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (5), and (6).") (<span class="Italic">citing BATF</span>, 18 FLRA at 469).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority noted in <span class="Italic">BATF, </span>18 FLRA at 468-69, the finding that an obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>after an impasse has been reached and a timely request for Panel assistance has been filed originates in decisions of the Federal Labor Relations Council under Executive Order 11491 that were intended to effectuate the policy of the Executive Order to foster stability in the Federal labor-management relations program.<span class="Italic"> See Internal Revenue Service, </span>6 FLRC 311, 313 n.3, 320 (1978) (after impasse and timely invocation of Panel processes, agency is required to maintain <span class="Italic">status quo </span>to the maximum extent possible). Unlike the Statute, there was no express requirement under Executive Order 11491 to comply with Panel procedures and decisions. That is, there was no equivalent to section 7116(a)(6) of the Statute. However, consistent with the holding that the impasse resolution process operated as an aspect of the overall obligation to bargain under the Executive Order, a failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>after impasse was reached and a timely request for Panel assistance was filed was held to violate section 19(a)(6) of the Executive Order, which prohibited a refusal to "consult, confer, or negotiate with a labor organization as required by [the] Order." <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Statute, as under the Executive Order, it is clear that "[t]he impasse resolution procedures of the Panel operate as one aspect of the collective bargaining, or negotiation, process." <span class="Italic">Department of Energy, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 124, 129 (1995), <span class="Italic">reversed on other grounds sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Department of Energy v. FLRA, </span>106 F.3d 1158 (4th Cir. 1997). Thus, the requirement to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>pending completion of bargaining, which is firmly rooted in the statutory obligation to engage in collective bargaining, as enforced in section 7116(a)(5), continues through impasse resolution<span class="Italic">. See INS, San Diego, </span>43 FLRA at 653. In fact, we are not aware of any case (where the complaint alleged a violation of both section 7116(a)(5) and (6)) in which a violation of the existing implied obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>under section 7116(a)(6) has not also been found to violate section 7116(a)(5)<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., SSA II, </span>35 FLRA at 949-51.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The purposes and policies of the Statute do not support imposition of a separate, implied obligation under section 7116(a)(6)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are several respects in which the creation of a separate, implied obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> arising from section 7116(a)(6) does not promote the purposes and policies of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, it has led to confusion in unfair labor practice litigation. As Authority precedent demonstrates, disputes involving failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> after impasse has been reached and the Panel's assistance has been timely sought have in some cases been litigated as alleged violations of section 7116(a)(5) alone. <span class="Italic">See SSA I</span>, 35 FLRA at 302. Other unfair labor practice complaints have alleged violations of section 7116(a)(6) only. <span class="Italic">See HUD, </span>23 FLRA 435. Still other complaints, including the one now before us, alleged violations of both section 7116(a)(5) and (a)(6). In some cases where both section 7116(a)(5) and section 7116(a)(6) were allegedly violated by a failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo, </span>the alleged section 7116(a)(5) violation was "independent" of the alleged section 7116(a)(6) violation; in others the alleged violation of section 7116(a)(5) was "derivative" of the alleged violation of section 7116(a)(6). <span class="Italic">Compare U.S. Department of the Air Force,</span> <span class="Italic">375th Combat Support Group, Scott Air Force Base,</span> <span class="Italic">Illinois, </span>49 FLRA 1444 (1994) (section 7116(a)(5) independent of section 7116(a)(6)) <span class="Italic">with DHHS, </span>35 FLRA at 949-51 (section 7116(a)(5) derivative of section 7116(a)(6)). Indeed, in the complaint now before us, it will be necessary on remand to determine whether what was found to be a "derivative" violation may be an "independent" violation. <span class="Italic">See</span> note 21, <span class="Italic">infra.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case also provides another example of the confusion in prosecuting--and defending--alleged violations of section 7116(a)(6) under Authority precedent. The Respondent defends its implementation of the Manual by arguing that the Union's request for Panel assistance was premature. However, in attempting to excuse its implementation under section 7116(a)(6)--by asserting that the parties had not bargained to impasse--the agency's argument may actually establish that the implementation was unlawful under section 7116(a)(5). Conversely, the Union believed, and continues to assert, that it was obligated to request Panel assistance to forestall unilateral implementation....&#8197;However, the Respondent did not assert at the time of implementation, and does not now assert, that the parties bargained to impasse. In fact, as noted above, the Respondent maintains that the parties had <span class="Italic">not </span>bargained to impasse at the time of implementation. Accordingly, the Union was clearly mistaken: it was under no obligation under existing case law to seek Panel assistance in order to forestall implementation of the Manual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As is apparent from the Union's actions in this case, grounding an agency's obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> in <span class="Italic">both</span> section 7116(a)(5) and (a)(6) not only encourages, but also in the Charging Party's view requires, unions to file requests for Panel assistance in order to preserve a legal argument, rather than because the Panel's services are actually needed. As noted above, a union is required to request Panel assistance in one circumstance: upon receiving proper notice of an agency's intent to implement a change in conditions of employment because parties have reached impasse in their negotiations, a union is obligated to file a request for Panel assistance to forestall implementation. However, requiring a union to file a request for Panel assistance following any notice of implementation places the union in the untenable position of being required to request Panel assistance (in order to avoid implementation) only to be confronted later with an allegation that implementation was proper because the request was filed prematurely.[15] Indeed, as noted previously, the Respondent characterizes the Union's request for Panel assistance in this case as a "'willful' misuse of the Panel's procedures...."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;Here, if the parties had bargained to impasse, the Union would have been obligated to seek Panel assistance in order to require maintenance of the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>under section 7116(a)(5) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The foregoing demonstrates a second reason why the creation of a separate, implied obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> arising from section 7116(a)(6) does not promote the purposes and policies of the Statute. Specifically, to the extent that requiring a union to file a request for Panel assistance following any notice of implementation prompts parties to file requests for Panel assistance in order to protect their litigation posture, it deflects Panel resources away from the central task of resolving impasses.[16] It also deflects the resources of the parties away from their tasks of engaging in collective bargaining and resolving bargaining disputes.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;We note, in this regard, that section 7119(c)(1) of the Statute provides that the "function" of the Panel "is to provide assistance in resolving negotiation impasses between agencies and exclusive representatives." Section 7119(b) provides that a party may request the Panel's assistance "<span class="Italic">[i]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">f</span> voluntary arrangements...fail to <span id="Page_1265"></span>resolve a negotiation impasse" (emphasis added). The voluntary arrangements referred to in section 7119(b) expressly include the services of "the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or any other third-party mediation[.]" One court has interpreted the requirement in section 7116(a)(6) that an agency cooperate in "impasse" procedures and decisions as conditioned on the existence of an impasse. <span class="Italic">See Patent Office Professional Association v. FLRA,</span> 26 F.3d 1148, 1153 (D.C. Cir. 1994) ("before the Panel can employ its power, <span class="Italic">there must first be an impasse.") </span>(emphasis in original). <span class="Italic">See also NAGE v. FLRA, </span>893 F.2d at 382 ("The <span class="Italic">status quo </span>duty depends, however, on some party's having <span class="Italic">properly </span>invoked the services of the Impasses Panel.") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The difficulties described herein would be less weighty, in our assessment, if it were necessary to find a separate, implied obligation in section 7116(a)(6) in order to enforce the requirement to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>until the completion of bargaining. However, as explained above, the impasse process is, in effect, subsumed within the collective bargaining process as a whole, such that a failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>during the impasse process violates section 7116(a)(5). Therefore, we are unable to discern a reason for finding an independent, implied obligation under section 7116(a)(6) to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>once Panel procedures are invoked. Put simply, it is unnecessary to create multiple enforcement grounds--with their attendant confusion and potential for resource misuse--when a single ground provides equivalent enforcement of the obligation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;The question whether an agency violates section 7116(a)(6) by implementing changes in conditions of employment will be resolved based on whether the agency cooperates with Panel procedures or a Panel decision requiring it to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the foregoing problems with Authority precedent, and because we do not discern either a need for imposing a separate, implied requirement to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>in section 7116(a)(6) or a basis in the plain wording of the Statute, its legislative history, or its policies and purposes for doing so, we conclude that the doctrine must be revised. We will, henceforth, determine whether an agency that implements a change in conditions of employment has violated section 7116(a)(6) of the Statute based on whether maintenance of the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>has been directed by impasse procedures or decisions. Previous Authority decisions to the contrary will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the above discussion makes clear, this modification in our approach to resolving the allegation presented in this case does not make any change in the bargaining obligations of agencies and unions. Specifically, an agency's obligation under section 7116(a)(5) to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>--both up to and through impasse resolution procedures--remains intact. This clarification of the parties' obligations reinforces the continuing and unitary obligation of agencies, absent the existence of a specific exception, to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>both during negotiations and after an impasse has been reached. Further, this change is not intended to discourage in any way the use of available dispute resolution procedures, including those of the Panel. In situations such as that presented in this case, it is perfectly appropriate for a union facing the implementation of changed working conditions to contact the Panel to determine whether its services, or those of other dispute resolution agencies, may be useful. The modification merely clarifies that a union is not obliged to seek Panel assistance simply to support an unfair labor practice charge. We leave it to the Panel to determine whether to adopt specific procedures concerning the maintenance of the <span class="Italic">status quo, </span>or whether to issue such orders under particular circumstances.[18]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[18]&#x2003;Since the circumstances in which the Panel may deem it appropriate to specify procedures requiring maintenance of the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>cannot be anticipated, we do not here address what, if any, defenses (such as those set out in note 9, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, or raised by the Respondent in this case) are available to respondents who do not cooperate in those procedures. Similarly, we will determine in an appropriate case what remedy should be provided for violations of section 7116(a)(6) under the new framework and, in particular, whether the existing FCI framework for evaluating requests for <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief should apply in such cases or whether a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy should be presumed appropriate in view of the importance of the Panel in the resolution of collective bargaining impasses. We note that, contrary to our dissenting colleague's suggestion...the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> framework has been applied by the Authority in determining appropriate remedies for violations of section 7116(a)(6). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., INS II, </span>44 FLRA at 1075. The Authority has, however, not been consistent in doing so. <span class="Italic">Compare id. (FCI </span>applied in determining whether to provide <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy for violation of section 7116(a)(6)) <span class="Italic">with Department of Health and Human Services,</span> <span class="Italic">Health Care Financing Administration, </span>39 FLRA 120, 133 (1991) <span class="Italic">(FCI </span>not applied). In an appropriate case, it will be necessary to reconcile this inconsistent precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the dissent points out, with certain exceptions, both law and policy obligate an agency to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>during the time an impasse is pending before the Panel. Despite our dissenting colleague's assertion to the contrary, today's decision neither undercuts that obligation in any way nor reduces unions' rights. In both the Federal and private sectors, that obligation historically has been rooted in the obligation to bargain in good faith, and a failure of a Federal agency to do so violates section 7116(a)(5) of the Statute. The obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>extended through impasse proceedings under Executive Order 11491, which did not contain an analogue to section 7116(a)(6), and continues to extend through impasse proceedings under section 7116(a)(5) of the Statute. That obligation has been enforced prior to this decision and will continue to be enforced after it. Agencies should not be mistakenly encouraged by the dissent to prematurely implement changes in working conditions without fulfilling their duty to bargain in good faith.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the 1999 <span class="Italic">INS</span> decision, FLRA summarized its holdings, noting that changes may be instituted unilaterally only if the parties have reached agreement, if there is no timely invocation of FSIP services after impasse following good faith bargaining (unless implementation is consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency), or if the union waived bargaining rights. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Local 1210</span>, 25 FLRA 32, 37 (1987). The agency's obligation to maintain conditions of employment during bargaining and impasse procedures does not change because a question concerning representation (QCR) is pending. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">FSIP</span>, 46 FLRA 1335, 1337 (1993) (FLRA declined to issue a major policy ruling) (relying on <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Local 2455</span>, 9 FLRA 253 (1982) [discussed in Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-10-157.html#sec2-158">Unfair Election Practices</a>"]).
