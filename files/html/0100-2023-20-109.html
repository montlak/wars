<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-105"><span class="space">m.</span> Intelligence, Counterintelligence Agencies; Foreign National</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) excludes from the definition of "agency" for the purpose of an IRA appeal an agency whose primary purpose is the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities if that agency or unit is excluded by determination of the President. <span class="Italic">Lewark v. DOD</span>, 91 MSPR 252 (2002), outlined the parameters of the exclusion in an IRA appeal involving the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency. The statutory exclusion, as amended through the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, is at &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(C)&#x2003;''agency" means an Executive agency and the Government Printing Office, but does not include--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(ii)(I) the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the National Reconnaissance Office; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(II)&#x2003; as determined by the President, any executive agency or unit thereof the principal function of which is the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities, provided that the determination be made prior to a personnel action[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The determination in <span class="Italic">Lewark</span> that an exclusion under the WPA for a national security agency can be made by implication rather than by an express, recorded decision by the President or his delegee, would be overturned in <span class="Italic">Czarkowski v. MSPB</span>, 390 F.3d 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2004), <span class="Italic">post</span>. <span class="Italic">Lewark</span> declared, 91 MSPR 255-58 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-12:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point for every case involving statutory construction is the language of the statute itself. <span class="Italic">E.g., Landreth</span> <span class="Italic">Timber Co. v. Landreth,</span> 471 U.S. 681, 685, 105 S. Ct. 2297, 85 L. Ed.2d 692 (1985); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Transportation</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 293 &#x00B6; 7 (2000). Where the statutory language is clear, it must control absent clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Hargrove v. Department of Defense</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 266, 270 (1998); <span class="Italic">Todd v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 4, 7 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 55 F.3d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The statute at issue, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii), provides, "[f]or the purpose of this section [2302]," that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"agency" means an Executive agency and the Government Printing Office, but does not include--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, the National Security Agency, [or], <span class="Italic">as determined by the President, any Executive agency or unit thereof the principal function of which is the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency in this case, the Department of Defense (DoD), is an "Executive agency," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101, 105, and it is undisputed that the JPRA is a "unit thereof." Here, section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) clearly provides that the determination (as to whether an "Executive agency or unit thereof" has, as its principal function, the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities) is to be made by the President. We have found nothing in the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency claims that Executive Order No. 12,333 (1981) constitutes the Presidential determination required by section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii). Executive Order No. 12,333, among other things, authorizes the Secretary of Defense to utilize the foreign intelligence and counterintelligence elements of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as the Marine Corps, and "[o]ther offices within the Department of Defense appropriate for conduct of the intelligence missions and responsibilities," to carry out the Secretary's foreign intelligence and counterintelligence responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at part 1.11-.13. It also provides that the Secretary of Defense "shall issue such appropriate directives and procedures as are necessary to implement this Order," and that heads of agencies within the intelligence community "shall issue appropriate supplementary directives and procedures consistent with this Order." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at part 3.2. Executive Order <span id="Page_3840"></span>No. 12,333 does not, however, reference 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii). Nor does it mention either the JPRA or the JPRA's parent organization, the U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFC), let alone determine that those units (or any other units) have as their "principal function" "the conduct of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities.[2] Thus, we hold that Executive Order No. 12,333 is not a basis for finding that the President has made any type of determination under section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) regarding the appellant's unit, the JPRA, that would exclude it as an "agency" for the purpose of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note it is undisputed that the JPRA's Charter provides that the JPRA's functions are the planning, preparation, and execution of personnel recovery for the DoD. In conjunction with its Charter, the JPRA's core missions are: Joint combat search and rescue; non-conventional assisted recovery; code of conduct training (including survival, evasion, resistance, and escape (SERE)); operational POW/MIA affairs (including repatriation, debriefing, and DoD SERE psychology program; and personnel recovery research, development, testing, and evaluation.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 3 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 301, the President is "authorized to designate and empower the head of any department or agency in the executive branch, or any official thereof who is required to be appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to <span class="Italic">perform</span> without approval, ratification, or other action by the President...<span class="Italic">any function</span> which is vested in the President by law." (Emphasis supplied.) The term "perform" may be construed to mean "exercise," and the term "function" "embraces any duty, power, responsibility, authority, or discretion vested in the President." 3 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 303. But, there is no evidence in this case showing that the President has designated or empowered the head of a department or agency in the executive branch, or any official thereof appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make the determination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) that is at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even in the absence of an express determination or delegation by the President, it appears that a determination under section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) may be made by the head of the Executive agency involved in this case. In <span class="Italic">Law v. United States</span>, 11 F.3d 1061, 1066-67 (Fed. Cir. 1993), our reviewing court, relying on U.S. Supreme Court decisions, held that the head of an Executive agency, without a specific delegation of authority from the President under 3 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 301, 302, may "serve as the President's alter ego and make determinations assigned by statute to the President that directly relate to the agency's work."[3] Here, although DoD Directive 5420.1 (Apr. 25, 1998), includes within a list of DOD components conducting intelligence activities "[o]ther intelligence and counterintelligence organizations, staffs, and offices, or elements thereof, when used for foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purposes," and DoD Directive 2310.2 (Dec. 22, 2000) ("Personnel Recovery") designated the JPRA as "the DoD Office of Primary Responsibility...for DoD-wide personnel recovery matters," those documents do not clarify whether the JPRA and/or the JPRA's parent organization, the USJFC are such "other" organizations. In short, there is no evidence in the record showing that the head of the pertinent Executive agency, the Secretary of Defense, has made a determination that the unit in which the appellant works, the JPRA, has the principal function of conducting foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities.</p>

But, 5 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) does not affirmatively prohibit delegation of the performance of the function it specifies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the appellant was appointed in the excepted service under a special authority used for civilian positions assigned in an intelligence activity of the agency, and thus that the appellant must be deemed to "belong to an agency with an intelligence mission." <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic">ee</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1601. The appellant, however, contends that the JPRA's principal function is to coordinate personnel recovery issues within the DoD and that the "JPRA serves an operational function, not an intelligence function." We find that the agency's argument cannot substitute for the Presidential determination that "the principal function" of "any Executive agency or unit thereof," is "the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities," that the plain language of section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) requires. Nor can this substitute for a similar determination by the pertinent Executive agency head, the Secretary of Defense, pursuant to an express delegation from the President or under the reasoning set forth by our reviewing court in <span class="Italic">Law</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore agree with the AJ's conclusion that the JPRA is not an "agency" excluded under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) from the coverage of section 2302.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Some employees in sensitive agency units have been exempted from Board appeal rights under section 2302(a)(2)(C) of the WPA. The exemptions are found in the definition of agency, which delineates the agencies that are not covered by the WPA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; "agency" means an Executive agency and the Government Printing Office, but does not include--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C) (2000) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question before this court is whether the OSP has been "determined by the President" to be an executive agency or unit thereof "the principal function of which is the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities," as specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii). The record in this case reveals without dispute that the President, or his lawful delegate, has not made an actual determination expressly naming Ms. Czarkowski's unit as an exempt agency under section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii). The Board held that an agency or unit thereof could be deemed one so "determined by the President" even without an express actual determination having been made. The Board held that documentary evidence showing Presidential delegation of authority to conduct foreign intelligence activities to an agency, coupled with other evidence such as appointments under Schedule A, could suffice to permit the Board to make a decision that a particular agency or unit thereof had been determined by the President to have as its principal function the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the agency defends the rationale of the Board, arguing that express action by the President identifying a particular agency pursuant to section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) is unnecessary to exempt an agency from Board review in WPA cases, and urges us to accept the Board's rationale and analysis of the documentary record. Ms. Czarkowski argues that even under the Board's rationale, she should prevail, since in her view the facts of her case cannot be distinguished from the facts in <span class="Italic">Lewark v. Department of Defense</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 252 (2002), a case in which the Board concluded that the documentary evidence failed to demonstrate the requisite Presidential determination. Ms. Czarkowski also argues frontally against the agency's theory of the case, asserting that an agency cannot "earn" exemption from Board review for itself by reference to documentary evidence of its scope of authority. Instead, Ms. Czarkowski asserts that the statute in suit is clear: exemption from Board authority exists only with respect to the agencies expressly named by Congress in the relevant statute and such other agencies or units thereof that have been expressly determined by the President, or his lawful delegate, to have as their principal function the statutorily specified intelligence activities. Ms. Czarkowski forwards her interpretation of the statute as harmonious with sound policy that enables the President himself, not the Board, to determine which agencies should be shielded from the <span id="Page_3841"></span>full scope of WPA review before the Board. She also argues that actual express determination by the President of exempt units will better afford the employees of those units notice of the extent of their appeal rights to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On its face, the statute requires that an exemption from section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) must be "determined by the President." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii). In order to exempt an agency's employees from WPA review rights before the Board, the President, or his lawful delegate, must decide that the agency has as its principal function the conduct of foreign intelligence activities. Many agencies have some authority to conduct foreign intelligence activities, and do so. The statute assigns to the President the task of identifying which agencies meet the "principal function" test. This surely is a delicate call in some circumstances, and it certainly is a call that Congress has left to the President or his delegate. The statutory language does not suggest that the Board can effectively make a determination for the President by reviewing documentary evidence that may suggest an agency has been determined to have the principal function of conducting foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities. Documents that suggest to the Board that a Presidential determination should or could have been made cannot stand as a proxy for an actual Presidential determination that references the statute. The burden is on the agency to show that the President, or his delegate, has explicitly exempted an agency or unit thereof under section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the WPA supports the clear meaning of the statute. The legislative history indicates that it is within the President's discretion to determine which agencies are exempt from the WPA. <span class="Italic">See Mark-Up Session on S. 2640: The Civil Service Reform Act of 1973</span>, 95th Cong. 69 (1978). This discretion is a judgment that can only be made when the President finds an agency or unit thereof is principally engaged in the specified intelligence activities. S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 18 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1973 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2740. Therefore the Board cannot impute determinations of exempted units to the President, or his delegate, by interpreting documentary evidence that may tend to show that an agency principally functions as an intelligence unit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In further support of the requirement of explicit determination by the President, or his delegate, Congress has expressly provided all intelligence employees, including those exempted under the mechanism of section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii), an alternate scheme for disclosing information without fear of reprisal. <span class="Italic">See</span> The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105-272, Title VII, 112 Stat. 2413 (1998) ("ICWPA"). The ICWPA provides the intelligence community a limited right to raise urgent and serious concerns to Congress or to the appropriate Inspector General. This act provides a voice to employees in agencies known for the conduct of intelligence activities which are statutorily denied protection under the WPA and those employees that have been exempted by presidential determination. Section 702(b)(1)(C) of the ICWPA provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;Any other employee of, or contractor to, an executive agency, or element or unit thereof, determined by the President under section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) of title 5, United States Code, to have as its principal function the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities, who intends to report to Congress a complaint or information with respect to an urgent concern may report the complaint or information to the appropriate Inspector General (or designee) under this Act or section 17 of the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 702(b)(1)(C). The House Report to this act emphasizes that the President is to determine which agencies or units thereof are exempt under section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) and states that as of 1998 the President had "made no such determinations." <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 105-747, Part 1, at 7 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ICWPA further supports the clear intent of Congress that a determination made pursuant to section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) by the President, or his delegate, must be explicit in order to give exempted employees an opportunity to participate in the alternate whistleblowing scheme provided for exempted intelligence employees. For policy reasons, it is important that employees can determine their status under the WPA, or alternatively under the ICWPA, in order to inform their decision about how to disclose information without fear of retaliation by personnel. We do not, however, read the statute to require the President to give actual notice to each employee of each agency he has determined to have as its principal function the relevant intelligence activities. It is enough for the President, or his delegate, to make his express determinations on the public record by such means as he deems appropriate. It should not be difficult for employees of agencies that conduct substantial foreign intelligence activities to learn whether the President, or his delegate, has expressly designated their particular agency pursuant to section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">V</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency failed to demonstrate that the President, or his lawful delegate, had explicitly exempted Ms. Czarkowski's unit, the OSP, under section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Whistleblower Protection Act from the merit systems appeal process. Without explicit exemption of her agency, Ms. Czarkowski met her burden of establishing Board jurisdiction, and is protected by an appeal right to the Board of her claim of adverse personnel action by the agency in response to her allegedly protected disclosure. We therefore reverse the finding of the Board that Ms. Czarkowski's unit is exempt from the merit systems appeal process and remand for further adjudication of her whistleblower claim.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a), an employee may file an individual right of action (IRA) appeal with the Board concerning a personnel action taken as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). A "prohibited personnel practice" is defined, in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302, as including a personnel action that, under circumstances described in that section, is taken with respect to an employee in a "covered position in an agency." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no doubt that the appellant's position was in an "agency," as that term is defined for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C) (defining "agency" as including "an Executive agency"); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105 (defining "Executive agency," for purposes of title 5, U.S. Code, as including an Executive department). Moreover, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(B) generally defines "covered position" as including positions that are in the excepted service; as indicated below, the appellant's position evidently is in the excepted service; and, although subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(B) exclude certain categories of those positions from coverage, nothing in the record suggests that either of those paragraphs applies to the appellant's position. The Board has held, however, that only persons who meet the definition of an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105 are entitled to the protections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302. <span class="Italic">Clark v. Army &#x0026; Air Force Exchange Serv.</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 43, 46 (1993). A person meets this definition if he is "engaged in the performance of a Federal function under authority of law or an Executive act," he is "subject to the supervision of an individual [meeting the definition of an "employee" under this section] while engaged in the performance of the duties of his position," and he has been "appointed in the civil service by" such an individual. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant was "engaged in the performance of a Federal function," i.e., conducting DHS customs investigations; that he was supervised by a person meeting the definition of an "employee"; and that he was appointed to his position by such an individual. With respect to the issue of whether the appellant was an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105, therefore, the only matter in dispute is whether the position to which the appellant was appointed was in the "civil service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "civil service" is defined, for purposes of title 5, U.S. Code, as "consist[ing] of all appointive positions in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of the Government of the United States, except positions in the uniformed services...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101(1). As indicated above, the appellant was appointed to a position in the executive branch of the United States Government, i.e., to a position in the Department of the Treasury that was transferred to another executive agency, DHS, before the appellant's removal. Nothing in the record suggests that the appellant's position was in a uniformed service. Moreover, both the standard form 50 documenting the appellant's appointment and that documenting his removal indicate that the appellant's position was in the excepted service. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2103(a), the term "excepted service" is defined, for purposes of title 5, as "consist[ing] of those <span class="Italic">civil service positions</span> which are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service." (Emphasis added.) Under the plain language of the definitions quoted above, therefore, and in light of the characterization of the appellant's service on each standard form 50 in the record,[3] the appellant appears to have been employed in the civil service. <span class="Italic">See O'Brien v. Office of Independent Counsel</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 192, 202-08 (1997) (finding that the appellant was in a "covered position" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302 because his position was in the excepted service, and because it had not been excepted for reasons described in paragraph (a)(2)(B)(i) of that section).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;State seems to have taken the position that the appellant's <span id="Page_3842"></span>position is not in the excepted service. It acknowledges that excepted service positions are in the civil service, however, and its apparent argument that the appellant was not in the excepted service seems to be based only on its position that the appellant was not in the civil service. Neither State nor DHS explains why the appellant's position is consistently characterized in his standard forms 50 as an excepted service position, and neither asserts specifically that the forms should have characterized the position in some other way.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although foreign nationals are excluded from most positions in the competitive service, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 7.3, there appears to be no similar provision with respect to the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both DHS and State argue, citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3331, that an individual becomes a member of the civil service only if he is in a position in which he is required to take the oath of office prescribed in that section. Although the appellant in this case evidently took the oath of office when he was appointed to his position, DHS and State argue that this circumstance is immaterial because, as a foreign national, he was not required to do so. The administrative judge accepted this argument below and found that the appellant accordingly was not appointed to a position in the civil service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not interpret 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3331 as providing that a person is not in the civil service unless he has taken the oath of office that is quoted in that provision, or unless he was required to take that oath on appointment. That provision does not purport to define the term "civil service," or to prescribe elements needed to establish that a person was "appointed in the civil service." Instead, it prescribes the language that generally is to be used by individuals who are elected or appointed to office in the civil service or in the uniformed services. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3331</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its argument that foreign nationals such as the appellant should not be administered the oath of office, State has cited its own Foreign Affairs Handbook, an Office of Personnel Management publication entitled "Guide to Processing Personnel Actions," and a 1902 opinion in which the Attorney General expressed his "belie[f] that the United States can [not] require or receive an oath of allegiance [to the U.S. Constitution] from one who still retains and owes allegiance to his own country." As the administrative judge noted, neither the guide nor the handbook has the force of law. <span class="Italic">See James v. Von Zemenszky</span>, 301 F.3d 1364, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines lack the force of law and do not ordinarily merit the kind of deference due to formal regulations, promulgated following notice and comment rulemaking). Moreover, the 1902 Attorney General opinion appears inconsistent with subsequent opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court. <span class="Italic">See In re Griffiths</span>, 413 U.S. 717, 727 n.18 (1973) (finding "no merit in the contention that only citizens can in good conscience take an oath to support the Constitution," and noting that an oath to support and defend the Constitution was required of all persons inducted into the armed services, including resident aliens); <span class="Italic">see also Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong</span>, 426 U.S. 88, 109 (1976) ("it is settled that aliens may take an appropriate oath of allegiance") (citing <span class="Italic">In re Griffiths</span>, 413 U.S. at 727 n.18).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, even if the appellant had not taken the oath of office, or if he should not have been required to do so, such a circumstance would not preclude a finding that the appellant was appointed in the civil service. Taking the oath of office is only one of the indicia of appointment in the civil service, <span class="Italic">see Watts v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 814 F.2d 1576, 1579 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 484 U.S. 913 (1987), and an agency's failure to administer or require it may be outweighed by evidence that the individual was in fact appointed in the civil service, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 1580 ("The cases mentioning standard forms and oaths of office [as indicia of appointment in the civil service] do not necessarily exclude other rituals that may be devised to signalize an appointment from time to time."); <span class="Italic">cf. Bevans v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 900 F.2d 1558, 1564 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (even if the employee was given the oath of office, that oath would be insufficient to overcome the other evidence in the record that he was not appointed).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other indicia of appointment include the issuance of a standard form 50 and payment "through the civil service system...." <span class="Italic">Watts</span>, 814 F.2d at 1579. As noted above, standard forms 50 were issued to document both the appellant's appointment and his removal. The appellant also appears to have been paid under a pay system established and administered by the federal government. <span class="Italic">See</span> Appeal File, Tab 16, Exhibit 14 (standard form 50 documenting appointment, indicating in blocks 16 through 20D that the appellant was to be paid under the "FSN" pay plan, consistent with a specified occupational code, grade, and step, and that he was to receive specified amounts of basic pay, adjusted basic pay, and "Other Pay"); Foreign Service Act, &#x00A7; 408 (providing State with the authority to establish compensation plans for foreign national employees of the foreign service, and providing other agencies performing functions abroad with authority to "administer employment programs for its employees who are foreign nationals"). Other aspects of his employment also are indicative of an appointment in the civil service. For example, a human resources officer at the U.S. Embassy advised the appellant, when "welcom[ing him] to the staff, in what [the official] trust[ed would] prove to be a long and rewarding career," that he would be required to complete a 1-year trial period, during which his employment could be terminated for unsatisfactory performance or misconduct. The same official advised the appellant further that his supervisor would be asked to evaluate his performance and recommend salary increases when he was eligible; and the appellant not only was administered the oath of office mentioned above, but also was required to execute two other "appointment affidavits," including one in which he agreed not to participate in any strike against the U.S. Government "while an employee of the Government of the United States or any agency thereof." The appellant also was permitted to pursue a grievance challenging the decision to remove him, and a U.S. Government official was designated as the individual responsible for deciding this grievance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court has held that the "essential prerequisites [for an appointment in the civil service] are an authorized appointing officer who takes an action that reveals his awareness he is making an appointment in the United States civil service, and action by the appointee denoting acceptance." <span class="Italic">Watts</span>, 814 F.2d at 1580. The appointing officer in this case may not have been aware of all the ramifications of the appellant's appointment, such as entitlement to file an IRA appeal; and the appointment may not have provided the appellant with all the benefits U.S. citizens would have obtained on appointment to a similar position. The actions and circumstances described above show, however, that the official appointing the appellant to his customs investigator position was aware that he was appointing the appellant to the civil service, and they show that the appellant accepted that appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the circumstances of this appellant's appointment are readily distinguishable from those under which an appointment in the civil service has not been found. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bevans,</span> 900 F.2d 1558 (individual who was employed in corporation owned by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and whose appointment-related documents indicated appointment only to a company position, and not to a CIA position, was not appointed in the civil service); <span class="Italic">Watts</span>, 814 F.2d 1576 (individual who was employed in same CIA-owned company, who was unaware that the company was owned by the CIA, and who was not issued any standard forms 50 or 52 "or any other standard form or document creating a nexus between him and the government," was not appointed in the civil service); <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (contract employees hired to perform government intelligence function were not government employees).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we find that the appellant was appointed in the civil service and that he is covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302. <span class="Italic">See generally Special Counsel v. U.S. Customs Service</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 342, 347 (1986) (reemployed annuitants are not expressly excluded from coverage under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302, and reading such an exclusion into the statute would be inconsistent with the broad congressional purpose of encouraging federal employees to expose the kind of wrongdoing mentioned in that section).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Van Werry v. MSPB</span>, 995 F.2d 1048, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 1993), affirmed the exclusion of employees of the Defense Intelligence Agency from the provisions of &#x00A7; 2302. (See 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii)(I)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Nirala v. DOD</span>, DC-1221-16-0230-W-1 (NP 6/9/2016) (5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii)(I) specifically excludes National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency from IRA coverage).
