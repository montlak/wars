<h2 class="h2" id="sec9-2"><span class="space">I.</span> UNACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE CASES</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Performance actions constitute a small portion of the Board's docket. Although the unacceptable performance action is not often used, when compared to adverse action, some agency managers, HR officials, and counsel recognize that a well-structured and properly executed performance action is likely to withstand Board scrutiny. This chapter is devoted to a description of the process and substance of Chapter 43 actions and the related cases involving appeals from denials of within grade increases. [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-13-172.html#sec6-170">Performance</a>," for adverse actions under Chapter 75 involving substandard performance.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit described the Chapter 43 performance action, <span class="Italic">Harris v. SEC</span>, 972 F.3d 1307, 1311, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2020):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chapter 43 governs the "Performance Appraisal" of federal agency employees, establishing standards for evaluating work performance and imposing sanctions of removal or demotion for unacceptable performance. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4315; <span class="Italic">Lisiecki v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 769 F.2d 1558, 1561 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Chapter 43 defines "unacceptable performance" as "performance of an employee which fails to meet established performance standards in one or more critical elements of such employee's position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(3) (2012). The term "critical element" is also a term of art, referring to a key "work assignment or responsibility" established as part of the written performance standards for each type of position within the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.203. Performance standards and critical elements of each employee's position must be communicated to the employee at the beginning of each appraisal period, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(2) (2012), which generally runs for 12 months, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(a)(2). Each agency's performance appraisal system must "provide for...reassigning, reducing in grade, or removing employees who continue to have unacceptable performance but only after an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(6) (2012). Agencies typically provide this opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance by placing the underperforming employee on a Performance Improvement Plan, or PIP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to properly remove or demote an employee under chapter 43, the agency must have (1) established a performance appraisal system approved by the Office of Personnel Management, (2) communicated objective and reasonable written performance standards and critical elements of an employee's position to her at the beginning of the appraisal period, (3) warned her of inadequacies in critical elements during the appraisal period, and (4) counseled and afforded her an opportunity for improvement after proper notice. <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 834 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 795 F.2d at 997. "If those requirements have been satisfied, an agency may reduce in grade or remove an employee for receiving a rating of 'unacceptable' <span class="Italic">with respect to even a single</span> critical element." <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 795 F.2d at 997 (emphasis in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit also described the performance case in <span class="Italic">Considine v. NCUA</span>, 366 Fed. Appx. 157, 158 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Considine argues on appeal that NCUA improperly removed her from her position. As the AJ observed, NCUA bore the burden of sustaining its decision to remove Ms. Considine for unacceptable performance pursuant to the provisions of Title 5, chapter 43 of the United States Code.

<p class="Body-Text">There are several key elements in a Chapter 43 case that commend its use by agencies. First, the Board does not permit the appellant to effectively challenge a determination that his or her performance is unacceptable before the individual is placed on a performance improvement period (often referred to as a PIP or as an opportunity period). Second, performance standards can be quite subjective. Third, evidence of performance during the PIP is assessed by the Board based on a substantial evidence test that is deferential to agencies. Fourth, an agency need not consider, and the Board will not consider, mitigation in a Chapter 43 case, although affirmative defenses, e.g., whistleblower reprisal or disability discrimination, are considered by the Board and should be considered by agencies when those defenses are raised in reply to a proposed performance-based action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 5 USC 4302-3, Congress established as a principal part of the Reform Act a requirement that agencies make decisions concerning retention, reassignment, promotion, and demotion of employees on the basis of performance in critical elements of their jobs, measured against reasonably objective performance standards. Removal can be based on failure to meet the requirements of just one of a number of critical elements for a position. <span class="Italic">Shuman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 23 MSPR 620, 627 (1984); 5 USC 4303. Once unacceptable performance in a critical element is identified, an employee is to be given an opportunity to improve. If the performance does not improve, and if the employee is charged with failing to meet more than one critical element, action will be sustained if the agency proves that he has failed to meet the requirements of just one critical element. <span class="Italic">Mabrouk v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 149, 153 (1989). If an agency finds itself with standards that do not permit the proper definition of unacceptable (or minimally acceptable) performance, the agency may, at the conclusion of one PIP, provide the employee with fair notice of what constitutes minimal performance and initiate another improvement period. <span class="Italic">Jimenez-Howe v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 35 MSPR 202, 206-08 (1987). Alternatively, the agency could proceed with a performance-based action under Chapter 75. [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-290.html#sec8-288">Performance</a>."] Although the unacceptable performance <span id="Page_2870"></span>case is difficult for an appellant to overcome when it is properly structured, the AJ owes the case proper scrutiny. If an appellant raises the issues of objectivity of performance standards or the fairness of the opportunity to improve, those issues must be resolved before the merits of the agency's charges can be decided. <span class="Italic">Luscri v. Dept. of Army</span>, 32 MSPR 623, 626 (1987). A performance-based adverse action under Chapter 75 is not a Chapter 43 performance action. [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-290.html#sec8-288">Performance</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-15-291.html#sec8-289">Performance as Basis for Adverse Action</a>," for adverse actions brought for poor performance.]</p>

Inter-American Foundation</span>, 122 MSPR 572, 2015 MSPB 46 (2015), determined that because a government corporation cannot take a performance-based action under Chapter 43, an appellant who otherwise met the definition of "employee" under 5 USC 7511 had an adverse action appeal within the Board's jurisdiction despite the agency's characterization of the action as one taken under Chapter 43.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The magic words are "unacceptable performance." 5 USC 4302(c)(6), 4303(a). In performance-based actions, an employee may be removed only for unacceptable performance, not for minimally acceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Goodale v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 28 MSPR 158, 159 n.4 (1985). An agency may not take an unacceptable performance action until it has warned the employee of unacceptable performance and given him a chance to improve. It is insufficient to warn the employee of marginal performance, look for improvement, and, not finding it, take an unacceptable performance action. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. ICC</span>, 28 MSPR 198, 200-01 (1985). As long as other requirements, discussed below, are followed, an employee may be reduced in grade or removed under Chapter 43 procedures at any time during the performance appraisal cycle when the employee's performance in one or more critical elements becomes unacceptable. There is no requirement that an official appraisal be issued to an employee in advance of a performance-based action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ketchum v.

The unacceptable performance action is not restricted to the fully trained or journeyman employee. It may be used if, after an opportunity to improve, e.g., an opportunity to obtain tutoring and retesting, an employee fails to succeed in a developmental or apprenticeship program. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gormley v.

<p class="Body-Text">A well-structured performance action is tough to beat. The agency is only required to provide substantial--not preponderant--evidence of unacceptable performance. In <span class="Italic">Lisiecki v. MSPB</span>, 769 F.2d 1558, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the court said of the review standard in a performance case:</p>

In reviewing agency action taken under this section, both the Board and the courts should give deference to the judgment by each agency of the employee's performance in light of the agency's assessment of its own personnel needs and standards....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Greer v.

Such deference is particularly appropriate in a case like this one, where the question is the adequacy of a research scientist's performance. Based on the unrebutted testimony of the <span id="Page_2871"></span>Director of Propulsion describing what a research plan should contain, and considering the model research plans submitted by the agency, a reasonable person could find that the appellant's research plans were unacceptable.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Given the deference to agencies concerning their development of performance standards and critical elements, given the refusal of the Board to apply mitigation standards developed in adverse action cases to unacceptable performance actions, and given the low quantity of proof required of agencies to support unacceptable performance actions, these cases present an effective vehicle for removing individuals who cannot or will not properly perform in their assigned positions.
