<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-59"><span class="space">5.</span> Hearing Entitlement On Timeliness Issue</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Timeliness of the appeal will ordinarily be resolved before the merits of the case are reached. Does the statute that guarantees an appellant a hearing in a Board appeal, 5 USC 7701(a)(1), guarantee a hearing on timeliness alone? Resolution of this question is not simple: it depends on whether there is a factual dispute as to timeliness that must be resolved. Under <span class="Italic">Sims v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 101 MSPR 311, 316 &#x00B6; 10, 2006 MSPB 50 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...When, as in this case, there is a dispute of material facts relating to timeliness and the appellant has requested a hearing, the appellant is entitled to a hearing on timeliness. <span class="Italic">See Stout</span>, 389 F.3d at 1240-41;<span class="Italic"> Peterson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 237, 243 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 976 F.2d 747 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table); <span class="Italic">Wellman</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 653; <span class="Italic">Secaida v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 256, 257-58 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit explained the advisability of a hearing when there are factual disputes concerning timeliness, <span class="Italic">Stout v. MSPB</span>, 389 F.3d 1233, 1237-42 (Fed. Cir. 2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Stout presents several arguments on appeal. Stout contends, among <span id="Page_947"></span>other things, that the Board improperly denied him a hearing on the timeliness of his appeal. As with any decision of the Board, we must affirm the decision not to hold such a hearing unless the decision is (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c) (2000). Because a hearing on the question of timeliness is not required by statute or regulation, whether to hold such a hearing is a matter of discretion with the Board. <span class="Italic">See Womack v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 798 F.2d 453, 455 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (no abuse of discretion in denying a hearing on timeliness where no disputed issues of fact required resolution).[4] We thus review the Board's denial of an evidentiary hearing on the issue of timeliness for abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See Hutchison v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 91 F.3d 1458, 1461 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;As we explained in <span class="Italic">Womack</span>, "[t]here is no regulation that requires the Board to hold a hearing before determining whether an appellant has shown good cause for waiving the time limits for appeal." 798 F.2d at 455. While 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(d) provides that "[u]nder 5 U.S.C. 7701, an appellant has a right to a hearing," section 7701(a)(1) grants the appellant the right to a Board hearing on the <span class="Italic">merits</span> of his appeal, rather than its <span class="Italic">timeliness</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board argues on appeal that no issues of material fact warranted a hearing on the timeliness of Stout's appeal. We disagree. The AJ's Initial Decision rested on two critical findings: (1) Stout failed to show that he could not have asked for help in pursuing his Board appeal during the thirty-day period following his removal (or at least during the thirty-some days following November 16, 2002) and (2) Stout requested reconsideration of the denial of his worker's compensation claim on November 16, 2002, demonstrating that he was not physically or mentally incapable of filing his appeal to the Board as of that date. The latter finding led the AJ to conclude that Stout was not incapacitated throughout the <span class="Italic">entire</span> period of delay, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, between October 21 and December 28, 2002.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the first finding, we are troubled by the AJ's determination that Stout had some obligation to show he was unable to request assistance from his family and friends in filing his Board appeal when there is at least some evidence to suggest that Stout's mental condition precluded his comprehension of the filing deadline. In <span class="Italic">Marquez</span>, the appellant did not claim that he was unaware of the deadline to appeal the denial of his retirement annuity application. Having filed his appeal two and a half years late, the appellant attempted to establish good cause for the delay simply by submitting a letter from his physician stating that appellant suffered from high blood pressure and arthritis. In dismissing the appeal as untimely, the Board explained that the</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">appellant's claim of poor health alone is not sufficient to establish a medical condition that rendered him immobile and unable to function on his own behalf every day of the nearly 21/2 year delay period. The appellant has not claimed that he could not leave his bed <span class="Italic">or that he was incapacitated to the point that he could not have asked someone to assist him in appealing his case</span>. The appellant's doctor has corroborated the appellant's arthritis and high blood pressure but has not provided any analysis of the severity of these conditions. Thus, the appellant has not shown that his poor health precluded him from taking any affirmative action to prosecute his appeal during the entire 28 month period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">54 M.S.P.R. at 91 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Marquez</span>, Stout alleged he was not able to understand the procedures and deadline for appealing his removal. In fact, as the AJ noted, Stout "averred that he was unable to even read the agency's entire removal letter until reading it to his attorney over the telephone in December." Information as to where and when to appeal, of course, comes at the end of a removal letter. In view of Stout's representations that he was not mentally sound enough to appreciate the filing deadline, the AJ's partial reliance on <span class="Italic">Marquez</span> is misplaced. While requests for assistance in filing an appeal are, in appropriate circumstances, considered as part of the good cause inquiry, an appellant's knowledge or awareness of the filing deadline must form a prerequisite to such consideration. An appellant cannot be taxed for failure to seek assistance with a deadline which he did not comprehend. Accordingly, only if such knowledge is established does the inquiry turn to whether the appellant possessed the mental competence to ask for assistance. Even then, an appellant must have capacity to do more than simply hand a removal letter to a relative and say, "take care of this." He must also have the capacity to cooperate effectively with the relative so that the appeal can be filed. To the extent <span class="Italic">dictum</span> in <span class="Italic">Marquez</span> can be read to the contrary, it is specifically disapproved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Stout asserted he was unable to comprehend that there was an October 21, 2002 deadline to appeal his removal from the IRS. Although the Agency adduced no contrary evidence, it nonetheless suggested that Stout must have known of the deadline because he received the removal notice setting forth the Board's appeal procedures via certified mail on September 20, 2002. Moreover, the Blaikie affidavit proffered by the Agency stated that "[o]n September 20, 2002, [she] received a telephone call from Ken Stout asking for a copy of the evidence file regarding his removal action." Stout's recognition of the filing deadline is thus in dispute. Stout's soundness of mind to ask for help also poses an evidentiary conflict. Absent resolution of these factual disputes, the AJ's reliance on Stout's failure to ask his family and friends for assistance in filing his Board appeal was improper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ's assumption that, "considering all of the help that he received," Stout failed to show he could not have asked for help is particularly unreasonable given Mrs. Stout's affidavit testimony that she "was not aware that [Stout] could appeal his removal or had to appeal his removal within a certain timeframe" and that she "never read a copy of the removal notice." While the AJ purported to credit this evidence, he nonetheless relied on the fact that Stout's mother did not expressly deny Blaikie's testimony that she had faxed Mrs. Stout a copy of Stout's removal notice on October 9, 2002. On Petition for Review, Stout submitted a second affidavit from his mother, specifically denying that she had ever received a copy of her son's removal letter from Blaikie. While this second affidavit did not result in reconsideration of the Board's <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span>, it further establishes yet another factual dispute material to Stout's proffered good cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the Board's other critical findings, the record before us, although incomplete, also abounds with conflicting evidence and contrary inferences therefrom as to Stout's mental state. Stout represented to the Board that as a result of the severe depression and stress caused by his removal from the IRS, he was "both physically and mentally unable to realize that there was a 30-day time frame to appeal the removal."[5] He also testified via affidavit that he only regained his ability to "handle day-to-day activities in approximately mid-December...." These statements were corroborated by the supporting affidavits submitted to the Board. Specifically, Gomez attested that "in no time after [Stout's] separation [from the IRS] that he was in any condition mentally (OR) physically able to follow any necessary steps to complete his disability retirement, workman comp from his Federal civil service position." Gomez added that "[Stout] was under medication and did not know what steps to take, we knew he could not handle any response on his be-half without our help." Marveen Stout further confirmed that "[f]or several months [following his removal], until approximately sometime in December, 2002, [Stout] had difficulty in talking and at times trouble with his lower extremities. <span class="Italic">[Stout]</span> <span class="Italic"> was unable to ambulate and manage most of his day-to-day affairs</span>." (Emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Stout also presented the Board with medical evidence, albeit scant, of his depressive state. The Clinic Progress Reports described Stout as "fully depressed" on October 15, 2002, less than a week before the deadline for his Board appeal. On that date, Stout's psychiatrist likewise noted that Stout suffered from "mania" (associated with bi-polar disorder), for which he prescribed the drug Depakote.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the Agency's argument that the filing of the Request for Reconsideration with the OWCP on November 16, 2002 demonstrated his ability to appeal his removal, Stout alleged that he did not draft the OWCP submission. He claimed that Gomez prepared and filed the Request for Reconsideration, which he merely signed. Indeed, Gomez stated in her affidavit that "[w]ith [Stout] under Doct care + medication we processed his appeal as timely as possible due to all the information necessary had to be requested from his employer IRS and his Medical Physician at Kaiser Hospital." Based on the foregoing, we conclude that factual disputes exist regarding Stout's mental condition at least during the November-December period of delay in filing his Board appeal.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Neither the Initial Decision nor the Final Order explains why such a hearing was not held. We presume that the Administrative Judge found that no disputed factual issues warranted a hearing on the question of whether good cause excused the untimely filing of Stout's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that if an appellant can establish a factual dispute as to whether he timely filed his appeal and he has requested a hearing, he is entitled to a timeliness hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Nelson v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 331 &#x00B6; 5 (2001). In <span class="Italic">Nelson</span>, the Board reversed the dismissal of appellant's appeal--without a hearing--as untimely filed, explaining that Nelson had presented "more than a bare allegation" that he timely filed his appeal by January 17, 2000. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 6. Nelson had supported his allegation that he appealed within the prescribed thirty-day period by proffering a copy of a letter from the Clerk of the Board responding to Nelson's inquiry regarding his December 24, 1999 appeal. Holding that Nelson raised a factual issue as to the timeliness of his appeal, the Board remanded the case with direction that the AJ hold a hearing regarding whether Nelson timely filed his appeal or showed good cause for his delay in filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_948"></span>The record before us, like the record in <span class="Italic">Nelson</span>, presents factual disputes on at least two of the AJ's key findings. The first dispute concerns whether Stout understood the filing deadline for his Board appeal and, if so, was of sound enough mind either to file himself or to seek assistance and cooperate effectively in timely filing his appeal. The second relates to the proper inferences to be drawn from the pursuit of Stout's worker's compensation benefits. Those activities, especially Stout's mid-November Request for Reconsideration to the OWCP, were critical to both the AJ's conclusion that Stout was not incapacitated throughout the entire period of delay, and his rejection of Stout's excuse. In addition, issues of the credibility of the affidavits of Stout, Gomez, and Marveen Stout versus Blaikie abound. Given the direct conflict particularly between Mrs. Stout and Blaikie over whether in October the latter transmitted a copy of the removal letter to the former, we cannot see how the AJ could resolve this conflict without live testimony, including cross-examination, of both persons to assess demeanor credibility. Because Stout thus established factual disputes regarding his mental state during the period of delay, we hold that the Board abused its discretion when it failed to hold a hearing on his proffered excuse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We follow the standard that the Board applied in <span class="Italic">Nelson</span> to govern the issue of when the Board must hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether an appellant has shown good cause for his untimely filing.[8] Under that standard, when an appellant presents facially credible evidence sufficient to establish a dispute as to material facts regarding the timely filing of his appeal or good cause excusing his late filing, the AJ must hold such a hearing to resolve the factual dispute. Of course, the AJ must first inform the appellant that he is entitled to such a hearing upon a showing of a factual dispute material to the issue of timeliness. Moreover, should the AJ decide that no material facts are in dispute and decline to hold an evidentiary hearing, he must set forth specific reasons for his decision. Such a decision is somewhat analogous to a grant of summary judgment by a district court. Accordingly, the reasoning must show either the lack of a factual dispute or that any such dispute was not material to the decision. Materiality, in turn, as in the summary judgment context, means only that a fact is likely to affect the outcome, but is not necessarily dispositive by itself. There is, however, one difference. The summary judgment rule that the non-movant must produce sufficient evidence contrary to that submitted by the movant to raise a genuine dispute depends on discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which do not apply at the Board. There, no discovery rights arise as to timely filing or good cause for late filing. Therefore, a genuine evidentiary dispute need not be shown. Specific alleged or documented facts to show good cause can suffice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;While we are unaware that any of our cases explicitly embrace this standard, our decision in <span class="Italic">Hutchison v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 91 F.3d 1458 (Fed. Cir. 1996), implicitly applies such a standard to analogous facts. In <span class="Italic">Hutchison</span>, petitioner claimed that on September 19, 1992, she timely appealed the Board's decision awarding her deceased husband's annuity to another woman claiming to be his surviving spouse. 91 F.3d at 1459. Upon refiling her appeal on August 15, 1994, Hutchison submitted a photocopy of what she claimed was "the cover sheet of the original appeal" showing the September 19, 1992 date and her signature, along with a declaration stating that she filed the appeal by U.S. mail on September 19, 1992. In the order acknowledging the receipt of her appeal, the AJ stated that "[i]f you further establish that there is a dispute as to facts which will affect my decision on the issue of timeliness..., you are also entitled to a hearing if you requested one." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Although Hutchison requested a timeliness hearing, the AJ did not hold one prior to issuing her initial decision dismissing the appeal as untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We reversed, holding that based on her declaration and the photocopy of the cover page of her first appeal, Hutchison had established, as a matter of law, a dispute as to the facts which would affect the AJ's decision on timeliness. Accordingly, we held that the AJ "deviated from the requirements and procedure set out in her [Acknowledgment] [O]rder" by dismissing Hutchison's appeal without a hearing on timeliness. We thus remanded the case to the Board with instructions to hold an evidentiary hearing on that issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1461.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Nelson</span> standard to this case, the Board should have held an evidentiary hearing to ascertain, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the level of Stout's involvement, if any, in the administrative actions relating to his worker's compensation benefits and the extent of his awareness, if any, of the deadline and method for filing his appeal. Accordingly, we vacate the Board's decision and remand the case for an evidentiary hearing as to all such material factual issues relating to Stout's proffered good cause for filing late.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has discretion to grant a hearing on timeliness of the appeal. <span class="Italic">Bagge v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 MSPR 326, 329 n.3 (1988). If the evidence on timeliness is in conflict, the AJ should hold a hearing on timeliness. If there is no hearing, the Board will decide the timeliness issue through the PFR process if the record is sufficiently well-developed and the Board's resolution is not based on demeanor findings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Starr v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 59, 61 &#x00B6; 4 (1998); <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 354, 357 (1998) (appellant is entitled to a timeliness hearing if there are factual disputes concerning the date of his receipt of the removal notice); <span class="Italic">Leonard v. Dept. of Army</span>, 78 MSPR 492, 496 (1998) (same: a dispute over whether an agency official misinformed the appellant concerning the necessity for an appeal of a RIF); <span class="Italic">Hall v. Dept. of Army</span>, 78 MSPR 222, 225 (1998) ("[I]f there are material facts in dispute regarding timeliness, and the appellant has requested a hearing, the appellant should be afforded the opportunity at a hearing to prove that his appeal was timely filed or that good cause to excuse the delay in filing his appeal exists."); <span class="Italic">Hightower v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 567, 569 (1996) ("if an appellant can establish a factual dispute as to whether he timely filed his petition for appeal with his employing agency, and he requested a hearing, he is entitled to a timeliness hearing"); <span class="Italic">Kowalczyk v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 396, 400 (1989) (if there is a genuine issue of fact concerning timeliness, the appellant is entitled to a hearing on the issue on his or her request).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although decisions suggest that a hearing is generally not required to resolve a timeliness dispute, the appellant is entitled to a hearing on request if the appellant's evidence or allegations could reasonably be construed to lead to a finding that the appeal was timely. If the appellant's evidence is capable of different interpretations, including a determination that the appeal is timely, the Board should not preclude a hearing and then adopt as fact an inference that may be drawn against the appellant from the facts, <span class="Italic">Hutchison v. MSPB</span>, 91 F.3d 1458, 1460-61 (Fed. Cir. 1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her opinion, the AJ stated: "I find that the appellant has not provided specific, credible evidence that her appeal was actually placed in the mail stream and <span class="Italic">therefore find</span> that the appeal was not timely filed." (emphasis added). Clearly, whether or not Juanita mailed her appeal affected the AJ's decision on the timeliness issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether there is a genuine dispute as to a fact is a question of law which we review <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">M &#x0026; J Coal Co. v. United States</span>, 47 F.3d 1148, 1152 (Fed. Cir.) (when reviewing a trial court's grant of summary judgment, the record is reviewed <span class="Italic">de novo</span> to determine whether any genuine issue of material fact exists).... Juanita, pointing to evidence that she submitted to the AJ in response to the Acknowledgment Order, asserts that she established a dispute as to whether she mailed her appeal to the Board on September 19, 1992. She points to her August 15 declaration, in which she stated that she "filed an appeal of [OPM's reconsideration decision] with the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board by U.S. Mail on September 19, 1992." She also points to the photocopy of the front page of the Board appeal form which shows her signature and which is dated September 19, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board argues that the AJ "accepted as proved" all of the matters asserted in Juanita's declaration. Thus, the Board asserts, Juanita was not entitled to a hearing under the Acknowledgment Order because there were no facts in dispute. The agency's premise is faulty, however. Juanita's affidavit explicitly states that she mailed her appeal to the Board, while the Board found that her appeal was not "actually placed in the mail stream." Plainly, the Board did not accept as proved all matters asserted in Juanita's affidavit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also argues that there are no facts in dispute because OPM did not submit any evidence to refute Juanita's assertions with respect to the mailing of her appeal. The Board notes that its cases hold that if a pleading is properly addressed with postage prepaid and placed in the Postal Service mail stream, it will be treated as filed on the date it was placed in the mail, regardless of whether the Board receives it. <span class="Italic">See Gaydon v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 198, 202 (1994). The Board argues that Juanita failed to offer evidence that her appeal was properly addressed or that she sent her appeal postage prepaid. Thus, the Board asserts, no facts were in dispute; Juanita simply failed to submit evidence to prove all of the facts material to the timeliness issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject the Board's argument. A genuine factual dispute can arise even when only one party offers evidence on the issue in question. For example, a genuine factual dispute can arise when a reasonable fact finder evaluating the evidence could draw more than one factual inference from the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Jeffery v. Sarasota White Sox, Inc.</span>, 64 F.3d 590, 594 (11th Cir. 1995). Juanita's statement that she mailed her appeal to the Board, submitted along with a photocopy of a dated and signed Board appeal form, would allow a reasonable fact-finder to infer that the appeal was properly addressed and had the correct postage on the letter. The Board's argument that no evidence supports a finding that Juanita mailed the appeal to the correct address with the correct postage challenges this reasonable inference. Therefore, there was a genuine factual dispute as to whether the appeal was properly addressed and had the correct postage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, the Board points to the statement in Juanita's September 1 response to the Acknowledgment Order that she was "not aware of any dispute of fact concerning the issue of timeliness..., pending discovery at this time." The Board contends that the statement suggested that no <span id="Page_949"></span>hearing on the timeliness issue was necessary, and that, consequently, the AJ did not abuse her discretion by not holding a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem with this argument is that it gives the statement an interpretation that is reasonable only if the statement is read out of context. First, on August 25, counsel had written the AJ that Juanita wanted a hearing. Second, the statement comes at the end of a five-page pleading in which it is argued that Juanita's appeal was timely filed and in which certain facts are alleged in support of that argument. Under these circumstances, we do not believe that the statement should be read as a withdrawal of the request for a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ's order stated that Juanita was "entitled" to a requested hearing if she established that there was a dispute as to facts which would affect the AJ's decision on the timeliness issue. As explained above, Juanita established, as a matter of law, that there was such a dispute. When the AJ dismissed Juanita's appeal without a hearing, the AJ deviated from the requirements and procedure set out in her order. Accordingly, the AJ abused her discretion in failing to hold hearing on the timeliness issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Hulst v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, SF-0752-17-0215-I-1 (NP 1/24/2023) ("When an appellant presents facially credible evidence sufficient to establish a dispute as to material facts regarding the timely filing of his appeal or good cause excusing his late filing, the administrative judge must hold a hearing to resolve the factual dispute. <span class="italic">Stout v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 389 F.3d 1233, 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="italic">Nelson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 5 (2001).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there are no factual disputes concerning the timeliness of the Board appeal, however, denial of a hearing is appropriate if it is determined on the written record that the appeal is untimely. <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. MSPB</span>, 751 F.2d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Peterson v. DHHS</span>, 50 MSPR 237, 243 (1991) (noting that the appellant was allowed various opportunities, through an invitation to submit factual evidence and through several prehearing conferences, to address the relationship between the appellant's medical condition and the timeliness of his appeal). A timeliness issue is often determined on the basis of paperwork alone, <span class="Italic">Womack v. MSPB</span>, 798 F.2d 453, 455-56 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no regulation that requires the Board to hold a hearing before determining whether an appellant has shown good cause for waiving the time limits for appeal. The regulation under which the time limit for filing appeals is waived merely states: "A presiding official may waive a Board regulation in an individual case for good cause shown if application of the regulation is not required by statute." 5 CFR 1201.12 (1982). The decision whether to hold a hearing on a request for waiver is a matter within the discretion of the Board in the exercise of its broad authority to prescribe and apply its own procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner does not contend that there were disputed issues of fact that required a hearing for resolution, and we know of none. The presiding official accepted the factual basis upon which the petitioner sought to justify his delay in appealing, but found them insufficient to excuse the delay. That determination was a legal one, and the petitioner offers no reason why a hearing was necessary for the presiding official properly to decide the issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner's argument that the Board's failure to hold a hearing on the waiver issue denied him due process fares no better. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the petitioner had a protectible property interest in obtaining a waiver of the time limit for appeal--a highly dubious assumption--all the petitioner was entitled to was notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Educ. v. Loudermill</span>, 105 S. Ct. 1487 (1985). The petitioner received both. He was informed that his appeal appeared untimely and that he could submit any justification for the delay, and he did so.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">DeShields v. EEOC</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 87-3503), added that, unless there are disputed issues of fact on the timeliness issue requiring a hearing for resolution, neither 5 USC 7701(a)(1) nor constitutional due process requires the Board to hold a hearing before determining whether an appellant shows good cause for waiving the time limits for appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is difficult to determine from the case law when documents alone will permit resolution of matters pertaining to timeliness and when a hearing is necessary. In deciding whether a hearing is needed, the Board justifies denials of hearings by declaring that the documentation alone allowed resolution of the factual matters pertaining to timeliness. Since the parties often submit affidavits or sworn statements on timeliness issues, a hearing may provide an opportunity only for cumulative evidence. Hearings are granted, however, when the facts are complex or confused, e.g., when an appellant claims through medical and other documentation that his or her mental condition precluded the filing of a timely appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wellman v. DHHS</span>, 47 MSPR 650, 653 (1991). Assuming that a hearing is held on timeliness, the AJ must resolve credibility issues and apply the Board's standards governing evaluation of evidence. In <span class="Italic">Younan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 41 MSPR 217, 221 (1989), the AJ erred by failing to analyze and credit uncontroverted evidence that an appeal was timely mailed to the Board's regional office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whatever procedure is used to resolve the timeliness of the appeal, the response to the show-cause order should be timely. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 35 MSPR 674, 677 (1987) (delay in responding to an order to show cause was not excused when it was caused by the appellant's failure to keep the Board advised of his current address); <span class="Italic">Arredondo v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 9 MSPR 90, 92 (1981) (discounting a claim that the show-cause order was not received when it was sent by certified mail to the appellant and counsel and receipts were apparently signed and returned to the Board).
