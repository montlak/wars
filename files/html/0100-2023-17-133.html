<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-131"><span class="space">C.</span> AWARD EXCEEDS AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR; STIPULATED OR NONSTIPULATED ISSUES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Another way of arguing that an award does not draw its essence from the contract is to assert that the arbitrator exceeded his authority through improper resolution of the issues addressed (or not addressed) or the remedy fashioned by an award. The two exceptions overlap. When FLRA denies an essence exception, and an exceeded-authority exception reiterates the same arguments as the essence exception, FLRA denies the exceeded-authority exception. <span class="Italic">SSA, ODAR and AALJs</span>, 68 FLRA 803, 806 (2015). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DCMA and AFGE Council 170</span>, 66 FLRA 53, 58 (2011) ("When the Authority denies an essence exception, and an exceeded-authority exception reiterates the same arguments as the essence exception, the Authority denies the exceeded-authority exception. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3354</span>, 64 FLRA 330, 334 (2009) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 62 FLRA 45, 48 (2007).").</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA summed up the law concerning an assertion that an arbitrator exceeded his authority, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3354 and USDA, Rural Dev. Centralized Serv. Ctr.,</span> 64 FLRA 330, 333 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, arbitrators exceed their authority by failing to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1617,</span> 51 FLRA 1645, 1647 (1996). However, when an Arbitrator's formulation of an issue is reasonable and the award is directly responsive to the formulated issue, the Authority denies exceptions contending that arbitrators exceeded their authority by failing to resolve an issue. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 3134,</span> 56 FLRA 1055, 1056 (2001). Finally, when the Authority denies an essence exception, and an exceeded-authority exception reiterates the same arguments as the essence exception, the Authority denies the exceeded-authority exception. <span class="Italic">E.g., NTEU,</span> 62 FLRA 45, 48 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3911 and EPA</span>, 68 FLRA 564, 567-69 (2015), restated the exception:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Arbitrators do not exceed their authority when they address a matter that is necessary to decide a stipulated issue, or a matter that necessarily arises from issues specifically included in a stipulation.[53] Further, arbitrators do not exceed their authority when they resolve a matter closely related to the issue giving rise to the grievance.[54] In determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his or her authority, the Authority accords an arbitrator's interpretation of a stipulated issue the same substantial deference that it accords an arbitrator's interpretation and application of a collective-bargaining agreement.[55] Moreover, even where a stipulated issue does not expressly include a particular matter, the arbitrator does not exceed his or her authority by addressing that matter if doing so is consistent with the arguments raised before him or her.[56]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...[T]he Authority has determined that when an arbitrator interprets an agreement in order to resolve an issue before him, he does not exceed his authority when that interpretation goes directly to the issue before the arbitrator.[61]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's interpretation of the stipulated issue merits deference. In resolving the stipulated issue, the Arbitrator found that her "task is to apply the relevant provisions of the parties' collective[-]bargaining agreement as a whole document."

<p class="noindent-1">In its exceeded-authority exception, the Union argues that the Arbitrator erred by (1) resolving the motion for summary judgment and (2) failing to resolve the Agency's hearing motion and the merits of the grievance. As relevant here, arbitrators exceed their authority when they fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration, or disregard specific limitations on their authority.[22]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, the Union errs in saying that the Arbitrator failed to resolve the merits of the grievance. In the award, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had no duty to bargain over the roster changes, and resolved the grievance by dismissing it. Because the premise of this argument is incorrect, it provides no basis for finding the award deficient.[25]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As for the Agency's request to cancel the hearing, the Arbitrator concluded that it was "in the nature of" a summary judgment motion, and directed the Agency to file one. The Union challenges the Arbitrator's authority to take this action, but the Union has not established that there were any relevant limitations in the parties' agreement or that the Arbitrator lacked the discretion to take this procedural step. For this reason, we find that the Arbitrator did not disregard a limitation of authority.[28] Moreover, in directing the filing of, and then ruling on, the motion for summary judgment, the Arbitrator effectively resolved[29] the issue raised by the hearing motion--what form the arbitration proceeding should take.[30]</p>

If the Union believed that the parties had stipulated that the grievants were working in hazardous-duty positions, the Union could have objected to the introduction of this evidence on the basis that, given the stipulation, this issue was not properly before the Arbitrator. Because there is no evidence that the Union did so, we find that its argument that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by considering whether the grievants were engaged in hazardous duties is barred by &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4(c) and 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations.").</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...Federal courts in private sector cases will find an arbitration award deficient on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority. For example, Federal courts in private sector cases will find an arbitrator's award deficient when it is demonstrated that the arbitrator rendered the award in disregard of a plain and specific limitation on his or her authority. Therefore, the Federal Labor Relations Authority will grant a petition for review of an arbitrator's award where it appears, based on the facts and circumstances described in the petition for review, that the exception presents the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority by rendering an award in disregard of a plain and specific limitation on that authority.</p>

In this regard, "the Authority has consistently held that arbitrators must confine their decisions and possible remedies to those issues submitted to arbitration for resolution and 'must not dispense their own brand of industrial justice.'" <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Sea Logistics Center, Detachment Atlantic, Indian Head, Md.</span>, 57 FLRA 687, 688 (2002) (<span class="Italic">NSLC</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin</span>., 24 FLRA 447, 450 (1986) (<span class="Italic">VA</span>) (citations omitted)). Arbitrators do not exceed their authority by addressing any issue that is necessary to decide a stipulated issue, <span class="Italic">see NATCA, MEBA/NMU</span>, 51 FLRA 993, 996 (1996), or by addressing any issue that necessarily arises from issues specifically included in a stipulation. <span class="Italic">See Air Force Space Div., L.A. Air Force Station, Cal</span>., 24 FLRA 516, 519 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority in two ways: (1) by addressing the conduct of management during the mediation session; and (2) by ordering the Chief to apologize to the grievant for his conduct during the mediation session.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the parties stipulated that the issue before the Arbitrator was whether the Agency violated Appendix F of the parties' agreement. The Arbitrator stated that Appendix F "requires management to take complaints of violence in the workplace seriously and to deal appropriately with them." In resolving this issue, the Arbitrator concluded that the Chief's determination that the commander did not engage in any violent action towards the grievant did not violate Appendix F of the parties' agreement, and that the Chief's investigation of the grievant's complaint did not violate Appendix F.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Arbitrator made these determinations, he decided the merits of the issue submitted to him, at which time the arbitration process should have ended. However, the Arbitrator went on to further rule that the Chief violated the requirements of the ADR program, separate and apart from Appendix F, in addition to Appendix F by not participating in good faith in the mediation session. In doing so, the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by deciding an issue that was not submitted to arbitration. Arbitrators may legitimately bring their judgment to bear in reaching a fair resolution of a dispute as submitted to or formulated by them, but they may not decide matters which are not before them. <span class="Italic">See NLRB, Tampa, Fla</span>, 57 FLRA 880, 881 (2002) (<span class="Italic">NLRB</span>); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not conclude that the Chief's conduct at the mediation session was part of the stipulated issue, which references Appendix F <span id="page_1892"></span>only, and not Appendix A; rather, he found only that the Chief's conduct at the mediation session "arguably" involved the issue of whether he violated Appendix F. However, the record is clear that the issue of the Chief's conduct at the mediation session was not an issue that was before the Arbitrator for resolution. Rather, the issue presented to the Arbitrator by the parties concerned whether management violated the terms of Appendix F of the parties' agreement. That issue clearly referred to the alleged grabbing of the grievant and the Chief's investigation of that incident. The Arbitrator addressed those matters and found that the Agency did not violate the parties' agreement as to those matters. Once the Arbitrator resolved those matters by finding that there was no violation, his job was done. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 57 FLRA at 881;<span class="Italic"> NSLC, </span>57 FLRA at 688-89<span class="Italic">; BOP, Marianna, </span>56 FLRA at 472.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Arbitrator expressly found violations of the ADR program requirements, which are separate and distinct from the workplace violence program under Appendix F of the parties' agreement, to justify his finding of a violation of Appendix F. As the ADR requirements are separate and distinct from the workplace violence program under Appendix F, the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by fashioning a remedy for a violation of the ADR requirements, even though he couched it in the context of a violation of the workplace violence program under Appendix F.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by deciding and awarding a remedy concerning an issue that was not submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 60 FLRA 584 (2005) (Member Pope dissenting) (the arbitrator exceeded his authority by deciding and ordering a remedy concerning issues that were not submitted to arbitration); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 59 FLRA 776 (2004) (Member Pope dissenting) (the arbitrator exceeded his authority by deciding and ordering a remedy concerning issues that were not submitted to arbitration).</p>
<p class="noindent">The "exceeds" exception applies when, following an FLRA ruling on exceptions to a basic award, the award is remanded to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator, who is then precluded from deciding an issue not submitted to him, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Coleman and AFGE Local 506</span>, 66 FLRA 300, 303-04 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrators exceed their authority when they fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregard specific limitations on their authority, or award relief to those not encompassed within the grievance. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1617</span>, 51 FLRA 1645, 1647 (1996). In determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his or her authority, the Authority accords an arbitrator's interpretation of a stipulated issue the same substantial deference that it accords an arbitrator's interpretation and application of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Info.

<p class="noindent-1">However, the Authority has held that an arbitrator's authority to fashion a remedy does not extend to issues that are not submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Sea Logistics Ctr., Detachment Atl., Indian Head, Md., </span>57 FLRA 687, 688 (2002) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy</span>). Moreover, the Authority has determined that, although arbitrators may legitimately bring their judgment to bear in reaching a fair resolution of a dispute submitted to them, they may not decide matters that are not before them. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Mint, Denver, Colo.</span>, 60 FLRA 777, 780 (2005) (then-Member Pope dissenting as to application).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, although the parties agreed to confer authority on the Arbitrator after his retention of jurisdiction had expired, they gave him limited authority on remand to address only the two stipulated issues. <span class="Italic">See </span>Exceptions at 6-7 (noting that the parties agreed that only the two stipulated issues were before the arbitrator); Exceptions, Attach. C at 7-8, 14-16, 52-55, 60 (indicating that only the stipulated issues were before the Arbitrator on remand and that other issues put before him prior to the original award were not before him). As noted above, the parties stipulated that the only issues before the Arbitrator were: (1) whether the fitness-for-duty examination was "an examination of an employee by a representative of the Agency"; and (2) whether "the fitness[-]for[-]duty examination [was conducted] in connection with an investigation." The Arbitrator resolved the stipulated issues by determining that, although the Union persuasively argued that the fitness-for-duty examination was conducted in connection with an investigation, no one who conducted the examination was a representative of the Agency. Moreover, the Arbitrator found that, because the fitness-for-duty examination was not conducted by Agency representatives, the "<span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>Doctrine" was not applicable. At that point, the Arbitrator had decided the merits of the issues submitted to him, found no violation, and, therefore, possessed no authority to direct a remedy. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Army, Womack Army Med. Ctr., Fort Bragg, N.C.</span>, 65 FLRA 969, 973 (2011); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Ogden Serv. Ctr., Ogden, Utah</span>, 63 FLRA 195, 197 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator determined that the Agency did not violate the "<span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>Doctrine," he went on to award the grievant "top-up pay" because he determined that, prior to the grievant's request for Union representation, she was harassed by co-workers and, as a result, was constructively discharged. The Arbitrator was not asked, or authorized, to resolve these other issues or to direct remedies concerning them. <span class="Italic">See </span>Exceptions at 6-7 (noting that the Arbitrator was asked only to address the two stipulated issues); Exceptions, Attach. C at 7-8, 14-16, 52-55, 60 (indicating that the Arbitrator was not asked to, nor authorized to, address other issues that were discussed in relation to the original award); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Envtl.

In fact, the parties specifically agreed that the Arbitrator should not address the issue of potential damages in the clarification award.[3] Consequently, by further finding that the grievant was harassed and constructively discharged and awarding the grievant "top-up pay," the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by deciding, and awarding a remedy concerning, an issue not submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See NLRB, Tampa, Fla.</span>, 57 FLRA 880, 881 (2002) (determining that the arbitrator exceeded her authority by deciding, and awarding a remedy concerning, an issue not submitted to arbitration); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 57 FLRA at 688-89 (same); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Food &#x0026; Drug Admin., New Orleans, La.</span>, 54 FLRA 90, 95 (1998) (same).</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1547 and Dept. of Air Force, Luke AFB</span>, 65 FLRA 91, 94-95 (2010), determined that an arbitrator did not exceed his authority by failing to address moot issues and by addressing an issue necessary to decide a stipulated issue or by addressing an issue that necessarily arose from issues specifically included in a stipulation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator exceeded his authority by failing to resolve a stipulated issue submitted to arbitration.</span></p>

Arbitrators, however, do not exceed their authority when they do not resolve issues that become moot as a consequence of the resolution of other issues. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Local 987</span>, 58 FLRA 619, 621 (2003) (then-Member Pope dissenting) (finding that a grievance was barred by the Statute, the arbitrator did not exceed his authority by not resolving other claims raised before the arbitrator).</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Stipulated issues numbers two through five</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not exceed his authority by not resolving stipulated issues two through five.&#x2003;The Arbitrator's determination not to reach those issues was based on his resolution of the first stipulated issue. That issue concerned whether the Agency committed a ULP when it unilaterally changed a condition of employment of bargaining unit employees. The condition of employment alleged to have been changed was the bargaining unit employees' ability to access their email accounts when off-base. In this regard, the Arbitrator concluded that there was no duty to bargain because the Agency's decision to change its email policy did not have an impact on the working conditions of bargaining unit employees, and consequently that the Agency did not commit a ULP when it unilaterally changed the access to the email system.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Arbitrator found that the Agency's action did not have an impact on the working conditions of bargaining unit employees, it rendered stipulated issues two through five moot. These issues concerned whether the Agency had fulfilled various aspects of its bargaining obligation relating to Agency changes in conditions of employment. If the Agency had, in fact, changed a condition of employment, then it would have been pertinent to consider the issues raised by stipulated issues two through five. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 462, 464 (2010) (prior to changing conditions of employment, agencies must provide the exclusive representative notice of the change and an opportunity to bargain). However, here, the Arbitrator concluded that the change in the Agency's email policy did not affect employees' working conditions because off-base email access was not a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator found that the Agency's action did not have an impact on the working conditions of bargaining unit employees, it became a moot point whether the Agency was required to give the Union notice of the change in policy (second issue); or to resolve whether the Agency was <span id="page_1893"></span>required to negotiate the impact and implementation of the changes to the email system (fourth issue). In addition, because the Arbitrator found that there was no duty to bargain, the issue of whether the Agency failed to give the Union an opportunity to bargain (third issue) became moot as well. Finally, as a result of the Arbitrator's conclusion with regard to the first issue, it also became moot for the Arbitrator to resolve whether there was a violation of Articles III, IV, and VI of the parties' LMA (fifth issue) because these articles also concern bargaining obligations over changes relating to conditions of employment. Accordingly, as issues two through five became moot when the Arbitrator resolved the first issue, there was no need for the Arbitrator to address them. Consequently, the Arbitrator did not exceed his authority by not resolving issues two through five.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Stipulated issue number six</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in contrast to issues two through five, the sixth stipulated issue did not become moot with the resolution of the first issue. The Arbitrator, therefore, exceeded his authority by not addressing issue number six. Unlike issues two through five, the sixth stipulated issue has nothing to do with whether the change in the Agency's email access policy had an impact on employees' working conditions. The sixth issue only required the Arbitrator to determine whether the Agency violated the 2006 MOU when it changed its policy regarding off-base email access. As indicated previously, <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 4, the 2006 MOU provided, in part, that systems, servers, and websites used by employees to apply for jobs would remain accessible to employees through the then-current user id/password procedures on private computers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by failing to resolve a stipulated issue submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def., Def.

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not exceed his authority by resolving whether off-base access to the Agency's email system was a condition of employment. As noted in Section B.1., above, in order to resolve whether the Agency committed a ULP when it unilaterally changed its email policy, it was necessary for the Arbitrator to address whether the change in email policy affected employees' working conditions. This in turn made it necessary for the Arbitrator to address whether off-base email access was a condition of employment.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The remaining Agency argument is that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority.&#x2003;Specifically, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by "imposing upon the [Agency] an obligation [notification of the Union] not specifically provided for under the terms of the Agreement."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, this exception also fails because the Arbitrator did not clearly violate an express limitation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Defense Dependents Schools,</span> 49 FLRA 120, 123 (1994) (arbitrator found to have exceeded his authority when he failed to adhere to a self imposed limitation of holding a hearing prior to issuing a final award). Rather, the Arbitrator properly exercised his power under both the agreement and Authority case law to interpret relevant provisions of the agreement in resolving the issue of whether the Agency must first notify the Union, not members of the bargaining unit, about overtime opportunities prior to determining whether a grievance would otherwise be constrained by the time limitations under Article 41, Section 6A of the parties' agreement. As such, the Agency's exception is merely an attempt to recast the Arbitrator's contract interpretation action as an exceeded authority allegation based upon an improper contract modification. <span class="Italic">See SSA, </span>57 FLRA 530, 537 (2001);<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Local 1546, </span>52 FLRA 94, 98 (1996);<span class="Italic"> United States Dep't of the Treasury, United States Mint, Philadelphia, Pa., </span>51 FLRA 1683, 1684-86 (1996) (where arbitrator properly engaged in interpretation of agreement language, attempt to challenge arbitrator's contract interpretation as exceeds authority exception was not permitted).

<p class="noindent-1">We construe the Union's assertions that the Arbitrator admitted into evidence material concerning an additional charge that is not part of the Agency's decision letter, and that the Arbitrator failed to rule on an unfair labor practice charge, as exceeds authority claims. An arbitrator exceeds his or her authority when the arbitrator fails to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolves an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregards specific limitations on his or her authority or awards relief to persons who are not encompassed within the grievance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def., Army &#x0026; Air Force Exch.

<p class="noindent-1">First, the Union contends that the Arbitrator admitted into evidence material concerning an additional charge that is not a part of the Agency's contention in its decision letter. We construe this as a claim that the Arbitrator resolved an issue not submitted to arbitration. The issue submitted to arbitration was whether the Agency violated the parties' agreement when it suspended the grievant for three days for failure to follow policy. The Arbitrator resolved that issue, and in doing so, he considered testimony regarding the grievant's alleged failure to make potential suicide-related entries into the inmates' records in the PDS. As the Arbitrator's actions and his award are directly responsive and confined to the stipulated issue, the Union has failed to demonstrate that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3495</span>, 60 FLRA at 511-12 (<span class="Italic">citing Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Union contends that the Arbitrator failed to rule on an unfair labor practice charge submitted to him concerning a purported change regarding the input of certain information into the PDS system. We construe this as a claim that the Arbitrator failed to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration. In this connection, we note that the parties stipulated the issue for the Arbitrator to resolve, and that issue does not include any reference to a purported change to the PDS system. Accordingly, we conclude that the Arbitrator did not fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHS, FEMA and AFGE Local 4060</span>, 69 FLRA 444, 445 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting in part), involved a stipulated issue of whether a nonpromotion violated the agency's mobility program. The arbitrator failed to decide that issue but instead directed promotion because the grievant was treated unfairly. FLRA set the award aside, remanding for the stipulated issue to be resolved:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties stipulated that the issue before the Arbitrator was: "Did the Agency violate...[the] [m]obility [p]rogram[&#8197;] when denying [the grievant's] promotion...? If so, is [the grievant] entitled to [backpay]?" The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency's failure to promote the grievant was "unfair and unwarranted," and she awarded the grievant backpay. But in her analysis supporting this conclusion, the Arbitrator did not make findings about, interpret, or even mention the mobility program. Further, by conducting a general "review of the Agency's promotion procedures," the Arbitrator addressed an issue not before her. Moreover, the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agency's failure to promote the grievant was "unfair and unwarranted" does not directly address the parties' stipulated issue. Therefore, we find that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority by resolving an issue not submitted to arbitration instead of resolving the stipulated issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where, like here, arbitrators exceed their authority by failing to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, the Authority will remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator, absent settlement, to resolve the stipulated issue.[16] Accordingly, we set aside the award and remand the matter to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for the Arbitrator to resolve the stipulated issue. While we regret the need to remand this matter, doing so enables the parties to have their dispute resolved by the individual who they jointly chose to resolve it: the Arbitrator.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In addition to its exceeded-authority claim, the Agency also argues that the award: (1) is based on a nonfact, (2) is contrary to Agency regulation--the mobility program, and (3) fails to draw its essence from the parties' collective-bargaining agreement.

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">SSA ODAR and AFGE Council 25</span>, 64 FLRA 469, 470-71 (2010) (Chairman Pope dissenting), the issue before the arbitrator was whether the agency improperly provided confidential information to a union official, but the exception to the award arose from a motion made by the union during the arbitration calling for payment of the travel expenses of the grievant, who also was the union representative and a witness at the arbitration. The arbitrator granted the motion, but FLRA set that part of the award aside because the arbitrator exceeded his authority by ruling on issue of cost allocation raised by the motion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the award deficient on the narrow ground that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority in granting the Union's motion for travel expenses. Arbitrators exceed their authority when they "resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1617, </span>51 FLRA 1645, 1647 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The general principles that apply are clear.&#x2003;An arbitrator may resolve only the issues properly submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The process by which issues are submitted to arbitration is well established. A grievance's statement of the issues may be adopted by an arbitrator, even if the parties disagree over how the issues should be formulated. <span class="Italic">See </span>Elkouri &#x0026; Elkouri<span class="Italic">, How Arbitration Works</span>, 296 (Alan Miles Ruben, ed., BNA Books 6th ed. 2003). Issues may also be properly brought before an arbitrator when the parties have stipulated to them or when the arbitrator formulates them himself. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 296-97<span class="Italic">; Veterans Admin.</span>, 24 FLRA 447, 451 (1986). An arbitrator's formulation of the issues is to be afforded deference. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1637, </span>49 FLRA 125, 130 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, once the issues have been framed, the arbitrator's authority in deciding the case has been defined, and the arbitrator may decide those issues only. "Arbitrators may legitimately bring their judgment to bear in reaching a fair resolution of a dispute as submitted to or formulated by them, but they may not decide matters which are not before them." <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin.</span>, 24 FLRA at 451; <span class="Italic">see generally </span>Elkouri &#x0026; Elkouri, <span class="Italic">supra </span>at 298 ("If a new issue arises at arbitration, an arbitrator ordinarily will refuse to consider the new matter over the objection of the other party."); <span class="Italic">Fairweather's Practice and Procedure in Labor Arbitration, </span>15-20 (Ray J. Schoonhoven, ed., BNA Books 4th ed. 1999). Where additional issues arise, an arbitrator may ask the parties for additional authorization. Elkouri &#x0026; Elkouri, <span class="Italic">supra </span>at 297.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator exceeded his authority when he resolved the issue regarding whether a Union representative can also be a witness or grievant for the purpose of having travel expenses paid by the Agency.&#x2003;As an initial matter, this issue is a substantive rather than procedural one. <span class="Italic">See John Wiley &#x0026; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston</span>, 376 U.S. 543, 558 (1964) (distinguishing "arbitrability of the subject matter" from "a dispute [that] arises over the procedures to be followed"). The contract language in Article 25, Section 5.E of the collective bargaining agreement is ambiguous regarding how the Agency should treat an employee with such dual status. Therefore, when the Arbitrator resolved this issue, he did more than merely apply a provision of the contract to determine whether a procedure should have been followed (such as with questions of timeliness, witness sequestration, and the admissibility of evidence); he had to interpret the contract to determine whether a Union representative can also be viewed as a grievant or a witness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, this new substantive matter was unrelated to the issues the Arbitrator had already formulated. Both the Union and the Agency proposed framing the issues around the Agency's allegedly improper disclosure of information to a Union official. When the Arbitrator stated his formulation of the issues, he also limited them in this fashion. Award at 5. Once the Arbitrator framed the issues, he was constrained from ruling on any unrelated substantive issues. "[T]he issue that the parties stipulated is the same as the issue the Arbitrator framed, and neither one required him to address the issue that he went on to decide." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</span>, <span class="Italic">Bremerton, Wash</span>., 53 FLRA 1445, 1449-50 n.3 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent's claim that the mere submission of a motion to an arbitrator by a party, without more, is sufficient to properly bring a matter before the arbitrator is unfounded. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., N. Chicago, Ill. </span>(<span class="Italic">VA N. Chicago), </span>3 <span class="Italic">on which the dissent relies, is not germane. The </span>motions resolved by the arbitrator in that case raised threshold issues <span id="page_1895"></span>of arbitrability. <span class="Italic">See VA N. Chicago, </span>52 FLRA at 388-90. The arbitrator had to resolve those issues before he could process the grievance. The same cannot be said of the no bearing on the arbitral process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also groundless is the dissent's reliance on <span class="Italic">United States Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals </span>(<span class="Italic">SSA</span>).[4] To begin with the most obvious distinction, <span class="Italic">SSA </span>dealt with an entirely different issue. Unlike this case, the agency in <span class="Italic">SSA </span>"except[ed] only [to] the portion of the award that require[d] payment to the Union" of a part of the union's arbitration costs. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 833. The agency's "exceeded authority" exception was so limited, claiming only "that the Arbitrator [improperly] modified the fee provision of the agreement." <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 836. Thus, <span class="Italic">SSA </span>does not directly present the issue whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority by deciding a matter involving, among other things, witness travel and per diem expenses.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;48 FLRA 833 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, in complete contrast to this case, the travel expense and arbitrator fee matters in <span class="Italic">SSA </span>related to threshold procedural issues concerning witness availability. As the Authority explained, <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 838, the arbitrator's determinations that the disputed witness's testimony was "necessary to the case" and that the agency should pay the witness's travel expenses to make the witness available were inextricably bound up with the arbitrator's ability to process the grievance. The remedy accorded the union concerning the arbitrator's fee simply "reflect[ed] the Arbitrator's assessment of the expense of extra time attributable to the Agency's improper action," refusing to make the witness available. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The instant case, where threshold issues like witness availability were never an issue, does not present any parallel. <span class="Italic">SSA </span>is therefore inapposite.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It would have been preferable for the parties to resolve on their own whether the contract allows a Union representative to also act as a grievant or witness for the purpose of having travel expenses paid by the Agency.&#x2003;Unfortunately, they could not. In these circumstances, the Arbitrator might have formulated the issues in the arbitration more broadly, or asked the parties for additional authorization. In any case, the Arbitrator had the authority to decide only those issues that were properly before him. As he formulated the issues, this issue was not. Therefore, on this record, we are constrained to find the award deficient on the very narrow ground that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority when he ruled on a question arising under Article 25, Section 5.E of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award may be remanded if the arbitrator appears to order a remedy without a violation of contract, law, or regulation, or if there is a violation without a remedy. FLRA explained that even in an expedited arbitration proceeding, the award must be sufficiently clear that it can be said whether or not the arbitrator exceed his or her authority, <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923,</span> 64 FLRA 516, 518-19 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that when an arbitrator decides the merits of a dispute and finds no violation of law or contract, the arbitrator has no authority to provide a remedy. <span class="Italic">See NLRB, Tampa, Fla.,</span> 57 FLRA 880, 881 (2002) (<span class="Italic">NLRB</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Marianna, Fla.,</span> 56 FLRA 467, 472 (2000) (citing <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin.,</span> 24 FLRA 447, 451 (1986)). Thus, the Authority has found that an arbitrator exceeded her authority when she concluded that an agency did not violate the parties' agreement as alleged, but, nevertheless, she provided a remedy. <span class="Italic">NLRB,</span> 57 FLRA at 881; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Sea Logistics Ctr., Detachment Atl., Indian Head, Md.,</span> 57 FLRA 687, 688-89 (2002). However, where an award is unclear as to whether an arbitrator's mitigation of a penalty is "based on a finding of a specific violation of applicable authority[,]" the Authority will remand the award for clarification from the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Justice, INS, Honolulu Dist. Office, Honolulu, Haw,</span> 43 FLRA 927, 937 (1992) (<span class="Italic">INS</span>, <span class="Italic">Honolulu</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the Arbitrator found that the grievant violated the Agency's trust when he forwarded confidential documents that he knew he had received in error. Further, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's investigation was thorough and fair. He also expressed unqualified agreement with "the Agency's interpretation of the facts presented into evidence[.]" Moreover, he evaluated the Agency's disciplinary action and found that it "appears consistent with the seriousness of the offense and the grievant's unblemished record of the past." Nevertheless, the Arbitrator sustained the grievance and set aside the suspension, on the condition that the grievant write an apology letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's only explicit rationale for setting aside the suspension is his belief that "the grievant should have one last chance to redeem himself and to maintain a clean disciplin[ary] record." However, the Arbitrator also found that the Agency-imposed sanction appears to be consistent with the grievant's record. It is unclear whether the Arbitrator was finding a violation of law or contract that warranted a remedy, or whether he was granting a remedy without finding a violation. <span class="Italic">See INS,</span> <span class="Italic">Honolulu</span>, 43 FLRA at 937.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We acknowledge that the parties' agreement does not require the Arbitrator in an expedited arbitration to state explicitly all of his findings as part of his decision. Thus, it is possible that the Arbitrator had a basis for setting aside the suspension that is not specified in his written award. However, we also note that Article 25, Section 7(C) of the parties' agreement states that the arbitrator "shall include a brief written explanation of the decision." It seems reasonable to infer that this requirement for a written explanation includes an unstated corollary requirement that such explanation be internally consistent, which this award is not. Because we are unable to determine whether the award is deficient in this regard, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for clarification of the basis for the remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The parties may elect to place jurisdiction in a particular arbitrator, and FLRA will protect that choice. If the parties vest jurisdiction in one arbitrator to hear and decide a dispute, another arbitrator who decides the dispute will have acted in excess of his authority, for he has exceeded his submission. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">GSA and AFGE Local 2600</span>, 34 FLRA 1123, 1128 (1990).

Oklahoma and AFGE Local 3354</span>, 59 FLRA 983, 986 (2004) ("one cannot award a remedy for an arbitrability issue other than finding the matter arbitrable and then conducting a merits analysis of the grievance"). When the issue was arbitrability and the merits determination was bifurcated, the arbitrator exceeded his authority by deciding both arbitrability and the merits (finding a contract violation but providing no remedy). The union, although it prevailed in the arbitrability determination, asserted that it failed to secure a full hearing on the merits. FLRA agreed with that position and vacated the award on the merits finding in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Dept. of Air Force, Warner Robins AFB</span>, 65 FLRA 411 (2010). An arbitrator exceeded his authority when, without a submission by the parties requesting him to determine the issue, he reapportioned his fees after issuing his final award (with no retention of jurisdiction) and issuing a billing that he later revised through a supplemental award. <span class="Italic">VA Eastern Kansas HCS and NFFE Local 1765</span>, 57 FLRA 440, 442 (2001).</p>

This comment does not amount to a resolution of an issue not before the Arbitrator."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Warner Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 32 FLRA 1081, 1082 (1988) (arbitrator's commentary that is not necessary to disposition of case constitutes <span class="Italic">dictum</span>). <span class="Italic">VAMC, Togus and AFGE Local 2610</span>, 55 FLRA 1189, 1191 (1999), summarized the law concerning the scope of issues decided by an arbitrator when comments made by the arbitrator in the award were challenged through exceptions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrators exceed their authority when they resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service,</span> <span class="Italic">Golden Gate National Recreation Area, San Francisco,</span> <span class="Italic">California and Laborers' International Union of North</span> <span class="Italic">America, Local 1276, </span>55 FLRA 193, 194 (1999) (<span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>). Arbitrators do not exceed their authority by addressing any issue that is necessary to decide a stipulated issue, <span class="Italic">see National Air Traffic Controllers Association, MEBA/NMU and U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration,</span> <span class="Italic">Southern California TRACON, </span>51 FLRA 993, 996 (1996), or by addressing any issue that necessarily arises from issues specifically included in a stipulation, <span class="Italic">see Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force Space Division, Los Angeles Air Force Station,</span> <span class="Italic">California and American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2429, </span>24 FLRA 516, 519 (1986) (<span class="Italic">LA Air Force Station</span>). In addition, we accord an arbitrator's interpretation of a stipulation of issues the same substantial deference that we accord an arbitrator's interpretation and application of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Information Agency, Voice</span> <span class="Italic">of America and American Federation of State, County,</span> <span class="Italic">and Municipal Employees, Local 1418, </span>55 FLRA 197, 198 (1999); <span class="Italic">LA Air Force Station, </span>24 FLRA at 518.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority based solely on the Arbitrator's statement that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the arbitrator's and the parties' attempts to frame the several layers of issues that emerged became overly intricate and did not reflect either the original grievance, the managerial response to it, nor the evidence that was placed into the record. Accordingly, the arbitrator <span id="page_1896"></span>answers the grievance as it is expressed and framed by the parties' written dialogue during the grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Agency relies on these statements as sufficiently supporting its exception, the Agency does not address the scope of the stipulation and what specific issues decided by the Arbitrator were beyond the stipulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Arbitrator's statements, standing alone, fail to establish that she exceeded her authority. Read in context of the record as a whole, we conclude that the statements of the Arbitrator reflect her interpretation, not rejection, of the stipulation of the parties. The statements reflect that the Arbitrator reviewed the record as a whole in order to construe the issues to be resolved. Based on that review, she concluded that the stipulated issues encompassed the Agency's reasons for accommodating Mr. R despite its obligations under the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</p>
