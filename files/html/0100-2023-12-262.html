Absent legal error, the Board cannot substitute its conclusions for those of the arbitrator, even if it would disagree with the arbitrator's decision. <span class="Italic">Id.; see Devine v. National Treasury Employees Union,</span> 737 F.2d 1031, 1033 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the arbitrator correctly held the appellant to a harmful error standard by requiring him to show that he was prejudiced by the agency's purported violations of the collective bargaining agreement and, as noted above, he determined that the appellant failed to show how he was harmed by the agency's alleged procedural errors. In his request for review, the appellant disputes this finding, asserting that the agency's delay had a negative impact on his professional development and personal well-being. These assertions, even if true, do not show that the agency would likely have reached a different result had it made its decision sooner. The appellant further asserts that one allegedly key witness resigned or retired shortly before the arbitration hearing and was not available to testify. It appears from the appellant's pleadings, however, that this potential witness did not leave the agency's employ until after the appellant was removed. Moreover, from the appellant's description of the witness's minimal involvement in his removal, any connection that the witness may have had to this case is tenuous at best. We see no basis on this record to conclude that the arbitrator's finding that the appellant failed to prove harmful error is incorrect as a matter of civil service law, rule, or regulation.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Interestingly, the Federal Circuit seems to give little if any deference to an arbitrator's construction of a collective bargaining agreement.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When an arbitrator is commissioned to interpret and apply the collective bargaining agreement, he is to bring his informed judgment to bear in order to reach a fair solution of a problem. This is especially true when it comes to formulating remedies. There, the need is for flexibility in meeting a wide variety of situations. The draftsmen may never have thought of what specific remedy should be awarded to meet a particular contingency. Nevertheless, an arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement; he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice. He may, of course, look for guidance from many sources, yet his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. When the arbitrator's words manifest an infidelity to this obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of the award.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, where, as here, the agency has established a legitimate, <span id="Page_1848"></span>nondiscriminatory reason for the appellant's removal by meeting its evidentiary burden on the merits, the issue of discrimination may be resolved by determining whether the appellant has shown that the agency's asserted reason for the action was merely a pretext for discrimination....

Ct. 2882, 2891 (1985); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 30 MSPR 389, <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 31 MSPR 479 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's assertion that the arbitrator failed to address instances in which management witnesses were impeached is a challenge to the arbitrator's factual findings underlying his credibility determinations. The arbitrator's failure to mention all of the evidence of record does not mean that he did not consider it in reaching his decision. <span class="Italic">See Marques v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 22 MSPR 129, 132 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F. 2d 1062 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 476 U.S. 1141, 106 S. Ct. 2247 (1986). The Board therefore defers to the arbitrator's factual findings regarding the credibility of the agency's witnesses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An arbitrator's finding that an appellant did not prove his discrimination claim is also a factual determination entitled to deference unless the arbitrator erred in his legal analysis. <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 55 MSPR 451 (1992). The appellant alleged that an Assistant Secretary of Labor held a personal vendetta against him because he is a black male. The arbitrator rejected the appellant's assertion that an Assistant Secretary "poisoned" the grievance process and implemented his own racist preference against the appellant because he found that the Assistant Secretary was not involved in the decision to remove the appellant. The arbitrator found that it was the undisputed testimony of the deciding official, a subordinate of the Assistant Secretary of Labor, that she made the decision without advice or instruction from her superior. Thus, the appellant's contention that the arbitrator erred with regard to his finding of no discrimination is at best mere disagreement with the arbitrator's credibility determinations and other findings of fact. These findings are entitled to Board deference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Benson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 548, 554-55 (1994), explained the limitations the Board imposes on itself when it reviews the form and substance of arbitrators' factfinding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Arbitration is a "bargained-for 'part of...self-government created by and confined to the parties.'" <span class="Italic">Devine v. White</span>, 697 F.2d 421, 432 (D.C. Cir. 1983) [footnote omitted]. It plays a "unique role in labor-management relations." <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, 30 MSPR at 395. Accordingly, arbitration awards are entitled to a greater degree of deference than initial decisions issued by the Board's administrative judges<span class="Italic">. See Bean v. EEOC</span>, 55 MSPR 609, 612 (1992). The Board will modify or set aside such a decision only where the arbitrator has erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law, rules, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Even if the Board would disagree with the arbitrator after reviewing the facts of record, it lacks the authority to second-guess the arbitrator and to substitute its conclusions for the specific conclusions in the arbitrators award absent legal error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, with regard to Ponce, the arbitrator specifically found that he was inciting a riot when he attempted to assist his friend, Benson, who was being confronted by a Master at Arms about a possible parking violation. This finding directly addresses the charge that Ponce incited a riot, and it does not conflict with a law, rule, or regulation. It is entitled to our deference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the arbitrator did not specifically address the other charges against the appellants, this omission does not mean that his decision is contrary to law, rule, or regulation. An arbitrator need not make explicit findings, or give his reasons for an award<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Girani v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 924 F.2d 237, 242 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Moreover, any ambiguity in his award is not necessarily reason to set it aside<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In any event, the arbitrator did explicitly find that the agency's actions were supported by a preponderance of the evidence, and that the appellants' removals were reasonable under the circumstances. We defer to these findings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lee v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 110 MSPR 355, 360 &#x00B6; 8, 2008 MSPB 252 (2008) ("These are specific findings, not in conflict with the Board's substantive law, and are therefore entitled to our deference. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Benson v. Department of the Navy,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 548, 554-55 (1994) (deferring to arbitrator's specific findings of fact).")</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of an unsuccessful attempt to secure what amounted to reversal of an arbitrator's analysis of a point of law is <span class="Italic">Dobruck v. VA</span>, 102 MSPR 578, 585 &#x00B6; 13-15, 2006 MSPB 213 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims that he was denied due process because the deciding official, in reaching the decision on his proposed removal, improperly considered allegations that the appellant had inflated his production numbers by making erroneous entries in a computer data system used to monitor production. The appellant asserts that there were improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between agency managers and the deciding official concerning these allegations, to which he was unable to respond. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> He also asserts that the agency rescinded the proposed admonishment based on these allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator found, however, that the deciding official relied solely on the data regarding the appellant's performance in making the decision to remove him. The appellant has failed to show that the arbitrator erred as a matter of law in reaching this conclusion. <span class="Italic">See Weaver</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 13 ("The arbitrator's factual determinations are entitled to deference unless he erred in his legal analysis, e.g., by misallocating burdens of proof or employing the wrong analytical framework."); <span class="Italic">Holly v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 10 (2002) ("An appellant seeking review of an arbitration decision has the burden of providing the Board with materials necessary to support matters raised on review, including a transcript or tape recording of the arbitration hearing."), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 69 Fed. Appx. 467 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Higgs v. Social Security Administration</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 48, 51-52 (1996) (employee's unsupported assertions that arbitrator erred in her fact findings were insufficient to show that the arbitrator's findings were in conflict with Board substantive law, and thus did not provide a basis for setting aside or modifying the arbitrator's award where the record did not contain the hearing transcript or exhibits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the arbitrator found that the deciding official's decision to remove the appellant was based solely on his performance record, we cannot conclude that the alleged <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">See Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Gerges v. Department of the Navy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 669, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23, 26-27 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 52 Fed. Appx. 513 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">General challenges to findings by an arbitrator will not likely secure alteration in the result, <span class="Italic">Cirella v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> 108 MSPR 474, 480-81 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16, 2008 MSPB 79 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Board will undertake a complete review of the record, the petitioning party must explain why the challenged factual determination is <span id="Page_1849"></span>incorrect and identify the specific evidence in the record that demonstrates the error<span class="Italic">. Weaver v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 129, 133 (1980), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>). A petition must contain sufficient specificity to enable the Board to ascertain whether there is a serious evidentiary challenge justifying a complete review of the record<span class="Italic">. Tines v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 90, 92 (1992). Mere disagreement with the arbitrator's factual findings and credibility determinations does not warrant full review of the record by the Board<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Weaver</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 133-34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has simply made vague allegations, unsupported by specific references to the record. Moreover, in sustaining the specifications, the arbitrator found that Jarnagin's, Wright's, and Abreu's testimony was more credible than that of the appellant and explained his reasons for his findings. The appellant's mere disagreement with the arbitrator's explained factual findings and legal conclusions does not show legal error. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dobruck</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 578, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Holly v.
