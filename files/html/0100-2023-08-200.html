<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-198"><span class="space">b.</span> Consolidation of Short Suspensions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will not consolidate, for jurisdictional purposes, short suspensions imposed at different times for different reasons, unless there is evidence that an agency attempted to avoid appeal rights through imposition of two or more suspensions, each less than 15 days. <span class="Italic">Price v. VA</span>, 3 MSPR 91, 92-93, 3 MSPB 206 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jennings v. MSPB</span>, 59 F.3d 159 (Fed. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">post</span>; <span class="Italic">Adikes v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 622, 624 (1983) (Board declined to treat a four-day suspension that occurred during the process leading to removal); <span class="Italic">Hightower v. <span id="Page_320"></span>Dept. of Army</span>, 6 MSPR 170, 170, 6 MSPB 151 (1981) (14-day suspension is not an adverse action only because a five-day suspension was issued five months earlier; the two do not combine into a single 19-day suspension). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Westbrook v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 77 MSPR 149, 155-56 (1997) (Board considered the possibility of reviewing a 7-day suspension imposed for the same reasons as a subsequent 23-day suspension ordered when an arbitrator concluded that a 30-day suspension was required for vehicle misuse and the agency then issued the subsequent suspension; the outcome, however, negated the necessity for combining the two actions: the second suspension was set aside as barred by the principle that misconduct can be punished by but one action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"For purposes of determining whether the employee has been suspended for more than 14 days, the Board may, under some circumstances, combine multiple suspensions of 14 days or less." <span class="Italic">Swink v. USPS</span>, 111 MSPR 620, 624 &#x00B6; 8, 2009 MSPB 133 (2009). In <span class="Italic">Kaminsky v. DHHS</span>, 13 MSPR 397, 399 (1982), a back-to-back period of enforced leave of 10 days and a suspension of 14 days combined to establish a suspension within the Board's jurisdiction, when both actions constituted an improper emergency suspension designed to keep the appellant out of work after an alleged threat to the supervisor. But in <span class="Italic">Bradley v. USPS</span>, 96 MSPR 539, 161 &#x00B6; 17 (2004),<span class="Italic"></span> an emergency suspension, taken under a Postal Service labor agreement provision intended to permit an investigation of an incident, was not combined with a disciplinary suspension that followed and that was based on the incident itself.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 109 MSPR 463, 467-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11, 2008 MSPB 180 (2008), established an analysis for determining whether nonconsecutive suspensions could be jurisdictionally combined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the initial decision, however, there exists no precedent, either before or after March 31, 1996, for combining non-consecutive suspensions of 14 days or less for purposes of finding Board jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Kaminsky v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 13 M.S.P.R. 397, 399 (1982), the Board combined a 14-day suspension with a 10-day period of enforced leave that immediately preceded it, where the suspension and enforced leave were based on the same reason. <span class="Italic">Cf. Jennings v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 59 F.3d 159, 160-61 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (finding that two 14-day suspensions, served consecutively, would not be combined for purposes of determining jurisdiction, as the two suspensions arose out of separate events and circumstances). However, neither the Board nor its reviewing court has ever combined nonconsecutive suspensions in order to reach the jurisdictional threshold. In <span class="Italic">Price v. Veterans Administration,</span> 3 M.S.P.R. 91 (1980), the appellant argued that the 5-day suspension that was the basis for his appeal should be combined with a subsequent 10-day suspension on the grounds that the agency was attempting to circumvent the law by giving him short suspensions at different times. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 92. The Board rejected the argument, finding that the two suspensions were based on wholly unrelated events and were different in time, and that there was no evidence that the agency had tried to circumvent regulations by imposing two suspensions of 14 days or less. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 93; <span class="Italic">see also Hightower v. Department of the Army,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 170, 170 (1981) (declining to combine two suspensions of 5 and 14 days where suspensions were based on different offenses and were separated by a period of approximately 5 months).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These precedents establish, at most, that consecutive suspensions of 14 days or less may be combined when they are based on the same reason, while leaving open the possibility that non-consecutive suspensions of 14 days or less may be combined when (1) the suspensions are based on the same reason and (2) there is evidence that the agency attempted to circumvent Board jurisdiction by imposing multiple suspensions of 14 days or less. <span class="Italic">See Kaminsky,</span> 13 M.S.P.R. at 399; <span class="Italic">Price,</span> 3 M.S.P.R. at 92-93. Here, the appellant was absent from duty on multiple occasions for the same reason, i.e., his temporary incapacitation, combined with a lack of available administrative work. There is no evidence, however, that the agency imposed multiple suspensions of 14 days or less in an attempt to prevent the appellant from exercising his appeal rights. Indeed, it does not appear that the agency regarded the appellant's absences as suspensions of any length. Consequently, we find that the appellant was not subjected to a suspension within the Board's jurisdiction, regardless of whether his absences from duty were voluntary or involuntary.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, the Board's jurisdiction is determined by the nature of an agency's action against a particular appellant at the time an appeal is filed with the Board. <span class="Italic">Himmel v. Department of Justice,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 484, 486 (1981). The Board has jurisdiction over suspensions of more than 14 days. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2), 7513(d), 7701. A "suspension" is the temporary placement of an employee in a non-pay, non-duty status for disciplinary reasons. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time the appellant filed his appeal, he had been in a non-pay, non-duty status from July 3 through July 10 (a period of 8 days), and from August 1 through August 7, 2008 (a period of 7 days), but he had been paid for the intervening period from July 11 through July 31, 2008. There exists no precedent for combining nonconsecutive suspensions for purposes of finding Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Stanton v. Department of Transportation,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 485, &#x00B6; 9 (2008). Therefore, at the time the appellant filed his appeal, he had not been subjected to a suspension of 14 days or more.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board has recognized that <span class="Italic">consecutive</span> suspensions may be combined when they are based on the same reason, while leaving open the possibility that non-consecutive suspensions may be combined when (1) the suspensions are based on the same reason and (2) there is evidence that the agency attempted to circumvent Board jurisdiction by imposing multiple suspensions of 14 days or less. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 10. Even though the appellant's separate periods of unpaid absences were apparently based on the same reason, the evidence does not establish that the agency separated the appellant's absences in order to circumvent Board jurisdiction. The agency claimed its intention was to place the appellant in a non-duty, non-pay status for no more than 14 days, and to grant him paid administrative leave thereafter. It alleged the appellant's separate periods of unpaid absences were the result of errors in processing his time and attendance records.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The appellant has not established that the agency was actively seeking to suspend him for more than 14 days while also depriving the Board of jurisdiction over the suspension. We therefore find insufficient evidence to combine the appellant's non-consecutive unpaid absences, as they stood at the time the appeal was filed, for jurisdictional purposes.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Given two suspensions totaling more than 14 days, if one is canceled with full back pay to the employee, the Board is justified in examining only the second. If the latter is 14 days or less, the Board lacks jurisdiction.

Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3450) (14-day suspension did not become appealable to the Board because of discrimination allegations or whistleblowing allegations that were not first raised with OSC). The Federal Circuit concluded that the Board correctly denied jurisdiction over two separate 14-day suspensions that arose out of separate infractions, were imposed on separate dates, and extended over nonoverlapping periods. It was immaterial that an EEOC administrative judge determined, before the Board appeal, that the suspensions should be considered to combine to a <span id="Page_321"></span>period of 28 days to make the case "mixed," with hearing rights at the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Smith v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jennings v. MSPB</span>, 59 F.3d 159, 160-61 (Fed. Cir. 1995), affirmed the Board's approach toward both the calculation of days involved in a short suspension and the combination of short suspensions imposed for different reasons:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A federal employee is provided the right to petition to the board for review of any "suspension of more than 14 days." 5 USC 7512(2) (1994). The term "suspension" is defined by 5 USC 7501(2) as "the placing of an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status without duties and pay." Here, substantial evidence supports the board's finding that Jennings was suspended for only fourteen days. The agency's "Notice of Suspension" clearly indicated that the suspension was for fourteen days. Therefore, his fourteen day suspension ended on Friday, April 22. The fact that the agency notified Jennings to return to work on Monday, April 25, instead of Saturday, April 23, did not extend his suspension. He had neither duties nor entitlement to pay on Saturday and Sunday. The agency notified him to return to work on April 25 because Saturday, April 23, and Sunday, April 24, were not scheduled as work days. <span class="Italic">See Perez v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 248, 250 n.2 (1992) ("Because the appellant was not returned to work on May 4, 1991, based on his predetermined work schedule rather than disciplinary reasons, the suspension cannot be deemed to have lasted more the 14 days.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jennings also argues that, for purposes of determining jurisdiction, the duration of his two suspensions should be combined because they were served consecutively. Therefore, Jennings believes that the board had jurisdiction over his appeal because his two suspensions together totalled more than fourteen consecutive days. Again, we disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jennings was subjected to two separate disciplinary suspensions of fourteen days each. The first suspension resulted from Jennings' failure to follow orders; the second from a separate incident that occurred over a month later involving verbal threats against his supervisor. Because these two suspensions arose out of separate events and circumstances, they cannot be combined to constitute a single suspension for the purpose of determining jurisdiction. Otherwise, contrary to logic, two unrelated agency actions that were not covered under 5 USC 7512 would become appealable merely because the suspensions were served consecutively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, it was not necessary for the agency to allow an intervening work day in order to retain the designation of each suspension as one of not more than fourteen days. The exigencies of the incident that led to the second suspension could reasonably have justified a suspension beginning on the day Jennings was to return from his first suspension. The fact that the suspensions arose from different events was sufficient to constitute them as separate, non-combinable suspensions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Consolidation of short periods of alleged enforced leave was considered, and denied, and tacking of short periods of alleged enforced leave was addressed in <span class="Italic">Talty v. USPS,</span> DE-3443-09-0360-I-1 (NP 7/29/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has yet to combine non-consecutive suspensions of 14 days or less for purposes of finding Board jurisdiction. Our case law suggests the possibility that non-consecutive suspensions of 14 days or less may be combined when (1) the suspensions are based on the same reason and (2) there is evidence that the agency attempted to circumvent Board jurisdiction by imposing multiple suspensions of 14 days or less. <span class="Italic">See Palmer v. Department of Transportation</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 438, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2008). Here, the appellant's absences during this period were based on the same reason, i.e., lack of light duty work within his medical restrictions. However, there is no evidence that the agency imposed multiple partial-day suspensions in order to circumvent Board jurisdiction. Indeed, it does not appear that the agency regarded the absences as suspensions of any length. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.<span class="Italic"></span> The appellant suggests that the agency's previous imposition of a 14-day suspension in November 2008 reflects an intent to deny him Board appeal rights, but that decision has no apparent bearing on the availability of light duty in April and May 2009. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge properly dismissed the appellant's constructive suspension appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
