<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7511 twice refers to temporary appointments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this subchapter--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;"employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;an individual in the competitive service--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003; who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The terms "term" and "temporary" are not the same when used to describe appointments, although much confusion results in caselaw--at least until <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/13-3056.Opinion.1-13-2014.1.PDF">741 F.3d 81</a> (Fed. Cir. 2014) (Judge Prost dissenting), making reasonably clear the significance of OPM definitions as they affect the nature of appointments and the significance of those appointments under 5 USC 7511 for Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations at 5 CFR Part 316 (2022) define and describe temporary appointments and term appointments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">PART 316--<span class="Italic">TEMPORARY AND TERM EMPLOYMENT</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subpart C--<span class="Italic">Term Employment</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 316.301 <span class="Italic">Purpose and duration</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An agency may make a term appointment for a period of more than 1 year but not more than 4 years to positions where the need for an employee's services is not permanent. Reasons for making a term appointment include, but are not limited to: project work, extraordinary workload, scheduled abolishment, reorganization, contracting out of the function, uncertainty of future funding, or the need to maintain permanent positions for placement of employees who would otherwise be displaced from other parts of the organization. Agencies may extend appointments made for more than 1 year but less than 4 years up to the 4-year limit in increments determined by the agency. The vacancy announcement should state that the agency has the option of extending a term appointment up to the 4-year limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;OPM may authorize exceptions beyond the 4-year limit when the extension is clearly justified and is consistent with applicable statutory provisions. Requests to make and/or extend appointments beyond the 4-year limit must be initiated by the employing office and sent to the appropriate OPM service center.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)(1)&#x2003;An agency may make a term appointment for a period of more than 1 year but not more than 10 years to a covered position defined in (2) when the need for an employee's services is not permanent. An agency may extend an appointment made for more than 1 year but fewer than 10 years up to the 10-year limit in increments determined by the agency. The vacancy announcement must state that the agency has the option of extending a term appointment under this section up to the 10-year limit. No appointment made under this section may last longer than 10 years from the date of the initial appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An agency may make a term appointment for more than 1 year but not more than 10 years to the following positions (as described in OPM's Handbook of Occupational Groups and Series):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Social Science Series, 0101;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 316.401 <span class="Italic">Purpose and duration.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appropriate use</span>. An agency may make a temporary limited appointment--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;To fill a short-term position (i.e., one that is not expected to last longer than 1 year);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;To meet an employment need that is scheduled to be terminated within the timeframe set out in paragraph (c) of this section for such reasons as abolishment, reorganization, or contracting of the function, anticipated reduction in funding, or completion of a specific project or peak workload; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;To fill positions on a temporary basis when the positions are expected to be needed for placement of permanent employees who would otherwise be displaced from other parts of the organization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Certification of appropriate use</span>. The supervisor of each position filled by temporary appointment must certify that the employment need is truly temporary and that the proposed appointment meets the regulatory time limits. This certification may constitute appropriate documentation of compliance with the limits set out in paragraph (c) of this section. The reason(s) for making a temporary limited appointment must be stated on the form documenting each such appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time limits--general</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;An agency may make a temporary appointment for a specified period not to exceed 1 year. The appointment may be extended up to a maximum of 1 additional year (24 months of total service). Appointment to a successor position (i.e., to a position that replaces and absorbs the position to which an individual was originally appointed) is considered to be an extension of the original appointment. Appointment to a position involving the same basic duties and in the same major subdivision of the agency and same local commuting area as the original appointment is also considered to be an extension of the original appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An agency may not fill a position by temporary appointment if that position has previously been filled by temporary appointment(s) for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, within the preceding 3-year period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exceptions to general time limits</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Agencies may make and extend temporary appointments to positions involving intermittent or seasonal work without regard to the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section, <span class="Italic">provided</span> that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Appointments and extensions are made in increments of 1 year or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Employment in the same or a successor position under this and any other appointing authority totals less than 6 months (1,040 hours), excluding overtime, in a service year. The service year is the calendar year that begins on the date of the employee's initial appointment in the agency. Should employment in a position filled under this exception total 6 months or more in any service year, the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section will apply to subsequent extension or reappointment unless OPM approves continued exception under this section. An individual may be employed for training for up to 120 days following initial appointment and up to 2 weeks a year thereafter without regard to the service year limitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;OPM will authorize exceptions to the limits set out in paragraph (c) of this section only when necessitated by major reorganizations or base closings or other unusual circumstances. Requests based on major reorganization, base closing, restructuring, or other unusual circumstances that apply agencywide must be made by an official at the headquarters level of the Department or agency. Requests involving extension of appointments to a specific position or project based on other unusual circumstances may be submitted by the employing office to the appropriate OPM service center.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Competitive temporary appointments</span>. In accordance with the time limits in &#x00A7; 316.401, an agency may make a temporary appointment under part 332 of this chapter, by using competitive procedures, or under part 337 of this chapter, by using direct-hire procedures, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Noncompetitive temporary appointments</span>. In accordance with the time limits in &#x00A7; 316.401, an agency may give a noncompetitive temporary appointment, without regard to the requirements of parts 332 and 333 of this chapter, to an individual who is qualified for the position and who is eligible for:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Reinstatement under &#x00A7; 315.401 of this chapter;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Veterans recruitment appointment under &#x00A7; 307.103 of this chapter. Temporary limited appointments under this section are permitted only at the grade levels authorized for VRA appointments. Such appointments are not VRA appointments and do not lead to conversion to career-conditional appointment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Career-conditional appointment under &#x00A7; 315.601, 315.604, 315.605, 315.606, 315.607, 315.608, 315.609, 315.612, 315.703, or 315.711 of this chapter;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Appointment under 5 U.S.C. 3112 (veterans with compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent of more). The disability must be documented by a notice of retirement or discharge due to service-connected disability from active military service dated at any time, or by a notice of compensable disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs, dated 1991 or later;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;Appointment under 28 U.S.C. 602 for current and former employees of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;Reappointment on the basis of being a former temporary employee of the agency who was originally appointed from a certificate of eligibles or under the provisions of part 333 of this chapter. An agency may not reappoint a former temporary employee if the individual has already served the maximum time allowed in &#x00A7; 316.401 or if the position has been filled under temporary appointment for the maximum time allowed in &#x00A7; 316.401. Reappointment must be to the same position or another position appropriate for temporary appointment with the same qualification requirements;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(8)&#x2003;Reappointment on the basis of being a former temporary employee who was originally appointed from a certificate of eligibles or under the provisions of part 333 of this chapter and who sustained a compensable injury while serving on the temporary appointment. Reappointment must be to the same position or another position appropriate for temporary appointment with the same qualification requirements. If the compensable injury disqualifies the former individual from performing such a position, reappointment may be to any position for which the individual is qualified. Reappointment must be for a minimum of 120 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Extension of temporary appointments</span>. An individual who receives a valid temporary appointment will be eligible for an extension in accordance with &#x00A7; 316.401 even if his or her eligibility for noncompetitive appointment expires or is lost during the authorized period of temporary employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 316.403 <span class="Italic">Designation of provisional appointments.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Conditions for designation</span>. An agency may designate a temporary appointment as a provisional appointment only when all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The appointment is made to fill a continuing position by a provisional appointment leading to permanent appointment when the position must be filled more quickly than would be possible under the procedures required for nontemporary appointment or when such a provisional appointment is a requirement of the applicable authority;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The agency must have current budgetary and appointing authority for the nontemporary appointment (assuming satisfactory completion of the required procedures); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The agency must have a specific intention to convert the appointee to a nontemporary appointment under appropriate authority before the expiration of the temporary appointment, must state this intention in any written offer of employment and document this intention as part of the permanent record of the initial appointment in accordance with instructions issued by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority for provisional appointments</span>. Provisional appointments must be made under an authority established by law, Executive order, or regulation or granted by OPM. Appointments which may be treated as provisional appointments under this paragraph may be made under any appropriate authority, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Noncompetitive temporary appointments of disabled veterans under &#x00A7; 316.402(b)(5), when the appointments are intended to afford eligibility for conversion in accordance with &#x00A7; 315.707 of this chapter and section 3112 of title 5, United States Code;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Temporary appointments of nurses in the Department of Veterans Affairs, when the appointments are made under the provisions of section 4114 of title 38, United States Code, with the intention of converting the appointees to continuing appointments as soon as the appointees obtain required State certification or registration and/or the agency completes necessary verification of references;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Temporary transitional Schedule C appointments made under &#x00A7; 213.3302 of this chapter, when the appointees are to be converted to nontemporary Schedule C appointments upon OPM approval and completion of necessary clearances.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;Temporary appointments of severely physically handicapped individuals, when such appointments are required to demonstrate qualifications for nontemporary appointment under &#x00A7; 213.3102(u) of this chapter, and when the appointees will be converted to such nontemporary appointment upon successful performance in the trial position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Warren v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 116 MSPR 554, 558-59 &#x00B6; 12, 2011 MSPB 68 (2011), noted, and attempted to rectify, confusion in terminology, explaining that term appointments are made only in the competitive service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that the appellant is not serving a term appointment excluded from CSRS coverage. However, we base our finding not on the length of the appointment, but rather on the fact that the appointment was in the excepted service. As OPM explained when it issued the regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 316, the term appointment provisions under that part apply exclusively to the competitive service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Excepted appointments are not covered by 5 C.F.R. part 316. However, unless the specific excepted service authority provides otherwise, agencies may make an excepted appointment on a time limited basis for more than 1 year. Such excepted appointments are comparable to term appointments in the competitive service, but there is no maximum time limit unless specified by a particular excepted service authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">63 Fed. Reg. 63,781, 63783 (Nov. 17, 1998). Consequently, the appellant's 5-year excepted service appointment, while "comparable" to a term appointment in the competitive service, is not properly speaking a term appointment.[3] Moreover, OPM has interpreted 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(14) as excluding from CSRS coverage only those employees serving term appointments under 5 C.F.R. Part 316. <span class="Italic">See Handbook</span>, &#x00A7; 10A1.3-3(C). Because the appellant is not serving a term appointment, or any other category of appointment excluded from CSRS coverage by law or regulation, we conclude that she was properly placed in CSRS Offset and is not entitled to relief under FERCCA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that the Board has on occasion erroneously referred to "term" appointments in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gamble v. Department of the Army</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 22 (2009); <span class="Italic">Killingsworth v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 273, 275 (1982). To the extent those decisions are inconsistent with our finding in this case, we hereby modify them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/13-3056.Opinion.1-13-2014.1.PDF">741 F.3d 81</a> (Fed. Cir. 2014) (Judge Prost dissenting) (applying OPM definitions of term and temporary appointments to excepted service positions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Uddin v. Dept. of Navy,</span> SF-0752-10-0037-I-1 (NP 2/3/2011), indirectly described the nature of a temporary appointment, with reference to the OPM regulations and with reference to collateral benefits that depend on the nature of the appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in reinstating him only for the balance of his appointment, which was scheduled to end on February 10, 2010, when he reversed the agency's removal action. The appellant asserts that the agency violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.401(c)(1) in extending his initial appointment, effective November 13, 2006, until January 11, 2009, because section 316.401(c)(1) "prohibits an agency from making a temporary appointment in excess of 24 months of total service." He similarly asserts that the agency violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.401(c)(2) in extending his temporary appointment on December 18, 2008, until February 10, 2010, because section 316.401(c)(2) "prohibits an agency from filling a position by temporary appointment if that position has previously been filled by temporary appointment(s) for an aggregate of 2 years within the preceding 3 year period." The appellant asserts that in violating 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.401 the agency converted him to a permanent employee, and therefore "his reinstatement should not have been limited by the date of February 10, 2010 or any other date."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Each of the SF-50s submitted into the record by the agency shows that the appellant was appointed for periods exceeding one year. Accordingly, because the appellant's appointments were not limited to 1 year or less, they were not "temporary" appointments under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.401. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Murdock-Doughty v. Department of Air Force</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 244, 251 (1997); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.401(c) ("An agency may make a temporary appointment for a specified period not to exceed 1 year."). Moreover, even if the agency mistakenly sought to appoint the appellant under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.401, the appellant has failed to point to any law, rule, or regulation that would convert him to a permanent employee under such circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the evidence in the record indicates that the appellant's appointments were term appointments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.301 ("An agency may make a term appointment for a period of more than 1 year but not more than 4 years to positions where the need for an employee's services is not permanent."). As noted above, each of the appellant's appointments was for a period of more than 1 year. Further, as the agency points out in its response to the appellant's petition for review, the SF-50s show that the appellant was entitled to retirement benefits under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and FICA, benefits to which an employee serving under a temporary appointment would not be entitled. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 890.102(c)(1) (providing that an employee serving under an appointment lasting 1 year or less is not eligible for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.105(a)(1) (providing that an employee serving under an appointment lasting 1 year or less is not eligible for FERS); <a href="http://www.opm.gov/retire/pre/fercca/faq/Determine.htm">http://www.opm.gov/retire/pre/fercca/faq/Determine.htm</a> (noting that code K in box 30 of an SF-50 indicates FERS and FICA coverage). Accordingly, as the appellant served under term rather than temporary appointments, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant is entitled only to retroactive reinstatement up to February 10, 2010, the date of the expiration of his term appointment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the competitive service temporary appointee, under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), the precondition to an appeal right is completion of one year of current continuous service in under other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less. The competitive service employee cannot acquire ordinary appeal rights through a temporary appointment or appointments of less than one year in duration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Parkinson v. DOJ</span>, 70 MSPR 316, 319 (1996) (nor could appellant appeal as probationer because, as a temporary appointee, he was not serving a probationary year under a career or career conditional appointment). <span class="Italic">Fish v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 595, 597-98 (1985), explained that a series of competitive service temporary limited appointments, each less than a year, do not provide an appeal upon termination even if the sum of the appointments exceeds the one-year waiting period:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The statute at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b) provides that an employee against whom a removal action is taken is entitled to certain procedural rights. An "employee" for purposes of Chapter 75 is defined as follows: "an individual in the competitive service...who has completed 1 year of current continuous employment under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less"; or "a preference eligible...in the excepted service...who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions." 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) and (B). The competitive service consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch except positions which are specifically excepted from the competitive service by or under statute. 5 USC &#x00A7; 2102(a)(1). The President has the power to except positions from the competitive service, 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3301 and 3302, and OPM, under delegating authorities, exercises the power on behalf of the President. 5 CFR Part 6. The Civil Service Rules determine the manner in which OPM may "specifically except" positions from the competitive service. 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6.1 and 6.2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that the appellant's position was in the competitive service. OPM appointed the appellant pursuant to 5 CFR Part 316, Subpart D. Such temporary limited appointments are a creation of OPM regulations and have not been excluded from the competitive service or placed in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">Cf. Carter v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the</span> Army, 19 MSPR 135 (1984) (TAPER appointments are a creation of OPM regulations and have not been placed in the excepted service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) also requires that the appellant "has completed 1 year of current continuous appointment under other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less." The record in this appeal clearly reflects that each of the appellant's eight appointments was a temporary appointment limited to one year or less. Therefore, although the appellant is in the competitive service, he does not meet the requirements of an "employee" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A). We find consequently that the Board has no jurisdiction to hear this appeal.</p>

An individual whose term appointment is terminated during the trial period, based on a pre-appointment reason, may appeal to the Board on the ground that the agency did not follow the procedures (advance notice, opportunity to respond, and written decision set forth at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.805. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 316.304(b) (incorporating section 315.805 by reference); <span class="Italic">Jordan v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Whether an individual has the right to appeal an adverse action depends on whether he or she was an "employee" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). That section defines "employee," insofar as is relevant here, as "(A) an individual in the competitive service--(i) who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or (ii) who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less[.] "</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant held a position in the competitive service. Although an individual does not gain competitive status by virtue of a term appointment, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 316.303(a), such an individual can nevertheless hold a position in the competitive service. "Competitive status" refers to a particular person's eligibility for non-competitive assignment to a competitive position. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 212.301; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 212.101. As the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) explained in the now-defunct Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), competitive status "belongs to an employee, not to a position" (emphasis in original), and a position can be in the competitive service whether or not the person occupying it has competitive status. FPM Part 212, &#x00A7; 2-2(a), (b) (July 14, 1989). The Board has recognized this distinction<span class="Italic">. See Carter v. Department of the Army</span>, 19 MSPR 135, 137 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant held a position in the competitive service, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) applies. That provision has two subsections: "[an individual] (i) who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or (ii) who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less[.] "</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, the following individuals in the competitive service had a regulatory right to appeal adverse actions to the Civil Service Commission:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;Any career, career-conditional[,] overseas limited, indefinite, or term employee, or any employee serving under a career executive assignment, in a competitive position who is not serving a probationary or trail [sic] period[;] and (ii) any employee serving in a competitive position who has completed 1 year of current continuous employment except one serving under a temporary appointment with a definite time limitation or a limited executive assignment[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.201(a)(1) (1978); <span class="Italic">accord</span> FPM &#x00A7; 752.201(a)(1) (Sept. 1, 1977). The CSRA made the right to appeal certain adverse actions statutory. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512, 7513(d). Congress modeled 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), which describes individuals who can appeal adverse actions listed in section 7512, on the regulation quoted above, and did not intend any change in substance<span class="Italic">. See Rochniak v. Department of the Navy</span>, 10 MSPR 603, 605 (1982), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Long v. Department of the Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 438 (1987). Section 7511 (a)(1)(A)(i) was meant to give individuals in the competitive service serving under "career, career-conditional, or certain other non-temporary appointments, and who have completed a probationary or trial period," the right to appeal certain adverse actions<span class="Italic">. See</span> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 48 (1978)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has observed that interpretations of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) have been "somewhat confusing." <span class="Italic">See</span> 53 Fed. Reg. 21,619 (1988). As OPM has explained, if an individual in the competitive service held an appointment requiring a probationary or trial period, then his or her rights are governed by section 7511(a)(1)(A)(i); if the individual held an appointment not requiring a probationary or trial period, then his or her rights are governed by section 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). These classes of appointees are distinct, and an individual required to serve a probationary or trial period need not meet the "current continuous service" test. 53 Fed. Reg. 21,619; <span class="Italic">see also Carr v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 681, 683 (1990) ("current continuous service" means service immediately preceding the action appealed); <span class="Italic">Rochniak</span>, 10 MSPR at 605 (the CSRA created "[t]wo different classes" of competitive service employees with the right to appeal certain adverse actions: those who had completed a probationary period, and those for whom a probationary period "was not applicable").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To recapitulate, an individual's appeal rights are determined by subsection (i) of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) if he or she held an appointment requiring a probationary or trial period, and are determined by subsection (ii) if he or she held an appointment not requiring a probationary or trial period. The two subsections are mutually exclusive. <span class="Italic">Cf. Kane v. Department of the Army</span>, 60 MSPR 605, 610-11 (1994). This mutual exclusivity is embodied in OPM's current regulations, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.401(c)(1), (2), which are entitled to deference.... Thus, in every case involving an individual in the competitive service, only one subsection of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) will apply--depending on whether the appellant held an appointment that required completion of a probationary or trial period--and will or will not be satisfied. The other subsection will not apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, a competitive-service term appointee is required to serve a one-year trial period. The statutory phrase in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i), "not serving a probationary or trial period," is equivalent to "no longer serving a trial period" or "completed a trial period." <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 48 (1978). Although the statute does not expressly refer to term appointees, it is not limited to career-conditional appointees, i.e., individuals "in other than temporary, term, or indefinite employment" who have completed the three continuous years of service required to gain career status<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.201(a). Indeed, as noted above, Congress intended to extend statutory appeal rights to those who in 1978 had regulatory appeal rights, and term appointees had regulatory appeal rights in 1978. In other words, term appointments are among the "certain other non-temporary appointments" referred to in the Senate report cited above who were intended to gain statutory appeal rights in the CSRA. To hold otherwise would create the anomaly that a term appointee would have limited appeal rights if separated during the trial period, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 316.304(b), but no appeal rights if removed after the completion of the trial period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, at the time of his separation the appellant held a term appointment, the first year of which is a trial period. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 316.304(a). Thus, subsection (i) of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) applies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Service under a temporary appointment will be credited toward completion of the one-year probationary period required under a career or career-conditional appointment, in a procedure known as "tacking," so long as certain specified conditions are met<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Coltin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 20 MSPR 16 (1984); <span class="Italic">Angell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 266 (1980). Those conditions are that the prior service was rendered immediately preceding the career or career-conditional appointment, in the same line of work, in the same agency, and with no more than one break in service of less than 30 days<span class="Italic">. See Long v. Department of the Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 438, 441 (1987) (relying on FPM ch. 315, sec. 8-2 &#x0026; app. A-3(c)). The administrative judge held that the FPM provisions relied on in <span class="Italic">Long</span> applied only to completion of probation under a career or career-conditional appointment, and not to completion of a trial period under a term appointment. As explained below, we disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although at the time the appellant received his term appointment in 1994 there were no regulations or extant FPM provisions governing the crediting of prior service toward completion of a term appointment trial period, there was such an FPM provision when the CSRA was enacted. FPM Supp. 752-1, section S2-1(c) (Oct. 11, 1976), provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee with a term appointment, overseas limited term appointment, overseas limited appointment of indefinite duration, or indefinite appointment is covered by subparts B and C of part 752 [relating to adverse actions] if he is not serving a trial period.... (FPM chapter 315 contains information for determining completion of a trial period.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By referring to FPM chapter 315 (relating to tacking), in a provision governing term appointees, the Civil Service Commission intended for the FPM provisions governing credit toward completion of the trial period under a career or career-conditional appointment to apply also to completion of the trial period under a term appointment. FPM Supp. 752-1 "became obsolete" on January 11, 1979, with the advent of the CSRA<span class="Italic">. See</span> FPM Bulletin 752-8 (Feb. 20, 1979). Still, Congress did not intend to restrict then-existing regulatory rights of appeal when it enacted the CSRA, but instead intended to transform those rights into statutory ones:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Subsection (a) [of section 7511] provides a statutory basis for the procedural protections and appeal rights now granted employees in the competitive service who are serving under Career, career-conditional, or certain other non-temporary appointments, and who have completed a probationary or trial period. Protections against arbitrary or capricious actions have become established by practice and Executive Order--but not by statute--as a basic right of competitive service employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S.&#x2003;Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 48 (1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore hold that the tacking of prior service toward completion of a trial period under a term appointment is entailed by the CSRA itself, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i), despite the formal demise of the applicable FPM provisions. This holding is consistent with a long line of cases in which the <span id="Page_200"></span>Board ruled that prior temporary service immediately preceding a career or career-conditional appointment, in the same line of work, in the same agency, and with no more than one break in service of less than 30 days, will be credited toward completion of a probationary period<span class="Italic">. See Raman v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 34 MSPR 428, 430-31 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 845 F.2d 1034 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table); <span class="Italic">Long v. Department of the Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 438, 441 (1987); <span class="Italic">Coltin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 20 MSPR 16, 17 (1984); <span class="Italic">Angell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 266, 267 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our holding that prior temporary service meeting certain conditions will be credited toward completion of the trial period under a term appointment is also consistent with the purpose of probationary and trial periods. In deciding that temporary service can be credited toward completion of probation under a career or career-conditional appointment, the Board expressly noted that the purpose of probation is to allow an agency to determine the fitness of an employee<span class="Italic">. See Angell</span>, 4 MSPR at 268. If continuous service under temporary and career-conditional appointments in the same line of work and the same agency exceeds one year, that purpose has been served<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Likewise, if continuous service under temporary and term appointments in the same line of work and the same agency exceeds one year, the purpose of the trial period has been served.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant had served for 11 months under his term appointment when he was separated, but his total service under the temporary and term appointments, which was all in the same line of work, with the same agency, and without a break, exceeded one year. By tacking the appellant's temporary service that commenced on April 25, 1994 onto his term service, we find that he completed his trial period on April 24, 1995, and at that time became an "employee" with the right to appeal the adverse actions listed at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512. Accordingly, the appellant's September 7, 1995 separation is an appealable removal, within our jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the separation of a term appointee at the expiration of the term specified at the time of appointment is not an appealable adverse action<span class="Italic">. See Berger v. Department of Commerce</span>, 3 MSPR 198 (1980); 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512. Where, as here, however, a term appointee is separated for cause after completion of the trial period but before the expiration of the term specified at the time of appointment, then he or she has been removed, and can appeal. 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that, with exceptions not relevant here, an employee against whom an adverse action is contemplated is entitled to 30 days advance written notice setting out the reasons for the proposed action, a reasonable time to respond, and a written decision stating "the reasons therefor." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b). In this case, it appears that the appellant was afforded 30 days advance written notice of his proposed separation and the right to respond, and that the agency provided him with written notice of its decision. At least on this record, then, we cannot say that the appellant's removal must automatically be set aside as not having been taken according to the procedures prescribed by statute. <span class="Italic">Cf. Coltin</span>, 20 MSPR at 17-18 (where an agency removed an employee without giving him 30 days advance notice and an opportunity to respond as required under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b), mistakenly believing that he had not completed his probationary period, his removal was reversed on the ground that the agency committed harmful procedural error).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal must therefore be remanded for adjudication on the merits....</p>

Because the appellant's appointments were not limited to 1 year or less, they were not "temporary" appointments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 316.401(c) ("[a]n agency may make a temporary appointment for a specified period not to exceed 1 year"). Rather, as indicated in the appellant's SF-50s, her 1993 and 1994 appointments were "term" appointments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 316.301 ("[a]n agency may make a term appointment for a period of more than 1 year but not more than 4 years").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a competitive service employee serving under a term appointment for a period not limited to 1 year or less at the time of her removal whose appointment was subject to a 1-year trial or probationary period that she completed, the appellant is an "employee" for purposes of 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 316.304(a); <span class="Italic">Youngs</span>, 73 MSPR at 557-558.

<p class="Body-Text">The suggestion in earlier decisions that the provisions of 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(A) are mutually exclusive is not a current interpretation. The conditions of the statute are stated in the alternative. To the extent <span class="Italic">Youngs</span> and similar cases analyzed the statutory provisions as mutually exclusive, they were overruled by <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002). <span class="Italic">Sosa v. DOD</span>, 102 MSPR 252, 256 n.2, 2006 MSPB 149 (2006). <span class="Italic">LaBoube v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant would have the right to appeal to the Board if he was an "employee" at the time he was terminated. <span class="Italic">See Tschumy v. Department of Defense</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 488, &#x00B6; 8 (2007). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), an "employee" is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]n individual in the competitive service--(i) who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or (ii) who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant would have appeal rights if he satisfied either prong of this definition. <span class="Italic">See McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal where the appellant meets the definition of "employee" under either subsection (i) or (ii)). We find, however, that the appellant does not satisfy either prong.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the first prong, the first year of service of a term employee is a trial period. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.304(a). The unrebutted evidence shows that the appellant's service under his 3-year term appointment commenced on January 9, 2005. He had therefore not completed his first year of service when he was terminated on December 24, 2005.[*] It is unclear from the evidence in the record why the "Notification of Trial Period Document" provides that the appellant's trial period would run from December 15, 2004, to December 14, 2005. Nevertheless, as pointed out by the agency in its response to the appellant's PFR, the "Notification of Trial Period Document" does not show that the appellant was actually appointed on December 15, 2004; rather, as noted above, other evidence clearly indicates that he was not appointed until January 9, 2005. Moreover, giving effect to the "Notification of Trial Period Document" would violate the rule that parties cannot confer Board jurisdiction by agreement where it is otherwise lacking. <span class="Italic">See Waldrop v. United States Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 12, 15 (1996); <span class="Italic">Mas v. Department of the Army</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 46, 48 (1990). By law and regulation, the Board cannot exercise jurisdiction unless the appellant actually completed a one-year trial period consisting of a "year of service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.304(a). The "Notification of Trial Period Document" cannot alter this jurisdictional requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] The probationary period for part-time employees under career conditional appointments is computed on the basis of calendar time, in the same manner as for full-time employees. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(d). We assume for the purposes of this appeal that <span id="Page_201"></span>this regulation applies to the appellant, who held a part-time term appointment that required completion of a trial period. We know of no law or regulation indicating that the trial period for a part-time term appointee is less than one calendar year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alternatively, if we were to assume for the sake of discussion that the appellant's trial period did begin on December 15, 2004, the "Notification of Trial Period Document" also provides that the appellant's trial period would be "extended by leave without pay or other non-pay time in excess of 22 days." This provision is consistent with the regulation governing probationary periods, which states that "[n]onpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the probationary period by an equal amount." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(c); <span class="Italic">see Gutierrez v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 141, &#x00B6; 7 n.2 (2005) (probationary period for seasonal employee was extended by time in non-pay status in excess of 22 workdays). During the period covered by the "Notification of Trial Period Document," between the dates of December 15, 2004, and December 14, 2005, the appellant was in a non-pay status from December 15, 2004, to January 8, 2005; May 13, 2005, to May 15, 2005; September 2, 2005, to September 12, 2005; and November 4, 2005 to December 14, 2005. Under the appellant's part-time schedule, he was therefore in a nonpay status for at least 25 workdays, thereby extending his trial period by at least 3 days. However, since the appellant was in a non-pay status from December 15, 2005, until his termination on December 24, 2005, he never completed the last three days of his trial period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the SF-50 documenting the appellant's term appointment on January 9, 2005, does not state that the appellant would be subject to a one-year trial period. Therefore, the appellant may have believed that his trial period would end on December 14, 2005. However, any such belief would have been based on the "Notification of Trial Period Document," and, as noted above, that document expressly provided for an extension of the appellant's trial period for any time in a non-pay status in excess of 22 days. In any event, an agency's failure to provide accurate information at the time of appointment about the requirement to serve a trial period is no basis for finding that the trial period was waived or otherwise completed ahead of schedule. <span class="Italic">Cf. Phillips v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 48, 52 (1990) (an agency's failure to inform an employee that she was required to serve a probationary period until 11 months after she was appointed did not alter the requirement that she complete a one-year probationary period that began on the effective date of her appointment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that civilian service under a prior appointment is creditable toward completion of probation if it was in the same agency, in the same line of work (as determined by the employee's actual duties and responsibilities), and contained or was followed by no more than a single break in service that did not exceed 30 calendar days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b). Prior service "is credited toward completion of the required trial period [under a term appointment] in the same manner as prescribed by &#x00A7; 315.802." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.304(a). Here, the agency expressly argued that the appellant's prior service as a GS-0303-3 Clerk was not creditable toward completion of his trial period as a GS-0592-4 Tax Examining Clerk. The agency's argument is supported by the record evidence of the appellant's duties and responsibilities. As a Clerk, the appellant's responsibilities were primarily clerical, while as a Tax Examining Clerk, the appellant was responsible for responding to taxpayer inquires and conducting research, among other duties. The appellant's subsequent submissions do not challenge the agency's argument or evidence. We therefore find that the appellant's prior service is not creditable toward completion of the trial period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the second prong of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), the appellant's service from January 9, 2005, to December 24, 2005, was for less than one year. His prior service ended on December 12, 2004, and therefore does not count toward the requirement of one year of current continuous service. <span class="Italic">See Gutierrez</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 141, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17, 19.</p>
