<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-181"><span class="space">b.</span> Reaction of Others to Threat</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, the listener's reaction is a significant factor to consider, even though the listener is not the object of the threat. The Board considers whether employees who heard the statements took voluntary actions consistent with their perception that the statements constituted threats. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hutson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 67 MSPR 432, 446 (1995). Listeners' reactions were of significance before <span class="Italic">Metz</span>. <span class="Italic">Faitel v. VA</span>, 26 MSPR 465, 467-68 (1985), considered the statements by the appellant and the reactions of listeners to determine whether the appellant made an actionable threat:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first two charges, threatening bodily injury to another employee and making slanderous and defamatory statements about other employees, arose out of a meeting involving appellant, his union representative and his supervisor convened for the purpose of discussing a written summary of a counselling session. The agency contends that the presiding official erroneously extended the agency's regulations when it imposed upon the agency the burden of establishing that it considered appellant's comment as a direct and immediate threat. We disagree. The presiding official, who had an opportunity to assess the credibility of all the individuals who heard the statement directly and indirectly, concluded the statement was an expression of anger and frustration rather a threat to do bodily injury. The presiding official's finding is also consistent with other evidence that appellant also stated he would sue the employee for slander. Moreover, the agency's own actions reflected that they did not interpret the statement as a threat. The agency took no action immediately or even shortly following the alleged threat. The lesser weight which the presiding official accorded the evidence of the delayed and somewhat superficial action to diffuse the alleged threat was warranted under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Holliday v. Army,</span> 11 MSPB 14, 12 MSPR 358 (1982). Appellant's desk was not moved away from the employee allegedly threatened until eight days after the threat was made. Moreover, the reasons cited by the agency for the delay were not persuasive. A complaint was not filed nor was assistance sought from the police. Thus, the presiding official was correct in finding that the agency failed to establish by the preponderance of the evidence that appellant threatened bodily injury to another employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fear of the recipient of the threat is not required to prove the charge. The criterion is apprehension of harm, i.e., a perception that an attempt to harm will ensue. <span class="Italic">Ingram v. DOJ</span>, 44 MSPR 578, 582 (1990). This perception must be there. Loud and angry statements to a supervisor, such as, "You had the <span id="Page_2684"></span>unmitigated gall to give me this [a supervisory note concerning performance] after you knew all the problems I'm having," and other statements made in anger, were not threats. No harm was suggested to the supervisor. The incident was, however, insolent disrespect toward a supervisor and warranted dismissal for that reason. <span class="Italic">Carson v. VA</span>, 33 MSPR 666, 669-70 &#x0026; n.1 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal was sustained of a production controller for making a statement that threatened the safety and welfare of agency employees and property in <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 498, 501, 504-05 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3355), involving an individual who told his supervisor that "he sometimes had 'evil thoughts,' and that he hoped that he would not strap a bomb to himself and kill himself and other agency employees":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency stated that the appellant had been absent from work for approximately one week due to a stress-related illness, and then went to his supervisor's office to submit a medical release so that he could return to duty. While he was there, he told his supervisor, Sharon Hebert, that he sometimes had "evil thoughts," and that he hoped that he would not strap a bomb to himself and kill himself and other agency employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant contends that, under the objective evidence standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, his statement did not rise to the level of a threat because the objective behavior of Hebert does not support the administrative judge's conclusion that a threat was made. In this connection, he contends that Hebert testified during the hearing concerning the agency's enforced leave action that the appellant's statement "concerned" her, but that she did not feel so threatened by his comment that she felt that it was necessary to immediately telephone the security police. Moreover, he contends that she contacted Employee Relations after the appellant made the comment only because she wanted to institute disciplinary action against him, not because she felt threatened, and that she contacted the Security Police "only upon the advice of Employee Relations."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hebert testified, however, that she believed that the appellant was capable of carrying out his threat, and that her life and the lives of other agency employees were in jeopardy. She further testified that she did not immediately call the Security Police because it was the agency's policy that supervisors first contact Employee Relations and then follow their advice before calling the Security Police. Therefore, under the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, we find that Hebert's reaction to the appellant's comment supports the conclusion that his statement constituted a threat. <span class="Italic">See Metz</span>, 780 F.2d at 1003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the attendant circumstances to the appellant's statement suggest that his statement constituted a threat. The appellant had made other threatening statements at the agency, and "talked about shooting people, and guns and things." Also, shortly before the appellant had made the statement to Hebert, someone had either mailed or placed a bomb in another agency employee's work area that had exploded in the employee's face. The employee lost an eye and suffered severe disfigurement. Moreover, Hebert testified that the appellant's work environment was extremely stressful. In this regard, she testified that the appellant worked in a very small room with six desks. The room was a windowless, dimly lit "controlled area," closed at all times with "cipher locks." If an employee needed to use the bathroom, it might be an hour before he or she could leave the room because of the intense work atmosphere in the area, with employees answering phones and listening to radio transmissions so that they could monitor the movements of military aircraft. Therefore, given the appellant's prior statements, the previous bomb incident, and the appellant's stressful work environment, we find that the attendant circumstances in this case suggest that the appellant's statement to Hebert constituted a threat.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further contends that the reaction of the Security Police to his statement does not support the conclusion that his statement was a threat, and that his co-workers' reactions to previous statements that he made indicate that those prior statements also were not threats. We find, however, that the Security Police found the appellant's statement serious enough that they interviewed Hebert as soon as they learned of it on June 2, 1993, the day after the appellant made his threat. The agency has not alleged that the appellant's prior statements to his co-workers constituted threats, or that they were considered as prior discipline. The record indicates, however, that they were taken seriously, and that he was afforded medical care and psychological counseling at the agency's request because of those statements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Coleman</span> permitted the agency proposing official to consider facts not made part of the charge to assess the nature of the appellant's statements, 66 MSPR at 506:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant next contends that Hebert's testimony establishes that, in proposing to remove the appellant, she relied "upon factors other than those stated in the notice of proposed removal." There is nothing in Hebert's testimony to suggest, however, that she relied on misconduct not cited in the notice of proposed removal. Rather, she described the appellant's prior acts only to establish the context surrounding his threat, and to show that his comment was not a joke, or an isolated instance of black humor<span class="Italic">. See</span>...<span class="Italic">Metz</span>, 780 F.2d at 1002 (in order to determine if a statement constituted a threat, the Board must consider the attendant circumstances of the statement). Therefore, we find that Hebert's testimony does not show that she impermissibly relied on such conduct in proposing the appellant's removal<span class="Italic">. See Burrell v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 58 MSPR 372, 376 (1993); <span class="Italic">Arnold v. Department of Energy</span>, 36 MSPR 561, 566 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Kilgour v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 544, 549 (1995), a threat was made out by a combination of indirect statements and direct actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly noted, the applicable review standard is established under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>; namely, in deciding whether statements constitute threats, the Board is to apply the reasonable person criterion, considering the listeners' reactions, the listeners' apprehension of harm, the speaker's intent, the conditional nature of the statements, and the attendant circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Metz</span>, 780 F.2d at 1002.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency showed that the appellant had made remarks such as he'd "like to" or "was going to" knock Dr. Estrada's lights out and that the appellant had made these remarks after going unannounced to Dr. Estrada's home late in the evening. Thus, he found that Dr. Estrada felt threatened when he learned that the appellant was in an emotional state and had been at his home with an intent to confront him and settle matters or "get it all over with."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his cross petition for review, the appellant does not specifically challenge the administrative judge's findings that he engaged in threatening misconduct; instead, he contends only that he was not in a "highly emotional state." Thus, the appellant's cross petition sets forth no basis upon which to disturb the findings in the initial decision. We note that there is no showing of error regarding the fact that the Medical Center Director might reasonably have felt threatened by the appellant's late night appearance at his home and his subsequent remarks. The administrative judge's findings and conclusions are based upon his thorough consideration of all pertinent factors and evidence and are supported by appropriate credibility determinations. In the absence of any specific showing of error, there is no basis upon which to disturb the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When assessing reactions of listeners to statements characterized by the agency as threats, the AJ must consider the circumstances of the listener and the timing of their reactions. The listener's reaction at about the time the statement is made will likely be more probative than the listener's assessment at a point more remote in time when the listener may be influenced by rumors or other events. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stoddard v. Dept. of Army</span>, 109 MSPR 199, 2008 MSPB 137 (2008) (considering that a verbal threat led to two employees expressing fear of coming to work and receiving a grant of leave); <span class="Italic">Powell v. DOJ</span>, 73 MSPR 29, 39 (1997) (considering the reactions of others to threats related through an EAP counselor: "[T]he precautionary actions taken by Mr. Guglielmo and Mr. Price should be compared with those of employees in other cases where the Board has found that a threat was made[.] "); <span class="Italic">Hutson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 67 MSPR 432, 446 (1995) (also considering that another employee questioned managers about security measures in the office and changed commuting patterns, that the agency notified local law enforcement authorities and building security personnel, and that the agency took specific security measures when the appellant was notified of the proposed removal and when the hearing was held).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the reaction of a manager who learns of threatening remarks involving an employee, contemporaneous actions of the manager are considered, <span class="Italic">Sutton v. VA</span>, AT-0752-12-0165-I-2 (NP 3/28/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Dr. Nanes immediately contacted the police to report the statement. <span class="Italic">See Peloquin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 435, 439 (1991) (finding that the appellant's statements satisfied the criteria for establishing a threat because, among other factors, "both of the threatened supervisors treated the appellant's statements as threats by reporting the matter on the day in question."). Dr. Nanes also created a contemporaneous statement, documenting the incident, which is entirely consistent with both the proposal letter and his hearing testimony. Further, consistent with his testimony that he believed Ms. Robinson was "in danger," Dr. Nanes immediately contacted Ms. Robinson, directed her to leave her office, and had her stay in a locked office. Dr. Nanes also contacted the Medical Center Director, Mr. James Clark, who testified that Dr. Nanes appeared "quite upset" when recounting the incident on the day it occurred. Based on the foregoing, we affirm the administrative judge's credibility finding and, consequently, his determination that the agency proved its charge by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lawson v. VA</span>, NY-0752-10-0185-I-1 (NP 4/10/2014), declined to deflect the charge of threat based on the appellant's argument that her coworkers viewed her as eccentric:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge should not have sustained charge 4, making threatening remarks in the workplace. The agency charged that, on the morning in question, the appellant <span id="Page_2685"></span>"repeatedly made the statement 'I'm going to get my pistol, bring it in and shoot up everybody.' This statement was heard by three...coworkers, who became frightened and feared for their lives." The appellant argues, among other things, that she was not a threat because she did not actually own a gun and her coworkers did not genuinely feel threatened. She claims that she was merely an "eccentric" employee who posed no danger to agency personnel or veterans. She further argues that, even if, "in her ramblings and unconscious communications[&#8197;] and expressions," she made some "inchoate threats," her actions were "due solely to the massive effects of the medications and hospitalizations that was visited upon her and that she was laboring under." We have considered the appellant's arguments, but for the following reasons, we do not disturb the administrative judge's explained finding that the agency proved its charge of making threatening remarks in the workplace.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding whether statements constitute threats, the Board applies a "reasonable person" standard and considers the listeners' reactions and apprehensions, the wording of the statements, the speaker's intent, and the attendant circumstances. <span class="Italic">Metz v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001, 1004 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Neither party disputes the administrative judge's determination that the agency was required to meet the reasonable person standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Metz</span> to prove its charge of making threatening statements in the workplace. The parties were properly informed of the standard below, and the record reflects that the administrative judge applied this standard in reaching her decision. Although the appellant disagrees with the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency met its burden under the <span class="Italic">Metz</span> standard, we find no fault with the administrative judge's weighing of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the administrative judge failed to give proper consideration of evidence that the appellant did not own or possess a gun. For purposes of this decision, we accept as true the appellant's assertion that she did not own or possess a gun at the time she made the statement. Nevertheless, a verbal threat to bring a gun into the office and shoot people is a serious offense, regardless of whether a gun is available when the threat is made. <span class="Italic">See Webb v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 493, 494-95 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1060 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). Such behavior affects the agency's obligation to maintain a safe workplace for its employees, thus impinging upon the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Id.; see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). To the extent that the appellant is arguing that the fact that she did not possess a gun supports her claim that she lacked a threatening intent, we are unpersuaded and find that this is not sufficient to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant made threatening remarks as charged.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerning whether an individual had a real fear of harm, a court concluded that he did when he testified that he felt threatened and when he sought assistance from another supervisor, called for security police and then immediately reported the matter to the local police. <span class="Italic">Foy v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3143); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Barber v. USPS,</span> 186 Fed. Appx. 1020, 1022 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP) ("Further, Mr. Mahar testified that he feared for his safety and subsequently took cautionary steps, such as carefully searching parking lots before parking his car, installing a home security system, and altering his times and routes of travel."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Powell v. DOJ</span>, 73 MSPR 29 (1997) (discounting the reactions of some individuals told of threats made during a conversation with an EAP counselor). The reaction of law enforcement authorities may be indicative of whether a statement constitutes a threat. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bucci v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 42 MSPR 47, 52 (1989). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-15-181.html#sec8-180"><span class="Italic">Metz</span> test</a>" and refer to Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-079.html#sec12-75">Dangerousness; Risk Assessment; Direct Threat</a>," for <span class="Italic">Battle v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 63 MSPR 403 (1994), and other decisions involving disability discrimination defenses raised by individuals whose antisocial actions may be the product of a mental disability.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an AJ uses the reaction of agency officials to determine whether a threat was made, the AJ must carefully consider the motivation for the agency's response. Cautionary words by agency officials to an employee who has just made an ambiguous statement about a supervisor do not establish that the statement was perceived as a threat. The caution could be merely indicative of a supervisor's belief that the employee's statements were inappropriate expressions of the appellant's frustrations that could be ameliorated by counseling. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hutson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 67 MSPR 432, 437 (1995).</p>
