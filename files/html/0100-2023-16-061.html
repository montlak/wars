<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-60"><span class="space">1.</span> Prerequisite of Unacceptable Performance; Pre-PIP Performance; <span class="italic">Santos</span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text">It is an unacceptable performance that triggers the unacceptable performance action through the notice of an opportunity to improve. Assuming a retention level of marginal, an agency that rates an employee's performance as marginal may not give the employee an improvement period, then evaluate the employee and take action on the basis of a subsequent unacceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Colgan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 28 MSPR 116, 118 (1985) ("Had it believed appellant was performing unacceptably in a 'Critical element, the agency could have designated her performance in that element as unsatisfactory. However, it did not do so and appellant's performance must be found to have met minimum standards at the time of her performance appraisal."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 37 MSPR 78, 85 (1988) (agency cannot remove an employee for unsatisfactory performance if the PIP was imposed after a minimally acceptable or minimally satisfactory rating); <span class="Italic">Smith v. DHHS</span>, 35 MSPR 101, 104 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Grant v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 24 MSPR 663, 667-68 (1984), and <span class="Italic">Colgan, supra</span>); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Salonga v. Dept. of Army</span>, 28 MSPR 628, 632 (1985) (the appellant was denied an opportunity period when the first notice he had of unsuccessful performance was a performance rating, and the agency relied solely on evidence of unsuccessful performance that predated the rating). It is insufficient for the agency to tell the employee that his performance borders on the unacceptable or that there are deficiencies as to one or more critical elements. There must be notice to the employee that his performance has dropped and a fair opportunity period following that notice. <span class="Italic">Moody v. Coast Guard</span>, 28 MSPR 395, 399 (1985) (two weeks between an appraisal that suggested a less than minimally satisfactory performance and a supervisor's request that the appellant be demoted was not a reasonable opportunity).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The failure of the agency to give the employee a performance rating is not relevant to the Chapter 43 case. It is required that the standards and elements be communicated to the employee at the beginning of the appraisal period and that she be warned of inadequacies in critical elements during the appraisal period. <span class="Italic">Scott v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 89-3256). Although an agency should notify an employee at the onset of a PIP that his performance under a standard is unacceptable, the notice can be implicit. <span id="Page_2930"></span>Notice is achieved if the agency states that the improvement period will be under the standard and that the appellant can be removed if his performance under the standard does not improve during the PIP. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smallwood v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 52 MSPR 678, 683 (1992). The law does not require an agency to warn an employee that failure to improve will result in removal or to inform the employee of what action it will take. <span class="Italic">Egleberry v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 27 MSPR 217, 218 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Until its position was reversed by the Federal Circuit, MSPB consistently held that an agency need not establish that performance was less than acceptable before placing an employee on a PIP: the PIP could be the agency's first notice of unacceptable performance to the employee. Ordinarily there will be notice to an employee that performance is not acceptable before a PIP is issued. The employee might, for example, get an unsatisfactory performance appraisal, and a WIGI might be denied. There could be emails to and discussions between the supervisor and the employee making plain concerns about substandard performance. But the ordinary is not always what occurs, and it could happen that an employee gets a PIP--perhaps from a new supervisor, or in a new job--without earlier communication of dissatisfaction with performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Santos v. NASA</span>, 990 F.3d 1355, 1360-63 (Fed. Cir. 2021), reversed the Board's position. The court made an element of a Chapter 43 case proof by substantial evidence that the employee's performance was unacceptable before the PIP and remained so during the PIP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute governing post-PIP removals, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, provides that employees "who continue to have unacceptable performance" may only be removed "after an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(c)(6). The Board has held that this provision does not require an agency to prove that an employee was performing unacceptably prior to the PIP in order to justify a post-PIP removal. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 583, 586 (1984) (finding "no statutory or regulatory basis" to require an agency to establish appellant's unsatisfactory performance prior to the PIP). The Board has consistently applied this interpretation to PIP removals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Brown v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 635, 640 (1990) ("[I]f the employee's performance is unacceptable during the PIP, the agency may generally base an action on this deficiency and need not also show that the employee's performance was unacceptable prior to the PIP, as the Board held in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have not directly addressed the question of whether, when an agency predicates removal on an employee's failure to satisfy obligations imposed by a PIP and that removal is challenged, the agency must justify imposition of a PIP in the first instance under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, though we have discussed the general relevance of pre-PIP performance to a PIP removal. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Sec. &#x0026; Exch. Comm'n</span>, 972 F.3d 1307, 1316-17 (Fed. Cir. 2020). Today we confirm that the statute's plain language demonstrates that an agency must justify institution of a PIP when an employee challenges a PIP-based removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4302 requires agencies to develop a performance appraisal system that, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "provide[s] for periodic appraisals of job performance of employees." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(a)(1). Section 4302(c) contains six subsections that detail what must comprise an agency's performance appraisal system. Subsections (c)(5) and (c)(6) advise how an agency's performance appraisal system should handle "unacceptable performance." An agency's performance appraisal system should provide for "assisting employees in improving unacceptable performance," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(c)(5), as well as "reassigning, reducing in grade, or removing employees <span class="Italic">who continue to have unacceptable performance</span> but only after an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(c)(6) (emphasis added). Agencies usually provide employees "an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance" by placing them on a PIP. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, 972 F.3d at 1311.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, Section 4302(c)(6) makes clear that an agency is only allowed to "reassign[ ], reduc[e] in grade, or remov[e] employees who <span class="Italic">continue</span> to have unacceptable performance" during a PIP. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(c)(6) (emphasis added). To "<span class="Italic">continue</span> to have unacceptable performance" during the PIP, as the statutory text requires, an employee must have displayed unacceptable performance <span class="Italic">prior</span> to the PIP. Under the plain meaning of the statute, then, an agency must defend a challenged removal by establishing that the employee had unacceptable performance before the PIP and "continue[d] to" do so during the PIP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our holdings in <span class="Italic">Harris and Lovshin v. Department of Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826 (Fed. Cir. 1985) are not inconsistent with this reading of Section 4302. <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> delineated four requirements agencies must satisfy before removing an underperforming employee under Section 4303. Agencies must: (a) establish an approved performance appraisal system; (b) communicate the performance standards and critical elements of an employee's position to the employee; (c) warn the employee of inadequacies in "critical elements"; and (d) offer an underperforming employee counseling and an opportunity for improvement. <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span>, 767 F.2d at 834. There, we emphasized that these requirements are consistent with fundamental fairness to employees. <span class="Italic">Harris</span> clarified the third <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> element, holding that "the PIP notice itself often serves as the warning" of a performance problem. <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 972 F.3d at 1316.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But <span class="Italic">Harris</span> also confirmed that pre-PIP performance by the terminated employee and the agency's pre-PIP treatment of the employee may be relevant to the removal inquiry. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, 972 F.3d at 1316-1317. While we did not find the pre-PIP evidence in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> sufficient to override the agency's removal decision, we expressly discussed the AJ's consideration of it, concluding that the AJ had adequately done so in that case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1320-21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Confirming an agency's obligation to justify initiation of a PIP where the PIP leads to removal is particularly appropriate, moreover, in situations resembling Santos's, where an employee alleges that both the PIP and the removal based on the PIP were in retaliation for protected conduct. Otherwise, an agency could establish a PIP in direct retaliation for protected conduct and set up unreasonable expectations in the PIP in the hopes of predicating removal on them without ever being held accountable for the original retaliatory conduct. Indeed, these are the circumstances in which the issue of pre-PIP performance would be most relevant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To be sure, an employee may not seek review of the decision to implement a PIP at the time it is instituted, either at the Board or otherwise. And, as <span class="Italic">Harris</span> makes clear, the institution of the PIP can itself satisfy the notice component of Section 4303, but, when an agency chooses to remove an employee at the end of the PIP period, pre-PIP conduct may be relevant to the removal decision, as <span class="Italic">Harris</span> also confirms. Allowing a PIP to serve as the preremoval notice required by Section 4303 is not the same as allowing the mere fact of a PIP to create a presumption that the pre-PIP conduct was <span class="Italic">actually</span> unacceptable. Thus, we hold that, once an agency chooses to impose a post-PIP termination, it must prove by substantial evidence that the employee's unacceptable performance "continued"--i.e., it was unacceptable before the PIP and remained so during the PIP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Importantly, we are not prescribing any particular evidentiary showing with respect to the employee's pre-PIP performance. Performance failures can be documented or established in any number of ways. The burden would then shift to the employee to prove that the motive for imposing the PIP and, ultimately termination, was discriminatory under well-established guidelines for making such a showing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without elaboration, Santos was applied in <span class="italic">Parrish v. DHHS</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Dr. Parrish cites Santos to argue she did not meet the requirements to be placed on PIP because her prior annual rating indicated that she achieved expected results, and she had not previously received a poor performance rating or a midterm rating indicating poor performance. Dr. Parrish misapplies our holding in <span class="italic">Santos</span>. There, we explained that an agency imposing a post-PIP termination must prove that the employee's unacceptable performance existed before the PIP and remained unacceptable during the PIP. <span class="italic">Santos</span>, 990 F.3d at 1363. Here, as discussed above, substantial evidence supports the arbitrator's findings that Dr. Parrish's performance was unacceptable before the Notice, remained unacceptable after she was issued the Notice and before she was issued the PIP, and continued to be unacceptable after she received the PIP.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Santos</span> applies to Chapter 43 cases, not to performance cases under Chapter 75. <span class="italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Groenleer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-16-0028-I-2, n.5 (NP 5/5/2023) ("Santos and Lee do not require a different result because they involved the standards for a chapter 43 appeal, while this appeal is governed by the standards of chapter 75.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We find that this case is distinguishable from <span class="italic">Santos</span>. First, this case does not involve an action taken under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43. Rather, it is an IRA appeal, under which the Board lacks the authority to adjudicate the merits of the underlying personnel action. <span class="italic">See Lu v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 7 (2015). Second, the personnel actions in this case do not include a removal for unacceptable performance. As set forth above, the appellant appears to have resigned in lieu of removal. In any event, given that one of the personnel actions involved the appellant's placement on a PIP, the administrative judge addressed the appellant's pre-PIP performance in great detail, finding significant evidence in support of that action....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If pre-PIP performance is at issue per <span class="italic">Santos,</span> and if the appellant asserts an affirmative defense of discrimination or reprisal, that defense must be evaluated as to the evaluation of performance before the PIP was initiated. <span class="italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Lin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 2023 MSPB 2, &#x00B6; 25 (2023). But, <span class="italic">Santos</span> was of limited or no weight in the IRA case of <span class="italic">Carvalho v. DOJ</span>, SF-1221-15-0208-W-2, n.10 (NP 1/10/2023):</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not long before <span class="Italic">Santos</span>, the Federal Circuit advised in <span class="Italic">Harris v. SEC</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200825162">972 F.3d 1307</a>, 1316-17 (Fed. Cir. 2020):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]here is no rule or regulation requiring an agency acting under chapter 43 to notify or warn an underperforming employee of a performance problem before issuing a PIP. Indeed, the PIP notice itself often serves <span id="Page_2931"></span>as the warning. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 176-77 (listing examples of unacceptable performance); <span class="Italic">Greer v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 477, 481 (Aug. 28, 1998) (noting that "the PIP notice itself unmistakably informed" the appellant that his performance in a critical element was not satisfactory).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Harris objects, however, that because her PIP notice was issued on October 2, 2017--after the 2017 appraisal period ended on September 30--she was not warned "during the appraisal period," as <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> purportedly requires. 767 F.2d at 834. This argument misreads <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span>. There, we said that an agency may take action under chapter 43 if it has, among other things, "communicated the written performance standards and 'critical elements' of an employee's position to the employee at the beginning of the appraisal period, [and] has warned of inadequacies in 'critical elements' during the appraisal period." <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span>, 767 F.2d at 834. Reading these two conditions together makes clear that <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> does not require that the warning come at any particular time, but rather requires that the warning relate to inadequacies that occurred during the same appraisal period for which the written performance standards were communicated. We agree with the government that the goal of these twin requirements--communicated standards and a related deficiency warning--"prevent the agency from starting a PIP for failures in one period that are only failures when judged against standards from another period." The applicable chapter 43 regulation confirms this reading: "At any time during the performance appraisal cycle that an employee's performance is determined to be unacceptable in one or more critical elements, the agency shall notify the employee...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 432.104. The regulation focuses only on the time when the inadequacies occurred, placing no condition on when the notification or warning occurs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Harris's PIP notice warned her of numerous inadequacies occurring in the last two months of the 2017 appraisal period, as judged against the 2017 written performance standards which she acknowledged receiving at the beginning of that period. <span class="Italic">E.g</span>., J.A. 176 (listing failures to perform certain duties within a critical element "at a minimally acceptable level during the 2017 rating period"); <span class="Italic">see</span> J.A. 361 (signed 2017 Performance Work Plan). Substantial evidence thus supports the Administrative Judge's determination that Ms. Harris was sufficiently warned of her inadequate performance.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">OPM was not much taken with Santos. In comments to proposed rulemaking, 87 Fed. Reg. 200 (Jan 4. 2022), OPM stated, <span class="italic">id.</span> at 203:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM does not agree that 5 U.S.C. 4302(c)(6) means that the agency must prove as part of its substantive case or as a required procedure that an employee performed unacceptably before he or she was placed on a PIP. Rather, the statute as interpreted by OPM's regulation at 5 CFR 432.104 provides that an agency may not take a performance-based adverse action against an employee whom the agency determined was performing unacceptably unless the agency first provides the employee with notice and an opportunity to improve, and the employee continues to perform unacceptably. The determination to be reviewed on appeal to the Board and its reviewing courts is the final determination of unacceptable performance following the PIP, not any interim determination leading to the PIP. This interpretation enables agencies to address performance issues early through the mechanism of a PIP without concern that the employees who ultimately are unable to demonstrate acceptable performance despite early and sustained assistance cannot be removed because the MSPB or a court might find that they were not performing unacceptably when the PIP began.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After comments were received on OPM's proposed regulatory changes, did not attempt to negate the substance of <span class="italic">Santos</span> by regulation, but OPM continued the debate over <span class="italic">Santos</span>, as it remarked in its final rulemaking notice, 87 Fed. Reg. 67765, 67771 (Nov. 10, 2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...OPM is not making any changes to the proposed regulation in response to these comments. OPM further recognizes that, until and unless Santos is revisited, agencies proposing a removal under 5 U.S.C. 4302(c)(6) must establish that the employee performed unacceptably both prior to and during the performance improvement period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">MSPB embraced <span class="italic">Santos</span> in <span class="italic">Lee v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 11, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-17 (2022), and Lee said of the proof of the pre-PIP unacceptable performance that "the agency warned the appellant of the inadequacies in her performance during the appraisal period and gave her an adequate opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge properly applied existing precedent as of the date she issued the initial decision, our reviewing court issued a precedential decision recognizing an additional element of an agency's burden of proof under chapter 43 while this matter was pending before the Board on petition for review. In <span class="italic">Santos</span>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) held for the first time that to support an adverse action under chapter 43, an agency "must justify institution of a PIP" by showing that the employee's performance was unacceptable before the PIP. <span class="italic">Santos</span>, 990 F.3d at 1360-61. The court noted that the statute authorizes actions against employees "who continue to have unacceptable performance" after a PIP and reasoned that proving continued unacceptable performance requires a showing that the performance was unacceptable both prior to and during the PIP. <span class="italic">Id.</span> (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(c)(6)). The court found that the Board's failure to consider the appellant's pre-PIP performance in Santos was an abuse of discretion and it remanded the appeal for further proceedings under the modified legal standard. <span class="italic">Santos</span>, 990 F.3d at 1363-64.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With limited exceptions not applicable here, decisions of the Federal Circuit are binding on the Board. <span class="italic">See Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39, <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Therefore, we modify the standard applicable to chapter 43 actions in light of Santos. To defend an action under chapter 43, the agency must prove by substantial evidence that: (1) OPM approved its performance appraisal system and any significant changes thereto; (2) the agency communicated to the appellant the performance standards and critical elements of her position; (3) the appellant's performance standards are valid under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(c)(1); (4) the appellant's performance during the appraisal period was unacceptable in one or more critical elements; (5) the agency warned the appellant of the inadequacies in her performance during the appraisal period and gave her an adequate opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance; and (6) after an adequate improvement period, the appellant's performance remained unacceptable in at least one critical element.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit's new precedent in <span class="italic">Santos</span> applies to all pending cases, regardless of when the events at issue took place. <span class="italic">See Porter v. Department of Defense,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 14 (2005) (citing <span class="italic">Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde</span>, 514 U.S. 749, 752, 759 (1995)). The parties did not have an opportunity before the administrative judge to address the modified legal standard in light of <span class="italic">Santos</span>. We therefore remand this case for further adjudication of the appellant's removal under the standard set forth in <span class="italic">Santos</span>.[3] <span class="italic">See Santos</span>, 990 F.3d at 1363-64 (remanding the appeal for further proceedings under the modified legal standard); <span class="italic">Blaha v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 11 (2007) (remanding an appeal where the parties were not informed of the correct legal standard).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;While this matter was pending on petition for review, Congress enacted the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 (VA Accountability Act), Pub. L. No. 115-41, 131 Stat. 862 (2017). Among other things, the VA Accountability Act provided the Department of Veterans Affairs with an expedited, less rigorous process for removing, demoting, or suspending its employees for inadequate performance or misconduct. The VA Accountability Act thereby gave the agency "an expedited, less rigorous alternative to traditional civil service adverse action appeals" under chapter 43 and chapter 75 of title 5. <span class="italic">Sayers v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 954 F.3d 1370, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2020). However, the Federal Circuit has held that the VA Accountability Act does not apply to disciplinary action based on conduct or performance occurring before its enactment, <span class="italic">id</span>. at 1380-82, and no other court of appeals has reached a contrary conclusion. Therefore, the VA Accountability Act may not be applied to the appellant's removal in this case because it is based on performance that occurred several years before the Act went into effect. Accordingly, the appellant's removal must be adjudicated under chapter 43 on remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge shall accept evidence and argument on whether the agency proved by substantial evidence that the appellant's pre-PIP performance was unacceptable. The administrative judge shall hold a supplemental hearing if appropriate. The administrative judge shall then issue a new initial decision consistent with <span class="italic">Santos</span>.

The arbitrator acknowledged the union's position that Mr. Licari "was an 'outstanding performer' until he came under the supervision of David Lehman in late 2013." But an agency cannot decide to remove an employee based on unacceptable performance that occurred more than a year before the notice of proposed removal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(c)(2). We note that &#x00A7; 4303(c)(2) does not prohibit the arbitrator from considering past acceptable performance. Given the prohibition on considering unacceptable performance more than one year old, however, we do not fault the arbitrator for not focusing on acceptable conduct prior to 2014. We see no requirement, statutory or otherwise, that an arbitrator must consider acceptable performance that occurred more than one year before the notice of proposed removal. And at any rate, the arbitrator had before him records of Mr. Licari's past acceptable behavior for the past several years.</p>
