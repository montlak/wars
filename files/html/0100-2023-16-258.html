<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-258"><span class="space">d.</span> Provision of Information; Polling; Seniority Determinations</h5>
<p class="noindent">One DFR complaint alleged that the union violated the Statute by establishing different schedules for members and nonmembers to telephone the local president to determine if they were on an agency list of employees tentatively <span id="page_1527"></span>eligible to receive cash awards. The members could call from 9:30 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> to 5:30 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span>; nonmembers could call from 5:30 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> to 5:45 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> FLRA concluded that the procedure was objectionable based on its analysis that when an exclusive representative decides to represent unit employees in any matter affecting their working conditions, it must represent them fairly and not discriminate on the basis of union membership. The union voluntarily undertook to provide unit employees with information, obtained from the agency for dissemination to unit employees, concerning their eligibility to receive cash awards. Having done so as exclusive representative, the union was required to provide nondiscriminatory access to that information. It was immaterial that unit employees were not being represented in formal or adversarial proceedings. A cease and desist order was issued. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 204 and FEC</span>, 18 FLRA 299, 300-02 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">The union may occasionally seek to implement a contract term through a choice of options. The union then conducts a poll to ascertain the desires of employees. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1827 and Bratton</span>, 49 FLRA 738, 739-40, 745-750 (1994), decided that a union breaches its DFR when it polls only union members, rather than all unit members, affected by a contract choice that will be made on the basis of the poll results of employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Respondent is the exclusive representative of a unit of employees at the Defense Mapping Agency, Aerospace Center, St. Louis, Missouri (Agency), including employees in the Agency's Graphic Arts Negative Engraving Division (GAN). In March 1986, the Respondent and the Agency entered into a collective bargaining agreement that grants the Respondent the discretion to determine the method of computing seniority among unit employees for certain purposes. More specifically, Article 60 provides, as relevant here:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">60-1</span> When the use of seniority as defined by an employee's Federal [Service Computation Date] is not mandated by law or government-wide regulations and is not otherwise specified in this Agreement, seniority will be determined by the employee and/or the Union, at the option of the Union, for the purpose of application of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">60-2</span> It is agreed that the same method of computing seniority must be applied to all employees in any given work group when the employees would be competing with each other for seniority-based benefits enumerated in the Agreement, such as shift preference, overtime, leave, etc.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In at least five areas covered by parties' agreement, seniority, as determined by the Respondent, is used to determine employee rights and benefits. These areas are the selection of days off and vacations, the selection of 8-hour days for compressed work schedules, overtime, training and details.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with Article 60-1, the Respondent had, for many years, polled unit employees to determine the type of seniority they preferred. Prior to October 1, 1991, seniority among GAN employees was based on continuous employment with the Agency. Because it had been several years since the last employee poll and the work force in GAN had significantly changed, a number of employees requested that the Respondent conduct another poll. As a result, on August 1, 1991, the Respondent began a poll of its members to determine the type of seniority to be used for calculating seniority-based benefits. The Charging Party, who was at that time a negative engraver inspector, requested to vote on the issue. She was refused an opportunity to vote specifically because she was not a Union member. Indeed, the Respondent acknowledges that all nonmember unit employees were denied the opportunity to vote on the matter precisely because of their lack of membership in the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the results of the first poll were inconclusive, a second poll of Union members was conducted. Thereafter, by letter dated September 17, 1991, the Respondent advised the Agency that the majority of its members preferred that the length of employment in GAN be used to calculate all seniority-based privileges. The Respondent further advised the Agency that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">GAN time will be used for selection of [Compressed Work Schedule] days off and 8 hour day [sic] will be effective now. Overtime, training, details, temp. promotions, etc. effective beginning Oct. 1, and vacation schedules effective starting Jan. 1, 1992.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since October 1, 1991, the Agency has determined seniority-based benefits for all GAN unit employees on the basis of their date of hire in GAN.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An exclusive representative is responsible for representing the interests of all employees in the unit it represents without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By this provision, "Congress adopted for government employee unions the private sector duty of fair representation." <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 800 F.2d 1165, 1171 (D.C. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span>, 28 FLRA at 916. Consistent with section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute, and the scope of the duty of fair representation in the private sector, union representational activities grounded in the union's status as exclusive representative must be undertaken without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is now well established that "[w]here it is alleged that a union failed to comply with section 7114(a)(1) by discriminating on the basis of membership in the union, the Authority first determines whether the union's disputed activities were undertaken in the union's role as exclusive representative of unit employees." <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force, Loring Air Force Base, Limestone, Maine and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2943</span>, 43 FLRA 1087, 1094 (1992). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Antilles Consolidated Education Association, (OEA/NEA) San Juan, Puerto Rico</span>, 36 FLRA 776 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Antilles); Fort Bragg</span>. If the activities were undertaken in that role, then the duty of fair representation under section 7114(a)(1) "attache[s]" and the Authority determines whether the union unlawfully discriminated on the basis of union membership. Antilles, 36 FLRA at 791.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the Authority concluded that the union was acting in its capacity as exclusive representative when it negotiated the right to administer certain insurance plans for unit employees. Having undertaken this role through collective bargaining, the union was obligated to administer those plans "without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 790.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This formulation of the duty of fair representation is consonant with that expressed by the court in <span class="Italic">Letter</span> <span class="Italic">Carriers II</span> [<span class="Italic">Branch 6000, NALC v. NLRB</span>, 595 F.2d 808 (D.C. Cir. 1979)]. There, the court stated that the duty of fair representation imposes on the bargaining agent a responsibility to fairly represent the interests of all unit employees "in good faith and without arbitrariness or invidious discrimination." 595 F.2d at 811. In the court's view, although this responsibility may be delegated, once the delegatee has been selected, it must function as a representative for all the employees in the bargaining unit, and if its decisions "are motivated solely by self-interest, then there is a breach of the duty of fair representation<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 812. In addressing the facts of the case before it, the court found that in conducting a referendum on the issue of fixed or rotating days off, it was contemplated that each union member would vote his personal preference and that the union would adopt the outcome of the referendum without further negotiations with the employer. In finding that the Board did not exceed its discretion when it concluded that this was an abdication of the union's representative function that violated the duty of fair representation, the court reasoned that the "ultimate decisionmaker--the union membership--did not function in a representative capacity." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Rather, the court determined that "[t]he referendum merely computed the composite personal preferences of individual union members without consideration of the views or interests of non-union employees<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Judge found that the Respondent "acted as the exclusive representative of unit members and there is no question that it was subject to the duty of fair representation." The Judge further acknowledged that, pursuant to this duty, the Respondent could not act in a manner that was contrary to the interests of non-Union members. Nevertheless, the Judge concluded that the Respondent's failure to permit non-Union members of the bargaining unit to participate in a poll concerning the method of calculating seniority to be used for determining seniority-based benefits did not violate the Statute. We cannot agree and find that, by this conduct, the Respondent breached its duty of fair representation in violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (8).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we note that in finding that the Respondent's conduct was not contrary to its duty of fair representation, the Judge appears to have concluded, without expressly stating, that the matter here at issue was exclusively within the province of the Respondent's internal affairs. Thus, in support of his decision, the Judge specifically relies on <span class="Italic">Financial Institution Employees</span> [475 U.S. 192 (1986)] for the proposition that union members have the right to control the shape and direction of their organization and that non-union members have no voice in a union's internal affairs. The Judge additionally relies on <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2000</span> [14 FLRA 617 (1984)], which also involved internal union matters, including participation in negotiations and a contract ratification vote.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Judge, we conclude that the administration of the contract clause granting the Respondent the discretion to determine the type of seniority to be used for calculating seniority-based benefits, without further negotiations with the Agency, directly affected all unit employees and, therefore, was not a matter relating to the Respondent's internal affairs. Rather, we conclude that, like the situation in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the Respondent undertook in its bargaining agreement the obligation to administer the system of seniority to be used for determining certain seniority-based benefits. Applying the rationale of <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> to the circumstances of this case, the Respondent was required to administer that system in a manner that did not discriminate on the basis of Union membership. When it polled only its members to determine the method <span id="page_1528"></span>of computing seniority, the Respondent neglected the interests of the nonmembers who would be affected by the new computations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the reasoning of the court in <span class="Italic">Letter Carriers II</span>, we find that, in the circumstances of this case, the Respondent abdicated its representative function by conducting a poll only of Union members, and thereby breached its duty of fair representation under section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute. In so finding, we agree with the General Counsel that <span class="Italic">PATCO</span> [<span class="Italic">Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, Local 301</span>, 7 A/SLMR 896 (1977)], in which the union took a poll of its members to determine a negotiating proposal, is distinguishable from the instant case. Similarly, cases involving ratification of an otherwise agreed-upon contract are distinguishable because "[ratification] settles no term or condition of employment [but] merely calls for an advisory vote...." <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Wooster Division of Borg-Warner Corp.</span>, 356 U.S. 342, 350 (1958). <span class="Italic">See also Letter Carriers I</span>, 232 NLRB at 263, n.1 (distinguishing the ratification of a collective bargaining agreement, deemed "an internal union matter," from polling used as "a substitute for negotiation"). Accordingly, we conclude that by its conduct the Respondent violated section 7116(b)(1) and (8).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Remedy</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the General Counsel requests, among other things, a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, including make-whole relief for all employees who suffered any loss of pay as a result of the Respondent's unlawful conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, in this regard, that Congress has entrusted the Authority with the responsibility to take any remedial action it considers appropriate to carry out the policies of the Statute. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d 964 (D.C. Cir. 1990). We further note that the purpose of a make-whole remedy is to place individuals who have been adversely affected by an improper action in the situation they would have been if the improper action had not occurred<span class="Italic">. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Dallas Region, Dallas, Texas and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, National Council of Social Security Administration-Field Operations Locals</span>, 32 FLRA 521, 525 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case it is clear that the Respondent's unlawful conduct interfered with the employees' terms and conditions of employment, which the Statute seeks to protect. It is also clear that, in the circumstances of this case, the issuance of a make-whole order will restore the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> and mitigate the inhibiting effect of the Respondent's improper acts. We therefore conclude that in order to fully effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute, it is appropriate to direct the Respondent to restore the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> as of October 1, 1991, and to make whole any employee who is determined to have suffered a loss of pay, benefits or differentials as a result of the Respondent's unlawful conduct. <span class="Italic">See Bowen v. United States Postal Service</span>, 459 U.S. 212 (1983) (Supreme Court found backpay appropriate as a remedy for the union's breach of its duty of fair representation); <span class="Italic">see also Local 282, International Brotherhood</span> <span class="Italic">of Teamsters</span>, 267 NLRB 1130, 1131 (1983), <span class="Italic">enforced</span>, 740 F.2d 141 (2d Cir. 1984) (union required to make employees whole for work lost because of the union's failure to notify laid-off employees of an arbitration award that altered the requirements they needed to fulfill in order to maintain their seniority); <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and</span> <span class="Italic">Aerospace Workers, Local 39</span>,<span class="Italic"> AFL-CIO</span>, 24 FLRA 352 (1986) (union ordered to pay unit employee amount of earnings lost during his suspension where union had failed to timely file grievance on employee's behalf).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Order</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to section 2423.29 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations and section 7118 of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the Respondent, National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1827, shall:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Take the following affirmative action in order to effectuate the purposes and policies of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;Request that the Graphic Arts Negative Engraving Division, Defense Mapping Agency, Aerospace Center, St. Louis, Missouri, reinstate the type of seniority used for calculating seniority-based benefits which was in effect prior to October 1, 1991.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;In the event the Respondent conducts a poll among unit employees of the Graphic Arts Negative Engraving Division, Defense Mapping Agency, Aerospace Center, St. Louis, Missouri, concerning the type of seniority to be used for calculating seniority-based benefits, the Respondent must grant to all unit employees alike the opportunity to participate in the poll.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(c)&#x2003;Make whole any unit employees employed in the Graphic Arts Negative Engraving Division, Defense Mapping Agency, Aerospace Center, St. Louis, Missouri, for any loss of pay, benefits or differentials suffered by such employee as a result of the implementation of GAN seniority on October 1, 1991, to calculate seniority-based benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAATS, Macon AFSS and Lewis</span>, 59 FLRA 261 (2003) (summary judgment based on allegations accepted through failure of union to properly respond to ULP complaint: union committed a ULP by failing to poll all unit employees, based on their union membership, concerning annual watch schedule).</p>
<p class="noindent">Distinguished from <span class="Italic">Bratton</span>, involving a determination based on a vote of employees, is the union determination, acting through its convention of union representatives, of how seniority will be administered under the provisions of a national agreement. Although the convention's members may consist only of union members, the exclusion of nonmembers from the vote is not a breach of the DFR. The evidence was that the union officials acted for the entire bargaining unit and not as representatives of the union. The union may not, however, give nonmembers the impression that their views will be discounted only because of their nonunion status, <span class="Italic">NATCA and Ruckman</span>, 55 FLRA 601, 601, 604-07 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Respondent is the exclusive representative of a nationwide bargaining unit of air traffic controllers. The collective bargaining agreement between the Respondent and the Agency provides that, "[e]xcept...[for reductions in force], seniority will be determined by the Union at the local level."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent determined the seniority policy to be applied under the contract by a vote of the delegates at its 1996 national convention.&#x2003;Pursuant to the Respondent's constitution, the national convention is the Respondent's "Supreme Body with full and complete authority over all the affairs of the Association." Business at the convention is conducted by delegates, who must be members of the Respondent and who are elected by members of the Respondent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's national convention considered alternative proposals for determining the seniority policy to be applied in the contract. Prior to the convention, the delegates used a variety of methods to solicit the opinions of employees concerning the seniority policy and to determine the manner in which to cast their votes. The methods included the posting of flyers, the distribution of information about the issue to union members and non-members, discussion of the issue at meetings, and "votes or polls" at four facilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the convention vote, a non-member of the Respondent wrote a letter objecting to certain aspects of the new seniority policy. The Regional President responded with a letter that stated, in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If you and 99 other non-members were NATCA members and had voted against a National Seniority System this resolution would have failed....&#8197;If you want to change this resolution, you have an opportunity to do so at the 1998 Convention in Seattle. I suggest you join the Union, become active and submit a resolution which either amends R96-015 or does away with a National Seniority Policy altogether.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the Respondent voted to establish a national seniority policy, the Agency filed a grievance under the parties' collective bargaining agreement, alleging that the establishment of the seniority policy violated the terms of the agreement. The grievance was submitted to arbitration, and the arbitrator held that the agreement ceded authority to the Respondent to determine the seniority policy, including the authority to determine the manner in which the policy would be exercised. The Arbitrator denied the grievance. No exceptions to the award were filed with the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A. The Duty of Fair Representation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute provides that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"[a]n exclusive representative is responsible for representing...all employees in the unit it represents without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership." This provision incorporates in federal labor relations the duty of fair representation recognized for unions in the private sector<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA, </span>800 F.2d 1165, 1171 (D.C. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the duty of fair representation, unions are required to "serve the interests of all members [of a bargaining unit] without hostility or discrimination toward any, to exercise discretion with complete good faith and honesty, and to avoid arbitrary conduct." <span class="Italic">Air Line Pilots</span> <span class="Italic">Association, International v. O'Neill, </span>499 U.S. 65, 76 (1991), <span class="Italic">quoting</span>, <span class="Italic">Vaca v. Sipes</span>, 386 U.S. 171, 177 (1967). The duty of fair representation obligates unions to represent all bargaining unit employees, requiring that "representational activities grounded in the union's status as exclusive representative must be undertaken without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership." <span class="Italic">Bratton, </span>49 FLRA at 746. As one court described this duty, "when a union uses a power which it alone can wield, it must do so for the benefit of all employees within its bargaining unit." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA, </span>812 F.2d 1326, 1328 (10th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1529"></span>Consistent with these principles, the Authority assesses allegations that a union has discriminated on the basis of union membership using a two-step analysis. First, we determine whether the union's disputed activities were undertaken in the union's role as exclusive representative. <span class="Italic">Bratton, </span>46 FLRA at 746. Second, we determine whether the union discriminated on the basis of union membership. <span class="Italic">Id.; compare Antilles Consolidated Education Association, (OEA/NEA), San</span> <span class="Italic">Juan, Puerto Rico, et al., </span>36 FLRA 776 (1990) <span class="Italic">(Antilles</span> <span class="Italic">Consolidated) </span>(union may not discriminate between members and non-members in the administration of insurance plan negotiated in collective bargaining agreement), <span class="Italic">with Fort Bragg Association of Educators,</span> <span class="Italic">National Education Association, Fort Bragg, North</span> <span class="Italic">Carolina, </span>28 FLRA 908, 918 (1987) (union may discriminate between members and non-members in representation provided in forums not grounded in union's role as the exclusive representative).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The adoption of the seniority policy by delegates to the Respondent's convention did not violate the duty of fair representation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Respondent's disputed activity was the determination of seniority rules under contract provisions that permit it to set this condition of employment. In <span class="Italic">Bratton</span>, the Authority held, with respect to this same subject, that there was "no question that [determining seniority for the bargaining unit] was subject to the duty of fair representation." 49 FLRA at 747. Similarly here, no party disputes that the Respondent administers the seniority policy in its role as exclusive representative and that the duty of fair representation applies to the Respondent's determination of this policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the second part of the Authority's test--whether the Respondent discriminated against non-members--there is no allegation that the substance of the seniority policy discriminates against non-members. In particular, no party excepts to the Judge's finding that the seniority policy selected by the Respondent was "employee neutral, i.e., was wholly unrelated to membership or non-membership in the Union."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Judge held that the substance of the Respondent's policy did not discriminate against non-members, he found that the procedure Respondent used to select the seniority policy illegally discriminated. In this regard, the Judge concluded that it violated the duty of fair representation for the Respondent to determine this policy at its convention, which may only be attended by delegates who are union members. The Judge held that this conclusion was dictated by the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Bratton.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not agree with the Judge that <span class="Italic">Bratton</span> and the case law it relied on dictate that the Respondent violated the duty of fair representation here. As the following discussion explains, this precedent requires a union to include both members and non-members where the union sets a condition of employment through a binding vote of <span class="Italic">employees. </span>It does not require that unions allow non-members to participate as <span class="Italic">union representatives.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general matter, unions are afforded a wide degree of latitude in the procedures that they use to formulate their positions with respect to conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See National Labor Relations Board v.</span> <span class="Italic">Wooster Division of Borg-Warner Corporation</span>, 356 U.S. 342, 350 (1958); <span class="Italic">Ford Motor, </span>345 U.S. at 337-38. For example, it is well established that unions are permitted to exclude non-members from contract ratification votes, <span class="Italic">Letter Carriers II, </span>595 F.2d at 813, and from polls taken to determine the union's positions in negotiations. <span class="Italic">See PATCO (Professional Air Traffic Controllers</span> <span class="Italic">Organization), MEBA, AFL-CIO, Local 301, Aurora,</span> <span class="Italic">Illinois, </span>A/SLMR No. 918, 7 A/SLMR 896 (1977) (exclusion of non-members from poll to determine a negotiating proposal not a breach of duty of fair representation). <span class="Italic">See also American Postal Workers Union</span> <span class="Italic">Pittsburgh Metro Area Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO</span> <span class="Italic">(United States Postal Service) and Blair Gorczyca, 300</span> NLRB 34 (1990) <span class="Italic">(American Postal Workers Union) </span>(no breach of duty of fair representation to exclude non-members from meeting to discuss union's position on proposed changes to employer's operations). As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The union has responsibility as exclusive bargaining agent to formulate the employees' position on terms and conditions of employment. This responsibility may be delegated by the union membership. Such delegation is an internal union procedure from which non-union employees properly may be excluded. However, the delegatee, once selected, must in turn function as a representative for all the employees in the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Letter Carriers II, </span>595 F.2d at 811-812 (citations omitted). <span class="Italic">See also American Postal Workers Union</span>, 300 NLRB at 35 (member-only meeting not a violation where union did not turn over its decision-making power as representative to the majority vote of its members).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The basic principle of <span class="Italic">Letter Carriers II </span>is that an individual representing a union must "function as a representative for all the employees in the bargaining unit." 595 F.2d at 811-812. If a representative's "negotiating decisions are motivated solely by self-interest, then there is a breach of the duty of fair representation<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 812. Consistent with this principle, if the union delegates final decision-making to a vote of employees, then both union members and non-members must be included in the voting. <span class="Italic">See Id. See also Bratton</span>, 49 FLRA at 748.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Respondent did not determine the seniority policy by a vote of its members. It determined the seniority policy by a vote of delegates to its national convention. These delegates operated as representatives of the employees. As the Judge described, each union delegate who testified stated that he had discretion in deciding how to vote on the resolutions, but that "every one stated that his vote reflected the wishes of the facility." The Judge specifically found, in this regard, that "delegates did not vote their personal preferences." No exceptions have been filed with respect to this finding. The delegates were, thus, acting as representatives of the entire bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge held that he was constrained by <span class="Italic">Bratton</span> to find the Respondent violated the Statute because "the legal issue is the same" and because the fact that the "vote moved from the local level to the national convention" was not dispositive. Although we agree with the Judge that the level at which a decision is made is not a dispositive factor, we do not agree that this is the only distinction between this case and <span class="Italic">Bratton</span>. The <span class="Italic">role</span> of the individuals making the determination in this case is different from the role of the individuals making the decision in <span class="Italic">Bratton. </span>As long as the decision-making power is vested in union representatives, rather than employees generally, and those representatives properly carry out their representative functions, <span class="Italic">Bratton and Letter Carriers </span>do not dictate that non-members of the union be included as decision-makers.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Because we do not believe that the decision in <span class="Italic">Bratton</span> controls the outcome in this case, we do not address the Respondent's contention that <span class="Italic">Bratton </span>was incorrectly decided. Nevertheless, we do not agree with Respondent's characterization of <span class="Italic">Bratton </span>as requiring that employees who are not union members be included in internal union deliberations. In <span class="Italic">Bratton, </span>the Authority adopted the reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">Letter Carriers II. Letter Carriers</span> <span class="Italic">II</span> explicitly provides that a wide variety of union decision-making, including polling of members, may exclude non-members of the union. <span class="Italic">Letter Carriers II, </span>595 F.2d at 812. The <span class="Italic">Bratton/Letter Carriers II </span>line of cases does not disapprove members-only ratification, and holds only that a union commits a violation of the duty of fair representation under the narrow circumstances where it delegates to its members the right to determine a condition of employment, without any subsequent exercise of decision-making responsibility on the part of the union or any safeguards assuring that the members are, in fact, acting as a representative "committee of the whole," rather than simply voting their personal, individual interests. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This result is supported not only by the precedent cited, but by important policy considerations. A finding that the practices followed by the Respondent here violate the duty of fair representation would have the effect of discouraging unions from democratically involving lower level union representatives in union decisionmaking. The inclusion of local union representatives in decision-making should be encouraged, however, especially where, as here, it appears that their inclusion was part of an effort to adopt a policy that reflected the desires of employees in the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that the Respondent did not violate the duty of fair representation by determining its seniority policy through a vote of delegates at its convention.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Respondent violated the duty of fair representation as a result of the Regional President's letter</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that the Respondent violated section 7116(b)(1) of the Statute when the Regional President sent a letter to a non-member of the union stating the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If you and 99 other non-members were NATCA members and had voted against a National Seniority System this resolution would have failed....&#8197;If you want to change this resolution, you have an opportunity to do so at the 1998 Convention in Seattle. I suggest you join the Union, become active and submit a resolution which either amends R96-015 or does away with a National Seniority Policy altogether.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standard for determining whether a union's allegedly coercive statement violates section 7116(b)(1) of the Statute is an objective one: whether, under the circumstances, employees reasonably could have drawn a coercive inference from the statement. <span class="Italic">See American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, Local 987,</span> <span class="Italic">Warner Robbins, Georgia, </span>35 FLRA 720, 724 (1990) <span class="Italic">(Warner Robbins). </span>As in cases involving a violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute, the standard for a section 7116(b)(1) violation is not based on the subjective perceptions of the employee hearing or receiving the communication, or on the intent of the speaker. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army Headquarters, Washington,</span> <span class="Italic">D.C. and U.S. Army Field Artillery Center and Fort Sill,</span> <span class="Italic">Fort Sill, Oklahoma, </span>29 FLRA 1110, 1124 <span id="page_1530"></span>(1987). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also American Postal Workers Union, </span>300 NLRB at 35 (finding a violation where the union makes communications that "under the circumstances, convey the impression that [it] intended to treat [a] non-member disparately.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this objective standard, we find, for the reasons that follow, that the Respondent violated section 7116(b)(1) of the Statute as a result of the Regional President's letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Regional President's letter states that the seniority system the Charging Party objected to would have been rejected if he and "99 other non-members" had joined the union and voted against it. This information, while factually incorrect, indicates that a direct vote on the seniority policy was available to all members of the union, and implies that non-members views and interests did not count. The letter thus conveys the "coercive inference" (<span class="Italic">Warner Robbins, </span>35 FLRA at 724) that the Respondent treated non-members disparately.[8] <span class="Italic">See American Postal Workers Union</span>, 300 NLRB at 35.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The finding, above, that the Respondent Union did not, in fact, conduct an improper vote of members to determine seniority rules does not excuse the impropriety of the Regional President's letter. By informing the recipient of the letter that he had, because of his non-member status, been denied a vote offered to all union member to set the seniority policy, the letter created an improper coercive inference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The letter does not, as the Respondent argues, simply inform the employee of the "greater participation" he might gain as a union representative at the convention. Moreover, while the dissent correctly points out that the letter does not contain an express statement that the employee's views would not be considered unless he joined the Union, no "stretch" (Member Wasserman Dissent at 20) is necessary to conclude that this is clearly implied by the letter's statement that the seniority system would have failed "if" the employee and "other non-members" became members of the Union. The letter effectively states that the seniority policy is directly determined by union members alone, and conveys the message that non-members views on the issue are not counted. The employee could reasonably have drawn a coercive inference from the letter as it relates to the exercise of the employee's right to join, or not join, the union and, for this reason, we find that Respondent violated the Statute as a result of the letter.</p>
