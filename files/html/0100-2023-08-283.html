<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 1208.11 (2022), describing permissive administrative redress with the Department of Labor or immediate appeal to the MSPB, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Choice of procedure under USERRA; exhaustion requirement.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Choice of procedure</span>. An appellant may file a USERRA appeal directly with the Board under this subpart or may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor under 38 U.S.C. 4322.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exhaustion requirement</span>. If an appellant files a complaint with the Secretary of Labor under 38 U.S.C. 4322, the appellant may not file a USERRA appeal with the Board until the Secretary notifies the appellant in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 4322(e) that the Secretary's efforts have not resolved the complaint. An appellant who seeks assistance from the Secretary of Labor under 38 U.S.C. 4321 but does not file a complaint with the Secretary under 38 U.S.C. 4322 is not subject to the exhaustion requirement of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appeals after exhaustion of Department of Labor procedure</span>. When an appellant receives notice from the Secretary of Labor in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 4322(e) that the Secretary's efforts have not resolved the complaint, the appellant may file a USERRA appeal directly with the Board or may ask the Secretary to refer the complaint to the Special Counsel. If the Special Counsel agrees to represent the appellant, the Special Counsel may file a USERRA appeal directly with the Board. If the Special Counsel does not agree to represent the appellant, the appellant may file a USERRA appeal directly with the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">38 USC 4321, governing assistance from DOL, states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Assistance in obtaining reemployment or other employment rights or benefits.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Secretary (through the Veterans' Employment and Training Service) shall provide assistance to any person with respect to the employment and reemployment rights and benefits to which such person is entitled under this chapter. In providing such assistance, the Secretary may request the assistance of existing Federal and State agencies engaged in similar or related activities and utilize the assistance of volunteers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">38 USC 4322, establishing DOL formal enforcement procedures, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Enforcement of employment or reemployment rights.</span></p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)(A)&#x2003;such employer has failed or refused, or is about to fail or refuse, to comply with the provisions of this chapter; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;in the case that the employer is a Federal executive agency, such employer or the Office of Personnel Management has failed or refused, or is about to fail or refuse, to comply with the provisions of this chapter,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">may file a complaint with the Secretary in accordance with subsection (b), and the Secretary shall investigate such complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Such complaint shall be in writing, be in such form as the Secretary may prescribe, include the name and address of the employer against whom the complaint is filed, and contain a summary of the allegations that form the basis for the complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)(1)Not later than five days after the Secretary receives a complaint submitted by a person under subsection (a), the Secretary shall notify such person in writing of his or her rights with respect to such complaint under this section and section 4323 or 4324, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;The Secretary shall, upon request, provide technical assistance to a potential claimant with respect to a complaint under this subsection, and when appropriate, to such claimant's employer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;The Secretary shall investigate each complaint submitted pursuant to subsection (a). If the Secretary determines as a result of the investigation that the action alleged in such complaint occurred, the Secretary shall attempt to resolve the complaint by making reasonable efforts to ensure that the person or entity named in the complaint complies with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;If the efforts of the Secretary with respect to a complaint under subsection (a) do not resolve the complaint, the Secretary shall notify the person who submitted the complaint in writing of--</p>

If the Special Counsel agrees to represent the appellant, the Special Counsel may file a USERRA appeal directly with the Board. If the Special Counsel does not agree to represent the appellant, the appellant may file a USERRA appeal directly with the Board.</p>

If an appellant first files a USERRA complaint with the Secretary of Labor, he may not appeal to the Board until he is notified that the Secretary's efforts did not resolve the complaint. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.11(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hobson v. VA,</span> DE-4324-11-0270-I-1 (NP 11/3/2011), reiterated the exhaustion scheme if DOL is the first step in the USERRA complaint process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant may file a USERRA complaint directly with the Board without filing a complaint with the Department of Labor (DOL). 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b)(1).

Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 327, &#x00B6; 12 (2007).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Becker v. MSPB</span>, 318 Fed. Appx. 907, 908 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), also summarized the choice that an individual makes between a Board appeal or preliminary resort to the Labor Department and subsequent required steps, if DOL is the first, in a USERRA appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_463"></span>A person may file a USERRA complaint against a federal executive agency directly with the Merit Systems Protection Board if that person has chosen not to apply to the Secretary of Labor for assistance. If the person does apply to the Secretary for assistance, he may only file a complaint with the board after receiving notification from the Secretary that the department was unable to resolve the complaint, the results of the department's investigation, and the person's entitlement to proceed to the board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4324(b), 4322(a), and 4322(e) (2000). If these procedures are not followed, the board does not have jurisdiction to hear the complaint. In this case, substantial evidence exists that Becker applied to the Secretary for assistance with his complaint. As the board found, on December 22, 2007, Becker wrote to the Secretary of Labor requesting that she address his complaints that he had not been hired for the positions. Becker however has not produced a notification that the Secretary has reviewed but was unable to resolve his complaint as the board ordered him to do to show jurisdiction. Instead, he complained in his appeal to the board that the Department of Labor "never replies." Therefore, he has not complied with the procedures set forth in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4324(b), 4322(a), and 4322(e), and the board correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to hear his case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Eberhart v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 398, 399 n.1 (2001) (USERRA: "The [appellant] may choose to file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor before or instead of filing an appeal with the Board.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Heckman v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 109 MSPR 133, 144-45 &#x00B6; 24, 2008 MSPB 128 (2008), explained the ability of the appellant to pursue a USERRA appeal directly to the Board or through the Department of Labor, the latter procedure requiring exhaustion of the Labor Department's remedial scheme:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish Board jurisdiction over a USERRA appeal arising under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), the appellant must allege that: (1) He performed duty or has an obligation to perform duty in a uniformed service of the United States; (2) the agency denied him initial employment, reemployment, retention, promotion, or any benefit of employment; and (3) the denial was due to the performance of duty or obligation to perform duty in the uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Hillman v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 5 (2003). Unlike the jurisdictional requirements of VEOA, an appellant may file a USERRA appeal directly with the Board without filing a complaint with DOL. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b)(1). Nevertheless, where, as here, an appellant seeks the assistance of the Secretary of Labor by filing a USERRA complaint with DOL before filing an appeal with the Board, he must exhaust his administrative remedies before DOL prior to submitting his USERRA appeal to the Board. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b)(2); <span class="Italic">Milner v. Department of Justice</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 37, 47 (1997). Moreover, whereas an appellant may be considered to have exhausted his administrative remedies in a VEOA appeal if the Secretary is unable to resolve his complaint within 60 days after the complaint was filed, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1), USERRA does not provide for exhaustion before DOL as a matter of time. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b). Instead, it requires that an appellant who has chosen to file a USERRA complaint receive a notice from DOL that it has been unable to resolve his complaint, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4322(e), 4324(b)(2), or, in cases where the appellant has requested that the Secretary of Labor refer the complaint to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) for litigation before the Board, USERRA requires that the appellant receive a notice from OSC that it has declined to initiate an action and represent the appellant before the Board, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(a)(2)(B), (b)(4).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Addressing the effect of a DOL referral of a USERRA complaint to OSC, <span class="Italic">Becker v. VA</span>, NY-4324-11-0348-I-1 (NP 11/2/2012), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an appellant first files a Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4333) (USERRA) complaint with the Secretary of Labor, he may not file a USERRA appeal with the Board until the Secretary notifies the appellant that she was unable to resolve the complaint. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b)(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.11(b); <span class="Italic">see Graham v.

Under the demonstration project created by the Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010 (the Act), the Department of Labor refers certain USERRA claims to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) for investigation and resolution of the claim. Pub. L. No. 111-275, &#x00A7; 105(a), (d)(3), 124 Stat. 2864, 2868-69 (Oct. 13, 2010).

Thus, OSC investigates and resolves USERRA complaints referred to it under the demonstration project, and OSC is responsible for informing the appellant of the results of the investigation and his right to appeal to the Board. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4322(e); Pub. L. No. 111-275, &#x00A7; 105(a), (d)(2)-(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted a November 7, 2011 preliminary determination letter stating that OSC was investigating his USERRA claim concerning the verbal counseling matter at issue in this appeal. The administrative judge's notice and initial decision both informed the appellant of the jurisdictional requirement to demonstrate that he received notice of the closure of the investigation into his USERRA complaint and his right to appeal to the Board. Nevertheless, he failed to submit a letter from OSC stating that it closed its investigation into his claim and notifying him of his Board appeal rights. Further, he argues on review that he is continuing to pursue his claim before OSC, and he attaches a copy of a letter to OSC in which he requests that OSC expedite its review of his claim. Thus, the administrative judge properly dismissed the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Becker v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 327, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2007).</p>

The administrative judge's initial decision finds that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's USERRA appeal but that it must be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. However, because we find that the Department of Labor is not "an employer" for purposes of this USERRA appeal, the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The operative statutory provision provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment <span class="Italic">by an employer</span> on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) (2000) (emphasis added). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has emphasized that this language "makes clear that the 'benefit of employment' that cannot be lawfully deprived by an employer is one that flows as a result of the person's employment <span class="Italic">by the employer in question.</span>" <span class="Italic">Thomsen v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 169 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there is no dispute that the appellant's employer was the Department of Justice. The appellant does not allege that he was ever employed by the Department of Labor or that he was an applicant for employment with that agency. Accordingly, he has failed to nonfrivolously allege a USERRA claim against "an employer" as required by the statute. <span class="Italic">See Michaels v. Department of Defense,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 676, &#x00B6; 8 (2009).</p>
