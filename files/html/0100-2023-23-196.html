<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-202a"><span class="space">6.</span> Time for Compliance if None Set in Settlement Agreement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If a settlement calls for payment by a certain date, that date should not pass without payment; merely initiating by that date the process to secure payment is insufficient. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Whaley v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 340, 347 (1994). If a specific date is not set out in the agreement, good faith requires timely fulfillment of its terms. Should a settlement not contain a time limit for compliance, the Board may impose a reasonable period of time for compliance. <span class="Italic">Graff v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 639, 643-44 (1989) (30 days set for compliance following regional proceedings and appeal to the Board on compliance issues); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Washington-Thomas v. VA</span>, 309 Fed. Appx. 394 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) (affirming Board's determination of what constituted a reasonable time for action to be taken under settlement); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Green v. DHS</span>, NY-0752-10-0290-C-1 (NP 4/25/2014) (citing "<span class="Italic">Kasarsky v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 296 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (when no time for performance is specified and one party performs, the non-performing party is not in breach of the contract until either (1) the performing party demands performance within a reasonable amount of time, and the other party still fails to perform within the time specified; or (2) the non-performing party repudiates the contract, and the performing party chooses to treat the repudiation as a breach)."); <span class="Italic">Ford v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 85 MSPR 354, 357-58 &#x00B6; 8 (2000) (agency delay violated agreement of agency to expeditiously issue a determination on appellant's eligibility for LEO retirement credit). If the settlement agreement does not set time limits for the actions it contemplates, an allegation of noncompliance will be reviewed to determine if delay is in bad faith or causes harm to the substantive rights of the appellant. <span class="Italic">Hallum v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 214, 215 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McWilliams v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 261, 264-65 (1991) ("[R]egardless of any settlement discussions the parties may have had, the final signed agreement...contained no specific time frame within which the agency was required to act. Accordingly, the agency cannot be found in noncompliance simply because it did not act within the time period the appellant suggests.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of the Board's approach toward an agency's responsibility to timely implement settlement provisions is <span class="Italic">Del Balzo v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 72 MSPR 55, 60 (1996), involving an application for counsel fees incurred during enforcement proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, when the appellant filed his petition for enforcement, the agency had not yet provided the appellant with his back pay or the attorney with his fee payment for the underlying action. Although the settlement agreement set forth only a deadline by when the agency was to initiate the processing of these payments, and did not set a date by which the payment had to be made, the Board has found that when a settlement agreement does not set a time limit for compliance, the Board has the authority to impose a reasonable time limit. <span class="Italic">See Hicks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 MSPR 561, 564 (1992) (when an agreement is silent as to the time or duration of performance, a reasonable time under the circumstances will be presumed); <span class="Italic">Graff v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 639, 643 (1989). Here, the appellant was not paid the back pay until more than three months after the settlement agreement was signed. Further, the attorney did not receive a fee check until more than four months after the agreement was signed. Clearly, although the agreement specified only a date by which the agency had to initiate processing of these checks, the point of the agreement was to promptly provide the appellant with the pay, and his attorney with the fees. The fact that the parties set short deadlines for the agency to initiate the processing of these checks after it received the necessary material from the appellant and his attorney leads to the conclusion that they did not contemplate that it would take three and four months respectively to accomplish these goals. We find that, particularly in light of the agreement's requiring the prompt initiation of the processing of these payments, the delay in actually making the payments was unreasonable.</p>

USPS</span>, 110 MSPR 642, 646 &#x00B6; 11, 2009 MSPB 37 (2009) (again remanded, 113 MSPR 89, 2009 MSPB 231 (2009)), examined the agency's actions in the initial implementation of a settlement to determine whether subsequent steps were completed in a reasonable time:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, there was a 3-month delay in the agency's issuing a PS-50 documenting the appellant's voluntary resignation for personal reasons. Although the agreement is silent as to the time of performance, a reasonable time under the circumstances will be presumed. <span class="Italic">Mincey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 247, &#x00B6; 11 (2002). What is reasonable in a particular case is a question of fact and parol evidence on this issue is admissible. <span class="Italic">Id.; see Ortega v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 422, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4, 7 (2000) (the AJ's finding that 21/2 months was a reasonable time under the circumstances for the agency to continue the appellant in the limited-duty assignment he held before filing his Board appeal is a factual finding). Six days after the settlement agreement was executed, the agency issued a PS-50 which stated that the appellant resigned "pending [an] inspection service case." Issuance of that PS-50 shows that the agency was capable of issuing a revised PS-50 in a relatively short period of time and also indicates that the parties intended that the agency would do so. Moreover, given that the appellant's goal in executing the agreement was to eliminate negative information as it may affect his search for future employment, there is no indication that the parties contemplated waiting more than 3 months after the agreement was executed to implement its provisions. On the contrary, the portion of the agreement requiring the appellant to resign and withdraw his appeal was implemented immediately, and the appellant had a right to <span id="Page_5049"></span>expect that the agency would meet its end of the bargain well before 3 months had passed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Graff v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 639, &#x00B6; 9 (1998). 643-44 (1989) (30 days was a reasonable period of time under the circumstances for the agency to complete its obligations under the terms of a settlement agreement, including the expungement of performance data from his official personnel record). The agency has offered no countervailing explanation for its delay in issuing a PS-50 documenting the appellant's voluntary resignation for personal reasons. Under the circumstances of the instant case, therefore, the agency's delay in meeting its obligations under the agreement would constitute a breach, despite its belated attempt to cure that breach. <span class="Italic">See Mullins v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 9 (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Eagleheart,</span> in <span class="Italic">Shelton v. EPA</span>, 115 MSPR 177, 186-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-22, 2010 MSPB 216 (2010), involving a dispute over the timeliness of payment of counsel fees under a settlement calling for payment of those fees within 30 days "or as soon as practicable," the Board considered the circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the agency breached the settlement agreement because it failed to pay the $61,000 in costs and attorney fees within a reasonable period of time. He concedes that the settlement agreement set no firm deadline for compliance. He argues, however, that the addendum initial decision is contrary to the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Capehart</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 385, and <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 55, where the Board found, under similar circumstances, that the agency's delay in performance was unreasonable and that the appellant was therefore the prevailing party in the compliance phase of the appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What constitutes a "reasonable delay" in complying with a settlement agreement depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular case. <span class="Italic">See Eagleheart</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 642, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Ortega v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 422, &#x00B6; 7 (2000). As the administrative judge correctly stated, what constitutes payment "as soon as practicable" under the settlement agreement also depends on the circumstances of a particular case. <span class="Italic">cf. Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 24, 30 n.3 (1982) ("The statutory guideline 'as early in the proceeding as practicable' is one designed to vary according to the circumstances.") (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(d)(1), which concerns the Office of Personnel Management's right to intervene in Board proceedings), <span class="Italic">aff'd as modified</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 451 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is correct that there are similarities between <span class="Italic">Capehart</span>, <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span>, and the instant appeal. Both <span class="Italic">Capehart</span> and <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span> are procedurally similar to the instant appeal, as both cases involved motions for attorney fees relating to the compliance stage of the appeals. <span class="Italic">Capehart</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 1; <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 57. <span class="Italic">Capehart</span> and <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span> both involved settlement agreements in which the agency agreed to make certain payments, but there was no specific deadline for compliance. <span class="Italic">Capehart</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 2; <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 60. They also involved delays in payment comparable to the alleged 78-day delay at issue here. <span class="Italic">Capehart</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 5 (delay of "almost three months" in paying attorney fees); <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 60 (delay of "more than three months" in paying back pay, and delay of "more than four months" in paying attorney fees).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in this case, the agreement itself contained an additional term acknowledging that additional time might be required under the circumstances to process the payments. IAF, Tab 26 at 3 (providing that the agency would "endeavor" to make the required payments within 30 days or "as soon as practicable"). The agreements in <span class="Italic">Capehart</span> and <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span> did not contain similar terms. <span class="Italic">Capehart</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 2; <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 57-58. Further, in finding that the agencies in <span class="Italic">Capehart</span> and <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span> failed to make the payments in a reasonable time, the Board considered facts that are not present in the instant appeal. In <span class="Italic">Capehart</span>, the Board noted that "the agency's Human Resources department failed to act upon the agency's initial order to remit attorney fees to the appellant and...the agency did not respond to the appellant's...letter regarding payment of the attorney fees." 83 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 5. The Board therefore found that the agency's eventual compliance was a direct result of the appellant filing his petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the instant appeal, however, it is undisputed that the agency continually acted upon the payment at issue beginning 4 days after the appellant's counsel submitted the required documentation, and that the agency responded to the appellant's counsel's requests regarding the status of the payment. Thus, there is no basis in the instant appeal for finding that the agency's eventual compliance was causally related to the filing of the petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span>, the Board found that, in light of the short deadline for the agency to begin processing the payments, the delay of more than 3 months in paying the back pay, and the delay of more than 4 months in paying the attorney fees was unreasonable because it was not what the parties contemplated. 72 M.S.P.R. at 60. In the instant appeal, however, the agency took only 78 days to fully comply with the settlement agreement. Furthermore, although the settlement agreement's 30-day benchmark for making the payment suggests that the parties here, like in <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span>, contemplated prompter payment, the agency in the instant appeal bargained for an additional provision to account for delays. <span class="Italic">cf. Whaley</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 347 ("[t]he agency could have contracted for some provision to protect itself against delays in processing the claim for backpay...but it did not do so and the Board will not do so for it."). Moreover, the agency in <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span> still owed the appellant interest and Thrift Savings Plan contributions a full 7 months after entering into the settlement agreement. 72 M.S.P.R. at 60-61. The appellant in the instant appeal does not allege that the agency still had outstanding obligations after it made the $61,000 payment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board saw no valid challenge to a provision of a settlement that called for the demotion of the appellant, who argued that the agency unduly delayed the demotion, <span class="Italic">Snowden v. Dept. of Interior,</span> DC-0752-10-0802-B-1 (NP 4/19/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the agreement is unenforceable because the doctrine of laches applies. The equitable defense of laches bars an action when an unreasonable delay in bringing the action has prejudiced the party against whom the action is taken. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Social Security Administration v. Carr,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 313, 330 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 185 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The party asserting laches must prove both unreasonable delay and prejudice. <span class="Italic">Id.; accord Pueschel v. Department of Transportation,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 422, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). We find that the appellant has shown neither. The appellant's argument appears to be that he was harmed by the agency's delay in demoting him because the agency's 2-year delay in demoting him extended the terms of the agreement by an additional 2 years. We, however, find nothing in the agreement providing that a unilateral delay in the performance of a single term by the agency that benefited the appellant would extend the terms of the agreement by the length of the delay. Further, we know of no authority for such, and the appellant has cited none. Moreover, as the administrative judge noted, rather than being harmed or prejudiced by the agency's delay, the appellant actually benefited by continuing to draw the higher salary to which he was not otherwise entitled. We, therefore, find no merit in the appellant's claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency unreasonably delays implementation of a component of a settlement, the appellant has the choice of enforcement or rescission of the agreement. When compliance proceedings are initiated and the agency then quickly complies, the appellant is left without a remedy if the appellant elects enforcement. But, the appellant may be able to secure counsel fees, <span class="Italic">Jones v. VA</span>, NY-0752-12-0182-C-1 (NP 5/5/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an appellant establishes that an agency is in breach of a settlement agreement, she may elect either enforcement of the agreement or rescission of the agreement and reinstatement of her claim on appeal. <span class="Italic">Wonderly v. Department of the Navy</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 529, 532 (1995). The appellant originally elected enforcement, not rescission. Because it is undisputed that the agency has cured the breach and complied with the parties' settlement agreement, the Board has no authority to order additional corrective action at this time. <span class="Italic">See Bables v. Department of the Army</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 171, &#x00B6; 20 (2000); <span class="Italic">Wonderly</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 532;. Although the Board lacks the authority to award compensatory damages for the breach, the appellant may be entitled to attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Wonderly</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 532. However, the appellant must submit her request by filing a motion with the New York Field office within 60 calendar days of the date of this decision. <span class="Italic">See Shelton v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 177, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 12 (2010) (setting forth the burdens of proof in a motion for attorney fees arising out of a petition for enforcement); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203.</p>
