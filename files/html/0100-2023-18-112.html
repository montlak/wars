<h5 class="h5" id="sec11-112"><span class="space">f.</span> Penalty Table, Standards of Conduct</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jenkins v. EPA</span>, 118 MSPR 161, 164-67 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 9-12, 2012 MSPB 70 (2012), relied on <span class="Italic">Ward</span> and determined that a removal lacked due process when the deciding official relied on a classification of the table of penalties not referenced in the proposal to evaluate the severity of the charged offense and the proper penalty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from the GS-13 position of Environmental Scientist based on two charges of misconduct: (1) Threatening or attempting to inflict bodily harm; and (2) Abusive or offensive language, gestures, or other conduct. Specifically, the agency charged that the appellant threatened to kill her second-level supervisor, Robert Dellinger, while the two were alone in the appellant's cubicle, and used profanity in addressing Dellinger. In proposing the removal, the agency relied on the appellant's past disciplinary record, i.e., a 2-day suspension for discourteous, unprofessional, and bullying conduct toward colleagues in 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in finding that the deciding official did not engage in prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication when she relied on an offense in the agency's table of penalties different from the offenses charged in the notice of proposed removal. Specifically, the appellant asserts that the deciding official relied on guidance in the table of penalties relating to the charge of generally criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral or notoriously disgraceful conduct, a charge not referenced in the notice of proposed removal, rather than the table of penalties provisions for threatening to inflict bodily harm and abusive or offensive language, the charges brought against the appellant. The deciding official testified that she relied on what she believed was a charge of comparable gravity to those in the notice of proposed removal, i.e., generally criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral or notoriously disgraceful conduct. She testified further that she relied on it because she felt removal was allowed for the first offense of misconduct described by that charge. The administrative judge found that the deciding official's reliance on the guidance for generally criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral or notoriously disgraceful conduct did not constitute an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency intends to rely on an aggravating factor as the basis for the imposition of a penalty, such factors should be included in the advance notice of adverse action so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond to those factors before the deciding official. <span class="Italic">See Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 5 (2011). Our reviewing court has explained that, if an employee has not been given "notice of any aggravating factors supporting an enhanced penalty," an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication with the deciding official regarding such factors may constitute a constitutional due process violation because it potentially deprives the employee of notice of all the evidence being used against her and the opportunity to respond to it. <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Furthermore, in determining whether a due process violation has occurred, there is no basis for distinguishing between <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information provided to the deciding official and information personally known by the deciding official, if the information was considered in reaching the decision and not previously disclosed to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication rises to the level of a due process violation; only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official constitute due process violations. <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The question is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279 (citations omitted). The Board will consider the following factors, among others, to determine whether an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact is constitutionally impermissible: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces cumulative information or new information; (2) whether the employee knew of the information and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">See Blank v. Department of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 2001). A due process violation is not subject to the harmful error test; instead, the employee is automatically entitled to a new, constitutionally correct removal proceeding. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency did not inform the appellant in its notice of proposed removal that it would consider the recommended penalty for a charge other than those set forth in the notice itself. Nevertheless, the deciding official testified that she considered the recommended penalty for conduct which is generally criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral or notoriously disgraceful. The appellant did not have an opportunity to respond to that aspect of the agency's table of penalties. We find that the agency's reliance on the recommended penalty for a charge other than those set forth in the notice of proposed removal cannot fairly be deemed cumulative or immaterial to the deciding official's decision. We therefore conclude that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights by denying her notice of the specific information considered and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See Gray v. Department of Defense,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-13 (2011) (finding a due process violation where the deciding official considered the appellant's likely loss of eligibility for a sensitive position as an aggravating factor without notice to the appellant). Accordingly, the appellant may not be removed unless and until she receives a "new constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">Ward,</span> 634 F.3d at 1280.</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, DE-0752-14-0402-I-1 (NP 8/4/2016) ("Accordingly, the facts of this case differ from those in which an employee is on notice of one charge, but a deciding official treats that charge as something altogether different to support an enhanced penalty. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 12 (2012) (finding a <span class="Italic">Ward/Stone</span> violation when the deciding official treated a charge as something altogether different to support a more severe penalty under the agency's table of penalties).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A similar analysis was applied in <span class="Italic">Evans v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, AT-0752-13-0310-I-1 (NP 9/27/2013), when the appellant was charged with inappropriate behavior, but his conduct was analyzed under standards applicable to sexual harassment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The primary issue here is whether the agency informed the appellant of the factors the deciding official would consider in imposing the penalty. In our view, the agency did not do so. The agency used a general charge label and in the charge narrative alleged a few specific examples of misconduct, as well as a pattern of misconduct occurring on unspecified occasions during 2011 and 2012, which continued even after the appellant was counseled about behavior that was "inappropriate" and "of a sexually oriented nature." The deciding official considered as an aggravating factor the fact that the appellant's misconduct resembled sexual harassment. He thus consulted the range of recommended penalties set forth in the agency's Table of Penalties for that offense. HCD (testimony of deciding official).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency intends to base its enhancement of a penalty upon aggravating factors, these factors must be included in the advance notice of the adverse action so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to address them before the deciding official. <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 5 (2011). An agency's failure to give notice of these factors may constitute a violation of constitutional due process. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279. Where a deciding official receives <span id="Page_3290"></span>by <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication new and material information regarding aggravating factors and relies upon that information, the employee is deprived of notice of all the evidence being used against him and the opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1375-76.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding whether the deciding official's use of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information has violated an appellant's due process rights, the Board will weigh the following factors, among others: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces "cumulative" information or new information; (2) whether the appellant knew of the information and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Jenkins,</span> 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 11. Ultimately, the Board seeks to determine whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, the Board considered the issue now at stake: whether the deciding official's reliance on the Table of Penalties to enhance the penalty violated the appellant's due process rights. Although the appellant in <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span> was charged with a different offense, it resembles the instant case in the relevant respects. The agency charged the appellant with threatening to inflict bodily harm, and abusive or offensive language, gestures, or conduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 12. The deciding official relied upon the Table of Penalties entry for a more serious charge, "generally criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral or notoriously disgraceful conduct," rather than the provisions for the charges actually brought. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board found the deciding official's review and reliance on the Table of Penalties to be an impermissible <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication because the appellant lacked notice of the specific information considered during the penalty determination and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision here does not suggest that the appellant lacked notice that the alleged misconduct was of a sexual nature or that the agency considered his behavior to be inappropriate. The notice of proposed removal was sufficient in that respect. We do not consider, however, the references to sexual harassment in the Background section of the investigative report to have adequately informed the appellant that the deciding official would consider an enhanced penalty based upon the recommended range of penalties for sexual harassment. As in <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span>, the penalty information for a charge other than the one set forth in the notice of proposed removal cannot fairly be deemed cumulative or immaterial to the deciding official's decision. <span class="Italic">See Jenkins</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 12. The appellant's written and oral responses do not suggest that he was aware of the agency's intention to impose an enhanced penalty. Thus, the agency violated the appellant's due process rights by denying him notice of the specific information considered and an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, a charge of sexual harassment is distinct from and more serious than a charge of "inappropriate conduct" based on comments and actions with sexual overtones. A charge of sexual harassment requires an agency to meet a specified standard of proof.[2] The agency admits here that the investigative record may have lacked the specificity to support such a charge. Conversely, the agency only had to prove that the appellant engaged in conduct described in the narrative. <span class="Italic">See Russo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 284 F.3d 1304, 1309-10 &#x0026; n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (a general charge, such as conduct unbecoming, may be sustained when the Board finds that the appellant engaged in inappropriate behavior, even though it does not rise to the level of impropriety asserted by the agency; however, the penalty should reflect only the proven level of impropriety). Without notifying the appellant in advance, the agency cannot rely upon the penalty recommendations for a more serious charge that it might not have been able to prove....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;A Title VII sexual harassment violation will lie if the offensive conduct is based on the employee's sex, is unwelcome, and is sufficiently severe or pervasive to interfere with the employee's job performance or to create an abusive work environment. <span class="Italic">See King v. Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d 1572, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1994). When the work environment is abusive, the conditions of employment have been altered by the sex-based actions. <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 65 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The deciding official's analysis of a penalty table alone does not constitute consideration of an aggravating factor, <span class="Italic">McCook v. DHUD,</span> SF-0752-14-0389-I-1 (NP 8/3/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice of proposed removal stated that the removal was being proposed in accordance with the agency's Adverse Actions Handbook, which describes in general terms how each of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors is used in determining a reasonable penalty and includes the agency's table of offenses and penalties. Further, the deciding official did not consider "consistency" with the table of penalties as an "aggravating" factor. <span class="Italic">Cf. Harding v. U.S. Naval Academy</span>, 567 F. App'x 920, 925 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding that "the fact of consistency with other decisions was not used as an aggravating factor, and thus due process would not require that the employee be given advance notice of the deciding official's intent to consider the penalties imposed on others"). Rather, the deciding official indicated that removal was within the recommended range of penalties for criminal conduct and that removal was warranted because the appellant's actions and guilty pleas "constituted an egregious situation and have a direct nexus to [his] position." The deciding official's conclusion was thus based on the nature of the appellant's conduct and its nexus to his position, as charged in the notice of proposed removal, and not on any new information unknown to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reference to penalty table classifications other than what was cited in the proposal did not cause reversal when the charges were not directly covered by the penalty table, <span class="Italic">Pauli v. DHS,</span> DC-0752-13-6815-I-1 (NP 3/10/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proposing official indicated that Charges 2 and 3, lack of candor and requesting that a contractor provide inaccurate information, were not covered in the table of penalties. The deciding official, however, found that these charges were analogous to "falsification, misstatement, or concealment of material fact in connection with any official record," which recommends a penalty range anywhere from reprimand to removal for a first offense. He considered this recommendation in arriving at his decision. The appellant argues on review that this constituted a due process violation under <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span>, the Board reversed the appellant's removal on due process grounds because the deciding official relied on a recommendation in the table of penalties for an offense with which the appellant was not actually charged. 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 9-12. The instant appeal is similar to <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span> to the extent that the deciding official considered a recommendation in the table of penalties of which the appellant was not on notice. This amounted to an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication for purposes of <span class="Italic">Ward</span> and <span class="Italic">Stone</span>. <span class="Italic">See Jenkins</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is a procedural defect so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that it undermines the due process guarantee and entitles the claimant to an entirely new administrative proceeding; rather, only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official will violate the due process guarantee of notice. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376. The Board will consider the following factors, among others, to determine whether an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact is constitutionally impermissible: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces "cumulative" information or new information; (2) whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the information at issue was cumulative of that presented to the appellant in the notice of proposed removal. The proposal notice identified the table of penalties as to the charges of "damage to...property" and "engaging in dangerous horseplay," both of which carried a potential penalty of reprimand to removal. The recommended range of penalties for a first offense of "falsification, misstatement, or concealment of material fact in connection with any official record" is also reprimand to removal. Thus, the deciding official's error did not alter the range of penalties that the appellant already knew that he was facing. <span class="Italic">See Blank v. Department of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225, 1229-30 (2001) (finding that a deciding official did not violate an employee's right to due process by conducting interviews "merely to confirm and clarify information that was already contained in the record"). Further, the notice itself reflected that the agency viewed the appellant as concealing material facts. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> IAF, Tab 3 at 122-23 (indicating, in pertinent part, that the appellant made misrepresentations and omitted "critical facts" from his statement), <span class="Italic">with Jenkins</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 9, 12 (finding that the deciding official violated an appellant's due process rights when the charge listed on the proposal notice was identical to one in the table of penalties, but the deciding official relied on a different charge listed in the table because she felt it was comparable in gravity to the appellant's misconduct and allowed for a higher penalty).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that it was unlikely that the deciding official's consideration of the penalty for misstatements and concealment resulted in undue pressure. As noted above, each of the relevant table of penalties entries considered by the deciding official allowed for the entire range of penalties. Considering the totality of the circumstances, we find that the deciding official's error was not "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that, although the deciding official committed procedural error, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(g)(1) (limiting the agency's decision on a proposed adverse action to the reasons specified in the proposal notice, the employee's response, and any medical documentation prescribed <span id="Page_3291"></span>by regulation), the error was not, in fact, harmful to the appellant's substantive rights, <span class="Italic">see Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991) (observing that harmful error under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) cannot be presumed; an agency error is harmful only where the record shows that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error). As explained above, the range of penalties remained the same. Furthermore, the appellant has not explained what additional evidence or argument he would have proffered to the deciding official had he been aware that the deciding official was considering this aspect of the table of penalties, <span class="Italic">see Ray v. Department of the Army</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 21 (2004) (declining to find a procedural error harmful because, in pertinent part, the appellant did not identify the specific evidence that would have resulted in a different outcome), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 176 F. App'x 110 (Fed. Cir. 2006), and in any event, the deciding official testified that he would have removed the appellant based on Charge 1 alone; <span class="Italic">see Wilson v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 686, &#x00B6; 13 (2014) (finding allegedly <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information is not material to a penalty determination if the deciding official does not use it to enhance the penalty), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 595 F. App'x 995 (Fed. Cir. 2015).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hicks v. USDA</span>, AT-0752-16-0105-I-1 (NP 9/22/2016), determined that no due process error occurred when the charge was conduct prejudicial to the best interests of the service, but the penalty determination was based on agency policies regarding workplace violence, including threats, and the proposal made clear that those policies were part of the rationale for the removal proposal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming without finding that the deciding official relied on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information when she considered the appellant's alleged misconduct as a threat charge, the proposal notice informed the appellant that the agency charged her with conduct prejudicial to the best interests of the service. This contains a lesser burden of proof than a threat charge because it does not require an agency to establish that the appellant intended to cause harm or that any listeners felt threatened by the alleged statements or actions at issue. <span class="Italic">See Wiley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 535, &#x00B6; 10 (2006) (finding that an improper conduct charge contains a lesser burden of proof than a threat charge), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 218 F. App'x 1001 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 200, 204 (1997) (finding that an administrative judge erred in requiring an agency to demonstrate the elements of a threat charge when it charged an appellant with "improper conduct" based on threatening remarks towards his supervisor); <span class="Italic">see also Metz v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001, 1004 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (finding that, in deciding whether statements constitute threats, the Board is to apply the reasonable person criterion, considering the listeners' reactions and apprehensions, the wording of the statements, the speaker's intent, and the attendant circumstances).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official testified that, in deciding to remove the appellant, she considered that: (1) the appellant had made "a threat to a colleague at the workplace"; (2) the gun at issue in the charge was used as "a threat to another employee"; (3) the gun was "perceived as a threat"; and (4) "showing a gun is a threat." She further testified that the appellant's removal was consistent with the agency's treatment of employees who convey "threats with deadly weapons such as firearms and knives," and that the appellant's removal was necessary because the "threat level was so high." We have considered the agency's arguments on review that the deciding official's testimony pertained solely to the severity of the alleged misconduct at issue in the charged offense of conduct prejudicial to the best interests of the service, and find them unpersuasive. We agree with the administrative judge that the deciding official considered the appellant's alleged misconduct as a threat charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, not necessarily finding as such, we note that not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication rises to the level of a due process violation; only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official are constitutionally infirm. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376-77; <span class="Italic">Lange</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6; 8. In <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit identified the following factors to be used to determine whether <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information is new and material: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication introduces cumulative, as opposed to new, information; (2) whether the employee knew of the information and had an opportunity to respond; and (3) whether the communication was of the type likely to result in undue pressure on the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. 179 F.3d at 1377. Ultimately, the Board's inquiry in deciding whether an employee's due process rights have been violated is "whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we agree with the agency that the administrative judge erred in finding that the allegedly <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information considered by the deciding official was new and material. Although the agency did not charge the appellant with making a threat, the penalty section of the proposal notice quoted agency policies regarding firearms and workplace violence, which prohibited threats, and addressed the same type of alleged misconduct that formed the basis for the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the proposal notice quoted an agency policy on firearms at the worksite, which stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is Agency policy to protect employees from assault, harassment, interference, intimidation, or <span class="Italic">threats</span> related to, or as the result of, performing their official duties and responsibilities, whenever possible. The Agency will not tolerate careless or indiscriminate incidents involving firearms or references to firearms (examples: joking, improper handling or storage, horseplay, or belligerent or hostile exchanges involving firearms). Actions or statements referencing firearms used to assault, harass, interfere with, intimidate, or <span class="Italic">threaten</span> employees are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proposal notice also quoted an agency policy on workplace violence, which stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is the Agency's policy that the workplace environment must remain free of behavior, action, or language causing or contributing to workplace violence. Assault, harassment, interference, intimidation, or <span class="Italic">threat</span> by or against any Agency employee or client at the worksite is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is a violation of Agency policy to have, use, or <span class="Italic">threaten</span> use of a firearm, explosive, or other dangerous weapons at a worksite or in a vehicle used for official business.... It is inappropriate to refer to or threaten the use of these items in a violent act or manner contrary to their normal use. Such a <span class="Italic">threat</span> is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the agency policies quoted in the penalty section of the proposal notice used the word "threat" or "threaten" no less than six times. Under these circumstances, we find that, although the agency did not charge the appellant with making a threat, the proposal notice did, or should have, put the appellant on notice that the agency viewed her alleged misconduct as analogous to a threat. Therefore, we find that, to the extent the information relied on by the deciding official may have been <span class="Italic">ex parte</span>, it was merely cumulative. <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some research or knowledge of the deciding official of comparable penalties did not warrant setting aside an adverse action in <span class="Italic">Walker v. DHS</span>, DA-0752-12-0601-I-1 (NP 5/23/2014), concluding that the information was cumulative:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge considered, but rejected, the appellant's claim that the agency violated his due process rights when, during his review of the case, the deciding official received three comparator cases from a Labor and Employee Relations (LER) Specialist, discussed them with her, and relied on them with regard to the consistency of the penalty, but did not share them with the appellant prior to issuance of the decision letter. The administrative judge found that the comparator cases constituted <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information, but the appellant's due process rights were not violated because, while he did not have an opportunity to respond to the comparator cases, the information regarding them was cumulative, not new.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, it is undisputed that the comparator cases constituted an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication. However, although the appellant disputes the administrative judge's conclusion that this <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication did not constitute a due process violation, the appellant has failed to explain the basis for his claim. In finding that the comparator cases constituted cumulative information and not new information, the administrative judge relied upon the deciding official's testimony that he considered them as a "general guide" and only to determine whether the penalty of removal was consistent. She also noted his testimony that he had previously served as a deciding official in a case where the employee was removed for making false statements, and he reviewed the agency's Table of Penalties to ensure that removal fell within the range of appropriate penalties for falsification. In reviewing the comparator cases, the deciding official confirmed that removal, as proposed, was the appropriate penalty in terms of how the agency had treated other Border Patrol Agents found to have committed falsification, and, therefore, he was conducting a limited inquiry into matters already in the record to clarify information that was already received as evidence. <span class="Italic">See Blank v. Department of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 2001). We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication in this case was not so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that the appellant cannot be subjected to a deprivation of property under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
