<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-115"><span class="space">c.</span> Marital Status</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Essential to an allegation of marital status discrimination is different treatment of married and unmarried employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dvortsin v. DHS</span>, 314 Fed. Appx. 307, 309 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) ("In order to allege marital status discrimination, Ms. Dvortsin must assert facts, which if proven, demonstrate that unmarried employees were treated differently from married employees."); <span class="Italic">Collins v. MSPB</span>, 65 Fed. Appx. 297 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) (marital status claim was not made out by a contention that the appellant was terminated, as the spouse of an enlisted man, while another woman in a comparable situation, who was the spouse of an officer, was not terminated); <span class="Italic">Lipniarski v. MSPB,</span> 26 Fed. Appx. 919 (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP) ("Because Lipniarski failed to present any evidence that the INS allowed single employees to take lengthy leaves of absence or to fail to report for duty on account of family obligations, we conclude that the Board correctly found that he failed to set forth a nonfrivolous allegation of marital status discrimination, and that the Board therefore lacked jurisdiction to hear his appeal."), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">LaFond v. DOD</span>, SF-315H-13-0884-I-1 (NP 4/1/2014) ("Although the appellant alleged that Ms. H. and others may have gossiped <span id="Page_172"></span>about him, the appellant did not allege facts that, if proven, would show that the agency would have treated a single employee differently under the same circumstances. <span class="Italic">Cf., e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Lipniarski v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 26 F. App'x 919, 922-923 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (probationary employee failed to nonfrivolously allege marital status discrimination because he did not present any evidence that the agency treated single employees more favorably than married employees with respect to extended leave for family obligations). He also did not allege facts that would show that the agency exhibited a keen interest in his marital status, as the Board found in the other cases he cited."); <span class="Italic">Chase-Baker v. DOJ</span>, 198 F.3d 843, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("The statute is...concerned...only with any difference in treatment of married and unmarried employees."); <span class="Italic">Goklaney v. Dept. of Navy,</span> PH-315H-11-0355-I-1 (NP 11/28/2011) ("We agree with the administrative judge that the statements of the appellant's managers regarding the appellant's perceived preference to spend time with his family rather than travel for work do not go to the essence of the appellant's status as a married individual; rather, they go to his status as an individual with familial responsibilities."); <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOJ</span>, 41 MSPR 353, 356 (1989) (no disparity was apparent from an allegation that an employee's supervisor told him that he could have problems because of frequent calls made by the employee's wife to the facility where he worked).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a probationer alleges that he was the victim of adverse action because he was married to a person of another race, his complaint is one of racial rather than marital status discrimination. <span class="Italic">Shah v. GSA</span>, 7 MSPR 626, 628, 7 MSPB 460 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Fort v. Dept. of Navy,</span> DC-315H-10-0756-I-1 (NP 9/20/2011) ("Specifically, she alleges that she was discriminated against because she is an "Officer's wife." We agree with the administrative judge, however, that the appellant did not allege facts that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal. The appellant has not alleged that she was treated differently than an unmarried person; she merely argues that she was treated differently, and that people were jealous of her, because she was married to an Officer. These arguments do not go to the essence of her status as a married person. <span class="Italic">See Smirne v. Department of the Army</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 51, &#x00B6; 8 (2010)."); <span class="Italic">Smith v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In particular, the appellant specifically alleged that (1) she had good performance reviews and no one explained her termination; (2) her supervisor regularly raised questions about her marital status; (3) she was assigned menial tasks not assigned to single employees; (4) married employees were subjected to harsher standards; (5) married employees were objects of ridicule; (6) her responsibilities were given to an inexperienced single employee; and (7) single employees received better treatment and preferences for telework. The Board has found similar allegations sufficient to entitle an appellant to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Smirne v. Department of the Army</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 51, &#x00B6; 11 (2010) (the appellant alleged that her purported performance problems were fabrications, she was the only single, pregnant, newly hired secretary, and she was the only new secretary terminated); <span class="Italic">Strausbaugh</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 305, &#x00B6; 8 (the appellant alleged that his supervisor made derogatory remarks about his marital status, told him he would not be having "problems" if he was married, and excluded his fianc&#x00E9;e and young child from an official function); <span class="Italic">Kiser v.

Thus, the appellant presented facially nonfrivolous allegations regarding her marital status discrimination claim, and the administrative judge erred in dismissing her case without holding a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 686 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (if a probationary employee presents a facially nonfrivolous allegation of marital status discrimination, she is entitled to a hearing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pommert v. Dept. of Army</span>, 14 MSPR 99, 101-02 (1982), involving a claim that an employee was fired because his child care responsibilities as a single parent caused him to leave early, described the contours of marital status discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear from appellant's contentions of appeal that his allegation of marital status discrimination is not based on his status as single but rather on his contention that he was entitled to leave early, despite the absence of accrued leave, because of family obligations. Appellant's need to leave early did not arise from the fact that he was single or even that he had been divorced but rather from the fact that he was entrusted with the care of his children. In this respect, appellant is no different from other parents regardless of their marital status. Thus, we cannot agree with his contention that the failure to grant his request constitutes marital discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is consistent with prior Board decisions concerning marital discrimination claims. In <span class="Italic">Shah v. GSA</span>, 7 MSPB 460, 7 MSPR 626 (1981), we held that in order to make an allegation of marital status discrimination which was not frivolous in character, appellant's allegations must go to the essence of the marital status of the appellant. There, the Board found that a foreign-born appellant who alleged that he was discriminated against because he was married to a white American woman would not establish a claim of marital status discrimination, even if his allegations were true, since there was no showing "that the actions against him were taken as a result of marital status <span class="Italic">per se</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 460, 7 MSPR at 628. Similarly, <span id="Page_173"></span>in <span class="Italic">Hilden v. U.S. Department of Agriculture</span>, 8 MSPB 3, 8 MSPR 300 (1981), we held that a claim that appellant's termination was discriminatory since it put her in a desperate financial situation because of her single status was frivolous since her financial situation, not her marital status as single, was the basis for her allegation. There, the Board found that the presiding official should have dismissed her appeal without making a finding as to the merits of her termination. <span class="Italic">See also Yakupzack v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 9 MSPB 435, 10 MSPR 180 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the presiding official should have also dismissed appellant's appeal as frivolous, since, on its face, his allegation of discrimination was not based on his status as single but on his familial obligations. Inasmuch as Col. Baker's denial of his request to leave early did not evidence a discriminatory motive towards single individuals, contrary to the presiding official's finding, there was no basis for inferring a discriminatory motive to his subsequent decision to terminate appellant for insubordination. Therefore, the presiding official erred in finding that appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination in light of the nature of appellant's allegations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Family or child care responsibilities were insufficient to invoke marital status discrimination jurisdiction over a probationer's discharge in <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Dept. of Navy,</span> PH-315H-10-0264-I-1 (NP 9/30/2010), considering whether the appellant's supervisor expressed "a keen interest in the appellant's marital status, including the way in which his or her marital status might affect employment," and determining that racially-oriented remarks about the nature of the appellant's marriage may have demonstrated racial or national origin prejudice but not marital status discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his affidavit, the appellant indicated that the reason that he requested telework to Georgia was "in support of [his] family" and "to attend to [his] family." However, the fact that he has family responsibilities does not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of marital status discrimination. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Lipniarksi v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 26 F. App'x 919 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the appellant alleged before the court that, "had he not been married, he would not have been called away to assist his wife with her father's illness, and thus the [employing agency] would not have terminated him." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 922. The Federal Circuit rejected this argument, concluding that "[marital] responsibilities do not excuse married employees from having to comply with orders to report for duty any more than they excuse similarly situated single employees having comparable family obligations," and it affirmed the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 922-23. Although <span class="Italic">Lipniarski</span> is an unpublished decision, the Board may rely on unpublished Federal Circuit decisions if it finds the court's reasoning persuasive. <span class="Italic">E.g., Herring v. Department of the Navy,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 13 n.* (2001), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 35 F. App'x 887 (Fed. Cir. 2002). We believe that the appellant's allegations regarding his family obligations are similar to the allegations in <span class="Italic">Lipniarski</span>; thus, the court's reasoning is persuasive. Similarly, the Board has held that "childcare responsibilities are not dependent upon an individual's marital status" and such allegations "[do] not go to the essence of [the appellant's] marital status." <span class="Italic">Awa v. Department of the Navy</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 318, 322 (1989); <span class="Italic">see Pommert v. Department of the Army</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 99, 101-02 (1982) (an allegation of marital status discrimination was frivolous when it was based on the appellant's childcare obligations, not his marital status). Therefore, any allegation based on the fact that he desired to support his family and/or care for his children does not support his claim of marital status discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Child care responsibilities, to the extent they contributed to a probationer's discharge, did not equate to marital status discrimination, <span class="Italic">Williams v. DOD</span>, PH-315H-14-0435-I-1 (NP 7/21/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an appellant has established jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b), the Board follows a two-step process. <span class="Italic">Marynowski v. Department of the Navy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 321, &#x00B6; 5 (2012). First, the appellant must make nonfrivolous claims of jurisdiction, i.e., factual allegations that, if proven, would establish that her termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An appellant who makes such nonfrivolous claims is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing at which she must then prove the basis for jurisdiction, i.e., that her termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status, by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To make a nonfrivolous allegation of marital status discrimination, an appellant must allege facts which, taken as true, would show that she was treated differently because of her marital status or facts that go to the essence of her status as married, single, or divorced. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. In <span class="Italic">Marynowski</span>, for instance, the appellant alleged that the supervisor who terminated her was motivated by jealousy of her marriage because she had repeatedly spoken about it. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. The supervisor, for example, would mention the appellant's mode of dress and grooming habits and speculate aloud as to whether these things pleased her husband. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board concluded that the appellant's allegation, taken as true, indicated that the supervisor displayed a "keen interest in the state of the probationer's marital status." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant in the instant appeal alleged that her supervisor was not understanding of her need to take leave to care for her children and that her supervisor disapproved of her previous interracial marriage with her ex-husband, the appellant did not allege facts that, if proven, would show that the agency would have treated a single or married, rather than divorced, employee differently under the same circumstances, <span class="Italic">cf., e.g., Lipniarski v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 26 F. App'x 919, 922-23 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (nonprecedential) (probationary employee failed to nonfrivolously allege marital status discrimination because he did not present any evidence that the agency treated single employees more favorably than married employees regarding extended leave for family obligations). She also did not allege facts that would show that the agency exhibited a keen interest in her marital status, as the Board has found in other cases. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Marynowski</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 321, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Strausbaugh v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the appellant here did not allege that the supervisor expressed a keen interest in the appellant's status as divorced. Rather, the appellant claimed that her supervisor was not understanding of her need to take leave to care for her children. However, childcare responsibilities <span class="Italic">per se</span> are not dependent on an individual's marital status and do not go to the essence of marital status. <span class="Italic">Green-Brown</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 327, &#x00B6; 7 n.2; <span class="Italic">see Awa v.

The appellant also claimed that her supervisor disapproved of her previous interracial marriage, even though she admitted that the supervisor said that she personally does not have a problem with interracial relationships. The appellant's evidence does not suggest that the action against her was taken as a result of marital status <span class="Italic">per se</span> but rather that it was allegedly taken as a result of racial and national origin prejudice. <span class="Italic">See Shah v.

<p class="Body-Text">Although child care responsibilities did not support a probationer's claim of marital status discrimination, allegations of disparate treatment of single and married employees supported jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Green-Brown v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency terminated the appellant during her probationary period from her Program Analyst position based on "repeated time and attendance problems." On appeal, she challenged the merits of the action and, referring to herself as a "single black mother," argued that her supervisor had violated her rights and treated her unfairly based on her "marital status, race, and parental status." She requested a hearing. The administrative judge issued an order setting forth the legal standard for establishing Board jurisdiction over probationary terminations. In response, the appellant, among other things, repeated her claim that her supervisor used her status as a single black mother to create limitations, threaten her employment standing, and isolate her in the workplace....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision based on the written record, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. She found that, even accepting the appellant's allegations as true, the appellant failed to assert a nonfrivolous allegation of marital status discrimination because she did not provide any description of how married employees were treated more favorably and cited to no specific examples of when she was treated disparately or denied a benefit of employment based on her marital status. The administrative judge further found that the appellant's allegation that she desired to, or was required to, care for her child did not support her claim of marital status discrimination because such allegations do not go to the essence of an individual's marital status.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged that on numerous occasions her supervisor threatened her employment standing while referencing her marital and parental status in an effort to get her to switch teams and/or organizations, to return to her previous employer, or to quit. The appellant further asserted that, when those attempts failed, he moved to terminate her employment based "on bogus claims" in order to "cover up" his retaliatory actions. In this regard, she challenged the incidents on which her termination was based, noting that, after they occurred, she received a performance bonus. In addition, the appellant described an incident that happened when she was working at home. According to the appellant, her supervisor asked where her daughter was, she replied that her uncle was also at home, and her supervisor said that it was only "okay" for her to work at home with her daughter present if someone was there to assist her. According to the appellant, married employees, including some who had minor or disabled dependents, were not subject to this policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the appellant's statement challenging as unsupported the time and attendance problems asserted by the agency, taken together with her statements alleging that, by his remarks, her supervisor targeted her as a single mother are sufficient to constitute nonfrivolous allegations that her termination was based on her marital status.[2] <span class="Italic">See Marynowski</span>, 2012 MSPB 82, &#x00B6; 8 (appellant's allegations that her supervisor showed a keen interest in her marital status, and was jealous that she had a husband, and that her fixation on the appellant's marital status caused her to lose training opportunities, constituted a nonfrivolous allegation of marital status discrimination); <span class="Italic">Strausbaugh v.

<p class="Body-Text">An appellant argued that the agency terminated her because she was married.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To show that the Board has jurisdiction because of discrimination based on marital status or partisan political reasons, an appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that her termination was based on one of those factors. <span class="Italic">See Strausbaugh</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 305, &#x00B6; 6.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that her termination was due to marital status discrimination.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the administrative judge's Order to Show Cause on jurisdiction, the appellant submitted a sworn statement that: (1) the agency's assertions of poor performance were untrue; (2) that she was the only one of 10 newly hired secretaries who was unmarried and pregnant during the time she was employed there and that she was the only new secretary terminated; and (3) that her supervisor's failure to counsel her regarding her performance, promptly credit her with donated leave, or congratulate her on the birth of her son are corroboration that her termination was based on her marital status. The agency submitted an affidavit from the appellant's supervisor that stated the decision to terminate the appellant was based on performance deficiencies and that no other secretary who had worked for him had similar deficiencies. The supervisor also stated that other single parents had worked for him successfully. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning first to the appellant's contentions regarding her supervisor's behavior, we do not believe that the conduct she describes falls within the ambit of factual allegations that the Board has found constitute nonfrivolous allegations of marital status discrimination. <span class="Italic">Cf. Strausbaugh</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 305, &#x00B6; 8 (finding that comments allegedly made by a supervisor that showed a "keen interest in the state of the probationer's marital status" were sufficient to constitute nonfrivolous allegations (citing <span class="Italic">Gribben v. Department of Justice,</span> 55 M.S.P.R. 257, 259 (1992)). The appellant in this appeal has not made allegations about statements or conduct by her supervisor that reflect any animus or concern about her status as an unmarried person or single mother.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the appellant correctly asserts that the administrative judge improperly weighed the evidence and concluded that she failed to nonfrivolously allege jurisdiction based on marital status discrimination. <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 329. We find the appellant's sworn statement that she did not have the performance problems asserted by the agency, taken together with her statements that she was the only single, pregnant, newly hired secretary and the only new secretary terminated are sufficient to constitute nonfrivolous allegations that her termination was based on her marital status. If proven, these facts could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Brown v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 451, 453-54 (1986) (an appellant's assertion that she was terminated because she was pregnant and the agency believed her to be "just another unwed mother" conferred jurisdiction, as it constituted a nonfrivolous allegation of marital status discrimination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because she has made a nonfrivolous allegation, the appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing at which she must support her allegation with facts that would, if not controverted, require a finding that marital status discrimination was the basis for her termination. <span class="Italic">See Stokes</span>, 761 F.2d at 686; <span class="Italic">Strausbaugh,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 305, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_175"></span>A hearing was required for an appellant who complained that she was terminated because of agency disapproval of an alleged extramarital affair. <span class="Italic">Gribben v. DOJ</span>, 55 MSPR 257, 259 (1992) (relying on <span class="Italic">Brown-Cummings v. DHHS</span>, 36 MSPR 94, 98 (1987). A hearing was required, and the burden of proof of marital status discrimination was considered, in <span class="Italic">Kiser v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 66 MSPR 372, 377-79 (1995), involving the allegation that a probationary supervisor was demoted because of a manager's distress over the appellant's alleged extramarital activities:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 761 F.2d 682 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the court explained that a probationary employee faces a two-step process in establishing Board jurisdiction over an appeal such as this one. He must first make an allegation of marital discrimination supported by factual assertions indicating that the allegation is not a <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> pleading. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 686. If the appellant makes such an allegation, he has a right to a hearing at which he must support his allegation with a showing of facts which would, if not controverted, require a finding that marital discrimination was the basis for the agency action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the appellant meets this second step requirement, dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is inappropriate, and the Board proceeds to determine the merits of the case, i.e., whether the agency has articulated and supported a nondiscriminatory reason for its action, and whether the probationary employee has shown that reason to be mere pretext. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 687.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge misapplied the above standards in at least three important respects. First, she erred in stating that the appellant would have the burden, at the jurisdictional hearing, to "show that the facts he set forth in his claim of marital status discrimination are true." The appellant's burden was instead to support his claim with evidence which would, if not controverted, require a finding that marital status discrimination was the basis for the agency action. <span class="Italic">Stokes</span>, 761 F.2d at 686.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the administrative judge erred in limiting the inquiry at the second step of the jurisdictional analysis to determining whether Van Riper made the comments attributed to her about the appellant's marital status and whether she treated an unmarried female differently than the appellant. The appellant was entitled to introduce any and all evidence that would, if not controverted, establish marital discrimination. As detailed below, such evidence would include, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, evidence tending to show that the appellant's performance was not deficient, that Van Riper did not raise concerns about the appellant's performance to his first and second-level supervisors, that she did express concern on numerous occasions about his alleged sexual liaisons, and that she did not follow ordinary agency procedures in terminating the appellant's appointment to the supervisory position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, because the appellant's burden at the second step of the <span class="Italic">Stokes</span> process is to show facts which, "<span class="Italic">if not controverted</span>," would require a finding of marital discrimination, 761 F.2d at 686 (emphasis added), the administrative judge erred in considering the affidavits and other evidence submitted by the agency in resolving controverted factual issues relating to jurisdiction.[3] <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. United States Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994) (in ruling on jurisdiction, an administrative judge may not consider the agency's evidence to resolve conflicting factual assertions). To the extent that the administrative judge weighed the evidence and made credibility findings in order to determine that the agency articulated and supported a nondiscriminatory reason for its action, she impermissibly went beyond the jurisdictional issue and ruled on the merits of the case. <span class="Italic">See Stokes</span>, 761 F.2d at 687.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note in this regard that the formulation in <span class="Italic">Stokes</span> of the appellant's burden of proof refers to the burden at a jurisdictional hearing, and the appellant waived his right to a jurisdictional hearing. Whether an appellant elects to present evidence at a hearing, or instead elects to rely on his written submissions, would not affect the burden of proof on the jurisdictional issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Edem v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 64 MSPR 501, 503-06 (1994), required a hearing on the assertion that an employee was terminated as a result of her supervisor's concerns about the state of the appellant's marriage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a timely petition for appeal with the Board's Philadelphia Regional Office, claiming that her removal was based on marital status discrimination. Specifically, she stated that Marcia Spink, her branch chief in Philadelphia, questioned her on three occasions about her relationship with her husband and children. The appellant lives in Philadelphia with her three young children and her husband, from whom she is separated, resides in New York, New York. The appellant stated that Ms. Spink wanted to know if she was still married, whether she was dating anyone and, if so, the person's name. She said Ms. Spink also asked her if her husband was still living in New York, how often he got to visit the children, and whether the appellant intended to return to New York. According to the appellant, these questions were unrelated to her work and were not part of any conversations that she initiated. She stated that she "believe[d] that Ms. Spink disapproved of my separation and living arrangements and these facts played a substantial role in the decision to terminate my employment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, which was supported by declarations by Ms. Spink and Francis Schiermeier, the deciding official for NOAA. Ms. Spink stated that she never questioned the appellant regarding her marital status, and that she did not disapprove of any aspect of the appellant's private life. She further stated that she never discussed the appellant's marital status with NOAA officials. Mr. Schiermeier stated that he at no time discussed the appellant's marital status with EPA officials and that he was unaware of her marital status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge characterized the appellant's assertions as "unsworn and unsupported," and cited <span class="Italic">Bedynek-Stumm v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 57 MSPR 176, 179 (1993), for the proposition that unsupported and unsworn assertions are insufficient to meet an appellant's burden of establishing an entitlement to a jurisdictional hearing. Further finding that sworn statements carry greater weight than unsworn statements, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant's assertions were <span class="Italic">pro forma</span>, and insufficient to entitle her to a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 686 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the court explained that a probationary employee faces a two-step process in establishing Board jurisdiction over an appeal such as this one. First, the employee must allege marital status discrimination and support the allegation with factual assertions indicating that it is not a <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> pleading. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 686. If the appellant meets this requirement by making a facially non-frivolous allegation of marital status discrimination, she has a right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Second, at the hearing, she must support her allegation with a showing of facts which would, if not controverted, require a finding that marital status discrimination was the basis for her discharge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gribben v. Department of Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 257, 259 (1992), the Board found that the administrative judge had erroneously required the appellant to satisfy the second step of the process before granting her a hearing. Gribben had alleged that the agency removed her because of an extramarital relationship with another agency employee. Among the factual assertions she made in support of this claim were the following: (1) When her supervisor learned of her extramarital relationship, he spoke to her in an abusive manner, and commented about her morals, her relationship with her children and the scandal that had been created; (2) the supervisor commented about the appellant's husband's virtuous nature, the innocence of her children, her married status, and the effect of the affair on her husband; and (3) the supervisor began to give her the "silent treatment," and made it clear that the affair had jeopardized her employment with the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 259. The Board found that these assertions constituted a non-frivolous allegation of marital status discrimination entitling her to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 259-60.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The assertions made by the appellant in the instant case are quite similar to those made in <span class="Italic">Gribben</span>. In each, the supervisor allegedly showed a keen interest in the state of the probationer's marriage, and particularly on how any marital difficulties might affect the couple's children. The only significant difference is that the supervisor in <span class="Italic">Gribben</span> allegedly "made it clear" to the probationer that her extramarital relationship had jeopardized her employment with the agency, 55 MSPR at 259, while the appellant in the instant case said she "believe[d] that Ms. Spink disapproved of my separation and living arrangements and these facts played a substantial role in the decision to terminate my employment." Although the alleged causal connection between the probationer's marital status and the decision to terminate employment is not stated as explicitly in the instant case as it was in <span class="Italic">Gribben</span>, the appellant stated a basis for her belief--the content of three alleged office conversations with Ms. Spinks. We find that the appellant made a non-frivolous allegation of marital status discrimination, not a <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> pleading.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the administrative judge erred in two respects regarding the evaluation of the parties' evidentiary submissions. First, the administrative judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">Bedynek-Stumm</span> for the proposition that unsworn statements are insufficient to establish an entitlement to a jurisdictional hearing is inapposite. Although the Board stated in <span class="Italic">Bedynek-Stumm</span> that the particular "unsupported and unsworn assertions" made in that case were insufficient to establish a right to a jurisdictional hearing, 57 MSPR at 179, it did not hold that sworn statements are essential to establishing a right to a hearing, and no such requirement exists.[4] Second, the administrative judge erred in crediting the agency's version of events over that of the appellant because the agency submitted declarations made under penalty of perjury while the appellant's statements were unsworn.[5] An administrative judge may consider an agency's documentary submissions in determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, but to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_176"></span>[4]&#x2003;Even if such a requirement existed, it would be incumbent on the administrative judge to so advise the appellant before dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Burgess v. MSPB</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue). The administrative judge did not advise the appellant that her assertions regarding jurisdiction had to be in any particular form.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The appellant claims in her petition for review that her allegations of marital status discrimination were sworn, as they were contained in an attachment to a Merit Systems Protection Board appeal form, which contains a statement that "I certify that all of the statements made in this appeal are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief." While the appeal form does contain this statement, we note that the statements therein are neither sworn under oath nor made under penalty of perjury. We further note that the certification was signed by the appellant's representative, not by the appellant personally.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Over the dissent of Member Robbins, who essentially argued the strength of the evidence, <span class="Italic">Marynowski v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 118 MSPR 321, 324-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, 2012 MSPB 82 (2012), remanded the appeal for a hearing when the appellant alleged that her probationary termination resulted from her supervisor's allegedly excessive interest in aspects of the appellant's marriage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her claim that her termination was based on marital status discrimination, the appellant made the following factual allegations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">7. When Appellant's Supervisor, and Appellant were alone she always commented on how Appellant was dressed and how her clothes and appearance would please Appellant's husband. This was inappropriate and made Appellant very uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">8. Before Appellant's husband arrived at the base, Ms. Nwuzor would often say things to Appellant like "when you husband gets here, you need to be sure and dress in something that he will notice or something that you know he will like."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">9. After Appellant's husband arrived at the base, Ms. Nwuzor would say to Appellant "do you need to get home to that husband of yours?," or she would say "don't be distracted from work because you are thinking of getting home to your husband."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">10. Ms. Nwuzor commented numerous times on the perfume Appellant was wearing and said "I'll bet that husband of yours really likes that perfume."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">11. Ms. Nwuzor never said these things to Appellant when someone else was around--it was only when it was the two of them. Her comments made Appellant very uncomfortable, because she felt like she was "coming on to Appellant," particularly before her husband arrived at the base.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">12. It appears that Ms. Nwuzor was jealous of Appellant because Appellant had a husband and Ms. Nwuzor was single, as Ms. Nwuzor discussed Appellant's marital status constantly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">13. When Appellant first began work there, Ms. Nwuzor wouldn't take the time to train Appellant, yet when nobody was around except Appellant and [sic] Ms. Nwuzor always took the time away from work to discuss Appellant's clothing, Appellant's jewelry or Appellant['s] perfume, and how it would please her husband.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">14. Ms. Nwuzor was focused on Appellant['s] marriage and she was the person who recommended Appellant's termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To make a nonfrivolous allegation of marital status discrimination, an appellant must allege facts which, taken as true, would show that she was treated differently because of her marital status or facts that go to the essence of her status as married, single, or divorced. <span class="Italic">See Qatsha v. Department of Defense</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 121, &#x00B6; 7 (2000). The appellant's allegations, taken as true, indicate that Ms. Nwuzor took a keen interest in the state of the probationer's marital status. <span class="Italic">See Strausbaugh v. Government Printing Office</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 305, &#x00B6; 8 (2009); <span class="Italic">Edem v. Department of Commerce</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 501, 504 (1994). Furthermore, by alleging that Ms. Nwuzor, who recommended the appellant's termination, was jealous that the appellant had a husband, and that her fixation on the appellant's marital status caused her to lose training opportunities, the appellant stated a basis for her belief that there was a causal connection between her marital status and her termination. <span class="Italic">See Strausbaugh</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 304, &#x00B6; 8 (appellant alleged he was terminated for bringing his fianc&#x00E9;e to an official agency function in violation of rules which allegedly limited participation to immediate family members); <span class="Italic">Edem</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 505 (appellant alleged that she believed her supervisor's disapproval of her separation and living arrangements played a substantial role in her termination). Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, and is therefore entitled to a jurisdictional hearing at which she must prove her claim of marital status discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Burton</span>, 2012 MSPB 73, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISSENTING OPINION OF MEMBER MARK A. ROBBINS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I agree with my colleagues' discussion and application of <span class="Italic">Burton v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 2012 MSPB 73. I also agree that the appellant did not non-frivolously allege that the termination of her appointment during her probationary period constituted discrimination for partisan political reasons. I do not agree, however, that the appellant has non-frivolously alleged marital status discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency terminated the appellant's appointment during her probationary period on the ground that she had: Missed seven scheduled meetings that she was expected to attend; recommended discharging a "severely handicapped student" without following proper procedures; wanted to discharge another student who was "in great need" of her services; was tardy in completing her "CAF file"; failed to complete her "sponsorship" and her "HIPPA training"; and had been the subject of "complaints from schools regarding lack of communication, lack of seeing [her] students and the quality of [her occupational therapy] services." As noted by the administrative judge, the appellant does not deny the allegations in the termination notice. She also does not contend that the agency has retained non-married probationers with performance deficiencies similar to hers, nor does she make any other allegation that, if proven, would permit an inference that the agency's reasons for terminating her appointment were a pretext for marital status discrimination. Although the appellant alleges generally that she performed well and that the families she worked with liked her, these are conclusory statements that do not contradict any of the legitimate non-discriminatory reasons in the termination notice. Likewise, the appellant's allegation that her supervisor did not observe enough of her work to criticize her performance, does not contradict the legitimate non-discriminatory reasons in the termination notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's supervisor's alleged comments about the appellant's husband were inappropriate. Nevertheless, such comments are at best weak circumstantial evidence of a discriminatory attitude, and standing alone they do not support an inference that the agency's numerous, unrebutted non-discriminatory reasons for terminating the appellant's appointment were a pretext for marital status discrimination. <span class="Italic">See McClintock v. Veterans Administration</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 475, 478 (1981) (a probationer's appeal was properly dismissed because she did not present sufficient evidence from which it could be inferred that the agency's legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for terminating her appointment were a pretext for marital status discrimination). The appellant's supervisor's alleged comments are not direct evidence of discrimination making this a mixed motive case, as the alleged comments do not "bear directly on the contested employment decision." <span class="Italic">George v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 71, 80 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, I would not remand this appeal for further proceedings but instead would affirm the administrative judge's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Strausbaugh v. GPO</span>, 111 MSPR 305, 306-09 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-9, 2009 MSPB 89 (2009) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Strausbaugh v. GPO</span>, AT-315H-09-0034-B-3 (NP 3/5/2012) (concluding there was no jurisdiction)), resulted in a remand based on a nonfrivolous assertion that a supervisor's concerns about the appellant's marital status led to his probationary termination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In his response, the appellant claimed, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that his supervisor, David Spiers, made derogatory comments concerning his marital status and excluded his fianc&#x00E9; and child from an official function on the ground that he was not married to his fianc&#x00E9;, and that the supervisor told him that he wouldn't be having "these problems" if he were married.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge thereafter dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction without conducting a hearing, finding that the appellant presented virtually "no evidence...of a bias based on marital status," that the appellant's exclusion from the official function "evidence[d] only that the appellant's supervisor enforced...what he considered to be a rule," that fianc&#x00E9;es were not family members "for most governmental purposes," that there was "seemingly no connection between the [official function] and the appellant's termination," and that the appellant therefore had not made a nonfrivolous claim of marital status discrimination.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The assertions made by the appellant in the instant case are comparable to those made in <span class="Italic">Gribben.</span> In each, the supervisor allegedly showed a keen interest in the state of the probationer's marital status. The supervisor in <span class="Italic">Gribben</span> allegedly "made it clear" to the probationer that her extramarital relationship had jeopardized her employment with the agency, 55 M.S.P.R. at 259, while the appellant in the instant case alleged that his supervisor, Spiers, told him that "[i]f you were married to your fianc&#x00E9;e instead of living with her you would not be having these problems," which he claims "turned out to be a reference to losing his job." Further, the appellant alleged that Spiers made "[d]erogatory statements...regarding [his] marital status"; that "[w]hen [he] asked for family leave to take care of his 3 year old child, he was told...that 'if you were married she could do that'"; that "management officials asked questions regarding [his] living with a woman and having a baby but not being married to her"; and that Spiers, "after telling [him] that he could bring his spouse and 3 year old child with him to [an official function] .... fired him for bringing his companion (the mother of his child with whom he had been living for the past 13 years)...." In addition, the appellant asserts that his termination notice includes only one reason for his separation, i.e., that he violated rules which allegedly limited participation in the official function to "immediate family members"; and he alleges that his "fianc&#x00E9;e was the real object of the termination action because she did not fit the description of spouse." Thus, the appellant has stated a basis for his belief that there was a causal connection between his marital status and the decision to terminate his employment. <span class="Italic">See also Edem v. Department of Commerce</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 501, 504-505 (1994) (the appellant's assertion that conversations in which her supervisor allegedly showed a keen interest in the state of her marriage, and in the manner in which any marital difficulties might affect her children, constituted a nonfrivolous allegation of marital status discrimination). The appellant's allegations constitute nonfrivolous allegations of marital status discrimination, rather than a mere <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> pleading. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 505; <span class="Italic">Gribben,</span> 55 M.S.P.R. at 259-60.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find further that the administrative judge misapplied the above standards by dismissing this appeal for lack of evidence that the appellant's termination was the result of marital status discrimination. As stated above, proof is not necessary at this stage of the proceedings, where the appellant need only make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction to obtain a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Stokes,</span> 761 F.2d at 686.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ellis v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 81 MSPR 6, 9-11 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-14 (1999), suggested that the Board may consider the appeal of a probationer (or first year appointee under the Veterans Readjustment Act) who asserts that his termination resulted from sexual discrimination or sexual harassment (reprisal for rejection of sexual advances) that was linked to the appellant's marital status (a single, unattached male):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where "allegations of marital status discrimination and sex discrimination are so intertwined that no meaningful finding as to one can be made without consideration of the other," the Board's scope of review must not be narrowed solely to the marital status discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">Uriarte v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 6 MSPB 334, 6 MSPR 393, 395 (1981). Rather, in such circumstances, the "allegations that the action had been based upon [the appellant's] marital status and upon sex discrimination must be examined together." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the present case, we find that the appellant's allegations present claims of marital status discrimination and sex discrimination so intertwined that a meaningful finding on one cannot be made without consideration of the other, and that accordingly, the appeal must be remanded for a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Edem v. Department of Commerce</span>, 64 MSPR 501, 504 (1994), the Board found that the appellant had made nonfrivolous allegations of marital status discrimination entitling her to a hearing because her allegations, if proven, could have supported the inference that her termination was linked to her supervisor's "keen interest in the state of [her] marriage." <span class="Italic">See also Gribben v. Department of Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 257, 259 (1992). So-called "<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>" sexual harassment, which is a form of sex discrimination, occurs when "sexual demands are made by a supervisor to a subordinate in exchange for career advantages or under threats of adverse job consequences." <span class="Italic">Downes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 775 F.2d 288, 290 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's allegations contain closely-related elements of marital status discrimination and <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment. He alleges that his supervisor took an interest in his single status, that she subjected him to sexually suggestive touches, looks, and gestures, that she implied that he could advance his career if he began a sexual relationship with her, that she did not scrutinize the behavior of married employees the way she scrutinized his behavior, and that she paid particularly close attention to his interactions with other women because of his unmarried and "available" status. It was those interactions with female passengers and airline representatives that allegedly led to Ms. Thornton's reports about the appellant's behavior. While the appellant may have behaved improperly with female passengers and airline representatives, the appellant may be able to show, as he asserts, that his interactions with female passengers and airline representatives were proper and that Thornton singled him out for "observation" and interpreted his actions as improper because he was single. As the appellant contends, it may be that Thornton viewed what may have been entirely proper interactions with other females as improper because of her alleged "sexual interest" in him as an unmarried man, and that she may have reported those contacts as improper because of her alleged vindictiveness toward him after he refused her purported sexual overtures. On this point, we note that although the appellant was appointed to his position on March 31, 1997, the termination notice mentions no instances of improper behavior by the appellant between that date and late November 1997 when Thornton became his supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellants allegations were similar to the ones at issue in <span class="Italic">Flores v. Farmers Home Administration</span>, 10 MSPB 808, 12 MSPR 286, 287 (1982), where the appellant claimed that "she was fired because her employer expected 'some type of social relationship' with her and that though she wasn't married she had a boyfriend and refused." The Board in Flores summarily found no right to a jurisdictional hearing because "[s]ocial relationships can occur between employees and supervisors <span class="Italic">regardless</span> of their marital status," and the appellant did not allege sufficient facts to make nonfrivolous allegations that the purported expectations of her supervisor were based on her marital status. 10 MSPB 808, 12 MSPR at 287 (emphasis added). The Board in <span class="Italic">Flores</span> did not discuss a situation such as the one presented here, where there are detailed, interrelated allegations of marital status discrimination and sexual harassment. Thus, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Flores</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts alleged here are also distinguishable from the facts alleged in <span class="Italic">Bedynek-Stumm v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 57 MSPR 176 (1993), another case on which the administrative judge relied. In <span class="Italic">Bedynek-Stumm</span> the appellant made unsworn and unsupported statements that "a female coworker disliked him, and therefore harassed him, because he [was] single." 57 MSPR at 179. The Board found that the appellant was not entitled to a hearing because "the factual assertions he made to support his contention all regard disputes over work-related matters, and [were] completely unrelated to his marital status except for his conjectures that this coworker sought to dominate him because of her negative feelings toward him as an unmarried male." 57 MSPR at 179. Here, the appellant has provided details regarding the alleged interest in him by Thornton, including specific assertions that Inspector Watson also observed Thornton singling the appellant out for attention and knew of Thornton's interest in the appellant as an unmarried man. We find that, unlike the contentions in <span class="Italic">Bedynek-Stumm</span>, the appellant's assertions are more than mere conjecture. <span class="Italic">Cf. Paine v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 32 MSPR 135, 137 (1987) (the appellant was entitled to a hearing on the issue of marital status discrimination where she premised her discrimination allegation on the assertion that the agency treated her differently because she was a divorced single parent, when it overlooked more serious acts of misconduct and performance deficiencies by its married employees).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we cannot say, on this record, that the appellant's termination was based on his marital status. We find that under <span class="Italic">Uriarte,</span> the appellant <span id="Page_178"></span>has made nonfrivolous, intertwined allegations of marital status discrimination and <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment entitling him to a hearing. On remand, the appellant shall be allowed to introduce such argument and evidence on the issue of sex discrimination as may be relevant to his claim of marital status discrimination. The ultimate factual issues that the AJ must resolve are 1) whether the agency terminated the appellant "based on...[his] marital status," 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.806(b), that is, whether he was "exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which [married employees] were not exposed," <span class="Italic">cf. Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services,</span> 523 U.S. 75, __, 118 S. Ct. 998, 1002, 140 L. Ed.2d 201 (1998) (the ultimate question in a sex discrimination case is whether the claimant was "exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed"), and 2) whether any discrimination that is found to have occurred goes to the basic nature of the appellant's marital status.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit interpreted <span class="Italic">Ellis,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> to mean that "where allegations of marital status discrimination and sex discrimination are so intertwined that no meaningful finding as to one can be made without consideration of the other, the Board must review both." <span class="Italic">Garcia v. VA</span>, 173 Fed. Appx. 830, 831 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Conclusory assertions centering on sexual orientation did not establish marital status discrimination jurisdiction over a probationer's termination, <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> CH-315H-10-0574-I-1 (NP 9/8/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only issue presented by this appeal is whether the appellant non-frivolously alleged that his termination was due to his marital status or for partisan political reasons. At the outset, we note the overwhelming majority of the appellant's allegations pertain to discrimination based upon sexual orientation, such as his supervisor's purported belief that he did not "act as a man should." But the Board has no independent jurisdiction to consider such discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hurston</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 34, &#x00B6; 11. The appellant bases his claim that his termination was due to his marital status or for partisan political reasons on two narrow allegations: (1) That his supervisor "did not believe that any homosexual person should ever be a Republican"; and (2) that his supervisor "assumed" he was single because he was gay, but she also knew he was not romantically available to her because he was gay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These conclusory allegations, however, do not suggest that the appellant's termination was due to his marital status or for partisan political reasons. <span class="Italic">See Strausbaugh v. Government Printing Office</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 305, &#x00B6; 6 (2009) (the appellant's allegations must be supported with factual assertions to show the appellant is not presenting a mere <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> pleading). Therefore, the appellant has not shown that the administrative judge erred on a matter of law in dismissing this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Ustariz v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, AT-315H-17-0316-I-1., n.5 (NP 6/9/2022) ("To make a nonfrivolous allegation of marital status discrimination, an appellant 'may allege facts to show that she was treated differently because of her marital status or that go to the essence of her status as a married, single or divorced person.' <span class="Italic">Smirne v.

Here, the appellant alleges that, during a training class in late October 2016, the Acting Manager displayed her Designation of Beneficiary form on the wall in front of the entire class, which named her sister as her sole beneficiary. According to the appellant, because the Designation of Beneficiary form named her sister as her sole beneficiary, it was 'made obvious that [she] was either single or divorced.' The appellant's allegation that the Acting Manager became aware that she was single or divorced in October 2016 is insufficient to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that another agency official imposed her termination 4 months later on the basis of marital status discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Smirne</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 51, &#x00B6; 8."); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. MSPB</span>, 495 Fed. Appx. 68, 71 n.1 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board had jurisdiction over a probationer's claim that his removal was discriminatory because married employees who engaged in specific misconduct were not disciplined. <span class="Italic">Ward v.

On review, Ward's allegations that he was removed as a probationer, while married employees with employment difficulties were retained, were insufficient to reverse the removal. The deciding official was unaware of the marital status of the employee. Other evidence showed that employees were not immune from discipline because of their marital status. <span class="Italic">Ward v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3047).

<p class="Body-Text">Marital status discrimination is not implicated by an employee's allegation that she was fired during her probationary period because her supervisor disapproved of her fianc&#x00E9;s' visit to her at agency-located housing quarters. <span class="Italic">Yakupzack v.
