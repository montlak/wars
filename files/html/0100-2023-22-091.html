<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-91"><span class="space">g.</span> Hourly Rate; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Pro Bono</span></span> or Contingent Representation; COLA; Expenses</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The reasonableness of fees claimed was evaluated in <span class="Italic">Gavette v. OPM</span>, 788 F.2d 753, 754 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Two issues were considered: the hourly rate and the reasonableness of the time invested. As to the rate, 28 USC 2412(d)(2)(A) set a $75 [now $125] cap "unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved justifies a higher fee." Gavette's counsel claimed $100 per hour and supported his claim with an affidavit stating that there was a limited availability of counsel in Detroit skilled in Board work. The court resolved the issue by noting:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Respondents challenge the claim for the increased rate, only by an unsworn statement, to the effect that petitioner has made no showing that the unavailability of counsel justifies an increase in the rate of $75 per hour. Consequently, we find that the respondents' objection is insufficient to prevail against the attorney's affidavit and that petitioner is entitled to recover attorney fees at the hourly rate of $100.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court went on to determine the reasonableness of the time invested, observing that <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 434 (1983), requires that excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary hours be excluded from counsel fee requests. The court disallowed 98 hours, including time that was apparently spent on a tentative EEO claim. Fees of $14,863 were awarded.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some clarification regarding EAJA ratemaking arrived with <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Underwood</span>, 108 S. Ct. 2541, 2553-54 (1988). The Court said of adjustment of the statutory fee cap:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If "the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved" meant merely that lawyers skilled and experienced enough to try the case are in short supply, it would effectively eliminate the $75 cap--since the "prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished" are obviously <span class="Italic">determined</span> by the relative supply of that kind and quality of services. "Limited availability" so interpreted would not be a "special factor," but a factor virtually always present when services with a market rate of more than $75 have been provided. We do not think Congress meant that if the rates for all lawyers in the relevant city--or even in the entire country--came to exceed $75 per hour (adjusted for inflation), then that market-minimum rate will govern instead of the statutory gap. To the contrary, the "special factor" formulation suggests Congress thought that $75 an hour was generally quite enough public reimbursement for lawyers' fees, whatever the local or national market might be. If that is to be so, the exception for "limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved" must refer to attorneys "qualified for the proceedings" in some specialized sense, rather than just in their general legal competence. We think it refers to attorneys having some distinctive knowledge or specialized skill needful for the litigation in question--as opposed to an extraordinary level of general lawyerly knowledge and ability useful in all litigation. Examples of the former would be an identifiable practice specialty such as patent law, or knowledge of foreign law or language. Where such qualifications are necessary and can be obtained only at rates in excess of the $75 cap, reimbursement above that limit is allowed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the same reason of the need to preserve the intended effectiveness of the $75 cap, we think the other "special factors" envisioned by the exception must be such as are not of broad and general application. We need not specify what they might be, but they include nothing relied upon by the District Court in this case. The "novelty and difficulty of issues," the "undesirability of the case," the "work and ability of counsel," and "the results obtained"...are factors applicable to a broad spectrum of litigation; they are little more than routine reasons why market rates are what they are. The factor of "customary fees and awards in other cases,"...is even worse; it is not even a routine reason for market rates, but rather a description of market rates....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4627"></span>The final factor considered by the District Court, "the contingent nature of the fee," is also too generally applicable to be regarded as a "special" reason for exceeding the statutory cap.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit offered its interpretation of the fee cap adjustment and other provisions of the Act in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. GSA</span>, 924 F.2d 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1991). First, the Federal Circuit determined that it is not a precondition of EAJA that the client be obliged to pay fees. Second, as to the cost of living adjustment, the Federal Circuit decided that the adjustment should be from the date of the statutory reenactment to the date that services were provided. Other circuits applied a rule that would allow the adjustment from the date of the statute to the date services are actually paid for by the defendant. Third, as to enhancement for expertise of counsel, the court found no need to adjust the rate upward to attract practitioners among the civil service bar. No explanation of that conclusion was provided. Perhaps due to the number of cases it receives, the court feels there is a surplus, not a shortage, of attorneys who specialize in the work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Raines v. Shalala</span>, 44 F.3d 1355, 1357-61 (7th Cir. 1995) (Social Security expertise did not qualify for EAJA enhancement; enhancement could follow an identifiable practice specialty not easily acquired by a reasonably competent attorney or special nonlegal skills such as knowledge of a foreign language).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the ability of counsel to obtain fees under EAJA without an obligation of the client to pay those fees, <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> determined, 924 F.2d at 1582-83:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States further argues that Phillips is only entitled to $2,500 in attorney fees because that is all she has paid, or is obligated to pay, to her attorney. The EAJA provides for the payment to a prevailing party of "fees and other expenses...<span class="Italic">incurred</span> by that party." (Emphasis added.) The question is whether Phillips incurred additional legal fees within the meaning of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his affidavit submitted with the application for attorney fees, Phillips' attorney described the fee arrangement as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]&#x2003;decided to take the case on a contingency. She was to pay me $2500 of her back pay for the appeal and I was to charge her no more. The recovery would then be contingent upon success, recovery to be based upon a statutory fee award if we prevailed. We kept bookkeeping entries of my time, but once the $2500 was paid by the client, she was not responsible for further payment of our charges and no further payment was made by her during the course of the litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the statute requires, any fee award is made to the "prevailing party," not the attorney. Thus, Phillips' attorney could not directly claim or be entitled to the award. It had to be requested on behalf of the party. With this predicate, we construe the fee arrangement between Phillips and her attorney to mean that if an award of attorney fees is obtained on her behalf she is obligated to turn it over to her attorney. In this sense, Phillips incurs the attorney fees that may be awarded her. On the other hand, if no fee award is made to her, she does not have any obligation to pay any further fees to her attorney from her own resources. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Ass'n of Retired Persons v. EEOC</span>, 873 F.2d 402, 406 (D.C. Cir. 1989). Inherent in the agreement is an intention on the part of Ms. Phillips to be obligated to her counsel for fees properly obtainable under the statute. Moreover, the policy of the statute is to pay non-enhanced fees for legal services actually rendered. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cornella v. Schweiker</span>, 728 F.2d 978, 985-87 (8th Cir. 1984).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;This is consistent with cases in which EAJA fees have been awarded to parties who have been represented on a <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> basis. <span class="Italic">Cornella v. Schweiker</span>, 728 F.2d at 985-87. It is also consistent with our decision in <span class="Italic">Devine v. National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 805 F.2d 384 (Fed. Cir. 1986), permitting fees to be recovered under the EAJA when an employee is represented under a prepaid legal service plan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of whether fees can be awarded under the EAJA where they have not been incurred was expressly reserved in our <span class="Italic">in banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Gavette</span>, 808 F.2d at 1461 n.25. In an earlier case, however, a panel of this court observed with respect to fees under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g) that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board has held that lawyer's fees are "incurred by an employee" if they are incurred in his behalf, even though he does not pay them. <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Department of Interior</span>, 2 MSPB 604 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Goodrich v. Department of the Navy</span>, 733 F.2d 1578, 1579 (1984). Further, we hold that to be "incurred" within the meaning of a fee shifting statute, there must also be an express or implied agreement that the fee award will be paid over to the legal representative.[5] The statute does not contemplate that a fee award may be made to a party to be retained. Thus, we have held in an analogous situation that a party acting <span class="Italic">pro se</span> is not entitled to an attorney fee award. <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Department of Transp.</span>, 845 F.2d 976 (Fed. Cir. 1988). We therefore conclude that Phillips incurred attorney fees within the meaning of the EAJA only in such amount as may be awarded to her. The amount of the fee award for services before this court, and whether enhancement should be allowed, will now be considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;If the party seeking legal fees is obligated to pay them to a third party which is not the professional providing the legal service, an award under EAJA has been deemed inappropriate. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Wall Indus., Inc. v. U.S.</span>, 15 Cl. Ct. 796 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd without opinion</span>, 883 F.2d 1027 (Fed. Cir. 1989), the plaintiff had a settlement agreement with its accounting firm whereby the firm paid for all litigation expenses, controlled the litigation, and would collect any money that resulted from the litigation. The Claims Court ruled that the accounting firm, which did not meet the financial requirements of the EAJA, was the real party in interest, and that fees were not incurred by plaintiff. A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Securities and Exch. Comm'n v. Comserv Corp.</span>, 908 F.2d 1407 (8th Cir. 1990), where the court found that petitioner had not incurred any fees because his legal expenses were provided for in an insurance policy carried by his employer.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also touched on in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> was the manner of calculation of the cost of living adjustment under EAJA. The court did not provide its reasoning, but the result was clear, 924 F.2d at 1583:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EAJA contains a $75 per hour limitation on attorney fees "unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee." 28 USC 2412(d)(2)(A). The rates per hour claimed by Phillips, prior to any consideration of cost of living increases or enhancement for special factors, all exceed the $75 per hour "cap." The statute, however, constrains us to a lodestar award of $75 per hour, increased only by the cost of living adjustment. We therefore hold that Phillips is entitled to attorney fees under EAJA in a lodestar amount determined by multiplying the hours set forth above by the statutory rate increased to reflect the cost of living increase from the effective date of the passage of the EAJA to the date the services were performed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">From the perspective of counsel, the third significant point concerning EAJA made by <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> was the court's disinclination to enhance a fee to recognize the specialization of counsel, 924 F.2d at 1583-84:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Phillips further contends that the lodestar fees should be enhanced for special factors. Principally she argues that the contingency arrangement for fees warrants enhancement because of the difference in market treatment of contingent fee cases as a class, including particularly employment cases, and because of the difficulty encountered by individuals in obtaining representation in employment cases when they cannot pay fully for the services. This argument is grounded on <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens Council for Clean Air</span>, 483 U.S. 711 (1987), involving attorney fees under the Clean Air Act, 42 USC 7604(d)). In the concurring opinion of Justice O'Connor, the difference in market treatment of contingent fee cases as a class was cited as a basis for enhancement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Phillips' argument fails to take into account the limits placed on the EAJA's reimbursement of contingency fee agreements by the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Underwood</span>, 487 U.S. 552 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Pierce</span>, the Court stated that "the contingent nature of the fee is also too generally applicable to be regarded as a 'special' reason for exceeding the statutory cap." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 573. The Court distinguished the statutory scheme in <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span> from the EAJA and held that it was inapplicable to an EAJA award:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The issue is quite different from the question of contingent-fee enhancement that we faced last Term, in <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air</span>, 483 U.S. 711 (1987)....&#8197;The EAJA differs from the sort of statutory scheme at issue there, not only because it contains this "special factor" requirement, but more fundamentally because it is not designed to reimburse reasonable fees without limit. Once the $75 cap is exceeded, neither the client paying a reasonable hourly fee nor the client paying a reasonable contingent fee is fully compensated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Pierce</span>, the Supreme Court also rejected as "special factors" (1) the limited availability of attorneys with an extraordinary level of general lawyerly knowledge and ability useful in all litigation, (2) the novelty and difficulty of the issues, (3) the work and ability of counsel, and (4) the results obtained, because all of these factors are applicable to a broad spectrum of litigation and thus are considered to be covered by the baseline statutory rate of $75 per hour, plus a cost of living increase....&#8197;Even if we accept Phillips' claim that attorneys are often unwilling to work at an hourly rate on cases before the MSPB (caused at least in part by the frequency of nonpayment by clients), it falls short of being a "special factor" covered by the EAJA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court, in <span class="Italic">Pierce</span>, concluded that Congress did not intend EAJA to completely cover attorney fees. "To the contrary, the 'special factor' formulation suggests Congress thought that $75 an hour was generally quite enough public reimbursement for lawyers' fees, whatever the local or national market might be." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 572....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit again declined to adjust fees under EAJA due to shortage of specialized counsel, <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 92-3083):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4628"></span>Petitioner argues that there is limited availability of attorneys qualified in federal employment law in Fort Collins, Colorado. Although this was not the simple, readily won case in which the respondent now casts it, the Supreme Court's view as expressed in <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Underwood</span>, 487 U.S. 552, 572 (1988) weighs against upward adjustment absent extraordinary considerations. Thus we decline to authorized an increased maximum rate on this ground.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the statutory cap of $75 per hour, which was first set in 1981, may be adjusted for inflation in accordance with 28 USC 2412(d)(2)(A). Such adjustment is appropriate in this case. Applying the figures provided by respondent, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the maximum hourly rate for the 1991 billings shall be $117 and for the 1992 billings shall be $119....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The explanation by the Federal Circuit of when a petitioner may recover EAJA fees following representation by counsel employed through a contingency agreement was slightly expanded in a case involving recovery of a cost of living adjustment, <span class="Italic">Knight v. United States</span>, 982 F.2d 1573, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1993), illustrating the need for precise wording in contingency agreements that may later be relied on to support EAJA recovery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Knight has "incurred" no attorney fees for the district court litigation. Foster Pepper was retained on a contingent fee basis, the amount of which accrued and was fixed before the suit. Although the "administrative attorney fees" sought as the object of the district court litigation are included within the "Claim" subject to Foster Pepper's 25 percent charge, our disposition of the case leaves no basis upon which such fees may be awarded. Thus the fees "incurred" by Knight in connection with the district court litigation are twenty-five percent of nothing--in other words, nothing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Phillips v. General Services Administration</span>, 924 F.2d 1577, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1991) ("In this sense, Phillips incurs the attorney fees that may be awarded her. On the other hand, if no fee award is made to her, she does not have any obligation to pay any further fees to her attorney from her own resources.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ed A. Wilson, Inc. v. GSA</span>, 126 F.3d 1406, 1408-09 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (noting, with approval, cases awarding EAJA fees when the prevailing party was represented by a legal services organization, by counsel appearing <span class="Italic">pro bono</span>, and by counsel represented by a salaried union counsel despite the absence of an obligation of the union employee to pay counsel)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If EAJA is used by union counsel to obtain recovery of fees, the $125 [formerly $75] "cap" applies up to the actual cost of the salaries of union counsel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Devine v. NTEU</span>, 805 F.2d 384 (Fed. Cir. 1986). [The result could be different under current law; refer later in this chapter to hourly rate determinations under "<a href="0100-2023-22-103.html#sec15-103">Union Counsel</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For a time it seemed that the COLA provisions of EAJA could take inflation into account. It was determined that hourly rates under EAJA may, under some circumstances, be increased to reflect the loss of value of an award that would otherwise result from the passage of time during litigation. <span class="Italic">Oliveira v. United States</span>, 827 F.2d 735, 742 (Fed. Cir. 1987), on appeal from a Claims Court decision reviewing a pre-Reform Act dismissal, observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Claims Court correctly recognized that it had discretion to adjust upward the statutory hourly rate for attorney fee awards pursuant to the EAJA. One significant factor that courts have considered in evaluating a prevailing party's request for an increase in the $75 statutory hourly rate set forth by the EAJA is whether the length of time that a prevailing party has been litigating the cause of action is such that the statutory rate must be adjusted for inflation. Nevertheless, such an increase is not automatic. Although litigation delays of 4 to 5 years have been considered by courts to provide a basis to increase the statutory fees rate, it is recognized that a minimal delay may properly be ignored.[23]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[23]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See National Ass'n of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense,</span> 675 F.2d 1319, 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A subsequent decision deflated the inflation adjustment approach and conservatively applied the COLA portion of the fee cap provision of EAJA, <span class="Italic">Chiu v. United States</span>, 948 F.2d 711, 718-19 (Fed. Cir. 1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government next argues that even if Chiu is entitled to attorney fees under the EAJA, the Claims Court erred in its determination of the amount of such fees. Specifically, the government contests the hourly rate of $102.73 used by the Claims Court to compute the fee award. The EAJA sets the hourly rate for attorney fee awards at $75 and permits upward adjustments to this figure in two circumstances; for increases in the "cost of living" and where "special factors" are found to exist:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;For the purposes of this subsection--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;"fees and other expenses" includes...reasonable attorney fees (The amount of fees awarded under this subsection shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, except that...attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of $75 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">28 USC 2412(d)(2)(A). The government's disagreement with the Claims Court's determination of the applicable hourly rate centers on the upward adjustment made to reflect increases in the cost of living during the litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To adjust the base rate of $75 per hour for increases in the cost of living as provided by the EAJA, the court must first set a base date from which increases in the cost of living may be calculated. While the government once advanced the date of reenactment of the EAJA in 1985 as the base date in case after case, it now appears to have accepted that the original date of enactment of the statute, October 1, 1981, is the appropriate starting date....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next step for computing a COLA to the fee rate is establishing the end date or dates. The Claims Court used a single end date, namely the date judgment was entered granting the EAJA fee award, June 28, 1989. The government takes issue with use of that date, which is particularly significant here inasmuch as the attorney's services were in large part performed much earlier. The government's position is that any COLA after the date the attorney's services are rendered, i.e., post-performance, constitutes an award for delay in receipt of fee reimbursement. Per the government, such adjustment contravenes the no-interest rule reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. Shaw</span>, 478 U.S. 310, 106 S. Ct. 2957, 92 L. Ed.2d 250 (1986). We agree. The EAJA does not authorize increases to the hourly rate in the nature of interest payments. Further, the no-interest rule obtains here to limit the COLA to the date on which legal services were performed and fees thereby incurred.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The COLA issue was again addressed, suggesting a conservative approach to application of COLAs over a period of time, <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. United States</span>, 480 F.3d 1327, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government contends that the Court of Federal Claims erroneously determined the amount by which the statutory maximum hourly rate of $75 was increased to reflect increases in the cost of living, as the statute authorizes. The trial court calculated the hourly rate as $153.18 by multiplying the statutory rate of $75 by 2.04. The latter figure reflected the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April 2003 of $197.31, divided by the Consumer Price Index for October 1981 of 96.6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that the effect of this calculation was improperly to award interest without Congressional authority to do so. The government relies upon <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. Shaw,</span> 478 U.S. 310, 314 (1986), and <span class="Italic">Chiu v. United States,</span> 948 F.2d 711, 719-20 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The trial court properly used the CPI of October 1, 1981 as the starting point for its calculation. <span class="Italic">Chiu,</span> 948 F.2d at 718. Although this case was tried in 1996 and most of the attorney fees presumably were incurred and paid in that year or before, the court's use of the higher April 2003 CPI increased the attorney fees beyond what was actually incurred in 1996--an increase the government states in its brief amounted to approximately $15,000. The effect of using the CPI for 2003, whose only connection with the fees was that that was the year in which the fee award was made, was to compensate for the delay in Hubbard's receiving the attorney fees, which constitutes the award of interest on the fee that had been earned earlier. <span class="Italic">Chiu,</span> 948 F.2d at 719-20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In denying the government's motion to reconsider the fee award on this ground, the trial court stated that the Equal Access to Justice Act "is silent as to applying cost of living adjustments when awarding litigation costs and fees. In light of this, the Court acted within its discretion in applying the CPI for April 2003." Although the award of attorney's fees lies within the discretion of the trial court, that discretion does not authorize the court to award prejudgment interest against the United States. In recalculating the attorney fees on remand, the trial court should take this principle into account. Although it may be difficult, or even impossible, to determine the particular year in which particular portions of the fees were earned, that does not justify the court's failure to directly address the problem. The court may be able to do no more than make a rough approximation of when various portions of the fees were earned but it is clear that they all were earned before 2003.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Starry Associates, Inc. v. United States</span>, 892 F.3d 1372, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2018) ("Agency misconduct, even if egregious, does not bear any nexus to the reasonable hourly rate an attorney might charge in litigation, and, thus, cannot 'justify' awarding fees at a rate above $125 per hour.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the subject of COLAs, the courts look to cost of living indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Bureau's Consumer Price Index is published annually and updated monthly. Figures may be obtained by checking the Bureau website at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm">http://www.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm</a>. The Federal Circuit utilized figures from the index in <span class="Italic">Bivens v. Dept. of Navy</span>, No. 90-3212 (Order of April 8, 1991, granting "motion to accept formula for calculating the cost of living factor"). Litigation in other circuits has resulted in challenges to the application of the COLA provisions of EAJA. In the D.C. Circuit, for example, the COLA is calculated separately for each year that services are provided, instead of allowing the calculation and application of a single enhanced rate for all work performed from 1981 until the year the court awards fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Masonry Masters, Inc. v. Nelson</span>, 105 F.3d 708, 711-12 (D.C. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Phillips <span id="Page_4629"></span>v. GSA</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Courts may adopt schedules for the adjustment of EAJA rates, as for example in the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000039">http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000039</a> ($179.51 per hour for 2011). <span class="Italic">Parrott v. Shulkin</span>, 851 F.3d 1242 (Fed. Cir. 2017), favored a COLA adjustment based on local rather than national consumer price index figures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court noted in <span class="Italic">Gavette v. OPM</span>, 808 F.2d 1456 (Fed. Cir. 1986), that EAJA permits recovery of expenses, a departure from the practice under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 699 F.2d 1140, 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("Under the EAJA, 'costs' and 'fees and other expenses' are expressly authorized, but under different subsections and different standards."). In a case arising out of a contract claim heard by the Claims Court and then the Federal Circuit, the court concluded that expert or "consultant" fees could not be recovered under EAJA if those fees were incurred in administrative proceedings leading to judicial review. Additionally, recovery of fees charged for law clerks may not exceed the statutory cap of $125; a COLA is reserved for fees of "counsel." If the prevailing market fees of counsel are at or below $125 [formerly $75] per hour, a COLA will not be applied. <span class="Italic">Levernier Construction, Inc. v. United States</span>, 947 F.2d 497, 503 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Payments for assistance of paralegals are recoverable under EAJA as expenses, not as attorney fees, meaning paralegal services are not compensable at market rates. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Richlin Security Service Co. v. Chertoff,</span> 482 F.3d 1358, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (recognizing divergent approaches by circuit courts).
