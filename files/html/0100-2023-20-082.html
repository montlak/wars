<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-79"><span class="space">h.</span> OSC Reopening</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Morrison v. Dept. of Army</span>, 77 MSPR 655, 656-57, 659-62 (1998), accepted an appeal based on the close-out letter issued after OSC's reopening of an investigation earlier terminated through a close-out letter:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 25, 1994, the appellant sought corrective action from the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) in connection with her claims that, in reprisal for her whistleblowing activity, the agency had issued her two letters of reprimand, threatened to suspend her, made more general verbal threats against her, and proposed to rewrite her job description. OSC accepted her allegations for investigation, and after supplementation by the appellant and its request that the agency institute corrective action, notified the appellant that it had completed its investigation on January 24, 1996. The matters it investigated, OSC stated, were "two letters of reprimand and [the appellant's claim that her] supervisory responsibilities were eliminated." The notice advised that the agency had now rescinded both letters and formally reinstated her to her supervisory functions. Finally, OSC found that none of her claims of harassment constitute cognizable personnel actions. Under the circumstances, it closed her file and provided her notice of the right to seek review of the complaint by filing an individual right of action (IRA) appeal with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather than doing so directly, the record shows that she continued to write to OSC and request further investigation and action on its part, as to both the reinstatement of her supervisory duties and her claims of harassment. This led OSC again to determine that she had raised matters warranting further investigation; it therefore reopened her case file on February 27, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of further action, by submission received by the Board on September 19, 1996, the appellant filed an IRA appeal, based on all of the evidence and argument she had raised to OSC. The agency moved to dismiss the appeal for vagueness, as untimely, and because of her use of the equal employment opportunity complaint process allegedly to gain review of the same matters....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his decision, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as untimely filed from the January 24, 1996 OSC close-out letter. He found both that the appellant had been notified of the time limit applicable to such an appeal but had not shown good cause to account for her nearly eight-month delay, and that even if good cause had been shown, the Board lacks authority to waive the regulatory filing deadline. Moreover, he ruled that OSC's reopening of the appeal in February did not provide a basis for the contrary result, inasmuch as the reopening did not cite any new personnel actions on which an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice could be based, and OSC stated that it had reopened the complaint only to determine whether the appellant was being allowed to perform her supervisory responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, and the appellant makes no claim to the contrary, that she was properly notified of the time limit by the January 1996 close-out letter; nor does she argue that her appeal was timely from it. Instead, she reasserts her contention that because of OSC's February 1996 reopening, all of the matters she originally raised to OSC were still being considered, so that she could raise them here at any time after 120 days following the reopening, inasmuch as no final action has yet been taken by OSC. For the reasons discussed below, we agree with the appellant's contention and conclude that her appeal was timely filed.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;For this reason, we find that no question of good cause arises, and need not address whether the time limit for filing an IRA appeal, as set out at 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), is subject to equitable tolling. <span class="Italic">See, e.g, Wood v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force,</span> 54 MSPR 587, 593 (1992); <span class="Italic">see also Irwin v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 111 S. Ct. 453, 112 L. Ed.2d 435 (1990) (statutory time limit for the commencement of suit set by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, is subject to equitable tolling).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the notice given to the appellant as to the time limit she must meet to raise her claims to the Board, she sought further action by OSC during the period in which she could have filed her IRA appeal.[4] More important, OSC's response favorable to her request was also made within the statutory limitation period. In addition to providing her with a contact point at OSC, the letter, in its entirety, read: "We have reviewed the additional information which you submitted to...OSC and have determined that further investigation is warranted. As a result of that review, we have reopened your case file and referred it back to the Investigation Division." Thus, after the date on which OSC informed her she must file, if at all, with the Board, that same agency told her that her case had been reopened for further investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Prudence would have dictated that the appellant should, nonetheless, have filed with the Board as initially directed. We <span id="Page_3781"></span>note that she has represented herself before us at all times. <span class="Italic">Pro se</span> appellants may not escape the consequences of inadequate representation, but they are not expected to proceed with the precision of an attorney in a judicial proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Roche v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 828 F.2d 1555, 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Walters v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 MSPR 115, 119 (1994); <span class="Italic">Goodnight v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 49 MSPR 184, 187 (1991). Regardless, we caution that it was not the appellant's lack of representation or her expeditious action in contacting OSC, but OSC's alacrity in (apparently unqualifiedly) reopening her complaint that makes this otherwise delayed appeal timely. The appellant's request for reopening alone, no matter how quickly submitted, would not have affected her filing deadline. Thus, she would have acted at her peril if she had ignored OSC's original notice and it had not timely reopened her complaint. On these facts, we have no occasion to forecast the effect of any later or less favorable response from OSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, it later clarified this letter and informed her that the reopening had been on a more limited basis than is apparent ("we reopened your file...for further investigation regarding your claim that the agency was still not allowing you to perform the responsibilities of your position."). Nonetheless, the appellant was not informed of that at any point when she could have timely filed with the Board from the January 24 determination. Indeed, she was not so informed until after she had already filed her appeal, and then only at her own request that OSC provide additional information in support of her timeliness argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that because of OSC's reopening decision, the finality which otherwise attached to the issues the appellant initially raised to it was no longer present, and her case was once again under active consideration. The finality requirement for purposes of seeking appellate review is met "when the initial decision-maker's action becomes firm and stable, the definitive 'last word' of the arbiter on the matter at hand." <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 712 F.2d 669, 670 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (construing the finality requirement applicable to the Board's appellate review authority under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121). Finality attaches "when the agency arrives at a terminal, complete resolution of the case before it. An order lacks finality in this sense while it remains tentative, provisional or contingent, subject to recall, revision, or reconsideration by the issuing agency," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 671. Final agency action "occurs when the agency has made an unalterable decision.... <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 674. <span class="Italic">See also Catlin v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S. Ct. 631, 633, 89 L. Ed. 911 (1945) (a final decision is "one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the statute does not speak in terms of a "final" decision, we find that it sets an equivalent rule by turning on notice that the investigation "has been terminated," and that the complaining party therefore may now file with the Board. It contains nothing limiting OSC's authority to reconsider the matter so expeditiously after issuing its otherwise final notice. In delaying her appeal, therefore, the appellant did not rely on speculation that her request alone prevented the investigation from having been "terminated," or on the advice of a stranger to the case, but on the actions of the very agency whose actions by law determine her right to file an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf. McCabe v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 62 MSPR 641, 644-45 (1994) (OSC's first close-out letter neither interpreted the appellant's claim as one of reprisal nor provided notice of appeal rights, but in response to his subsequent requests for reevaluation it informed him that it had considered his further claim but declined to reopen the matter; under the circumstances, the appeal, although untimely filed as to the first close-out, was held timely as to the second because that letter showed that OSC reopened the record and considered the reprisal claim for the first time), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 62 F.3d 1433 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the legislative history of the 1989 amendments to the WPA, as a result of which the right to file an IRA appeal was first instituted, reveals no consideration of the specific question now before us. Nonetheless, we find that the result we reach here is consistent with it and with the overall purpose of the WPA. For example, in defining the purpose of the notices OSC is required to give an individual at 60-day intervals (5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(1)(C)), Congress stated that they are "to keep employees aware of the status of their cases and to promote confidence in the process." S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 19 (1988); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 17-18 (the right to file an IRA appeal "is important to assure whistleblowers at the very least, of having an opportunity to argue their cases at a hearing. * * * The Committee does not intend that any time limit be applied to appeals by whistleblowers whose cases have not been formally closed by the OSC...."). Moreover, the tenor of the discussion generally indicated a concern that OSC be allowed the time to settle cases informally and take a more active rol[e] in pursuing them on behalf of complaining individuals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id.,</span> at 17 ("it is hoped that the OSC will demonstrate an increased commitment to whistleblowers so that few employees will find it necessary to pursue their cases independently"). Finally, we note that the remedial intent of the law favors inclusion, not exclusion. <span class="Italic">See Duvall v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 74 MSPR 334, 341 (1997); <span class="Italic">King v. Department of Health &#x0026;</span> <span class="Italic">Human Services,</span> 71 MSPR 22, 32 (1996) (the WPA is remedial legislation and should be interpreted to effectuate that purpose).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the effect of OSC's then nonspecific reopening of the case during the limitations period was to render its January 24 notification void and deprive it of the finality it would otherwise have had, because the OSC investigation cannot be said to have been "terminated"; and further, that so holding accords with the statute's plain language and is consistent with its legislative history.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this conclusion, the appellant could file her IRA appeal within 65 days after any new close-out or, in the absence of a final OSC determination, at any time following 120 days from having sought further corrective action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(B); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(2), quoted above. The record does not indicate, and the agency does not claim, that OSC had closed out that matter when the instant appeal was filed. Accordingly, because the appellant filed her appeal following the passage of 120 days from her request for further corrective action and after OSC informed her that it had reopened the case, we find that the appellant's IRA appeal is timely, so that she may proceed further before the Board on her claims....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that a decision by OSC to reopen its investigation deprives its initial close-out determination of the requisite finality needed before an appellant can file an IRA appeal with the Board pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A). <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Department of the Army</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 655, 659-62 (1998).

In so holding, the Board found that nothing in the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) or its legislative history prevented OSC from reconsidering matters after issuing its close-out letter and equated the requirement in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A)(i) that OSC provide notice that its investigation "has been terminated" with the finality requirement for purposes of seeking appellate review.[2] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 660-61. Although <span class="Italic">Morrison</span> involved the timeliness of the appellant's Board appeal, whereas here the appellant filed a timely appeal and OSC subsequently reopened its investigation after the limitations period, we nonetheless find the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Morrison</span> applicable here.

<p class="Body-Text">The effect of reopening of a case by OSC on the timeliness of an IRA appeal was restated, <span class="Italic">Kalus v. DHS</span>, 123 MSPR 226, 228-29 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11, 2016 MSPB 9 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A), an appellant may file an IRA appeal with the Board once OSC closes its investigation into his complaint and no more than 60 days have elapsed since notification of the closure was provided to him. Under the Board's regulations implementing that statutory time limit, an IRA appeal must be filed no later than 65 days after the date that OSC issues its close-out letter, or, if the letter is received more than 5 days after its issuance, within 60 days of the date of receipt. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant's IRA appeal was untimely filed, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Heimberger v. Department of Commerce</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10 (2014), to determine that the statutory deadline began to run from the date of OSC's August 29, 2012 close-out letter. We find <span class="Italic">Heimberger</span> distinguishable from the circumstances in this case. In <span class="Italic">Heimberger</span>, after the statutory period for filing an IRA appeal had passed, the appellant filed a request to reopen with OSC, OSC denied her request, and the appellant filed an IRA appeal with the Board arguing that her appeal was timely filed because timeliness should be calculated from the date of OSC's denial of her request to reopen. <span class="Italic">Heimberger</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4. The Board disagreed and found that the appellant's IRA appeal was untimely filed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. The Board reasoned that, because the denial of a request to reopen generally does not restart the statutory period to file an IRA appeal, the timeliness of the appeal was properly assessed from the date of OSC's close-out letter, not the date of OSC's denial of her request to reopen. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike <span class="Italic">Heimberger</span>, which involved OSC's denial of the appellant's request to reopen, OSC here accepted the appellant's new complaint based on new evidence and resumed its investigation under a new case number. The Board has held, under similar circumstances, that OSC's reopening of an appellant's complaint after it already had issued a close-out letter in the matter creates a new statutory filing period, providing the appellant <span id="Page_3782"></span>the right to file an IRA appeal either within 65 days after OSC issued its new close-out letter or, in the absence of a final OSC determination, at any time following 120 days from having sought further corrective action. <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Department of the Army</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 655, 656-57, 661 (1998) (reviewing and applying the legislative history of the Whistleblower Protection Act). Here, because the appellant filed his appeal within 65 days of OSC's new close-out letter, we find his appeal timely. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 661.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board noted in <span class="Italic">Morrison</span>, the appellant's request for reopening alone would not have affected his deadline to file his IRA appeal with the Board; rather, it was OSC's decision to reopen that restarted the statutory filing period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 659 n.4; <span class="Italic">cf. Hawker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 62, &#x00B6; 7 (2015) (recognizing that a decision by OSC to reopen its investigation deprives its initial close-out determination of the requisite finality needed for purposes of seeking Board review). The Board will accept OSC's decision to reopen at face value, absent egregious circumstances evidencing an abuse of process, which are not present here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, our decision to accept this appeal as timely filed is consistent with the Board's analysis in appeals of the final decisions of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) under similar circumstances. Like IRA appeals, which require exhaustion before OSC, certain retirement matters can be appealed to the Board within 30 days after the appellant receives a final decision from OPM. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.110, 1201.22(b)(1). The Board has found that OPM's issuance of a second final decision creates a new filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Smith v.

Similarly, the Board also has recognized that OPM's issuance of a prior final decision does not preclude the Board from taking jurisdiction over a matter pursuant to a subsequent final decision by OPM regarding the same matter. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 5 n.1 (2012); <span class="Italic">Powell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 580, &#x00B6; 9 n.2 (2010).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has not addressed whether an appellant must exhaust a request for reconsideration submitted to OSC before filing an IRA appeal. Upon consideration of this issue, we find that the appellant's reconsideration request to OSC did not require a second period of administrative exhaustion before filing his IRA appeal with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Department of the Army</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 655 (1998), the Board held that the appellant filed a timely IRA appeal 120 days after receiving a letter from OSC informing her that it was reopening her case file in response to her request for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 660-61. The Board reasoned that OSC's reopening decision--which was issued during the original 60-day period the appellant had to file her IRA appeal after she received OSC's initial close out letter, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 659--deprived OSC's initial close out determination of the requisite finality needed before the appellant could file her IRA appeal with the Board, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 660. In so holding, the Board noted two important factors which are germane to the exhaustion issue in the present appeal. First, the Board acknowledged that the appellant justifiably delayed filing her IRA appeal based upon the affirmative act "of the very agency [OSC] whose actions by law determine her right to file an IRA appeal," and that she "did not rely on speculation that her request alone prevented the investigation from having been 'terminated.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Second, the Board opined that "the appellant's request for reopening alone, no matter how quickly submitted, would not have affected her filing deadline. Thus, she would have acted at her peril if she had ignored OSC's original notice and it had not timely reopened her complaint." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 659 n.4. Together, these observations support the conclusion that an appellant who seeks reconsideration from OSC after receiving an initial close out letter and does not file an IRA appeal within 65 days of his receipt of OSC's initial determination runs the risk of having his IRA appeal dismissed as untimely if he waits an additional 120 days after submitting his request for reconsideration to OSC. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> ("Prudence would have dictated that the appellant should, nonetheless, have filed with the Board as initially directed.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge noted that "[i]t appears that OSC has not yet reopened his complaint" in response to the appellant's request for reconsideration, we find the administrative judge's affirmative requirement that the appellant <span class="Italic">must</span> wait for a response from OSC--or if he does not receive a response, at least 120 days--before filing his IRA appeal runs counter to our observation in <span class="Italic">Morrison</span> that a request for reconsideration to OSC, alone, does not extend the time to file an IRA appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">See Morrison</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 655, 659 n.4. Thus, absent any evidence that OSC granted the appellant's request for reconsideration or gave the appellant reason to believe that it was reconsidering its prior determination, we conclude that the appellant properly exhausted his administrative remedies by initially presenting his whistleblower complaint to OSC and that he did not have to wait for a response from OSC on his reconsideration request before filing his IRA appeal with the Board. As contemplated by the Board in <span class="Italic">Morrison</span>, merely filing a request for reconsideration at OSC does not create an additional administrative exhaustion requirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find that the appellant has exhausted his administrative remedies with OSC, to the extent the administrative judge dismisses the appellant's chapter 75 appeal as untimely or outside the Board's jurisdiction, she should determine on remand whether the appellant has established the remaining jurisdictional elements of his IRA appeal. Specifically, in order to maintain an IRA appeal before the Board, an appellant who has established exhaustion before OSC must nonfrivolously allege that (1) he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure, and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Peterson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 113, &#x00B6; 8 (2011). To meet the nonfrivolous standard, an appellant need only plead allegations of fact which, if proven, could show that he made a protected disclosure that was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Whether an allegation is nonfrivolous is determined on the basis of the written record. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the appellant satisfies each of these jurisdictional requirements, he has the right to a hearing on the merits of his whistleblower reprisal claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, if the appellant seeks reconsideration from OSC's closeout letter and reconsideration is not granted, the appellant's ensuing appeal to the Board may be untimely if it is not filed within 65 days from the closeout letter, <span class="Italic">Heimberger v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HEIMBERGER_DEBRA_A_CH_1221_13_0007_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1003060.pdf">121 MSPR 10</a>, 12-14 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-8, 2014 MSPB 18 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant began working for the agency under a term appointment in April 2010, and was terminated from employment approximately 3 months later. The appellant filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) alleging whistleblower reprisal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and, on March 18, 2011, OSC issued a preliminary determination to close its inquiry without corrective action. OSC provided the appellant an opportunity to respond to its preliminary determination in writing, and, after receiving no response, it issued the appellant a close-out letter on April 7, 2011. The close-out letter informed the appellant of her right to file an IRA appeal with the Board and the time limit for doing so, and it also stated that she may request reconsideration from OSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More than a year after OSC issued its close-out letter, on July 9, 2012, the appellant filed a request to reopen with OSC on the ground that she possessed new evidence. On August 2, 2012, OSC denied the request to open. On October 1, 2012, the appellant filed the instant IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued a timeliness order, and, in response, the appellant argued that the timeliness of her IRA appeal should be judged from the date OSC issued its decision on her request to reopen rather than from the date of its initial close-out letter. The administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal on the basis that the appellant filed it outside the statutory time limit without a showing that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled, and therefore "she failed to make a non-frivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a petition for review, arguing that her appeal was timely under the statute and, alternatively, that the deadline should be equitably tolled. The agency has filed a response to the petition, and the appellant has filed a reply to the agency's response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appeal was filed outside the statutory time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A), an appellant may file an IRA appeal with the Board once OSC closes its investigation into her complaint and no more <span id="Page_3783"></span>than 60 days have elapsed since notification of the closure was provided to her. Under the Board's regulations implementing that statutory time limit, an IRA appeal must be filed no later than 65 days after the date that OSC issues its close-out letter, or, if the letter is received more than 5 days after its issuance, within 60 days of the date of receipt. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the timeliness of her IRA appeal should be calculated from the date of OSC's denial of her request to reopen, and not from the date of the April 7, 2011 close-out letter. We disagree. First, we find that the April 7, 2011 close-out letter constituted notice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A)(i) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(1) that OSC was terminating its investigation. Therefore, this letter satisfied the criteria for triggering the statutory filing period. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A)(ii). Although the close-out letter invited the appellant to seek reconsideration from OSC, we cannot agree with the appellant that this invitation somehow made the letter provisional or preliminary in nature. The most reasonable reading of this letter is that OSC made a final decision to terminate its investigation, and any request for reconsideration would be a request for reconsideration of that final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also disagree with the appellant that OSC's denial of her reconsideration request created a new IRA filing period. The Board has found that the denial of a request for reconsideration will generally not restart the statutory period to file an IRA appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Morrison v. Department of the Army</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 655, 660-61 (1998). In <span class="Italic">Morrison</span>, the Board found that the appellant timely filed her IRA appeal 120 days after OSC granted her request for reconsideration, but otherwise took no further action on her complaint. <span class="Italic">Morrison</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 660-61; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(B). The Board reasoned that, OSC, "the very agency...whose actions by law determine [an appellant's] right to file an IRA appeal," affirmatively informed the appellant that it was reopening her complaint of whistleblower reprisal. <span class="Italic">Morrison</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 659. In contrast to <span class="Italic">Morrison</span>, OSC in this case never informed the appellant it was granting her reconsideration request, reopening the investigation, or otherwise reconsidering its original close-out determination. The Board in <span class="Italic">Morrison</span>, moreover, expressly noted that "the appellant's request for reopening alone, no matter how quickly submitted, would not have affected her filing deadline. Thus, she would have acted at her peril if she had ignored OSC's original notice and it had not timely reopened her complaint." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 659 n.4. We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the timeliness of the appellant's IRA appeal should not be calculated from the date of OSC's denial of the request for reconsideration, but rather should be assessed from the date of the close-out letter.[1] This IRA appeal was therefore untimely by nearly 16 months.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We have considered whether the appellant's reconsideration request should be construed as a new whistleblower complaint. However, we find that the reconsideration request pertains to the same disclosures and the same personnel action at issue in the original complaint, merely providing additional details in support of it. <span class="Italic">Cf. Fisher v. Department of Defense</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 470, 474-75 (1992) (new allegations of whistleblower reprisal triggered a new IRA filing period as to only those new allegations). We have also considered the appellant's argument that the instant appeal is timely under <span class="Italic">McCabe v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 641, 645 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 62 F.3d 1433 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table), in which the Board found that the filing period began to run from the date that OSC denied the request for reconsideration. However, the critical fact in <span class="Italic">McCabe</span> was that OSC did not construe the appellant's allegations as pertaining to whistleblower reprisal when it issued its original close-out letter, so its reconsideration denial was effectively a new determination. 62 M.S.P.R. at 645.
