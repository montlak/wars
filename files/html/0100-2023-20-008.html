<p class="Body-Text">Unlike the analysis of allegations of waste and mismanagement, "[w]hether or not reported violations are trivial does not deprive the discloser of the benefit of having made a protected disclosure of violations of statutes, regulations, or rules." <span class="Italic">Wojcicki v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 72 MSPR 628, 635 (1996); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Grubb v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 96 MSPR 377, 389-90 &#x00B6; 26 (2004) ("there is no <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception for the violation-of-law aspect of the protected disclosure standard" involving a violation of law, rule, or regulation); <span class="Italic">Lawley v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 84 MSPR 253, 260 &#x00B6; 18 (1999) (report of cheating in an agency training course constituted a report of a violation of regulation, 5 CFR 735.203, precluding the employee from engaging in "criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, or other conduct prejudicial to the government"); <span class="Italic">Berkley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 71 MSPR 341, 352 (1996) ("The agency's violation may have been minor and promptly corrected, but there is no <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception for the violation-of-law aspect of the WPA's protected disclosure standard."). The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act Amendments of 2012 redefined &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(i) from "a violation" to "any violation," signifying abandonment of a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> test for otherwise covered disclosures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the WPEA, the Federal Circuit had not taken an approach that protected <span id="Page_3593"></span>as a whistleblowing disclosure the report of a trivial violation of law. Analysis of what constitutes a violation of law was provided in <span class="Italic">Frederick v. DOJ</span>, 65 MSPR 517, 534 (1994), a disciplinary case against an employee accused of taking reprisal against a whistleblower. The Board noted that "the reasonableness of a discloser's belief is to be judged from the discloser's point of view, considering the information that he had when he made the disclosure." On review, however, the Federal Circuit determined that the reasonableness of the disclosure would be, in part, ascertained on the basis of the severity of the violation reported, <span class="Italic">Frederick v. DOJ</span>, 73 F.3d 349, 352-53 (Fed. Cir. 1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Frederick that there was no substantial evidence to support a reasonable belief by Womack that a violation occurred....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA was enacted to protect employees who report genuine infractions of law, not to encourage employees to report arguably minor and inadvertent miscues occurring in the conscientious carrying out of one's assigned duties. As noted in the legislative history of the WPA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">What is needed is a means to protect the Pentagon employee who discloses billions of dollars in cost overruns, the GSA employee who discloses widespread fraud, and the nuclear engineer who questions the safety of certain nuclear plants....&#8197;Nor would the bill protect employees who claim to be whistle blowers in order to avoid adverse action based on inadequate performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d. Sess. 8 (1978),<span class="Italic"> reprinted in</span> 1978 USCCAN 2730-31. The WPA was thus not intended to encompass such a minor transgression as took place even if Mayberry and Womack stepped into Mexico while doing their work. If supervisors have to fear that every trivial lapse in their own behavior will be the subject of a whistleblowing complaint when they critically appraise their employees, as they are obligated to do, they will be deterred from carrying out honest appraisals. Poor performers will be protected by any minor lapse in a supervisor's <span id="Page_3594"></span>conduct. This was not the purpose of the WPA, which was intended to root out real wrongdoing. Thus, the alleged action by Mayberry was of such a trivial nature that Womack could not have had a reasonable belief that Mayberry was violating a law, rule, or regulation within the meaning of the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering all the evidence presented, including that which detracts from a "reasonable belief," the record does not contain substantial evidence to support a reasonable belief by Womack that the border crossing was a violation of law. Thus, no reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Womack's disclosure of the alleged border crossing was a protected disclosure.</p>

Dep't of Treasury</span>, 265 F.3d 1259, 1266 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

<p class="Body-Text">Before and after the WPEA, the allegation of a violation of law, rule, or regulation must be specific, <span class="Italic">Demery v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the WPA, to establish a protected disclosure has been made, a person must establish that: (1) he had a reasonable belief that his disclosure was protected under the WPA; and (2) he identified a "specific law, rule, or regulation that was violated." <span class="Italic">Langer v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 265 F.3d 1259, 1266 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (internal quotations omitted). Vague, conclusory, or facially insufficient allegations of government wrong-doing fail to constitute protected disclosures under the WPA. <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Merit Sys. Prot.

Cir. 1999) (holding that the Board had no jurisdiction under the WPA for the disclosure of trivial violations of agency rules).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Ms. Demery's November 19, 2010 phone conversation lacks the specificity required to constitute a disclosure. Ms. Demery testified that she told Mr. Denham in that call that she thought CPAC's consideration of another candidate "was not correct" and "that this timing doesn't seem quite right." Although Ms. Demery indicated her general dissatisfaction with the process, she did not allege any violation of a rule, regulation, or law. The Board reasonably found that Ms. Demery's statements in the November 19 phone call were too vague and conclusory and thus do not qualify as a protected disclosure under the WPA as amended by the WPEA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The disclosed alleged violation may be obvious. <span class="Italic">See McCardle v. EEOC</span>, SF-0752-16-0689-I-3, n.16 (NP 12/7/2022) ("We find that the appellant's allegations that the agency doctored his OPF so obviously implicate a violation of a law, rule, or regulation that it was unnecessary for him to identify any specific law or regulation that he believed was violated. <span class="Italic">DiGiorgio v. Department of the Navy</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 14 (1999).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the 2012 WPEA, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">Herman v. DOJ</span>, 193 F.3d 1375, 1380-82 (Fed. Cir. 1999), that disclosures of violations of law, rule, or regulation must be substantial or repeated to be protected:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Herman also contends that the Board erred in finding that a reasonable person would not believe that Dr. Herman's second disclosure, concerning a possible compromise of EAP confidentiality, constituted a protected disclosure of a violation of the EAP Directive P.S. 3792, at most a "rule," or other laws and regulations. According to Dr. Herman, the Directive requires that the "counseling information of all employees referred for assistance" shall be kept confidential and that the confidentiality of the counseling information may have been violated when telephone logs in his office were copied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board found that not every piece of information in an EAP office is "counseling information," which needs to be kept confidential. The Board further found that Dr. Herman did not establish that a reasonable person as manager of the EAP would have believed that the logs or telephone messages that were copied were protected under the Directive. Given the fact that Dr. Herman has not provided any evidence that any of the information that was copied was confidential or even that any of the messages that were in the telephone log were related to the EAP, we cannot say that the Board erred in holding that Dr. Herman could not have reasonably believed that he disclosed information evidencing a violation of any law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Herman further argues that the AJ erred when she based her ruling that no person could have reasonably believed that there was a violation of a law, rule, or regulation on her own view of the lack of seriousness of the reported wrongdoing. Dr. Herman contends that under <span class="Italic">Horton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 F.3d 279 (Fed. Cir. 1995), "whether or not the reported violations were trivial...does not deprive the discloser of the benefit of having made a protected disclosure," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 283, and that an evidentiary hearing on jurisdiction is needed to evaluate Dr. Herman's credibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. The AJ based her decision on the fact that Dr. Herman had not provided any evidence whatsoever that any confidential "counseling information" was copied. Thus, there simply was no violation. The AJ therefore correctly held that Dr. Herman's memorandum expressing his concern about the possible effect that copying the telephone logs may have on the integrity and the confidentiality of the program is not a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we reject Dr. Herman's contention that <span class="Italic">Horton</span> mandates that the disclosure of a single violation, even if trivial, necessarily constitutes a protected disclosure. In <span class="Italic">Horton,</span> the whistleblower did not allege a single violation, but rather reported multiple instances of alleged wrongdoing, including allegations that employees falsified time cards, were frequently sleeping on the job, and misused the telephone. Indeed, we criticized the Board's conclusion that a "single incident [of making a personal phone call] could not reasonably be viewed as wrongdoing" by noting that the disclosure did not relate to a single incident, but rather to a "practice of excessive personal calls during work periods." <span class="Italic">Horton</span>, 66 F.3d at 283. Because <span class="Italic">Horton</span> did not decide whether a single violation can suffice, it is not controlling in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we noted in <span class="Italic">Frederick v. Department of Justice</span>, 73 F.3d 349, 353 (Fed. Cir. 1996), the WPA was enacted to protect employees who report genuine violations of law, not to encourage employees to report minor or inadvertent miscues occurring in the conscientious carrying out of a federal official or employee's assigned duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If supervisors have to fear that every trivial lapse in their own behavior will be the subject of a whistleblowing complaint when they critically appraise their employees, as they are obligated to do, they will be deterred from carrying out honest appraisals. Poor performers will be protected by any minor lapse in a supervisors conduct. This was not the purpose of the WPA, which merely was intended to root out real wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Frederick,</span> for example, the alleged whistleblower claimed that he had disclosed a violation of law by reporting that a United States Border Patrol agent violated international law by crossing the border into Mexico without Mexican permission. In evaluating the reasonableness of the whistleblower's purported belief, we stated that "the alleged action [of the Border Patrol agent] was of such a trivial nature that [the 'whistleblower'] could not have had a reasonable belief that [the Border Patrol agent] was violating a law, rule, or regulation within the meaning of the WPA."<span class="Italic"> id.</span> Indeed, the Border Patrol agent testified that in fact the exact location of the border was unclear and that he believed he never crossed into Mexico but always remained on United States soil.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the EAP Directive requires that all EAP confidential "counseling information" and records thereof be kept in a security-approved container, such as a safe. The agency made copies of the telephone log in order to investigate possible wrongdoing by Dr. Herman. The telephone log was not kept in a security-approved container but appeared to have been left out in the open. Given the fact that confidential information should have been kept in a security container, that the telephone log was not kept in such a container, that copying of confidential information, if any, would have been inadvertent, and that Dr. Herman could not identify any confidential information as actually being copied, the action by the agency was of such a trivial nature that Dr. Herman could not have reasonably believed that the agency was violating a law, rule, or regulation within the meaning of the WPA when the agency made copies of his telephone log. Moreover, the unreasonableness of his belief is further established by the fact that the copying he complained about was pursuant to an investigation of improper conduct on his part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, we do not suggest that the disclosure of a single violation of a law, rule, or regulation could never constitute a protected disclosure. There may be situations in which the disclosure of even a single violation can amount to a protected disclosure. Similarly, a report of repetitive violations of even minor rules or regulations can constitute a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Eidmann v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 976 F.2d 1400, 1402-03, 1407 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (affirming the Board's finding that a whistleblower's disclosure of an agency's repeated refusal to enforce regulations banning smoking in general office areas was a protected disclosure under the WPA). The determination of whether an employee has a reasonable belief that a law, rule, or regulation was violated turns on the facts of the particular case. In this case, we hold that Dr. Herman could not have reasonably believed that his memorandum concerning the photocopying of telephone logs constituted the disclosure of a violation of a nontrivial law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dolinsky v. DHS</span>, 372 Fed. Appx. 85, 90 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) (appellant failed to show a reasonable belief that he made a disclosure evidencing a violation of law, rule, or regulation when he reported what he believed to be a Hatch Act violation); <span class="Italic">Gernert v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 Fed. Appx. 756, 762 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP) (report of a supervisor's minor misuse of government phones did not rise to protected whistleblowing); <span class="Italic">Langer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 265 F.3d 1259 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (as to a violation of law, rule, or regulation: "Even if all of the above factors have been met, disclosures of trivial violations do not constitute protected disclosures"; the WPA was enacted to protect employees who report genuine violations of law, not minor miscues).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The jurisdictional question is whether a person in the appellant's position with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the appellant could reasonably conclude that a law was violated. The appellant does not have to show that a law was actually violated to establish jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Horton v. VA</span>, 106 MSPR 234, 242 &#x00B6; 17, 2007 MSPB 164 (2007). In <span class="Italic">Drake v. AID</span>, 543 F.3d 1377, 1380-82 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Drake v. AID</span>, 111 MSPR 285, 2009 MSPB 81 (2009) (directing corrective action)), the Federal Circuit revisited and clarified its approach to violations of rule and law that are characterized as trivial by agencies accused of reprisal. In <span class="Italic">Drake,</span> the reported offense was that agency officials were drinking on duty. The court explained that the allegation was sufficient to establish jurisdiction for purposes of an IRA merits determination and, in so doing, distinguished some of its earlier decisions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the AJ misinterpreted our holdings in <span class="Italic">Langer v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 265 F.3d 1259 (Fed. Cir. 2001) and <span class="Italic">Herman v. Department of Justice,</span> 193 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1999) in finding that Mr. Drake's e-mail was "a disclosure of a trivial violation [that] does not constitute a protected disclosure."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Herman,</span> prison officials copied the telephone logs of Dr. Herman, the former chief clinical psychologist for a federal prison camp, while investigating his alleged unauthorized telephone use. Dr. Herman asserted that this copying of his telephone logs may have compromised the confidentiality of employees who had called him as part of an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and was therefore a violation of the prison's EAP directive. Dr. Herman further asserted that a memorandum he wrote complaining about the copying of his telephone logs amounted to a protected disclosure. This court, emphasizing that the telephone logs were not identified as potentially confidential by being kept in a security-approved container as mandated by the EAP directive and that Dr. Herman could not show that any confidential information was actually copied, determined that the "copying of confidential information, if any, would have been inadvertent." <span class="Italic">Herman,</span> 193 F.3d at 1381. Accordingly, we held that "the action by the agency was of such a trivial nature that Dr. Herman could not have reasonably believed that the agency was violating a law, rule, or regulation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court then held that Mr. Herman's disclosure was not protected because: "The WPA was enacted to protect employees who report genuine infractions of law, not to encourage employees to report arguably minor and inadvertent miscues occurring in the conscientious carrying out of one's assigned duties." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Frederick v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 73 F.3d 349, 353 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Langer,</span> Mr. Langer complained that the IRS was allowing secretaries to open pink envelopes that might contain confidential information. Relying on <span class="Italic">Herman,</span> we held that the relevant disclosures "evidence[d] disagreements Langer had with his supervisors regarding the formal policy for handling of the pink envelopes that might contain confidential grand jury information," and that "any actual viewing of grand jury material by a secretary would at most have been inadvertent." <span class="Italic">Langer,</span> 265 F.3d at 1267. Furthermore, the court held that "the alleged violation concerned a rule not adopted by the agency, but rather a procedure personally established by Langer as an exception to general agency procedures." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Once again, as in <span class="Italic">Herman,</span> we held that the disclosures were not protected because they did not report violations of any laws, rules or regulations, but rather reported "minor and inadvertent miscues occurring in the conscientious carrying out of a federal employee's assigned duties." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We held in <span class="Italic">Herman</span> that: "The determination of whether an employee has a reasonable belief that a law, rule, or regulation was violated turns on the facts of the particular case." <span class="Italic">Herman,</span> 193 F.3d at 1382. Based on the facts of <span class="Italic">Herman</span> and <span class="Italic">Langer,</span> we further held that the relevant disclosures were not protected because they disclosed, at most, minor and inadvertent miscues occurring in the conscientious carrying out of one's assigned duties, not violations of laws, rules, or regulations. This is not such a case. Here, the facts do not show, nor has the agency asserted, that the alleged violations were inadvertent or that they occurred in the conscientious carrying out of assigned duties. The alleged intoxication of agency personnel reported by Mr. Drake was instead the result of deliberate and intentional consumption of alcohol during working hours and would result in a violation of a law, rule or regulation. Therefore, the AJ's reliance on <span class="Italic">Herman</span> and <span class="Italic">Langer</span> and their discussion of a trivial or <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception is not appropriate in this case.[1] Unlike Herman and Langer, Mr. Drake reported intoxication which he could reasonably believe constituted a genuine violation of a law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The trivial or <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> idea comes from the statute itself. In 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii), the statute refers to "gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety...." (emphasis added). Moreover, the legislative history indicates that the statute protects, for example, a "pentagon employee who discloses billions of dollars in cost overruns, the GSA employee who discloses widespread fraud, and the nuclear engineer who questions the safety of certain nuclear plants." <span class="Italic">Herman</span>, 193 F.3d at 1379 (quoting S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 3d Sess. 8 (1978)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, the AJ erred with regard to the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White,</span> 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The AJ articulated the correct test that "in order to show that he reasonably believed 3 FAM 4542 had been violated, the appellant would be required to show that a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by him reasonably could conclude that employees were intoxicated." In application, however, the AJ required Mr. Drake to show that intoxication was the cause of the behavior he observed and reported. In analyzing Mr. Drake's disclosure, the AJ conceded that the reported activities were "all behaviors that an intoxicated individual might engage in," but then found that they were also "behaviors that an enthusiastic party-goer who was not intoxicated might engage in." Relying on the possibility that the agency personnel might not have been intoxicated, the AJ noted that Mr. Drake failed to prove that "the behaviors he observed <span class="Italic">were caused</span> by alcohol intoxication," and therefore held that "a disinterested observer could not reasonably conclude that [Mr. Drake's] disclosure evidenced a violation of 3 FAM 4542."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By requiring Mr. Drake to prove that the agency personnel were intoxicated, the AJ erroneously required Mr. Drake to prove that an actual violation occurred. This is in direct conflict with the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Lachance.</span> <span class="Italic">See also Huffman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 429, 433 (2002) ("To establish that he held such a reasonable belief, an appellant need not prove that the condition disclosed actually established one or <span id="Page_3595"></span>more of the listed categories of wrongdoing, but he must show that the matter disclosed was one which a reasonable person in his position would believe evidenced one of the situations specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)."). The AJ erred by requiring Mr. Drake to prove that the behavior he observed was in fact caused by intoxication. The test is not whether Mr. Drake was able to prove intoxication, but rather could a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by Mr. Drake reasonably conclude that agency personnel were intoxicated and that a violation did occur. Applying the proper legal test, the undisputed findings of the AJ lead to but one conclusion--Mr. Drake made a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Initially, <span class="Italic">Ganski v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 83 MSPR 301 (1999), <span class="Italic">vacated</span>, <span class="Italic">Ganski v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 86 MSPR 32 (2000), <span class="Italic">post</span>, excluded from protection disclosures of violations of law or regulation involving merit promotion procedures from the types of waste, fraud, and abuse covered by the WPA. Under the 1999 <span class="Italic">Ganski</span> decision, 83 MSPR at 306 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1035, the Federal Circuit found that an individual's challenge to an agency's selection process as "unfair and inequitable to the employee because the agency considered nonmerit factors in denying him a promotion opportunity," is not the "type of fraud, waste, or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach." The court noted that not every disclosure pertaining to personnel actions can rise to the level of a section 2302(b)(8) disclosure by alleging that it evidences mismanagement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 77 MSPR 224, 233 (1998), the appellant alleged that the agency's selection process was unfair because persons with less experience and qualifications than he had were selected. <span class="Italic">See</span> 77 MSPR 224, 232-33 (1998). He asserted that these practices violated various provisions in the agency's Merit Promotion Plan and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy. Based on the Federal Circuit's guidance in <span class="Italic">Ellison,</span> the Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> that a disclosure which alleges only that an agency's selection process was unfair because the agency considered nonmerit factors is not the "type of fraud, waste, or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 232.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, although the appellant's claims are factually distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> and <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> because they were not part of the agency's formal grievance process, the factual differences have no legal effect. We find that the appellant's claims that the agency's selection process was improper are not the type of fraud, waste, or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ganski sought review in the Federal Circuit. The Board requested and received a remand for "additional analysis" that led the Board to vacate its first opinion, reverse its position, and determine that the WPA includes <span class="Italic">any</span> violation of law, rule, or regulation as a protected disclosure if the disclosure meets other requirements of the WPA, <span class="Italic">Ganski v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 86 MSPR 32, 34-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-13 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The prior Board decision found that the appellant satisfied the second and third elements, 83 MSPR 301 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 7-10 and we adopt that finding and incorporate it here. The question before the Board is whether the appellant satisfied the first element, the making of a protected whistleblowing disclosure. We find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that, if proven, would establish that she made a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the pleadings filed before the administrative judge, the appellant told Park Superintendent Arthur Stewart that Ms. Sue Zuribyda obtained her Administrative Officer (AO) position "illegally." The appellant stated to Stewart that the position had not been advertised, as required under the agency's Merit Promotion Plan, and that Zuribyda obtained it only after the agency created a "bogus" Administrative Operations Facilitator (AOF) position for her to serve in for a year, at the end of which her position was non-competitively converted to AO based on her newly-acquired specialized experience. The appellant further stated to Stewart that the AOF and AO positions had not been posted on the agency's Operations Opportunity List, as required (she alleged) under agency rules. The appellant also submitted to the administrative judge a copy of personnel directives from the agency's Mid-Atlantic Deputy Regional Director, which included a requirement that all vacancies be posted through the Operations Opportunity program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the previous decision in this appeal, all three Board members agreed that the appellant made a non-frivolous allegation that she reasonably believed she was revealing a violation of law, rule, or regulation when she made her disclosure to Stewart. <span class="Italic">See</span> 83 MSPR 301 &#x00B6; 11 (majority opinion); 83 MSPR at 308 (dissenting opinion agreeing with majority's finding on this point). We adopt that finding and incorporate it here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The applicable statute describes one type of whistleblowing disclosure as a revelation of "a violation of any law, rule, or regulation." 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i). The other type of whistleblowing disclosure is a revelation of "gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii). Based on the Board's previous finding that the appellant revealed what she reasonably believed was a violation of law, rule, or regulation, the applicable subsection is (i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 77 MSPR 224, 233 (1998), the Board held that a disclosure of a violation of personnel rules was not protected because it did not involve the "type of fraud, waste, or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach." The <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> decision did not distinguish between the two subsections of section 2302(b)(8)(A), and <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> thus appears to hold that a disclosure is protected under subsection (i) only if the law, rule, or regulation involved relates to a particular type of "fraud, waste, or abuse." The prior Board decision in this case relied on <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> to find that the appellant's disclosure of a violation of hiring rules was not protected. Upon reconsideration of this issue, we find that the prior Board decision was in error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> decision was based on <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Systems</span> <span class="Italic">Protection Board,</span> 7 F.3d 1031 (Fed. Cir. 1993), in which the court considered whether disclosures of improprieties in the selection process for a vacancy were protected whistleblowing. The court stated--without distinguishing between subsections (i) and (ii) of section 2302(b)(8)(A)--that an employee "does not necessarily" make a protected disclosure merely by revealing alleged "mismanagement or the like." 7 F.3d at 1035. Rather, such a disclosure may be protected under section 2302(b)(8) "only if [it] establish[es] the type of fraud, waste, or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This passage, with its reference to "mismanagement or the like," means that a disclosure of impropriety in an agency's selection process is protected whistleblowing under section 2302(b)(8)(A), subsection (ii), only if it alleges the "type of fraud, waste, or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach." 7 F.3d at 1035. The court did not say that a disclosure of a violation of law, rule, or regulation under subsection (i) may or may not be whistleblowing, depending on what law, rule, or regulation is involved, and <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> was incorrect to interpret the court's decision as so holding because such a rule is not supportable under the plain language of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 2302(b)(8)(A), subsection (ii), requires the Board to make a substantive judgment about the type of alleged wrongdoing disclosed (e.g., did the appellant reveal <span class="Italic">"gross"</span> mismanagement or a "<span class="Italic">substantial and</span> <span class="Italic">specific</span>" danger to the public). However, subsection (i) does not contain any qualifying language; that provision covers a disclosure of "a violation of any law, rule, or regulation." Accordingly, the inquiry into whether a disclosure is protected under subsection (i) ends upon a determination that the appellant disclosed a violation of law, rule, or regulation.

<p class="Block-Quote1">This reading of the statute, which gives effect to its unambiguous language, is supported by the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified as amended in various sections of title 5 of the United States Code). The CSRA made it a prohibited personnel practice to take or fail to take a personnel action because of "a disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences--(i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation." 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i) (1988) (emphasis supplied). The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) amended this language, making it a prohibited personnel practice to take or fail to take a personnel action because of "<span class="Italic">any</span> disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences--(i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation." 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i) (1994) (emphasis supplied). The Senate committee that considered the bill that became the WPA[2] explained that the bill changed the phrase "a disclosure" to "any disclosure" to "emphasize[]" that "any disclosure is protected (if it meets the requisite reasonable belief test and is not required to be kept confidential)." S. Rep. No. 100-413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., at 13 (1988). The holding in the prior Board decision that some disclosures of violation of law, rule, or regulation are not protected, notwithstanding the legislature's deliberate revision of the statute to provide that "any" such disclosure is protected, is contrary to congressional intent.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> 109 (7th deluxe ed. 1999). The definition of an "aggravated assault" is a "[c]riminal assault accompanied by circumstances that make it more severe, such as the use of a deadly weapon, the intent to commit another crime, or the intent to cause serious bodily harm." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In South Carolina, common law assault constitutes "'an attempted battery' or an unlawful attempt or offer to commit a violent injury upon another person, coupled with the present ability to complete the attempt or offer by a battery." <span class="Italic">State v. Sutton,</span> 340 S.C. 393, 532 S.E.2d 283, 285 (2000).

<p class="Block-Quote1">A box cutter, by its very nature, is a knife with a sharp blade used to cut, and therefore may reasonably be construed as a deadly weapon depending upon the circumstances. Waving a box cutter at another person implies a threat of immediate force with a deadly weapon against that person; therefore, a disinterested observer could reasonably believe that the act of waving a box cutter at another person could be a violation of law. Based on the foregoing, we find that the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that he reasonably believed he disclosed a violation of law, and, therefore, the disclosure is protected by the WPA.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to the appellant could reasonably conclude that Ms. Weeks threatened to impermissibly lower the appellant's performance appraisal for non-merit based reasons in violation of law, rule, or regulation. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1), agencies must evaluate employees based on performance standards, "which to the maximum extent feasible, permit accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria." Furthermore, under the Office of Personnel Management's regulations, a rating shall be based "only on the evaluation of actual job performance...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.208(a)(1). Thus, we find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation of a protected disclosure with regard to her first two disclosures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 2302(b)(8), it is a prohibited personnel practice to take or fail to take a personnel action against any employee or applicant for employment as reprisal for a disclosure reasonably believed by the employee or applicant to evidence a violation of any law, rule, or regulation. "Rule" or "regulation" appears to extend to agency policy statements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Russell v. DOJ</span>, 68 MSPR 337, 345 (1995). The disclosure must not be specifically prohibited by law or specifically required by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs. 5 USC 2302(b)(8)(A); 5 CFR 1209.4(b) (2008).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The term "rule" was further defined in <span class="Italic">Rusin v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/RUSIN_MARK_S_CH_1221_00_0028_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_250380.pdf">92 MSPR 298</a>, 304-07 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-19 (2002), to include agency policy or an operating instruction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that Mr. Rusin has established this remaining jurisdictional element. Section 2302(b)(8) protects disclosures which an employee reasonably believes evidence "(i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." The appellant alleged below that Ms. Kiernan violated a law, rule, or regulation by purchasing lighters and key chains with her government-issued credit card. Specifically, he alleged that she violated the agency's Procurement Instruction Memorandum 88-35's Don't Buy List (PIM List), and ATF's Government Commercial Credit Card Program (GCCCP). The administrative judge found that neither of these were rules or regulations, stating that the PIM List was "nothing more than its title suggests: a memorandum containing instructions" and that the GCCCP was similarly not a law, rule, or regulation. The appellant challenges this ruling in his petition for review, continuing to claim that the alleged violations of the PIM List and the GCCCP constitute violations of a rule or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that he alleged a violation of a rule within the meaning of the section 2302(b)(8).[5] Contrary to the administrative judge's approach, the determination of whether or not something is a "rule" for purposes of the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) cannot be based merely on its title. A more substantive examination of these documents is required. The PIM "Don't Buy List" consisted of 17 sections, each entitled a "rule," which prohibited the purchase of various items. The document stated that these items were "not authorized for purchase" in "accordance with the Department of Treasury Procurement Instruction Memorandum 88-35." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The "rules" describing the prohibited items were followed by paragraphs entitled "exceptions/conditions." The PIM rule whose violation the appellant contends he disclosed stated: "[d]on't buy give-away items such as plaques, cufflinks, plastic holders for credentials, bracelets, ashtrays, Christmas cards, paperweights, cigarette lighters, key chains, and similar mementos." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3. The GCCCP, which the appellant asserts is also a rule which the agency violated, describes in detail the conditions and responsibilities governing the proper use of the government credit card, addressing such topics as the proper approving official, alternative approving official, procedures for the issuance of the card, and the criminal and civil penalties for improper use of the card. The document also details the five conditions that each purchase must meet, states that the card "must not be used for any personal purchases," and lists 12 categories of items whose purchase is prohibited. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Among the prohibited items are "employee awards." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that the content and purpose of the PIM List and the GCCCP strongly support a finding that these documents were rules, with the meaning of section 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Because we find that the PIM List and the GCCCP are "rules," we do not need to address whether they are "regulations."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other considerations support a conclusion that these documents qualify as rules under section 2302(b)(8). The subsection of the statute governing prohibited personnel practices which defines terms does not define "rule," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2), nor does the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act, which first created section 2302, shed any light on the definition of a "violation of...rule." Moreover, neither the Board nor the Federal Circuit has defined the word "rule" as it is used in section 2302(b)(8). In determining the meaning of a word, the provisions of a statute should be read in harmony, leaving no provision inoperative, superfluous, redundant, or contradictory. <span class="Italic">Holley v. United States,</span> 124 F.3d 1462, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Thus, because the term "rule" is in the same subsection of the statute as "law" and "regulation," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i), it must be given a distinct meaning from them. A "fundamental canon of statutory construction is that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning." <span class="Italic">Perrin v. United States,</span> 444 U.S. 37, 42, S. Ct. 311, 62 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1979). Black's Law Dictionary defines "rule" as "an established and authoritative standard or principle; a general norm mandating or guiding conduct or action in a given type of situation." Black's Law Dictionary 1330 (7th ed. 1999). Barron's Law Dictionary defines "rule" as "a prescribed guide for action or conduct, regulation or principle." Barron's Law Dictionary 427 (3d ed. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that the WPA is a remedial statute intended to improve protections for federal employees and, as such, it should be broadly construed in favor of those whom it was intended to protect<span class="Italic">. Keefer v. Department Of</span> <span class="Italic">Agriculture,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 687 &#x00B6; 13 (1999). Given the purpose of the WPA and the dictionary definitions of "rule," without specifically adopting a definition here to be applied to all future cases, we believe that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that he disclosed violations of two rules.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for a disclosure to be considered protected under section 2302(b)(8), the employee must have had a "reasonable belief' that it evidences a violation of law, rule, or regulation or one of the other conditions set out in the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White,</span> 174 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1157, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (2000). In the instant appeal, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to show that he had a reasonable belief he disclosed a violation within the meaning of section 2302(b)(8). However, without adopting a specific definition of a "rule" here, in order to establish jurisdiction under the <span class="Italic">Yunus test,</span> the appellant was required only to make a non-frivolous allegation that he reasonably believed that the information he disclosed evidenced a violation of a rule. As explained below, we believe that the appellant met this test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether an employee had a reasonable belief that his disclosure evidenced a violation of a law, rule, or regulation, the test is whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably conclude that the actions evidence a violation of a law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Lachance v. White,</span> 174 F.3d at 1381. In the instant appeal, the appellant alleged that after he received the anonymous note alleging that Ms. Kiernan had been misusing her government-issued credit card, he reviewed Ms. Kiernan's credit card records and discovered a procurement order showing that Ms. Kiernan had purchased lighters and key chains with a government credit card. The appellant alleged that he reasonably believed that these purchases violated the PIM List and the GCCCP. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. After reviewing the relevant provisions of the PIM List and the GCCCP, which we discussed above, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that a disinterested observer with knowledge of the information he disclosed about Ms. Kiernan's purchases could reasonably believe that her actions were a violation of these rules.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Without further evidence concerning the context of the appellant's disclosure, we do not make a finding that the appellant in fact had a reasonable belief that his information disclosed a violation of these rules, but he will have the opportunity to support such a merits finding on remand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Flynn v. SEC</span>, 877 F.3d 200, 205 (4th Cir. 2017), said of a "rule" in a whistleblowing case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act does not define "rule," the Administrative Procedure Act defines the term as "the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 551(4).

<p class="Block-Quote1">While our precedent makes clear that protection under the WPA requires that an employee identify a "specific law, rule, or regulation that was violated," <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span>, 234 F.3d at 13, we hold that this requirement does not necessitate the identification of a statutory or regulatory provision by title or number, when the employee's statements and the circumstances surrounding the making of those statements clearly implicate an identifiable violation of law, rule, or regulation. In this case, Langer's mentioning to the AUSAs and his supervisor that he believed there was a problem with a disproportionately high number of African-Americans being prosecuted clearly implicated the question of selective prosecution and sufficiently raised possible violations of civil rights to constitute a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, an allegation of substantial improperly spent federal funds implicates violations of law even though the appellant did not specify the potential statutory or regulatory infractions, as <span class="Italic">Bennett v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming, however, that the appellant did not know how the missing $40,000 had been spent, some allegations of wrongdoing so obviously implicate a violation of law, rule, or regulation that an appellant need not identify a particular law, rule, or regulation for a disclosure of such information to be protected. <span class="Italic">See Daniels v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that two of her alleged acts of whistleblowing were not protected disclosures. She contends first that her "outspokenness" and informal complaints concerning auditing standards and other matters constituted a protected disclosure. The administrative judge found with respect to these alleged acts of whistleblowing that they were described in a vague and general manner by the appellant and that she therefore could not determine whether they met the statutory definition of whistleblowing. The administrative judge also found that these acts represented the expression of an employee's disagreement with the directions she received from her superiors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Review of the appellant's submissions below confirms that her assertions concerning the content of these allegedly protected disclosures were general and not specific. In addition, her arguments on this issue tend to show, as the administrative judge found, that her informal complaints to her superiors were general if heated disagreements about the application of auditing standards. The appellant contends throughout her cross petition for review that she had loud, protracted discussions with her superiors about these matters, but she does not cite evidence of record or hearing testimony establishing that she disclosed violations of a specific law, rule, or regulation during these discussions. Therefore, the administrative judge was correct in finding that the appellant had failed to show that these discussions constituted a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Padilla v.

The next issue is whether the appellant has made non-frivolous allegations that her disclosure was protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rusin</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298 &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and John Gardner, the appellant's first-level supervisor, served on a Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) that evaluated proposals for a contract to study "The Role of Mortgage Markets in Promoting Energy-Efficient Mortgages." The TEP ranked 23 proposals. According to the appellant, the proposals were evaluated on technical quality alone without considering cost. Later, as the appellant notes, a determination would be made by the Department's Office of Procurement and Contracts as to which proposal offered the best value, and a contract would be awarded to that bidder. The TEP ranked a proposal from Econometrica as the top proposal. An August 12, 2002 e-mail message (e-mail) from Alfredo Valentin of the Department's Office of Procurement and Contracts tentatively identified the RESNET proposal as the top proposal based on the best overall value. Ultimately, a proposal submitted by a third bidder, Applied Real Estate Analysis, Inc., was accepted after further procurement procedures were undertaken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an August 27, 2002 e-mail, Gardner instructed the appellant to complete the TEP report concerning the proposal it was recommending. The e-mail notes that, consistent with TEP's conclusion, Harold Bunce, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs (the appellant's second-level supervisor), wanted the TEP to make the argument for selecting Econometrica. The appellant believed that RESNET's proposal represented the best value, and she objected to the assignment. Bunce subsequently instructed the appellant to comply with Gardner's August 27 assignment and instructions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that on August 29, 2002, she contacted John Opitz, Assistant General Counsel, and disclosed regulatory abuses by both Bunce and Gardner. Thereafter, on that same date, the appellant sent an e-mail to Bunce expressing her belief that RESNET's proposal provided the best value. In the e-mail, the appellant also asserted that Gardner's instruction for her to recommend Econometrica was unethical. Further, the appellant stated that she had consulted two ethics officers regarding these issues, and Opitz may contact Bunce in the near future to discuss the matter further. Subsequently, by memorandum dated September 16, 2002, Bunce informed the appellant that she was being terminated during her probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ concluded that the appellant has not established that she disclosed information that she reasonably believed evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, an abuse of authority, or a gross waste of funds. We find, however, that the appellant has provided sufficient facts to demonstrate a reasonable belief that the actions of Gardner and Bunce could reasonably be regarded as violating regulatory provisions. Specifically, the appellant alleged that Gardner and Bunce violated several Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) in the TEP evaluation process. Moreover, any doubt or ambiguity as to whether the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation should be decided in favor of affording the appellant a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 92 M.S.P.R., 429 &#x00B6; 13 (2002). Further, the Federal Circuit has held that the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal if the employee makes non-frivolous allegations that the elements of his claim are satisfied. <span class="Italic">See Spencer</span>, 327 F.3d at 1356. Once jurisdiction is established, the Board will hold a merits hearing; "at that hearing, the appellant must establish the elements of his claim by a preponderance of the evidence." Accordingly, we find that the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation that a disinterested observer with knowledge of the information the appellant disclosed about Gardner's and Bunce's activities could reasonably believe that these actions violated "any law, rule or regulation" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)<span class="Italic">. See White v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 1 &#x00B6; 28 (2003) (the test for whether a putative whistleblower had such a reasonable belief is whether a "disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee [could] reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidenced" one of the situations set out in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation that her disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take a covered personnel action against her. Specifically, she alleged that the agency terminated her, which is defined as a personnel action in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(a). Additionally, the appellant notified Bunce via e-mail that she had contacted Opitz to discuss ethical violations and violations of the FAR and the C.F.R. Within 20 days of her contact with Opitz, Bunce terminated the appellant from service. Thus, it appears that she made detailed, factual allegations that the agency officials responsible for this personnel action were aware of her disclosure and acted within such time that a reasonable person could find that the disclosure contributed to the action. <span class="Italic">See Rusin</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298 &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another report of procurement or contracting violations constituted a protected disclosure, <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. DHHS,</span> DC-1221-10-0458-W-1 (NP 5/25/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the first disclosure to Mr. Nevin and Mr. Smith, that Mr. Nevin engaged in illegal conduct by allowing the contractors to write their own statements of work, project schedules, resource requirements, and cost estimates, the appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations that the disclosure was protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Kahn v. Department of</span> Justice, 618 F.3d 1306, 1312-13 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (the proper test for determining whether an employee had a reasonable belief that his disclosures revealed misconduct described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) is whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence wrongdoing as defined by the WPA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By virtue of his position as the agency's Information Technology Clearing Officer, the appellant was tasked with approving contract documents that contained computer requirements. He observed that Mr. Nevin allowed the contracting company to create statements of work and other contract documents, which created a conflict of interest because the statements of work were written in such a way as to favor the contracting company. Although the appellant has not asserted a violation of a particular law, rule, or regulation, his allegations regarding conflicts of interest and mishandling of statements of work demonstrate the appellant's reasonable belief of a violation of the agency's acquisition regulations. <span class="Italic">See Schneider v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 13 (2005). The agency's regulations clearly state that procurement transactions should to the extent practicable be open and free competition and should be devoid of organizational conflicts of interest or noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition. 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 74.43; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 48 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 307.7108 (describing the agency's statements of work). The regulations further state, "contractors that develop or draft grant applications, or contract specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements." 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 74.43. Thus, the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that Mr. Nevin violated the agency's procurement regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stiles v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 263, &#x00B6; 25 (2011); <span class="Italic">Schnell v. Department of the Army</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 20 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Illegal Use of Government Funds Disclosure</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the second disclosure, that Mr. Nevin illegally used government funds to send contractors to training programs, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of a violation of law. <span class="Italic">See LaChance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 1999);<span class="Italic"> Horton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 234, &#x00B6; 17 (2007) (to establish a nonfrivolous allegation of a protected disclosure, the appellant must demonstrate a reasonable belief of a violation of law but does not have to prove an actual violation to establish jurisdiction). The appellant has asserted firsthand knowledge of this activity, alleging specifically that Mr. Nevin paid for several contractors to attend training programs and that, at least on one occasion, Mr. Nevin registered a federal employee to attend training and instead sent a contractor in his place. It was reasonable for the appellant to believe that using government funds in an unauthorized manner for non-employees to attend training violated the law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 641 (prohibiting conversion of public money for unauthorized use);<span class="Italic"> Rubendall v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2006) ("[t]here is no <span class="Italic">de minimus</span> exception for the violation of any law, rule, or regulation aspect of the WPA's protected disclosure standard."); <span class="Italic">see also DiGiorgio v.

Even assuming that these standards 'would be included in any core courses at the 101 level,' as the appellant <span id="Page_3601"></span>contends, we find no basis in the record for concluding that they are agency laws, rules or regulations.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A report to OPM that an agency violated its statutory responsibilities under delegated appointment authority qualified as a whistleblower disclosure, <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Labor,</span> AT-1221-10-0907-W-1 (NP 5/26/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that she made a disclosure that she reasonably believed evidenced a violation of one of the circumstances described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). The appellant is a GS-690-12 Industrial Hygienist with the Occupational Safety &#x0026; Health Administration (OSHA). She alleged that she disclosed to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that OSHA misused its authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104 and engaged in improper recruiting and hiring practices by treating positions in the GS-018 job series including Safety Specialists as interdisciplinary with positions in her job series and the GS-803 job series including Safety Engineers. She submitted her October 10, 2007 letter to OPM to support her allegation. Further, she provided OPM's December 5, 2007 response in which it stated that, although OSHA had determined that the GS-803 Safety Engineer and GS-690 Industrial Hygienist positions were similar professional occupations with "positive" education requirements and could be performed by an individual in either discipline, the GS-018 Safety and Occupational Health Management position was classified as "Administrative and Management" and would be advertised under a separate announcement from the professional positions. We find that the appellant's allegation satisfies the second IRA jurisdictional requirement because she has made a nonfrivolous allegation of a violation of law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ganski v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 32, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A regulation prohibiting waste or inefficiency may be violated even though the waste is not gross. The Board did not determine when disclosures of waste might properly be protected because the disclosure evidences a violation of a regulation, even though it does not rise to the level of a separately protected disclosure of gross waste or mismanagement, but the Board found reprisal when an employee complained of a regulatory violation that he thought occurred when the agency entered into financial settlements of unmeritorious EEO complaints. <span class="Italic">Garst v. Dept. of Army</span>, 56 MSPR 371, 382 (1993), <span class="Italic">remanded for reconsideration</span>, 60 MSPR 514 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Costello</span>, 75 MSPR 562, 582 (1997), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Costello v. MSPB</span>, 182 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1999), concluded that a violation of regulations included a violation of an agency standard of conduct prohibiting cursing, i.e., profanity. The substance of the allegation was not diminished because profanity was used by other employees when the allegation went to the conduct of a supervisor who "should be held to a higher standard of conduct than a subordinate employee and set an example for other employees to follow." Violation of agency rules and regulations established IRA jurisdiction when the allegations related to a manager's failure to adhere to requirements concerning the issuance of performance appraisals and concerning leave administration. Given the violation of rules established by the appellant's allegations, the Board found it unnecessary to address whether the same complaints evidenced an abuse of authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kraushaar v. USDA</span>, 87 MSPR 378, 383 &#x00B6; 11 (2000), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Kraushaar v. USDA</span>, 60 Fed. Appx. 295 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">That alleged conduct was, moreover, a violation of laws, rules, or regulations. Army regulations prohibit "[i]ntimidating, teasing, name calling, mockery, threats of violence, harassment, [or] taunting." Army Reg. 600-20, Personnel-General: Army Command Policy, para. 4-19a(2) (24 July 2020). And statute prohibits "[a]ny deliberate or repeated unwelcome verbal comment or gesture of a sexual nature by any member of the armed forces or civilian employee of the Department of Defense." 10 U.S.C. 1561(e)(3). A disinterested observer could believe Col. Hudson's alleged conduct violated both these provisions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But cf. Edwards v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 2022 MSPB 9 (2022) (implying that EEO issues should be directed through EEO rather than IRA processes).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Coppens v. DOD</span>, 117 Fed. Appx. 110, 113 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), concerning an allegation that a travel policy violated OPM regulations, the court drew a distinction--a distinction that unfortunately was not explained--) between disclosure of an unlawful policy and disclosure of unlawful conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Mr. Coppens's disclosure concerned the illegality of the travel policy, rather than the existence of the travel policy, the AJ's determination that there was no WPA protected disclosure is supported by substantial evidence. While one may contend that disclosure of illegality is as likely to result in employee retaliation as disclosure of conduct, this argument is irrelevant because the clear intent of the statute is limited to disclosures of <span class="Italic">conduct</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although internal disagreements are often not considered to constitute whistleblowing, they may be protected disclosures if they actually constitute allegations of violations of law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Heining v.
