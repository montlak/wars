<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-224"><span class="space">b.</span> Conversion of Appointment</h5>
<p class="noindent">An employee may receive only the pay, benefits, and tenure of the position he held by lawful agency appointment. An arbitrator may not convert an appointment contrary to or without authority of statute, regulation, or the now defunct FPM. Lacking authority in the FPM, an arbitrator may not convert the appointment of a seasonal employee to a part-time position. <span class="Italic">IRS, Indianapolis Dist. and NTEU Chap. 49</span>, 29 FLRA 232, 234-37 (1987); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 3438</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-37.html">71 FLRA 205</a>, 207-08 (2019) (Member Abbot concurring; Member DuBester dissenting) (concurrence of Member Abbott commented on invalidity, as a matter of classification, of arbitrator's award having the effect of converting the grievant from an excepted service temporary appointee to a competitive service permanent position). FLRA concluded that neither provisions of the late FPM nor judicial or administrative decisions compelled an agency to convert a seasonal employee to permanent status after one year of employment, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 68 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Andover Serv. Ctr.</span>, 48 FLRA 1329, 1333, 1334-36 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the award is contrary to FPM chapter 340.&#x2003;The Union concedes that the Arbitrator correctly found that nothing in chapter 340 specifically requires that a seasonal employee be converted to permanent status after being on duty for more than 12 months. However, the Union maintains that the award is nevertheless deficient because the Arbitrator improperly distinguished the treatment of seasonal employees from the treatment of intermittent employees, who are entitled to conversion to part-time status after a certain length of service....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Union has failed to establish that the award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Award Is Not Contrary to the FPM</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no merit in the Union's exception that the award is deficient on the ground that it is contrary to FPM chapter 340. FPM chapter 340, subchapter 2 provides guidance concerning the use of seasonal employees. The Union has not established that the Arbitrator's award is inconsistent with any portion of FPM chapter 340 and, in particular, has failed to show that the regulation requires the conversion of the grievant in this case from seasonal to permanent status. As the Arbitrator found and the Union concedes, nothing in FPM chapter 340, subchapter 2 requires that seasonal employees be converted to permanent status after having worked for more than 365 days.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Federal Grain Inspection Service</span> [46 FLRA 189 (1992)] is misplaced. The Arbitrator did not err in distinguishing that case from the instant case. Rather, the Arbitrator correctly observed that <span class="Italic">Federal Grain</span> <span class="Italic">Inspection Service</span> concerned the claims of on-call employees that they were entitled to conversion to permanent full-time status pursuant to FPM chapter 340, subchapter 3 and to the individual employment agreements covering those employees. There is nothing in <span class="Italic">Federal Grain Inspection Service</span> that required the Arbitrator to find that the grievant in this case must be converted to permanent status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we conclude that the Union's contention that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to FPM chapter 340 constitutes mere disagreement with the Arbitrator's interpretation of that FPM provision and with her conclusions based thereon. As such, the exception provides no basis for finding the award deficient...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Award Is Not Contrary to Law</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We construe the Union's exception that the award is contrary to principles of <span class="Italic">de facto</span> employment as a contention that the award is contrary to law under section 7122(a) of the Statute. We find that the Union has failed to establish that the award is deficient on this basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the two Federal court decisions cited by the Union, we find that neither decision supports the Union's contention that the grievant <span id="page_2100"></span>was entitled to conversion to permanent status by virtue of having worked for more than 365 days. In <span class="Italic">Stevens</span> [687 F.2d 158 (6th Cir. 1982)], the court did not establish a broad principle of <span class="Italic">de facto</span> employment that would be applicable to the circumstances of the present case. Rather, the court found that, for purposes of the Vietnam Era Veteran's Readjustment Assistance Act, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, the mere designation of a position as temporary, in itself, does not exempt the position from the Act if the other characteristics of the position show that the position is not temporary. In this case, however, there is no question that the grievant was in fact, as well as designation, a seasonal employee from January 25 through July 15, 1989, and a temporary employee from July 16, 1989, through May 31, 1990. The issue decided by the Arbitrator concerned whether the grievant was entitled to conversion to permanent status under either the FPM or the parties' agreement, not whether the grievant was denied conversion because her position was incorrectly designated. The Arbitrator found that there was no entitlement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Dove</span> [161 Ct. Cl. 768 (1963)], the Court of Claims found that the then Civil Service Commission (CSC) improperly denied a when-actually-employed (WAE) employee retirement rights because the CSC erroneously calculated the employee's length of service and did not follow its own standards for crediting the work time of WAE employees. In this case, as the Arbitrator found, there was no showing that the Agency failed to comply with any regulation or provision of a collective bargaining agreement that required the Agency to convert the grievant to permanent status after working for more than 365 days. We find nothing in either <span class="Italic">Stevens</span> or <span class="Italic">Dove</span> to support the Union's claim that the award is deficient on the ground that the Arbitrator failed to apply any legal principle of <span class="Italic">de facto</span> employment established by Federal courts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, we find that the Union's exception has no support in the cited decisions of the Authority and the FLRC. In <span class="Italic">Cincinnati District</span> [47 FLRA 207 (1993)] the Authority denied the agency's exceptions to an arbitrator's award of backpay pursuant to a provision in a negotiated agreement to employees who had been assigned higher-graded duties. In <span class="Italic">Indianapolis District</span> [29 FLRA 232 (1987)], the Authority initially found that the arbitrator erred in finding that an employee had been converted from a seasonal part-time position to a permanent part-time position and awarding backpay to the employee. On reconsideration, the Authority determined that the Arbitrator's finding regarding the grievant's status was supported by the record and reversed the previous decision. In <span class="Italic">Jacksonville District</span> [6 FLRC 558 (1978)], the FLRC found that an arbitrator properly enforced a mandatory provision in the parties' collective bargaining agreement to require the temporary retroactive promotion of an employee assigned higher-graded duties. We find nothing in any of those decisions that establishes a principle of <span class="Italic">de facto</span> employment requiring the Arbitrator in this case to order the grievant converted to permanent status.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator could direct an agency to rescind conversion of employees from a scheduled to an "as needed" basis, if the remedy was ordered to correct reprisals (that is, prohibited personnel practices) against employees who had complained of improper personnel practices. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Dallas and NTEU Chap. 140</span>, 37 FLRA 1022, 1030-32 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">USDA, Fed. Grain Inspection Serv. and AFGE Local 3157</span>, 46 FLRA 189, 193-95 (1992) (arbitrator could call for agency to honor contract to convert employees from on-call to permanent status "if possible," but arbitrator could not direct immediate conversions, rather than conversion as positions became available, without violating management's right to determine numbers, types and grades of positions in accordance with &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1)).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 45 FLRA 1411, 1416-17 (1992), considered whether grievants could require an agency to convert their appointments from temporary to permanent positions in accordance with the provisions of a DOD Directive. FLRA concluded that the arbitrator properly entertained the grievance and properly directed the requested conversions. The decision involved two essential points: first, whether the grievance was barred because it involved an appointment; second, whether the award interfered with the right of management to determine the number and types of employees appointed, a matter the agency claimed not to have elected to bargain over with the union. The second point is discussed earlier in this chapter as to the ability of an arbitrator to enforce agency rules. FLRA concluded that the DOD Directive requiring conversion could be enforced through arbitration, as if a waiver of bargaining objections occurred, as long as the regulation remained in effect. As to the first point, FLRA distinguished an appointment and the conversion of an appointment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance alleging that the Agency had violated DoD Directive 1400.13, as it pertains to conversions of Agency teachers with temporary appointments to permanent appointments. The Union claimed that a group of teachers in temporary positions was entitled to have been converted to permanent positions because each teacher had met the conditions of the directive for conversion as of the beginning of the 1990-91 school year. The Union argued that under the directive, conversion was mandatory and that the Agency had violated the directive by failing to convert the teachers. The Agency denied the grievance on the basis that the grievance was not grievable and arbitrable. The Agency claimed that the grievance concerned conversion from temporary to permanent appointments and that, therefore, the grievance was precluded because it concerned appointments....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Agency fails to establish that the award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Council of Field Labor Locals of the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO and United States Department of Labor</span>, 4 FLRA 376 (1980) (<span class="Italic">DOL</span>), the Authority specifically addressed the meaning of the term "appointment" as used in section 7121(c)(4) of the Statute. The Authority examined the legislative history of the Statute and relevant laws and regulations. On the basis of its examination, the Authority determined that "general usage of the term 'appointment' refers to the action which takes place at the time an individual is initially hired into the Federal service." 4 FLRA at 381. In <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, the Authority applied the term "appointment" in section 7121(c)(4) consistent with this common usage in finding that a grievance over the separation of a probationer was not precluded by the Statute. The Authority adhered to this application of section 7121(c)(4) in <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency and American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> 1812, 32 FLRA 739, 748 (1988), in concluding that a grievance concerning the temporary assignment of an employee was not precluded by the Statute. We will continue to adhere to this usage of the term "appointment" in applying section 7121(c)(4) of the Statute. Accordingly, because the grievance in this case did not concern the initial appointments of the grievants, we conclude that no basis is provided for finding that the grievance in this case is precluded by section 7121(c)(4) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because this exception concerns the Arbitrator's determination that the grievance was not precluded by section 7121(c)(4) of the Statute, we agree with the Union that the Agency's reliance on the FPM definition of conversion in FPM Supplement 296-33 is misplaced. FPM Supplement 296-33 in no manner specifies that grievances over conversions from temporary appointments to permanent appointments concern appointments within the meaning of section 7121(c)(4) of the Statute. In our view, the Agency is merely disagreeing with the Arbitrator's reasoning and conclusions in determining that the grievance in this case was not precluded by the Statute. Such disagreement provides no basis for finding the award deficient....</p>
<p class="noindent">Another DODDS decision distinguished the authority to secure through arbitration a conversion of an appointment and the statutory bar against grievances involving initial appointments, <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 51 FLRA 210, 210-14 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant, an elementary school teacher, worked for several years in the Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS) System. During that time, she served a trial period and was converted to permanent status. She resigned from her position for the 1990-91 school year, and was rehired by the Agency in the fall of 1991. After being rehired, the grievant was informed that the Agency had placed her in a temporary position. The Union then filed a grievance claiming that, under a Department of Defense (DoD) regulation, the grievant was entitled to a permanent position because of her previous permanent status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the Arbitrator, the Agency argued, as relevant here, that the grievance was not arbitrable because it concerned the grievant's "appointment," within the meaning of section 7121(c)(4) of the Statute. The Agency claimed that because the grievant was returning after her absence during the 1990-91 school year, her rehiring constituted an "appointment." The Agency argued that the definition of "conversion" set forth in the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) supported its claim that the grievance did not concern a conversion, but rather an appointment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rejecting this argument, and citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense, Office of Dependents Schools and Overseas Education</span> <span class="Italic">Association</span>, 45 FLRA 1411 (1992) (<span class="Italic">OEA</span>), the Arbitrator determined that the grievance over management's failure to give the grievant permanent status and place her into a permanent position was not precluded either by section 7121(c)(4) of the Statute or by the FPM. On the merits, the Arbitrator sustained the grievance and ordered that the grievant be made whole and "converted retroactively to permanent status effective the day of her rehire[,]" with backpay, benefits, and interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(c)(4) provides that the scope of a grievance procedure negotiated under the Statute may not extend to any grievance concerning an "examination, certification, or appointment[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that the term "appointment" in section 7121(c)(4) relates to the initial entry of an applicant into the Federal service. <span class="Italic">See, for example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Council of Field Labor Locals of the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO and United States Department of Labor</span>, 4 FLRA 376, 381 (1980) (<span class="Italic">DOL</span>); <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1636 and U.S. Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau, Albuquerque, New Mexico</span>, 48 FLRA 511 (1993) (<span class="Italic">National Guard Bureau</span>); <span id="page_2101"></span><span class="Italic">OEA</span>; <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1812</span>, 32 FLRA 739 (1988). The Claims Court also has construed the term "appointment" in section 7121(c)(4) of the Statute as relating only to an individual's initial appointment. <span class="Italic">Brammer v. United States</span>, 24 Cl. Ct. 487, 492 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Brammer</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that the grievant in this case is not contesting any matter in connection with her <span class="Italic">initial</span> <span class="Italic">appointment</span> to a position in the Federal service, or with the Agency. Instead, the grievant disputes the status of the position to which she was <span class="Italic">reappointed</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The D.C. Circuit has distinguished between appointments and reappointments for purposes of section 7121(c)(4). In <span class="Italic">Suzal v. Director, United States Information Agency</span>, 32 F.3d 574 (D.C. Cir. 1994), the plaintiff, a Turkish citizen who had been employed by the USIA under a series of 1-year appointments, filed suit alleging various Constitutional and other claims when the USIA decided not to renew his appointment. On appeal, the D.C. Circuit concluded that the plaintiff's collective bargaining agreement provided the exclusive avenue of redress. In so doing, the court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">To be sure, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(c)(4), the collective bargaining agreement excludes from the negotiated procedure any grievance concerning an "examination, certification or appointment."... But we read the word "appointment" in the context of both statute and agreement to refer only to <span class="Italic">initial</span> appointments, not to reappointments. The FLRA appears to agree. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, [<span class="Italic">National Guard Bureau; OEA; cf. Brammer</span>].</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 580 (emphasis in original)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency cites no authority for its claim that the grievance in this case concerns an appointment within the context of section 7121(c)(4). In this regard, the Agency's reliance on the FPM's definition of "conversion" to support its claim that the grievance in this case involves an appointment is misplaced. As the Authority stated in OEA, the definition of conversion contained in FPM Supplement 296-33, subchapter 11-2 "'in no manner specifies that grievances over conversions from temporary appointments to permanent appointments concern appointments within the meaning of section 7121(c)(4) of the Statute.'" 45 FLRA at 1416-17. The Agency's reliance on two Comptroller General decisions to support its claim that the grievance concerned an appointment is also misplaced. Those decisions were not based on an interpretation of the term "appointment" in section 7121(c)(4) and did not concern the individuals' reappointments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the award orders the Agency to rescind, cancel or change the manner of its selection of the grievant for the teaching position. Moreover, the Agency does not dispute that it determined that the grievant was a qualified candidate and had exercised its right to select her on that basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency's exception relates only to the Arbitrator's order requiring the Agency to convert the grievant from a temporary to a permanent status, the exception does not establish that the award implicates management's right to select a candidate for a position from among properly ranked and certified candidates, or from any other appropriate source under section 7106(a)(2)(C). Moreover, because the Arbitrator did not require the Agency to take or refrain from taking any particular actions with regard to the selection of the grievant for a position, the award does not otherwise interfere with management's right under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Agriculture, Federal Grain Inspection Service and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3157</span>, 46 FLRA 189, 193-94 (1992); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Louisville District and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 36 FLRA 375, 384-88 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we conclude that the Arbitrator's award does not interfere with management's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1843 and VAMC Northport</span>, 51 FLRA 444, 447 (1995), pointed out the distinction between a statutory bar involving grievances over initial appointments and the arbitrability of grievances concerning conversions of initial appointments:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(c)(4) of the Statute precludes grievances over "any examination, certification, or appointment[.]" The Authority has held that the term "appointment" in section 7121(c)(4) relates to the initial entry of an applicant into the Federal service. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense Dependents Schools, Kaiserslautern, Germany and Overseas Education Association</span>, 51 FLRA No. 23, slip op. at 3 (1995). Thus, section 7121(c)(4) will not preclude a grievance that does not concern an initial appointment into the Federal service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3-5 (and cases cited therein). This case does not concern the grievant's initial appointment into the Federal service and, therefore, does not concern an appointment within the meaning of section 7121(c)(4). Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
