<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-18"><span class="space">9.</span> Period of Receipt of OWCP Benefits</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Losh v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 150, 152-53 (1988), determined that service credit toward disability retirement accrued during a period that the employee receives OWCP benefits--time deemed LWOP--if the employee returned to employment when OWCP benefits ceased:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge found, it is undisputed that the appellant received OWCP payments from September 26, 1974, to May 12, 1986, and that he did not return to duty with his employing agency upon cessation of OWCP payments. Rather, he elected to retire and have his disability retirement annuity reinstated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's contentions, we find that OPM was correct in determining that he was not entitled to service credit for the period of time he received OWCP payments. As pointed out by OPM, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(b) provides<span class="Italic">, inter alia</span>, that generally "the service of an employee [for purposes of calculating the amount of the annuity] shall be credited from the date of original employment to the date of separation [on] which title to annuity is based...." Thus, the appropriate date for calculating the appellant's service credit was September 26, 1974, the date upon which he was separated from his position with the Department of Defense by disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsection 8332(f) of Title 5 does provide one of a number of exceptions to this general rule and provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that an individual who has received benefits under Subchapter I of Chapter 81 of Title 5 (OWCP benefits) can, under certain circumstances, receive service credit for the time he or she received such benefits. However, as the administrative judge correctly concluded, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f) requires that, before an appellant can be entitled to service credit for a period of time during which he or she received OWCP benefits, that individual is required to return to duty upon cessation of the OWCP benefits. The relevant portion of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f) provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">An employee or former employee who returns to duty after a period of separation</span> is deemed, for the purpose of this subsection, to have been in a leave of absence without pay for that part of the period in which he received benefits [from OWCP] ....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis added). Section 8151(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">In the event the individual resumes employment</span> with the Federal Government, the entire time during which the employee was receiving compensation under this chapter shall be credited to the employee for the purposes of within grade step increases, retention purposes, and other rights and benefits based upon length of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the plain language of both statutes is unambiguous, and requires that, in order for an individual to receive service credit for those periods during which he or she received OWCP benefits, he or she must return to duty upon cessation of those benefits, regardless of whether he was an "employee or former employee" during the time he received such benefits. <span class="Italic">See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,</span> 421 U.S. 723, 733, 737, 748-49 (1975); <span class="Italic">Caminetti v. United States,</span> 242 U.S. 470, 485-86 (1917). The appellant failed to return to duty upon cessation of his OWCP benefits and is not, therefore, entitled to service credit for the period of time in question.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. OPM</span>, 99 MSPR 18, 23 &#x00B6; 11 (2005) ("We find that the plain language of these statutory sections provides service credit to an employee who has returned to work following recovery from a compensable injury for only the period of time that he was in receipt of OWCP benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8151(a), 8332(f);<span class="Italic"> Phillips v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 420, 422-23 (1985)."), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP No. 05-3330) ("Williams nevertheless argues, as he did before the Board, that he is entitled to service credit for the entire period of his separation under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.107, which provides, in pertinent part, that 'an employee absent because of...compensable injury is generally entitled to...receive [&#8197;] credit for the entire period of absence for purposes of rights and benefits based upon seniority and length of service....' The Board concluded that 'this broad language cannot be relied on to award appellant service credit...in light of the clear language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) and 8332(f) that an employee who has returned to work following recovery from a compensable injury is entitled to service credit only for the period of time that he was in receipt of OWCP benefits.' We do not agree that the statutory provisions on which the Board relied preclude retirement credit for the period that an employee receives CSRA disability benefits. However, the regulation cannot be read to require retirement credit for any period other than that during which the employee receives OWCP benefits. The regulations define 'injury' for the purposes of the subchapter as 'a compensable injury sustained under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, subchapter 1....' 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102")); <span class="Italic">Henderson v.

The administrative judge erroneously cited 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(d), which deals with creditable service under the Federal Employees' Retirement System, for this proposition.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pfander v. OPM</span>, CH-0831-12-0123-I-1 (NP 10/26/2012), declined to direct service credit for a lengthy period of OWCP benefits following the appellant's disability retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's finding that the appellant is not entitled to service credit for the nearly 35-year period during which he received Office of Workers' Compensation Program (OWCP) benefits following his disability retirement in March 1975. In particular, he asserts that, in making this finding, the administrative judge erred in relying on the second sentence of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f), which provides that, for an individual to be entitled to credit for service during a period when he received OWCP benefits, he is required to return to duty upon cessation of the OWCP benefits. The appellant asserts that the second sentence of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f) is inapplicable here because it applies only to individuals who recover from their injuries sufficiently to return to work, whereas he was never able to return to work. He claims that he is entitled to credit for the period following his disability retirement during which he was receiving OWCP benefits pursuant to the first sentence of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f), which states as follows: "Credit shall be allowed for leaves of absence without pay granted an employee while performing military service or while receiving benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4117"></span>This argument is unpersuasive. The period during which the appellant was receiving OWCP benefits following the effective date of his disability retirement cannot properly be characterized as a "leave of absence without pay." Thus, the appellant is not entitled to credit for that period pursuant to the first sentence of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f). Moreover, as he appears to concede, the appellant is not entitled to credit for that period pursuant to the second sentence of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f) because he did not return to duty upon the cessation of his OWCP benefits. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant is not entitled to service credit for the period of time that he received OWCP benefits after the effective date of his disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee who returns to service after a compensable injury may not be able to meet the statutory service requirements for a new or redetermined annuity because of the peculiarities of crediting of leave without pay during periods covered by workers' compensation, <span class="Italic">Saxton v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 46, 47-50 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following injuries sustained on the job, the appellant, in May 1977, retired on disability under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337 from his GS-8 position of Quality Control Specialist with the Department of the Air Force (Air Force). On November 12, 1977, he elected to receive workers' compensation benefits under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 81, in lieu of an annuity. On June 1, 1987, the appellant was reemployed by the Air Force in a GS-5 position of Environmental and Safety Clerk after partially recovering from his compensable injury, but continued to receive workers' compensation benefits, albeit in a reduced amount. He resigned from this position on February 3, 1988, and applied for a voluntary retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its reconsideration decision dated February 16, 1989, OPM found that the appellant was reinstated as a disabled annuitant, effective February 5, 1988, because there was no finding made, based upon medical evidence or earnings, that he was recovered from his disability or was restored to his earning capacity. Therefore, it concluded that he was not entitled to a voluntary retirement, with credit under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f) for the time he was on the rolls of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), because he was an annuitant under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed OPM's decision to the Board's Denver Regional Office. Following a hearing, the administrative judge found that OPM correctly determined that the appellant was not eligible for a discontinued service retirement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b) because he did not work for a period of one year after his reemployment. However, relying on an OPM policy interpretation of the applicability of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f) and the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 MSPR 420 (1985), she concluded that he was a reemployed compensationer under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f), and not a reemployed annuitant, and, therefore, he was entitled to a voluntary retirement annuity with service credit for the period he received OWCP benefits. She also found, relying on the OPM policy interpretation, that, since his position at the time of his work-incurred injury was a GS-8, the appellant was entitled to creditable service at that rate for computing both his length of service and his "high-three" average salary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, OPM concurs with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant was not entitled to a discontinued service annuity, but argues that she erred in finding that he was not a retired annuitant covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a), and that his time on the rolls of OWCP was creditable for computing his average pay at the grade level of the position he held when he was injured.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f), an employee or former employee is entitled to leaves of absence without pay while receiving OWCP benefits, and upon returning to duty, is deemed to have been on a leave of absence without pay for such periods. However, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a) provides that, where an annuitant becomes reemployed, his service on and after the date of reemployment is covered under this subchapter, except for certain noted exceptions, including an annuitant whose annuity is terminated because of his recovery or restoration of earning capacity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant was covered under Section 8332(f), and not Section 8344(a), the administrative judge relied upon the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Phillips.</span> In <span class="Italic">Phillips,</span> the employee had been granted disability retirement in 1976 and elected to receive OWCP benefits in lieu of an annuity. He was later reemployed by his agency as a recovered employee. Within a year, however, the agency proposed his removal for failing required training and he elected discontinued service retirement. Claiming a recurrence of his prior illness, the employee refiled for disability retirement and OWCP benefits. The Board found, as here, that the employee was ineligible to receive a discontinued service annuity because he did not meet the one year of reemployment requirement in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b). However, it found that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(b), he was entitled to a <span class="Italic">new</span> disability retirement, based upon his separation from his reemployed position, and to have the entire time he received OWCP benefits credited as a leave of absence without pay. The Board expressly noted in that case that, "Upon his restoration in 1981, appellant's OWCP payments ceased and OPM agreed retroactively that he was a recovered employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(d)."[3] <span class="Italic">See Phillips,</span> 29 MSPR at 422<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(d), if an annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity recovers before age 60, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or one year after the date of a medical examination showing the recovery, whichever is earlier. If such employee is restored to an earning capacity fairly comparable to the current rate of pay of the position occupied at the time of retirement, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 180 days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is so restored, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the appellant in the present case was receiving OWCP payments during the entire period following his reemployment by the Air Force. Consequently, he could not have been found to be recovered. <span class="Italic">See Losh v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 37 MSPR 150, 152-53 (1988) (for an employee or former employee to receive service credit for periods during which he received OWCP benefits, he must return to duty upon cessation of the OWCP benefits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, the appellant was only entitled to reinstatement of his annuity resulting from his disability retirement in 1976, and could receive no credit for the time he was on the rolls of OWCP.<span class="Italic"> See Losh,</span> 37 MSPR 1t 153<span class="Italic">.</span> Accordingly, OPM's decision finding that the appellant is a reemployed annuitant is sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Receipt of concurrent payment for disability retirement and OWCP pay continuation is prohibited, <span class="Italic">Dela Casa v. OPM</span>, 60 MSPR 287, 291-92 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, it is undisputed that the appellant was represented by an attorney in the OWCP proceedings. It is not clear if her attorney advised her about the prohibition against receiving concurrent OWCP and CSRS benefits, but if he did not, he should have. The prohibition against dual benefits is explicit and unambiguous; it is set forth amid the statutory provisions governing OWCP benefits, and is repeated in the chapter governing CSRS benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8116(a) (with exceptions not pertinent here, an individual may not receive "salary, pay, or remuneration of any type from the United States" while receiving payments from OWCP); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(f)(2) ("[a]n individual is not entitled to receive an annuity under this subchapter and a concurrent benefit under subchapter I of chapter 81 [of title 5, U.S.C.] on account of the death of the same person").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have long held that a party appearing before the Board is responsible for the acts and omissions of her chosen representative, even where the representative gives erroneous legal advice that causes the party to lose a potentially valuable right. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Puckett v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 25, 27 (1992); W<span class="Italic">allace v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 432, 432-33, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 864 F.2d 149 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table). The principle that a party must accept the consequences of relying on her representative's actions and advice applies with equal force here. The appellant either knew, or should have been advised by her attorney, that she could not accept OWCP benefits while retaining her CSRS benefits.</p>
