<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-24"><span class="space">8.</span> Augmentation of Standard; Subjective Standard</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Like musical chords, standards may be augmented, but they are rarely diminished. Congress intended both that employees be protected from arbitrary labeling of their work as unacceptable and that employees be made aware in advance of what was expected of their performance. But Congress also intended agencies to have flexibility in devising methods for assessing performance. Congress limited the Board's review to determining whether agencies abused their discretion in establishing the standards.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although standards must be sufficiently specific to provide that "firm benchmark toward which the employee must aim his performance, and not an elusive goal that the agency may find the employee met or failed to meet at its pleasure," <span class="Italic">Donaldson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 27 MSPR 293, 298 (1985), agencies may give content to an employee's performance standards by informing him of specific work requirements through various methods. These may include written instructions regarding the employee's duties, specific advice to an employee concerning deficiencies in his work and methods to improve his performance, memoranda describing to the employee what constitutes unacceptable performance, and agency responses to the employee's questions concerning his performance. <span class="Italic">Melnick v. DHUD</span>, 42 MSPR 93, 98-99 (1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Salmon v. SSA</span>, 663 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-16-017.html#sec9-16">Objectivity</a>"); <span class="Italic">Romero v. EEOC</span>, 55 MSPR 527, 535 (1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Baker v. DLA</span>, 25 MSPR 614, 617 (1985)); <span class="Italic">Cranwill v. VA</span>, 52 MSPR 610, 616-17 (1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Donaldson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 27 MSPR 293, 298 (1985)); <span class="Italic">Benavides v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 43 MSPR 468, 471-72 (1990) (training instructor: the agency supplemented the standards by written memoranda and counseling); <span class="Italic">Donaldson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 27 MSPR 293, 298 n.1 (1985) ("<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baker v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 25 MSPR 614 (1985), in which the Board held that an agency whose performance standards require that the employee 'usually' or 'frequently' perform at a certain level, may give sufficient specificity to its standards to meet the statutory requirements by written and oral instructions."); <span class="Italic">Baker v. DLA</span>, 25 MSPR 614, 617 (1985) (enumerating means of informing employees of their performance requirements: "Congress intended performance standards to notify an employee in advance what is expected of his performance. The Board has recognized, however, that an agency may give content to an employee's performance standards by informing him of specific work requirements through other methods. These may include written instructions regarding the employee's duties, evidence that an employee was informed specifically of deficiencies in his work and of methods by which he could improve his performance, memoranda describing to an employee what constitutes unacceptable performance, and agency responses to an employee's questions concerning his performance."). <span class="italic">But see Feesago v. DOD</span>, SF-0432-16-0458-I-1 (NP 8/10/2022) (management changed requirements of standards during the PIP in a manner that did not directly relate to deficiencies identified in the PIP; and "during the PIP, the appellant's supervisor focused on conducting 'walk throughs' of the produce department and meticulously documenting instances in which she found that the appellant's performance was deficient instead of offering her assistance or suggestions as to how to improve her performance").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to counseling during the PIP as a means of further detailing standards, <span class="Italic">France v. Dept. of Energy</span>, SF-0432-12-0299-I-1 (NP 7/18/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An agency may give content to an employee's otherwise valid performance standards by informing him of specific work requirements through written instructions, information concerning deficiencies, methods of improving performance, memoranda describing unacceptable performance, and responses to his questions concerning performance. <span class="Italic">Baker v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 614, 617 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 782 F.2d 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Here, the record reflects that the agency gave the appellant copies of acceptable standards drafted by his co-workers and that his supervisor provided bi-weekly oral and written feedback on his progress in meeting the agency's expectations during the PIP. The weight of the evidence supports the administrative judge's findings that the agency provided sufficient content during the PIP to cure the lack of specificity in the performance standards by counseling the appellant on his deficiencies and identifying specific projects and tasks and the applicable deadlines for completion, in order to achieve a minimally acceptable performance rating on Critical Element 1.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, under <span class="Italic">Clark v. SSA</span>, DC-0432-13-0106-I-1 (NP 8/7/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may give content to an employee's otherwise valid performance standards by informing him of specific work requirements through written instructions, information concerning deficiencies and methods of improving performance, memoranda describing unacceptable performance, and responses to his questions concerning performance. <span class="Italic">Baker v.

Here, the agency gave content to the appellant's performance standards both before and during the OPS....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ruiz v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 547, 550-51 (1985), provides an example of a standard for a radiologic technologist--"shielding be used at all times"--that, but for informal augmentation, could have been impermissible:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]ppellant timely challenged standard f under critical element 1 requiring that "Shielding [be] used at all times." Appellant argues that this standard is invalid because it is inconsistent with factor 3 of his position description that he must use judgment to deviate from standard procedures to compensate for individual circumstances in accordance with standard practice as well as with his testimony at the hearing that "there are often times when patients cannot be shielded and that it is the judgment of the technologist that prevails in these instances."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find that this standard constitutes an abuse of agency discretion in these circumstances. The Board has recognized that an agency may give content to an employee's performance standards by informing him of specific work requirements through other methods, including written instructions regarding the employee's duties, evidence that an employee was informed specifically of deficiencies in his work and of methods by which he could improve his performance, memoranda describing to an employee what constitutes unacceptable performance and agency responses to an employee's questions concerning his performance. <span class="Italic">See Coleman v. Department of the Army,</span> 27 MSPR 305, 310-11 (1985); <span class="Italic">Baker v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 25 MSPR 614, 617-18 (1985). Here, appellant's assertions indicate that he was cognizant of his position description as well as general practice and that he was aware that the standard required him to use shielding where appropriate to protect patients from unnecessary exposure but did not constitute an absolute requirement that shielding be used in all cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This conclusion is supported by factor 1 of his position description requiring</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--Thorough knowledge of radiation protection standards, devices, and techniques including concepts of accumulated dosage and genetic changes, effects of radiation on living organisms, and the effects of X-ray technique on patient and operator exposure in order to assure that adequate safeguards are maintained, to recognize when changes of equipment or procedures might result in increased exposure, and to recommend methods to prevent such exposure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2897"></span>Moreover, the presiding official interpreted the standard to require proper shielding as warranted by the circumstances. He found that appellant should have used shielding in the incidents set forth in the agency specifications and did not base his findings of appellant's poor performance as to that standard simply on a failure to use shielding regardless of the circumstances. In his petition appellant has not contended that the presiding official's interpretation of the standard was inconsistent with his position description of agency instructions, nor that he understood the standard to require the use of shielding regardless of the individual circumstances. Therefore, there is no showing of error which would warrant our review on this basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Performance standards were properly supplemented by a series of at least 10 weekly conferences with the employee concerning the status and deficiencies in appellant's work, his evaluators' written constructive criticism, and instructions in the margins or in responsive memos relating to his work. <span class="Italic">Mye v. Dept. of Commerce</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 88-3466). Although poorly written, partially backward, and garbled standards may be insufficient in a performance case, the deficiencies may be corrected by meticulous explanations from a supervisor of what had to be done. <span class="Italic">Sesko v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 88-3465). Should an employee contend for the first time at a hearing that she was unaware of the agency's performance expectations, the agency should be allowed to present rebuttal evidence showing how definite expectations were conveyed to the employee by her supervisors. <span class="Italic">Clarke v. DHHS</span>, 37 MSPR 63, 67 (1988). If there is no indication that the agency ever informed the employee that work errors beyond those specifically described in a performance standard would result in unacceptable performance, the agency will not prove that its standards were properly augmented or that the employee was on notice of work expectations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 340, 345 (1993). If a standard is to be augmented by a supervisor's instructions, it will not do for the supervisor's testimony to be inconsistent concerning the nature of the standard the supervisor was attempting to augment<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Nalls v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 46 MSPR 603, 608 (1991) (ALOC determination).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's occasional distress over verbal displacement of written standards was expressed in <span class="Italic">Williams v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 217, 220 (1986), involving a GS-7 Secretary demoted to GS-5 for unacceptable performance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that an agency may give content to an employee's written performance standards,...by informing the employee of the specific requirements and application of the standards to her work situation through oral counselings, performance improvement plans, and the evaluation process....&#8197;However, an agency may not orally change a written performance standard under the guise of giving content to it. The level 2 performance standard as written provides that the final product may contain two errors per page. Mr. Healton required more. An agency may not prove an employee's unacceptable performance of the critical element without regard to the written performance standard for that critical element. <span class="Italic">Blumenson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 27 MSPR 259, 261 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find that the performance standard for the critical element is invalid, we will not consider appellant's alleged deficiencies. To do so would require the Board to establish the performance standard--an action clearly exceeding the Board's authority....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At best, it must be said that the law remains such that, at least for some positions, standards at times do not really mean what they say; what is said by supervisors after the standards are issued can be of greater importance. <span class="Italic">Adkins v. DHUD</span>, 781 F.2d 891 (Fed. Cir. 1986), involving standards for a secretary, explained that if performance standards incorporate a subjective element, they can be supplemented by supervisory instruction. If the employee knows from oral instruction what is expected, he cannot defend himself by citing ambiguity in the formal standards. <span class="Italic">Rocheleau v. SEC</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 86-713); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hollins v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 46 MSPR 305, 310-11 (1990) (agency could not prove unacceptable performance through the appellant's alleged failure to interpret properly and follow ambiguous instructions from supervisory personnel). But then, as in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board occasionally determines that a bad standard apparently cannot be saved through supplemental instructions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of augmentation of subjective standards by supervisory instructions is <span class="Italic">Neal v. DLA</span>, 72 MSPR 158, 161-63 (1996), involving demotion of a supervisory quality assurance specialist:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases involving a performance-based action under 5 USC Chapter 43, the agency must prove its action was based on valid performance standards, and the Board is obliged to consider this issue, regardless of whether it has been raised by the parties. <span class="Italic">Mendez v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 62 MSPR 579, 581-82 (1994). Accordingly, the administrative judge acted properly in considering <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> the validity of the agency's performance standards. Furthermore, notwithstanding the agency's contention to the contrary, the administrative judge properly found that the invalidity of an agency's performance standards precludes consideration of an appellant's alleged performance deficiencies. <span class="Italic">See Callaway v. Department of the Army</span>, 23 MSPR 592, 597 (1984) (absent a valid performance standard, the Board cannot consider charged performance deficiencies as there is no performance standard against which to measure appellant's alleged errors). However, we find that the administrative judge erred in concluding that the agency's performance standards were invalid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency is required to establish standards which, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate appraisal of performance based on objective criteria. <span class="Italic">Romero v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 55 MSPR 527, 535 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 22 F.3d 1104 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). An agency may give content to performance standards by informing the employee of specific work requirements through written instructions, information concerning deficiencies and methods of improving performance, memoranda describing unacceptable performance, and responses to the employee's questions concerning performance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the agency charged the appellant with unacceptable performance as to Critical Element 1, "Contract Quality Assurance," and Critical Element 4, "Leadership." "Contract Quality Assurance" is described as follows: "Provides the guidance and oversight for implementation and maintenance of an effective IQUE [in-plant quality evaluation] program." The performance standard for a minimally acceptable rating under this element reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Fulfills the duties and responsibilities of the position while demonstrating a minimum degree of competence. Actions demonstrate a lack of motivation with little emphasis on attainment of organizational goals. Maintains a minimally effective system of program oversight/evaluation which requires intervention and guidance by management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Leadership" is described as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Provides effective oral and written communication, creates a cooperative work environment. Promotes teamwork and professionalism. Develops an attitude for continuous improvement and leads through delegation. Allows subordinates to express new methods/ideas and provides opportunities to validate (where practical) improvement suggestions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The performance standard for a minimally acceptable rating under this element reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Fulfills the duties and responsibilities of the position while demonstrating a minimum degree of competence. Actions demonstrate a lack of motivation with little emphasis on attainment of organizational goals. Completes leadership and employee development responsibilities which requires intervention and guidance by management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that these standards lacked "objective, measuring criteria," noting as to Critical Element 1, that "[T]he agency failed to explain what constitutes a consistent fulfillment of the appellant's duties, and did not define what degree of competence in an effective IQUE program is considered acceptable." The administrative judge found that the standard under Critical Element 4 was similarly vague, stating that "[T]he agency does not describe, for example, how oral and written communications are judged to be at an acceptable level of competence so that the appellant would know his performance was at the fully successful level." The administrative judge further found that the agency did not add content to its performance standards by means of its subsequent communications with the appellant, concluding that although these communications guided the appellant as to the actions he should have taken to improve his performance, "they did not set a benchmark at which his performance would be considered acceptable."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the fact that performance standards may call for a certain amount of subjective judgment on the part of the employee's supervisor does not automatically render them invalid, especially where, as here, the appellant's position involves the type of professional judgment which is not susceptible to a mechanical rating system<span class="Italic">. See Chaggaris v. General Services Administration</span>, 49 MSPR 249, 254 (1991). Furthermore, the record is replete with evidence of the agency's efforts to counsel the appellant regarding his performance deficiencies, and to identify for him the specific problems he needed to address in order to achieve a minimally acceptable performance rating under the two critical elements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, the agency's notice of unacceptable performance detailed the particular programs and subordinates which it charged had failed to receive effective oversight from the appellant. The appellant's supervisor, Robert Willich (Willich), testified that he met with or spoke to the appellant every two weeks during his performance improvement period (PIP), and counseled him regarding his performance deficiencies. Willich and other supervisors also provided the appellant with memoranda and other written feedback regarding these deficiencies, and the manner in which he could cure them. The appellant himself indicated in his testimony that he understood what was expected of him under critical elements 1 and 4, and that he was aware of the performance areas that were of particular concern to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency's performance standards were not <span id="Page_2898"></span>impermissibly vague, and that the administrative judge should have determined whether the agency proved the appellant's unacceptable performance by substantial evidence. Because we find that this is a determination best made by the initial finder of fact, we remand the case for an adjudication on the merits of the agency's demotion action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Neal, supra</span>, was relied on in <span class="italic">Hill v. DHS</span>, AT-0432-16-0643-I-1 (NP 9/14/2022), validating a subjective standard for an IT manager as that standard was augmented through instructions in a PIP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant's performance standards, as set forth in Core Competencies 1 and 6, were not valid because they lacked qualitative or quantitative benchmarks for "how well and how often" the appellant had to meet the standards. The fact that performance standards may call for a certain amount of subjective judgment on the part of the appellant's supervisor does not automatically render them invalid, especially when, as here, the appellant's position involves the type of professional judgment that is not susceptible to a mechanical rating system. <span class="italic">Neal v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 158, 162 (1996); <span class="italic">see Wilson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 770 F.2d 1048, 1055-56 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (recognizing that "some tasks may be rated only with a certain modicum of subjective judgment"). Here, the appellant served as the Branch Chief of the regional IT division, supervising approximately 14 employees, and both the technical and supervisory nature of his work called for a degree of independence and discretion that warranted less objectivity and specificity in his performance standards. <span class="italic">See Greer v. Department of the Army</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 477, 483 (1998) ("[W]ith greater discretion and independence reposed in the incumbent of a position comes less objectivity and specificity in the position's performance standards.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's findings, we find that any lack of specificity in the appellant's performance standards was cured when the agency gave content to the performance standards by providing the appellant with supplemental standards in the PIP and providing oral and written feedback during the period in which the PIP was in effect. An agency may give content to performance standards by informing the appellant of specific work requirements through written instructions, information concerning deficiencies and methods of improving performance, memoranda describing unacceptable performance, and responses to the appellant's questions concerning performance. <span class="italic">Romero v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 527, 535 (1992), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 22 F.3d 1104 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). In particular, the PIP informed the appellant of his performance deficiencies under each core competency at issue and outlined seven "improvement actions" under Core Competency 1 and four such actions under Core Competency 6 that he was to complete during the period in which the PIP was in effect to perform at an acceptable level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency failed to set forth the minimum level of performance that the appellant was required to meet because the actions set forth in the PIP did not include performance measures and did not inform the appellant of the minimum level of performance that he was required to meet to achieve acceptable performance. To the contrary, we find that each improvement action set forth in the PIP set forth sufficient benchmarks toward which the appellant was to aim his performance. Each action identified a communication or written product that the appellant was to complete during the period in which the PIP was in effect. Each action further identified required content for each communication or written product. Although the appellant disputed the validity of two actions under Core Competency 1, which required him to submit a "completed" written product, we find that this descriptor, coupled with his performance standard, which required him to submit communications that "rarely require revisions," was sufficient to communicate to him the minimum level of quality his written products under these actions were to achieve. <span class="italic">See also Wilson</span>, 770 F.2d at 1055 (concluding that a performance standard providing that reports must require "minimum revisions" was sufficiently objective and precise, despite allowing for some subjective judgment on the part of the appellant's evaluators). Each improvement action also set forth either the frequency by which the appellant was to complete a discrete action, such as "every two weeks" during the period in which the PIP was in effect, or a firm deadline to complete such an action. Thus, we find that the appellant's performance standards, as clarified by the improvement actions set forth in the PIP, were sufficiently precise so as to invoke general consensus as to their meaning and content.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Augmentation of generic standards through specific job tasks and subsequent specific enumeration of expectations was acceptable in <span class="Italic">Diprizio v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 88 MSPR 73, 77-79 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At issue here, however, is the adequacy of the appellant's generic performance standards which the agency applied to each of the appellant's critical elements. As noted, the performance of all civilian Coast Guard employees, regardless of position, was measured against these same performance standards. The AJ chose to examine the "unsatisfactory" level of performance which states that the employee's work products do not meet the minimum requirements of the critical element, and that most of the following deficiencies are typically, but not always, characteristic of the employee's work: inadequate guidance to subordinates, inattention to work programs, and failure to stimulate subordinates to meet goals. The AJ found that the standard was vague and impermissibly subjective, that it could not be applied in a verifiable fashion, and that it did not indicate the level of proficiency which the agency actually expected for the appellant. The more appropriate standard for review, however, is the standard for the "needs improvement" level of performance, since that is the one to which the appellant's performance had to reach in order for him to be retained. It states that "[t]his level of performance only meets the minimum requirements with close supervision. All assignments are completed but may require the assistance of the supervisor and/or peers. Organizational goals and objectives are met only as a result of close supervision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that the degree of objectivity and specificity required in performance standards depends on the job involved, and that, with greater discretion and independence reposed in the incumbent comes less objectivity and specificity in his performance standards. <span class="Italic">See Graham v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force,</span> 46 MSPR 227, 236 n.7 (1990). It is also true that the appellant had a great amount of discretion and independence in his position, the duties of which required him to exercise professional judgment. Nonetheless, we agree with the AJ that, standing alone, the generic performance standards in this case do not, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1). The standards are not sufficiently precise and specific as to invoke a general consensus as to their meaning and content; and do not allow a supervisor to make a verifiable decision regarding an employee. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 770 F.2d 1048, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the generic performance standards specifically indicate that they are to be applied to each critical (and non-critical) element. The Financial Management critical element of the appellant's position required him to "manage MWR [Morale, Welfare, and Recreation] fund in accordance with Commandant directives; make sound business decisions; prepare accurate financial reports; and ensure safeguarding of all funds." That critical element identified specific tasks to which the performance levels applied, including ensuring monthly reconciliation of all checking accounts, submitting budgets as directed and no later than 30 days before the beginning of the fiscal year, ensuring that property records are current, conducting quarterly physical property inventories, completing and submitting specific reports no later than 10 days after the end of the quarter, and demonstrating a net profit greater than zero with regard to quarterly financial performance. The Program Management critical element required the appellant to "[be] responsible to manage and direct MWR programs including club operations, ticket sales, pool programs, intramural programs and special events; and to carry out aspects of planning, advertising and implementation." The specific tasks identified for that critical element included increasing the use of the club as a conference center, increasing the use of advertising to increase patronage, and ensuring that all programs are advertised, and changes announced promptly. An agency is not prohibited from using more than one document to set forth the performance standards against which an employee's performance will be rated. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mouser v. Department of Health</span> &#x0026; Human <span class="Italic">Services,</span> 32 MSPR 543, 547 (1987). Reading the generic performance standards in conjunction with the critical elements, as intended, renders them less vague because they better apprise the appellant of the tasks he was required to perform, along with the minimum level of successful performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, any lack of specificity inherent in the performance standards was cured by the agency's providing the appellant with clear guidance during the PIP as to what was expected of him<span class="Italic">. See Baker v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 25 MSPR 614, 617 (1985), <span class="Italic">affd,</span> 782 F.2d 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (an agency can give content to performance standards by informing the employee of specific work requirements through written and oral instructions). First, we note that the December 11, 1997, notice of unsatisfactory performance that placed the appellant on a PIP set forth due dates for projects assigned to him, provided specific expectations, recommended sources of guidance and technical support, and afforded him an opportunity to request additional training...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through some means an agency must at least communicate to its employees the expectations that will serve to augment standards. <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. Dept. of Army</span>, 47 MSPR 433, 440-41 (1991), determined that an agency failed to properly augment an imprecise standard:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Performance standard "a" of critical element 4 (Internal Control Systems Program) requires that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Written material is prepared [in accordance with] established stated objectives and is clearly written, succinct and consistent with regulations and established policy. Little, <span class="Italic">if any</span>, rewrite is required <span id="Page_2899"></span>and necessary approval/concurrence of finished product is easily obtained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the performance standard appeared to be "a virtually absolute standard" on its face because the inclusion of the phrase "if any" seemed to require that even one deviation from the standard could result in failure under the standard. Finding that the agency failed to present any evidence that would justify the absolute nature of this performance standard, the administrative judge determined that the specification of unacceptable performance under performance standard "a" could not be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that it is unnecessary in this appeal to determine whether performance standard "a" is "virtually absolute." While an agency may show that a similar performance standard might well be acceptable in another appeal, we concur with the administrative judge's further determination in this appeal that performance standard "a" is invalid because it lacks sufficient objectivity as required by 5 USC &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) to apprise the appellant of the standard against which her performance was to be measured.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may give content to performance standards by informing the employee of specific work requirements through written instructions, information concerning deficiencies and methods of improving performance, memoranda describing unacceptable performance, and responses to the employee's questions concerning performance. <span class="Italic">E.g., Melnick v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> 42 MSPR 93, 98-99 (1989); <span class="Italic">Baker v. Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Logistics Agency,</span> 25 MSPR 614, 617 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 782 F.2d 1579, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1986). However, under the statute, 5 USC &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1), an agency must communicate to the employee performance standards that are sufficiently specific to provide the employee with a firm benchmark toward which to aim his performance, and not an elusive goal which the agency may find the employee met or failed to meet at its pleasure. <span class="Italic">Sullivan v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 44 MSPR 646, 653 (1990); <span class="Italic">Melnick,</span> 42 MSPR at 98; <span class="Italic">Donaldson,</span> 27 MSPR at 298.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, although the appellant's supervisor--who developed and administered the appellant's performance standards--testified that she made a "value judgment" in determining whether the appellant met performance standard "a," she gave no indication of the factors that formed that judgment. The supervisor was unable in her testimony to give a lucid explanation of her judgment in applying the performance standard. Although her testimony suggests that she saw the standard as primarily quantitative, she could not, or at least did not, describe intelligible boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable performance under performance standard "a." The closest explanation she provided was that performance would be unacceptable if an employee's work always had to be rewritten, but would be acceptable if substantive revisions were required only "once in a blue moon." We find in the present appeal that the agency failed to present substantial evidence showing that, in practice and by agency instruction of the appellant, performance standard "a" was sufficiently objective so as to apprise the appellant of the standard against which her performance was to be measured. Thus, we will not consider the appellant's alleged performance deficiencies under the invalid performance standard. <span class="Italic">See Sullivan,</span> 44 MSPR at 652-53; <span class="Italic">Duggan v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 33 MSPR 568, 571 (1987); <span class="Italic">Donaldson</span>, 27 MSPR at 298-300.</p>
