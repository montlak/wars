<h6 class="h6" id="sec10-34"><span class="space">(ii)</span> Postal Reorganizations: 2000 Onward</h6>
<p class="Body-Text">The Postal Service continued its efforts to reorganize, although the numbers of employees involved were fewer. Adverse action jurisdiction was applied as to craft employees who challenged reassignments they accepted after being warned their jobs might be abolished, with possibly adverse consequences, <span class="Italic">Burger v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 579, 580-83 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-10 (2001), <span class="Italic">clarified</span>, <span class="Italic">Burger v. USPS</span>, 93 MSPR 582 (2003), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Eleven of the appellants, all except Thelen, were Level 6 Clerks when, in July 1993, the agency began to eliminate the operation with which their positions were associated. At that time, those eleven appellants were notified that their positions were to be abolished and that they would become unassigned regulars, and further that, if they failed to bid to existing vacancies, they would be placed in residual vacancies. At different times, the eleven appellants bid to, and/or were placed in, Level 5 positions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants filed individual, but identical, appeals wherein they alleged that the agency's actions constituted reduction-in-force (RIF) demotions taken without RIF procedures. They specifically alleged that their demotions were involuntary. Claiming to be preference eligibles, they argued that they were denied their rights as such because, while their own positions were abolished and they were demoted to Level 5 positions, nonveterans were allowed to retain their Level 6 positions. They contended that their demotions violated the Veterans Preference Act of 1944 and the RIF regulations at 5 CFR &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 351.502 and 351.601. These regulations generally give preference to preference eligible employees in a RIF....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Key to the AJ's dismissal of these appeals for lack of jurisdiction was his finding that the appellants could have remained indefinitely in their Level 6 positions, but chose, apparently for personal reasons, to bid to Level 5 positions. That finding, however, is not supported by the record. Nothing in the parties' stipulations or in the notices the appellants received indicated that they would, or could, remain indefinitely in their Level 6 positions. The notices stated that, if the appellants "declined to bid or [were] unsuccessful in obtaining bid position[s], [they would] become...unassigned regulars and subject to assignment to...residual vacanc[ies]" in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement. While it is true that the appellants stipulated to being told that, upon abolishment of their Level 6 positions, they would become unassigned regular employees at the "PS Level 6 pay level," neither the notices nor the stipulations indicated the <span class="Italic">grade level</span> of the residual vacancies in which the appellants would be placed, if they failed to bid. In other words, the appellants were never notified that they would or could be placed into Level 6 positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the records of four of the appellants, Burger, Christian, Markowitz, and Holloway, directly contradict the AJ's finding that they voluntarily bid to the Level 5 positions and could therefore have remained indefinitely at the grade 6 level. A listing of the positions to which these four appellants bid during their careers does not show any bid for a Level 5 position at or near the time they were placed in the Level 5 positions. Thus, the records for these four appellants support their contention that they were involuntarily demoted to Level 5 positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The records of the remaining eight appellants, Blackman, Reall, Schrage, Schmidt, Thelen, Haskett, Chism, and Dodd, arguably show that they bid to positions at or near the time they were placed in Level 5 positions. However, even if they did, and even if all of the appellants bid to the lower-graded positions to which they were demoted, the applicable case law nevertheless supports a finding that they made nonfrivolous allegations that their assignments to those positions were involuntary RIF demotions. In <span class="Italic">Hanson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 58 MSPR 413, 417 (1993), the Board held that the appellant's change to a lower-graded position was not voluntary, despite his application for it, because he did not seek assignment to that position until after his organization had been restructured, after he had been informed that he had not been selected for assignment at his former grade level, and after he was placed in the agency's "national pool for unplaced preference eligibles." And, in <span class="Italic">Harants v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 130 F.3d 1466, 1469 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the court held that an assignment to a lower-graded position constitutes a RIF demotion even when the employee voluntarily applies for or is offered an assignment to that position, as long as the assignment was made after the agency had informed the employee that his original position had been abolished and that he had not been selected for assignment to a position at his former grade level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, although the agency's notices informing the appellants that their positions would be abolished did not explicitly state that there were no positions available for them at their current grade levels, it did inform them that their rights to any future positions were governed by the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Under Article 37.3.F.10 of the agreement, the agency was obligated to offer the appellants vacancies at the "same or higher salary level," but if this were not possible, it could offer them lower-level vacancies with "rate protection." Thus, even if the appellants bid to lower-level positions, they did so under circumstances clearly indicating that there were no positions at their current grade levels to which they were entitled under the collective bargaining agreement. In other words, the agency's demoting the appellants to lower-graded positions was the functional equivalent of confirming that there were no positions at their former grade levels to which they were entitled. Applying the test in <span class="Italic">Hanson</span> and <span class="Italic">Harants</span>, we find that the appellants made nonfrivolous allegations that they were subjected to RIF demotions, we reverse the AJ's contrary finding, and we remand these appeals for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find further that the records in seven of these twelve appeals clearly support the conclusion that the appellants made nonfrivolous allegations that they were subjected to adverse actions without being afforded any of the required statutory procedures. Specifically, the files of appellants Reall, Schmidt, Christian, Haskett, Chism, Holloway, and Dodd show that they suffered reductions in their grades and basic pay. These actions qualify as adverse actions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(3)-(4), 7512; <span class="Italic">Fair v. Department of Transportation</span>, 5 MSPB 28, 4 MSPR 493, 496 (1981). The agency's notices neither advised the appellants that they would be reduced in grade or pay, nor provided any of the other procedures required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b). All of these seven appellants invoked 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75 as a basis for the Board's jurisdiction. Accordingly, these seven appeals must be remanded for further proceedings to adjudicate these appellants' rights under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After remand, the Board reconsidered <span class="Italic">Burger</span> and similar appeals through a consolidated PFR. The Board clarified its original opinion and discussed the application of its theory of RIF (and collateral adverse action) jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">Burger v. USPS</span>, 93 MSPR 582, 587-97 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-39 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> <span class="Italic">sub nom</span> <span class="Italic">Hayes v. USPS</span>, 390 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2004), <span class="Italic">post</span>. The discussion below emphasizes the basic reasoning of the cases, includes quotation from the treatment of the appeals of several groups of the appellants, and omits discussion of those cases of appellants whose assignment rights were established by memoranda of understanding between the agency and its employees' unions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2), an agency is required to use RIF procedures when it "releases a competing employee from his or her competitive level by furlough for more than 30 days, separation, demotion, or reassignment requiring displacement" when the release is due to, among other things, lack of work or a reorganization<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Myers v. Department of the Army</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 77 &#x00B6; 4 (2000). The regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.901 therefore gives the Board jurisdiction only over cases where the employee has been furloughed for more than 30 days, separated or demoted by RIF. A demotion is an assignment to a position at a lower grade than the position occupied before the RIF<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 307, 311, 318-23 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary. Rather, it is limited to those matters over which the Board has been given jurisdiction by law, rule <span id="Page_3036"></span>or regulation. In deciding these cases, we therefore must strictly adhere to the regulatory bases which give us jurisdiction over RIF actions<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant bears the burden of establishing that his appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)]. Further, he must prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, which is the degree of evidence that a reasonable person would consider sufficient to find that the Board more likely than not has jurisdiction over the appeal<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2), (c)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2), 1201.4(q)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction in a RIF appeal cannot be defeated by the agency's mere assertion that the employee voluntarily consented to the action<span class="Italic">. Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 345, 351-52 (1993). Rather, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held in <span class="Italic">Harants v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 130 F.3d 1466 (Fed. Cir. 1997), "[a]n assignment to a lower-grade position constitutes a RIF demotion even when the employee voluntarily applies for or is offered an assignment to that position, as long as the assignment was made <span class="Italic">after</span> the agency has informed the employee that his original position had been abolished <span class="Italic">and</span> that he had not been selected for assignment to a position at his former grade level." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1469 (emphasis in the original and added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, under <span class="Italic">Harants</span>, an appellant claiming demotion by RIF must establish, by preponderant evidence, that two things happened. First, he must show that he bid to and accepted a lower-grade position after the agency actually informed him that his original position had in fact been abolished. Second, he must prove that his bid to and acceptance of a lower-grade position occurred after the agency expressly notified him that he would not be assigned to a position at the same grade as the position which was abolished.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In the portion of <span class="Italic">Harants</span> quoted above, the court stated that where these two things occur and the employee is assigned to a lower-grade position, there is a RIF demotion "even when the employee <span class="Italic">voluntarily</span> applies for...that position." 130 F.3d at 1469 (emphasis added). We read that statement as meaning that an employee's assignment to a lower-grade position cannot be voluntary, even though it appears to be so, if his bid to and acceptance of the lower-grade position was made after the agency abolished his former position and after the agency expressly told him that he was not selected for a position at his former grade level. To read the court's statement in any another way would mean that an employee's acceptance of a lower-grade position would be a RIF demotion no matter the circumstances and no matter how voluntary. Such an interpretation would give no effect to the two conditions which the court stated had to take place before there could be a finding of a RIF demotion. This reading of <span class="Italic">Harants</span> is confirmed by the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Knight v. Department of Defense</span>, 332 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We will review the instant appeals in light of these legal principles. We begin with the Burger appeals because several of the appellants in the cases now before us rely on Burger. We therefore take this opportunity to clarify the Burger remand opinion to the extent that it may be unclear regarding the test for determining whether we have jurisdiction over alleged RIF demotions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Burger</span> Appeals</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A.&#x2003;Background of the <span class="Italic">Burger</span> appeals</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As of 1993, all twelve of the appellants in the <span class="Italic">Burger</span> consolidation were employed in level PS-6 positions at the agency's Omaha General Mail Facility. Eleven of the appellants were employed as Multi-Purpose Letter Sorting Machine (MPLSM) Clerks, while one appellant was employed as a Review Clerk.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency began eliminating the MPLSM operation in 1993, and it began eliminating Review Clerk positions in 1998. At some point during the time period 1993-1998, each of the appellants was placed in a level 5 position, and at some point the grade level at which the agency paid each appellant was reduced. On February 9, 2000, the appellants filed individual, but essentially identical, appeals alleging that they had been demoted in violation of RIF regulations and the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge assigned to these cases issued separate, but basically identical, initial decisions dismissing the appeals for lack of Board jurisdiction. On petition for review, the Board vacated the initial decisions and remanded the appeals for further consideration. In its remand opinion, the Board found that the appellants had made nonfrivolous allegations that they had been demoted by RIF, and that seven of them had also made nonfrivolous allegations that they had been subjected to adverse actions<span class="Italic">. Burger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 579 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found on remand that, although the seven appellants who had alleged that they had been subjected to adverse actions had failed to substantiate those allegations, all twelve appellants had been subjected to appealable RIF demotions. The administrative judge found that the actions could not be sustained in light of the agency's failure to provide the appellants with the substantive and procedural rights to which they were entitled under the RIF regulations. In its petition for review of the remand initial decisions, the agency argues that the appellants' assignments do not constitute appealable RIF demotions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">B.&#x2003;Analysis of the <span class="Italic">Burger</span> appeals</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">1.&#x2003;The Board's jurisdiction over the claims of an alleged RIF</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the agency contends that provisions of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) have divested the Board of jurisdiction over any RIF actions that may have been effected. In support of this argument, the agency refers to provisions of negotiated agreements between the agency and certain postal unions, and it quotes one of those sections as providing that "unresolved questions may be submitted by the Union to arbitration under the grievance-arbitration procedure." The agency also cites <span class="Italic">Bonner v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 781 F.2d 202 (Fed. Cir. 1986), for the proposition that the Board has no jurisdiction to review a RIF action that may be the subject of a grievance under a CBA<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As <span class="Italic">Bonner</span> indicates, section 7121 of Title 5 of the United States Code generally provides that matters covered by a negotiated grievance procedure may not be appealed to the Board<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Bonner</span>, 781 F.2d at 203. Section 7121, however, does not apply to the U.S. Postal Service<span class="Italic">. Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 277 &#x00B6; 3 n.1 (2002). A showing that the appellants were able to challenge RIF actions under a negotiated grievance procedure therefore would not preclude a finding of Board jurisdiction over such actions. Accordingly, we need not consider this argument further.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also alleges that the appellants failed to prove on remand that they had been subjected to appealable RIF actions. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the Board previously found that the appellants had made nonfrivolous allegations that they had been subjected to RIF demotions. This finding was based largely on indications that the appellants were not told, when their positions were abolished, that they would be assigned to other positions at their current grade level, and that, even if the appellants had bid for the lower-level positions to which they were assigned, any such bids would have been submitted under circumstances indicating that there were no positions at their current grade level to which they could be assigned<span class="Italic">. Burger</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 579 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9. Applying <span class="Italic">Harants</span>, the Board stated that these circumstances indicated that the appellants' assignments to any level 5 positions for which they had bid might have been RIF demotions<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's remand opinion in <span class="Italic">Burger</span> found that the appellants made a nonfrivolous allegation of being demoted by RIF "although the agency's notices informing [them] that their positions would be abolished <span class="Italic">did not explicitly state</span> that there were no positions available for them at their current grade level." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). Based on this statement, it appears that some of the appellants in these consolidated cases read <span class="Italic">Burger</span> as suggesting or holding that a RIF demotion can occur even in the absence of an agency notice expressly notifying the employee that he will not be placed in a position at his former grade level. The court in <span class="Italic">Harants</span>, however, found that an appealable RIF demotion can take place only if the agency has actually informed the employee that he will not be assigned to a position at his former grade level. The Board is bound by our reviewing court's precedent. Indeed, the Federal Circuit's jurisdictional test in <span class="Italic">Harants</span> makes perfect sense. Thus, a change to a lower-grade position is voluntary unless the agency has notified the employee that he will not be assigned to a position at his former grade level. To the extent the remand opinion in <span class="Italic">Burger</span> can be read as suggesting otherwise, we hereby clarify it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's notices to the appellants informed them that their bid positions were being abolished and that new bids would be opened. The notices further told the appellants that if they declined to bid on new positions or were unsuccessful in obtaining new bid positions, they would each "become an unassigned regular and subject to assignment to a residual vacancy in accordance with Article 37, Section 3.F.10 of the National Agreement." Section 3.F.10 of Article 37 of the National Agreement states that full-time employees not encumbered in a bid duty assignment "shall be assigned in residual assignments in the <span class="Italic">same or higher</span> salary level for which the employees meet the minimum qualifications." (emphasis added). The record prior to remand also includes a stipulation by the parties that the agency's notices informed the appellants that their jobs were being abolished, and that "they would become unassigned regular employees at the PS Level 6 pay level."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's remand initial decision indicates that he found RIF demotions based solely on the Board's finding that the appellants made a nonfrivolous allegation that they had been demoted by RIF. A nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, however, is not the same as proving <span id="Page_3037"></span>facts which would establish the Board's jurisdiction over an appeal. The administrative judge therefore should have based his remand initial decision on the fully developed record<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 2 MSPB 2, 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980) (an initial decision must, among other things, identify all material issues of fact and law and summarize all of the evidence). We grant the agency's petition for review to consider all of the evidence submitted in these appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the specific jurisdictional issue on which the Board remanded these cases, the appellants merely rested on the evidence which had been submitted prior to the remand, stating that "[t]here is no need for further evidence." Unlike the appellants, the agency on remand submitted additional evidence in support of its position that the appellants had not been subjected to appealable RIF demotions. Specifically, it submitted a declaration, signed under penalty of perjury, by an official who was a Labor Relations Specialist in the appellants' district from 1992 to 1998, and who was involved in phasing out the operations in which the appellants were employed. According to that declaration, the normal procedure at the relevant time "was to make the individual concerned an unassigned regular with the <span class="Italic">same</span> grade and pay."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The official signing the declaration also expressed his belief that, if the appellants were to be assigned to lower-level positions, the notices issued to them on abolishment of their jobs "would have also advised the employee[s] of their salary protection rights." The written notices issued to the appellants do not mention "salary protection rights." The official concluded from the absence of such information in the notices that the appellants "would have been kept within the <span class="Italic">same</span> grade and pay status." This suggests that the appellants were in the group of employees who would be assigned to positions at the same grade as their former positions. The official's declaration is consistent with the reference in the notices to the CBA provision which guaranteed that the appellants would be assigned to positions at the same or higher grade than their former positions.[11]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;The Board's remand opinion indicates that the written notices received by the appellants referred to a provision of the CBA that permitted assignments to lower-grade positions with "rate 'protection.'" <span class="Italic">Burger</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 579 &#x00B6; 9. The notices, however, make no mention of Section 37.3.F.11 of the CBA, which governs "rate protection."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Burger</span> appellants did not prove on remand that the <span class="Italic">Harants'</span> test for jurisdiction was met. That is, they did not show that they bid to and accepted grade level 5 positions only after the agency expressly told them that they had not been selected for assignment to positions at their former grade level<span class="Italic">. Harants</span>, 130 F.3d at 1469; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 345, 351 (1993), cited in <span class="Italic">Harants</span>, 130 F.3d at 1469. In the absence of such notice from the agency, the Board has no jurisdiction over any assignments to lower-grade positions for which the appellants voluntarily bid<span class="Italic">. See Harants</span>, 130 F.3d at 1469.2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Jurisdiction over the adverse-action claims</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that those appellants who claimed to have been subjected to adverse actions had not substantiated their claims. In making this finding, he referred to his conclusion that the appellants' assignments to level 5 positions were RIF demotions, and he stated that an action could not be both a RIF action and an adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our finding that the appellants were not demoted by RIF eliminates the basis for the administrative judge's finding that the appellants could not have been subject to adverse actions. However, despite being on notice that the agency filed a petition for review challenging the administrative judge's finding of RIF jurisdiction, none of the appellants filed a cross petition for review explaining why, if the Board finds no RIF jurisdiction, there is still adverse-action jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perhaps more important, the appellants submitted no evidence on remand that would support a finding that they had been subjected to adverse actions. In fact, they did not even challenge the agency's suggestions that they voluntarily bid for level 5 positions because they simply did not want to work as unassigned regulars at the PS-6 level. Thus, assuming that cross petitions for review had been filed by the appellants who alleged that the agency took adverse actions, we would find that they failed to substantiate their allegations. Accordingly, those appellants did not show that the Board has jurisdiction over their appeals under the laws and regulations covering adverse actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Albers</span> Appellants</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A.&#x2003;Background of the <span class="Italic">Albers</span> appeals</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Albers</span> appellants were employed as Flat Sorter Machine (FSM) Operators, grade level PS-6, in Cincinnati, Ohio. By notices dated July 19, 2000, at least seven of the eight appellants were notified that FSM operator positions in their facility would be abolished effective August 26, 2000, and that they would be "involuntarily reassigned...as...unassigned full-time regular clerk[s], PS-06, in the Cincinnati Processing and Distribution Center." While the record in the case of the eighth appellant (Ms. Pettit) does not include a copy of this notice, it shows that she was notified of the future abolishment of her position by notice dated March 14, 2000, and that she was told in that notice that she would "become an unencumbered (unassigned) employee" when her position was abolished unless she successfully bid for a vacant position before then.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After their positions were abolished, five of the appellants bid for and were assigned to lower-grade positions. The remaining three appellants remained on the rolls as "unassigned full-time regular clerk[s]" following the abolishment of their PS-6 FSM Operator positions. The appellants have alleged that, as "unassigned regulars," they would have been or were required to perform lower-level work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">B.&#x2003;Analysis of the <span class="Italic">Albers</span> appeals</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has acknowledged that the appellants' positions were abolished, and that the appellants were placed in "unassigned regular" positions as a result of its decision to replace the flat sorter machine on which they worked with newer equipment. As stated above, five of the <span class="Italic">Albers</span> appellants bid for their lower-level positions after being told that their PS-6 FSM Operator positions would be abolished. Moreover, the notices by which they were told that their positions were being abolished could be regarded as suggesting that they bid on lower-level positions. The notices that were issued to at least seven of the appellants included statements that the appellants would "receive saved grade" if they successfully bid for lower-level positions, and the agency attached to each notice "a copy of the present bid sheet." A notice issued previously to Ms. Pettit informed her that, if she failed to bid successfully on a vacant position by the time her PS-6 FSM Operator position was abolished, she could be "assigned to any residual vacancy."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As fully discussed in our earlier analysis of <span class="Italic">Burger</span>, the court's holding in <span class="Italic">Harants</span> applies only where the agency expressly informs the employee that he will not be placed in a position at his former grade level. It does not apply where the agency merely refers to the possibility that the employee may wish to seek assignment to a lower-level position, or where it provides an incentive for requesting or accepting a lower-level position. The five appellants who were assigned to lower-level positions do not allege that the agency expressly informed them that they would not be placed in positions at the PS-6 level. Moreover, the record does not indicate that any such information was provided to them. Instead, it shows that the agency informed at least four of the appellants that they would be "reassigned...as...unassigned full-time regular clerk[s], PS-06," which were assignments at the grade level of their former positions. In addition, even though the agency informed Ms. Pettit that she would "become an unencumbered (unassigned) employee," that notice did not indicate that she would not receive an assignment at her former grade level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find that the subsequent assignments of these five appellants to the lower-level positions for which they had bid do not constitute appealable RIF demotions. Instead, they constitute voluntary assignments over which the Board lacks jurisdiction under the RIF regulations.[14]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;The appellants alleged below that their decision to bid on lower-level positions "was based on duress, intimidation and coercion," and they seem to have argued that the actions therefore would constitute adverse actions if they did not constitute RIF demotions. In support of their claim that the bids were involuntary, they assert that, in the absence of such bids, each appellant "would be forced to remain on an unassigned position with less job security, less opportunity for advancement, and less pay." The fact that an employee must choose between unpleasant alternatives, however, does not render the employee's selection of one of those alternatives involuntary<span class="Italic">. Soler-Minardo v. Department of Defense</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 100 &#x00B6; 5, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 53 Fed. Appx. 545 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The appellants accordingly have failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over these cases under adverse action law and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also see no credible evidence that the other three appellants were ever assigned to lower-level positions, so as even to be able to allege a demotion. Although these appellants seem to have claimed that their work as "unassigned regulars" was at a level lower than PS-6, they remained officially assigned to the positions of "unassigned full-time regular clerk, PS-06" in which they were placed after the abolishment of their positions as FSM Operators, PS-6. For this reason, we find that these appellants failed to show that they have been affected by RIF demotions<span class="Italic">. See Kukish v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 360, 362-63 (1995) (an employee whose official assignment remained that of his former position had not been subjected to a RIF demotion, even though he had assumed the duties of a lower-level position).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hayes v. USPS</span>, 390 F.3d 1373, 1374-81 (Fed. Cir. 2004), explained that <span id="Page_3038"></span>movements through the postal crafts, without loss of pay or grade, prior to formal RIF procedures, were not appealable to the Board because they amounted to voluntary actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Albers petitioners were employed as level 6 flat sorter machine ("FSM") operators for the United States Postal Service ("USPS") in Cincinnati, Ohio. They performed a number of duties, including operating FSM 881 series machines. The FSM 881 series machines require the mail to be "schemed." When scheming the mail, an operator remembers a large number of alphabetical and geographical groupings and keys these groupings into the mail sorting machine at appropriate times. Scheming was the "primary reason" that the positions held by the Albers petitioners were graded at level 6. In or before August, 2000, the USPS replaced the FSM 881 series machines at the Cincinnati, Ohio facility with automated flat sorting machine ("AFSM") 100 series machines, which do not require scheming.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Albers petitioners were notified on July 19, 2000, that (1) their positions would be abolished on August 26, 2000; (2) they would receive "saved grade" if they successfully bid on a lower-grade position; and (3) they would each be reassigned "as an unassigned full-time regular clerk, PS-06" if they did not successfully bid on another position before August 26, 2000. The July 19 letter uses the phrase "unassigned full-time regular clerk, PS-06." Other documents use other terms, such as "Unassigned Regular status," "unassigned regular," "level 6 unassigned FSM Operator position," "unassigned regular clerk," and "unencumbered employees." We use the term unassigned regular clerk to maintain consistency throughout this opinion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Each of the Albers petitioners, except Conover, was reassigned as an unassigned regular clerk. Conover transitioned directly from a level 6 FSM operator position to a level 4 mail processor position on or about August 26, 2000. Furthermore, each of the Albers petitioners, except Doherty, Heaberlin, and Oeltman, successfully bid for a lower-grade position. Doherty, Heaberlin, and Oeltman continued to work as unassigned regular clerks without bidding on lower-grade positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Albers petitioners appealed to the Board, claiming that they had suffered a RIF demotion. The administrative judge who made the Board's initial decision agreed, determining that the Albers petitioners had been assigned to lower-grade positions because they were required to "operate a '100' machine that does not require keying duties or scheme knowledge but instead requires employees to manually prepare and load mail into a machine that performs these functions." The full Board reversed, reasoning that the Albers petitioners were not demoted because a position as an unassigned regular clerk is a position at the same grade and pay level. <span class="Italic">Burger</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. at 596-97 (determining that the July 19 notice demonstrates that petitioners were informed that assignments as "'unassigned full-time regular clerk[s], PS-06'" constitute "<span class="Italic">assignments at the grade level of their former position</span>" (alteration in original, emphasis added)). For the Albers petitioners who bid on lower-grade positions, the Board gave an additional reason why these petitioners had not suffered a RIF demotion, namely, that they had not received notice "that they would not be placed in positions at the PS-6 level" before they successfully bid on the lower-grade positions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 596. The Albers petitioners timely petitioned this Court for review of the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of Hayes' case are quite similar to those of the Albers petitioners. Hayes worked as a level 5 FSM operator in Manasota, Florida. On December 13, 2000, Hayes received notice that (1) his position was abolished, (2) he could bid on other positions and would receive saved grade if he did so, and (3) he had become an "unencumbered regular." Hayes was informed that as an unencumbered regular, he would retain "saved-grade" and that his "Form 50 [would] not be changed from [his] current level as an unencumbered flat sorter operator." Hayes successfully bid for, and was assigned to, a level 4 mail processor position with saved grade on January 12, 2002.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hayes appealed to the Board, claiming that he had suffered a RIF demotion. The administrative judge who made the Board's initial determination rejected Hayes' appeal for lack of jurisdiction on two grounds. The administrative judge first determined that Hayes' reassignment as an unassigned regular clerk was merely a temporary detail and also determined that Hayes had not received notice that he would not be placed in a position at his former grade level before he bid for a lower-grade position. The full Board agreed and dismissed Hayes' appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Burger</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. at 601-04 (reasoning that "[t]he administrative judge correctly found that, at the time the appellant filed his appeal, he occupied the position of Level 5 FSM Operator, and that, even though he may have performed the duties of a lower-graded position, he did not allege, nor did the record reflect, that the agency assigned him to a position graded lower than his former position" and that his bid for a lower-grade position was voluntary).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;Discussion</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the Board has jurisdiction is a question of law we review without deference. <span class="Italic">Torain v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 83 F.3d 1420, 1422 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The Board can have jurisdiction if and only if the petitioner makes non-frivolous allegations that satisfy the elements of the claim. <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 327 F.3d 1354, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Even then, an evidentiary hearing on jurisdiction may be needed. Furthermore, the Board's jurisdiction is limited to those "actions for which the right to appeal is specifically granted by law, rule, or regulation." <span class="Italic">Torain</span>, 83 F.3d at 1422. The Board's jurisdiction over RIF-related appeals is provided in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.901, which states that "[a]n employee who has been furloughed for more than 30 days, separated, or demoted by a reduction in force action may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Only demotion is at issue in this case. Demotion is defined in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(4) in pertinent part as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency: (i) <span class="Italic">To a lower grade</span> when both the old and new positions are under the General Schedule or under the same type graded wage schedule; or (ii) <span class="Italic">To a position with a lower rate of pay</span> when both the old and new positions are under the same type ungraded wage schedule, or are in different pay method categories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphases added).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;For simplicity, we will refer in this opinion to a demotion as a change of employment to a position with a lower grade or pay, even though whether a RIF demotion occurred is analyzed by reference to grade if the agency uses a graded wage schedule or by pay if the agency does not use a graded wage schedule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, voluntary changes in employment do not constitute RIF demotions. <span class="Italic">See Torain</span>, 83 F.3d at 1423. In <span class="Italic">Harants v. United States Postal Service</span>, this Court established an exception to the general rule, holding that "an assignment to a lower-grade position constitutes a RIF demotion even when the employee voluntarily applies for or is offered an assignment to that position, as long as the assignment was made after the agency had informed the employee that his original position had been abolished and that he had not been selected for an assignment to a position at his former grade level." 130 F.3d 1466, 1469 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (emphasis omitted). In <span class="Italic">Knight v. Department of Defense</span>, 332 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2003), we justified the <span class="Italic">Harants</span> exception by reference to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.201(b), which provides that RIF regulations must be followed if an employee has been "reached for release from a competitive level." The <span class="Italic">Knight</span> court held that a federal employee had been reached for release when she received notice "that her position had been identified for abolishment" and that she would be separated because there were no positions for which she was qualified that were vacant or for which she had higher retention standing than the incumbent. <span class="Italic">Knight</span>, 332 F.3d at 1364, 1369.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also determined that assignment to a temporary "detail" does not constitute a RIF demotion. <span class="Italic">Dixon v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 445 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">Scorcia v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 77 F.3d 503 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). In <span class="Italic">Dixon</span>, the Board reasoned that "[a] detail by its very nature is temporary and involves no formal appointment since the employee continues to be the incumbent of the position from which he was detailed." 64 M.S.P.R. at 450.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Marcino v. United States Postal Service</span>, 344 F.3d 1199 (Fed. Cir. 2003), is based on facts nearly identical to those in the present case. The <span class="Italic">Marcino</span> court summarized the following facts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The petitioner is an employee of the United States Postal Service ("the agency"). In 1997, the petitioner was serving as a flat sorter machine operator at grade level 6 when the agency notified him by letter that his position would be abolished effective March 29, 1997, but he would nonetheless retain his seniority and could "bid on any existing vacancies for which [he was] eligible to bid." The letter further stated that if the petitioner were unsuccessful in bidding for a new position, he would become an "Unassigned Regular Clerk," effective March 29, 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On March 29, 1997, the agency converted the petitioner to an unassigned regular clerk with a saved grade level 6. The petitioner subsequently bid for a position as a flat sorter machine operator at grade level 5 and accepted this position on October 10, 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1200 (alteration in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Marcino appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, determining that the <span class="Italic">Harants</span>/<span class="Italic">Knight</span> exception did not apply because Marcino voluntarily bid for a lower-grade position without having been informed that he had not been selected for assignment to a position at his former grade level. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1201. The administrative judge's decision became final when two Board members could not reach a decision on Marcino's petition for full Board review. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1201-02.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This Court affirmed the administrative judge's determination. We first noted that Marcino had failed to support his jurisdictional allegations with affidavits or other evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1204. We further held that <span id="Page_3039"></span>Marcino's allegations were not sufficient to sustain jurisdiction, even if the allegations were supported by competent evidence, stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The petitioner has not alleged that the agency informed him that he would not be reassigned to a position at the same grade level or that there were no positions available at his grade level, as was the case in <span class="Italic">Harants</span> and <span class="Italic">Knight</span>. Had that been the case, it would have been futile for the petitioner to await his actual separation, and his acceptance of the level 5 position would have been involuntary or, put differently, he would have been reached for release before he applied for the level 5 position. Instead, the petitioner in the present case, like the petitioner in <span class="Italic">Torain</span>, was merely informed that his position was being abolished. The petitioner was then converted to an unassigned regular clerk with a saved grade level. The petitioner had the option of awaiting an appealable adverse action either an actual reduction in grade or being informed by the agency that there were no alternative level 6 positions available. Yet, as in <span class="Italic">Torain</span>, the petitioner "simply accepted an alternative employment option" by bidding for and accepting a position as a level 5 sorter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of this case are nearly identical to those of <span class="Italic">Marcino</span>. Marcino held the same position, level 6 FSM operator, that all but one of petitioners held, with Hayes holding a level 5 FSM operator position. Just like Marcino, petitioners' positions were abolished. The written notice received by Marcino is materially indistinguishable from the written notice received by petitioners. Marcino was reassigned as an unassigned regular clerk, and all petitioners, except for Conover, likewise spent at least some time working as an unassigned regular clerk. After working as an unassigned regular clerk, Marcino successfully bid to a lower-grade position with saved grade and pay. Similarly, all petitioners, except Doherty, Heaberlin, and Oeltman, successfully bid to lower-grade positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners attempt to draw four factual distinctions between this case and <span class="Italic">Marcino</span>, none of which is material.[4] First, petitioners contend that they, but not the petitioner in <span class="Italic">Marcino</span>, were required to perform the duties of lower-grade positions as unassigned regular clerks. There is nothing in <span class="Italic">Marcino</span>, however, to suggest that the substantive duties performed by the petitioner in <span class="Italic">Marcino</span> while working as an unassigned regular clerk materially differ from the duties performed by petitioners in this case while working as unassigned regular clerks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Petitioners also contend that <span class="Italic">Marcino</span> does not govern this case because whether their bids for employment were voluntary "is not an issue presented in this case." This argument is easily rejected because the Board explicitly held that it did not have jurisdiction because petitioners' bids "constitute <span class="Italic">voluntary</span> assignments over which the Board lacks jurisdiction under the RIF regulations." <span class="Italic">Burger</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. at 596 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, under Federal Circuit precedent, a reduction in an employee's duties and responsibilities, by itself, does not constitute a RIF demotion. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 807 F.2d 1577, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, the petitioner argued that his reassignment from a position in San Francisco, California to a position in Bakersfield, California constituted a RIF demotion because his responsibilities were reduced. In San Francisco, he "was responsible for more than 9,000 Postal employees and administered a payroll of approximately $275 million," whereas in Bakersfield, he "was responsible for less than 2,000 employees and administered a payroll of approximately $50 million." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1578. The <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> court rejected the petitioner's argument, holding that "[a] reduction in responsibility without a concurrent reduction in grade or pay, however, is not appealable to the Board." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1580. Thus, petitioners' argument that their duties were reduced is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, petitioners contend that <span class="Italic">Marcino</span> is distinguishable because the USPS, in this case, "relies on the demonstrably false premise that, by withholding issuance of a Form 50 formally reassigning" petitioners to lower-level positions commensurate with the lower-level duties they were required to perform as unassigned regular clerks, petitioners remained in positions at the same grade and pay and, therefore, were not RIF demoted. Petitioners contend, as to the Albers petitioners, for example, that "the Postal Service seeks to circumvent the law by denominating the Albers Petitioners Level 6 FSM Operators, even though they have no FSM machine to operate." We disagree with petitioners' view of the facts of this case. As unassigned regular clerks, petitioners were no longer required to scheme the mail but continued to be assigned to other duties within the standard position description of the positions they occupied before the AFSM machines were introduced. For example, the local memorandum of understanding provided to Hayes explains this well:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As unencumbered FSM Operators, they may be assigned work within the position description of their bid. <span class="Italic">They may perform all the duties that they performed before they became unencumbered.</span> Specifically, they can be assigned to the FSM-1000 and FSM-881, manual distribution or other duties that they normally perform.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis added.) Thus, because petitioners have failed to demonstrate that they performed duties inconsistent with the position to which they were officially assigned, we find unpersuasive petitioners' factual claim that the USPS was required to "formally reassign[&#8197;] " them to lower-grade positions. Furthermore, in addition to advancing a faulty factual premise, petitioners have provided no legal argument, much less authority, as to why a failure formally to so reassign them would be actionable, especially given the straightforward holding in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> that a mere change in duties or responsibilities does not constitute a RIF demotion. In this case, we take no view on that legal issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, several petitioners distinguish their cases from <span class="Italic">Marcino</span> based on the length of time spent working as unassigned regular clerks. These petitioners argue that the length of time they spent working as unassigned regular clerks was sufficiently long to constitute a RIF demotion. The petitioner in <span class="Italic">Marcino</span> worked for approximately six and a half months as an unassigned regular clerk. <span class="Italic">Marcino</span>, 344 F.3d at 1200. In this case, only Albers and Conover spent less time than that as unassigned regular clerks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we discuss timing in both <span class="Italic">Marcino</span> and <span class="Italic">Torain</span>, in neither case did we suggest that an employee need wait only for a limited period of time while working as an unassigned regular clerk. Further, <span class="Italic">Marcino</span>'s language referring to waiting appears to be based entirely on language from <span class="Italic">Torain</span>. <span class="Italic">Compare Marcino</span>, 344 F.3d at 1204 ("The petitioner had the <span class="Italic">option of awaiting</span> an appealable adverse action either an actual reduction in grade or being informed by the agency that there were no alternative level 6 positions available.") (emphasis added), <span class="Italic">with Torain</span>, 83 F.3d at 1423 ("Torain simply accepted an alternative employment option <span class="Italic">in lieu of waiting</span> for eventual reassignment.") (emphasis added). Nor does the language of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(4) support an argument that timing spent working as an unassigned regular clerk is relevant. Instead, section 210.102(b)(4) limits demotions to changes of an employee "[t]o a lower grade" or "[t]o a position with a lower rate of pay," without discussing timing at all.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners rely on <span class="Italic">Dixon</span> in contending that timing is important, but their reliance on <span class="Italic">Dixon</span> is misplaced. <span class="Italic">Dixon</span> involved a USPS restructuring in which the petitioners "were detailed, i.e., temporarily assigned to agency Placement Centers where they were to obtain other positions within the agency." 64 M.S.P.R. at 447. Petitioners' reassignments in this case as unassigned regular clerks, however, are not temporary details. Although some aspects of the unassigned regular clerk position may perhaps make an unassigned regular clerk's schedule and daily duties less predictable than those of an assigned regular employee, that does not mean that an unassigned regular clerk position is merely a temporary detail. Accordingly, petitioners have failed to demonstrate the relevance of the length of time during which they worked as unassigned regular clerks to their contention that a RIF demotion occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fourth, the petitioners who bid for lower-grade positions also contend that their cases are distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Marcino</span> because they received non-written information sufficient under the <span class="Italic">Harants</span>/<span class="Italic">Knight</span> exception to demonstrate that they suffered a RIF demotion.[5] These petitioners cite evidence that they were made unassigned regular clerks and that the collective bargaining agreement contains a statement that employees whose jobs are eliminated "shall receive saved grade." These facts, however, do not materially distinguish their cases from <span class="Italic">Marcino</span>. On the contrary, the opinion in <span class="Italic">Marcino</span> explicitly recites that the petitioner was made "an unassigned regular (emphasis added) clerk with a saved grade level 6." <span class="Italic">Marcino</span>, 344 F.3d at 1200. Additionally, these petitioners cite evidence that they were not placed in residual level 6 assignments while working as unassigned regular clerks and that all the level 6 FSM operator positions at the local facility were abolished. These facts also do not distinguish these petitioners' cases from <span class="Italic">Marcino</span>, which states, "The agency conceded that at the time the petitioner accepted his level 5 position, '<span class="Italic">all Level 6 positions</span> were being abolished or reverted due to automation and mechanization changes.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;These petitioners concede that the written notification they received did not explicitly state that they had not been selected for positions at the same grade and pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because petitioners have failed to distinguish <span class="Italic">Marcino</span>, we are bound by its holding. Accordingly, the Board properly determined that it did not have jurisdiction because petitioners did not suffer RIF demotions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that petitioners also take issue with the Board's finding that "unassigned regular clerk" is a position at the same grade and pay as petitioners' FSM operator positions. Petitioners argue that a change in designation to "unassigned regular" is merely a change in the employee's status within a position but does not change his position. More specifically, an employee has both a position and a status as either assigned or unassigned in a duty assignment. A position is a formally described set of duties found in a standard position description, whereas a duty assignment is a set of duties within a position to be performed at specific times. Being changed from assigned to unassigned status, therefore, involves the elimination of a specific duty assignment, but not a change in their positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3040"></span>We need not determine, however, whether this finding is supported by substantial evidence because even if we adopt petitioners' view of the facts, we must affirm the Board's decision. Under the Board's theory, petitioners were not demoted because "unassigned regular clerk" is a position at the same grade and pay as their former positions. Under petitioners' theory, their positions were not changed. But if their positions were not changed, they were not demoted, because demotion requires reassignment to a position with lower grade or pay. Accordingly, any error in the Board's finding would be harmless.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;Conclusion</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, because petitioners have failed to distinguish <span class="Italic">Marcino</span>, which binds us to hold that petitioners did not suffer RIF demotions, and have not otherwise demonstrated that the Board's decision was not in accordance with the law or supported by substantial evidence, we affirm.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Burger</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 245, 246-47 (2003), requiring, as a condition to a RIF appeal from a reorganization leading to an otherwise voluntary downgrading, the clearly stated notice from the agency that the appellant would not be assigned to a position at the same grade as the position that was earlier held. <span class="Italic">Burger</span> was interpreted and again applied in <span class="Italic">McNeal v. USPS,</span> 96 MSPR 545, 546-47 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-6 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated February 26, 2003, the agency informed the appellant that his "duty assignment [of PS-6 General Expeditor]...w[ould] be abolished effective...March 21, 2003," and that he would "become an unassigned regular at that time." The appellant filed this appeal, alleging that this agency letter resulted in his demotion from a Level 6 position to a Level 5 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued that the appellant was not demoted because he was subjected to no personnel action during 2003 that changed his grade or pay. The appellant responded that he was in fact demoted to a Level 5 Mail Processing Clerk position because he was assigned to perform the duties of that position after his former position was abolished.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge (AJ) found that the agency demoted the appellant by RIF because, after abolishing his Level 6 position of General Expeditor, the agency indefinitely assigned him to perform the lower-grade duties of a Mail Processing Clerk. The AJ noted that, even though the appellant was not formally assigned to the Mail Processing Clerk position, the salient, undisputed fact was that he was assigned to perform the duties of the Mail Processing Clerk position, which were formally classified and graded by the agency as Level 5 duties. After thus finding jurisdiction over the appeal, the AJ reversed the agency's action as having been effected without the required RIF procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has filed a petition for review, arguing the appellant was not demoted because he remained an unassigned employee without any change of grade or pay. The appellant has not filed a response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Burger v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 582 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 32, 33 (2003), issued after the initial decision in this appeal, employees were assigned as "unencumbered" or "unassigned" employees after their former PS-6 positions were abolished. The Board held in <span class="Italic">Burger</span> that the employees were not demoted by RIF, even if they were required to perform lower-grade work as "unassigned" employees, because they remained officially assigned to positions at their former grade. As in <span class="Italic">Burger</span>, the appellant here remained an "unassigned" employee after his PS-6 position was abolished. Because he was not officially assigned to a lower-graded position, he was not demoted. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Kukish v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 360, 363 (1995) ("a reassignment action that does not result in a reduction in pay and grade is not appealable to the Board, even if the appellant's duties were diminished").
