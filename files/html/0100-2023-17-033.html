<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-34"><span class="space">C.</span> EEO CLAIMS; 5 USC 7121(d)</h3>
<p class="noindent">Similar to the election required of individuals who challenge adverse or performance-based actions, individuals who assert EEO violations must make their elections as well. 5 USC 7121 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) [discrimination] of this title which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both. An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise the matter under either a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure at such time as the employee timely initiates an action under the applicable statutory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated procedure, whichever event occurs first. Selection of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review the final decision pursuant to section 7702 of this title in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board, or, where applicable, to request the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review a final decision in any other matter involving a complaint of discrimination of the type prohibited by any law administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent">In pertinent part, 5 USC 2302 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, as prohibited under section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;on the basis of age, as prohibited under sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 631, 633a);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;on the basis of sex, as prohibited under section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206 (d));</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(D)&#x2003;on the basis of handicapping condition, as prohibited under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791); or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(E)&#x2003;on the basis of marital status or political affiliation, as prohibited under any law, rule, or regulation[.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Under &#x00A7; 7121(d), contact with an EEO counselor is not a formal election of remedy between EEO appeals proceedings and grievance proceedings. To raise a matter under an EEO appeals procedure, governed by 29 CFR Part 1614 [formerly 29 CFR Part 1613], there must be a written EEO complaint. The EEO precomplaint process is informal and often advisory. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Marshals Serv. and Int'l Council of Marshals Serv. Locals, AFGE</span>, 23 FLRA 414, 417-18 (1986). Without regard to statutory elections, a contract may exclude consideration of a matter that could be raised under EEO procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 1770 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg</span>, 61 FLRA 755 (2006) (arbitrator's award applied contract provision to exclude from grievance procedure challenge to suspension that was also challenged under EEO process).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the EEO complaint is not timely, a grievance is not precluded under the statutory election scheme. In <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 145 and DHS, C&#x0026;BP Laredo</span>, 65 FLRA 898, 899-900 (2011) (recon. den., 65 FLRA 1015 (2011)), the agency proposed a 14 day suspension, the employee initiated EEO counseling and filed an untimely EEO complaint as to the proposal. The agency subsequently <span id="page_1727"></span>mitigated the suspension to two days and the union took the matter to an arbitrator who dismissed the grievance as barred by the election of the EEO process challenging the proposed suspension. Because the EEO complaint was not timely, the EEO process was not elected and did not bar the grievance:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(d) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under [&#x00A7;] 2302(b)(1) of this title which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both. An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise the matter under either a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure at such time as the employee <span class="Italic">timely </span>initiates an action under the applicable statutory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated procedure, whichever event occurs first.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that, in order for &#x00A7; 7121(d) to bar a grievance, two requirements must be met: (1) the matter that is the subject of the grievance must be the same matter that was the subject of the action initiated under the statutory procedure; and (2) "such matter must have been earlier raised by the employee <span class="Italic">timely </span>initiating an action under the statutory procedure." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2145</span>, 61 FLRA 571, 573 (2006). <span class="Italic">Accord U.S. DoJ, U.S. Marshals Serv.</span>, 23 FLRA 414, 416 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Marshals Serv.</span>). <span class="Italic">Cf. Verkennes v. Cheney</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01913941 at 3 n.1 (Dec. 10, 1991) (untimely filed grievance would not bar formal EEO complaint on the same matter); <span class="Italic">Frankl v. Kemp</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 05910261 (May 13, 1991) (<span class="Italic">Frankl</span>) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority has held that the "timely initiation of an action" under statutory EEO procedures occurs with the "filing of a formal written complaint." <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Nat'l INS Council</span>, 27 FLRA 467, 469-70 (1987) (<span class="Italic">INS Council</span>). <span class="Italic">Accord Marshals Serv.</span>, 23 FLRA at 417-18. This is consistent with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations and precedent. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.301(a) (stating, in pertinent part, that "[a]n election to proceed under this part is indicated only by the filing of a written complaint; use of the pre-complaint process...does not constitute an election for purposes of this section[&#8197;]"); <span class="Italic">Frankl</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 05910261.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the grievant's formal EEO complaint was untimely. Although the Agency claims that &#x00A7; 7121(d) bars the appeal because the grievant "timely <span class="Italic">initiated </span>the EEO <span class="Italic">action</span>" before he filed his EEO complaint, as stated above, it is the filing of the formal EEO complaint--not any informal, precomplaint actions--that is relevant for purposes of interpreting &#x00A7; 7121(d). <span class="Italic">See INS Council</span>, 27 FLRA at 469-70; <span class="Italic">Marshals Serv.</span>, 23 FLRA at 417-18. Thus, the Agency's claim is misplaced. As there is no dispute that the grievant's formal EEO complaint was untimely, the above-cited precedent supports a conclusion that the EEO complaint did not bar the appeal under &#x00A7; 7121(d). Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator erred in relying on &#x00A7; 7121(d) to find the appeal nonarbitrable, and we set aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an arbitrator incorrectly dismisses a grievance as nonarbitrable, the Authority remands the matter to the parties for submission, absent settlement, to an arbitrator of their choice. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2823</span>, 64 FLRA 1144, 1147 (2010). Consistent with this principle, we remand this matter to the parties for submission, absent settlement, to an arbitrator of the parties' choice.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Statute provides in section 7121(d) that when an employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), such as an allegation of discrimination, has raised the matter under a statutory procedure, the employee may not file a written grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure concerning the same matter. For a grievance to be precluded by section 7121(d), two conditions must be met: (1) the matter which is the subject of the grievance must be the same matter which was the subject of the action initiated under the statutory procedure; and (2) such matter must have been earlier raised by the employee timely initiating an action under the statutory procedure....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Marshals Service and International Council of U.S. Marshals Service Locals, AFGE</span>, 23 FLRA 564 (1986), the Authority held that an EEO complaint filed over a suspension barred a later grievance over the same matter. The Authority discussed in that case what constitutes a "matter" for purposes of section 7121(d) and noted that "[t]he term 'matter' described in section 7121(d) pertains to prohibited personnel practices under section 2302(b)(1)."...&#8197;Further, the Authority noted that prohibited personnel practices for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) are any personnel actions defined in section 2302(a). The Authority stated that "a personnel action is central to the prohibited practice of section 2302(b)(1) and specifically encompasses recommended and approved actions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As relevant to the instant case, section 2302(a)(2)(A)(iv) defines a personnel action as "a detail, transfer, or reassignment[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the grievance filed on July 24, 1989, specifically concerned the grievant's allegation that he was not afforded a reasonable accommodation for his handicapping condition related to allergies and asthma and his request to be "transferred, at Government expense, to the northeastern part of the United States." The grievant asserted in the grievance that he was entitled to a transfer as an accommodation because he was a "qualified handicapped individual" due to his allergies. At the arbitration hearing, the Arbitrator accepted the Union's statement of the issue as well as the issue proposed by the Agency. The Union's statement of the issue alleged a violation of Article 17 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement and further charged that the Agency "failed to provide the grievant with a reasonable accommodation to his handicapping condition."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator considered and rejected the Union's contentions that the grievant was a "'qualified handicapped person[.]'"...&#8197;The grievant also argued before the Arbitrator that he was denied reasonable accommodation for his handicapping condition when the Agency refused to provide a limited duty assignment, a dust-free vehicle, and prescription dust masks and when the Agency charged him with being AWOL for certain days instead of granting sick leave for those days. We find that the substance of the grievance was the grievant's claim that he was discriminated against on the basis of his handicapping condition when the Agency refused to transfer him to the northeastern United States. Therefore, the "matter" in the grievance, for purposes of section 7121(d) of the Statute, concerned the Agency's failure to take a personnel action (that is, to transfer the grievant) based on discrimination against the grievant because of a handicapping condition, which would be a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(D).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the grievant earlier filed a formal EEO complaint regarding the same matter as that contained in the grievance.&#x2003;The Agency has submitted two letters addressed to the Chief Patrol Agent in El Paso and signed by the Agency's Acting Director of EEO. The letter dated August 8, 1989 states that the grievant filed Complaint of Discrimination No. I-89-5654 against the Agency on February 22, 1989 and states that the complaint alleges "that you discriminated against him on the bases [sic] of reprisal when you denied his medical transfer, at the Government['s] expense, to accommodate him for his handicapping condition of asthma." Included in Exhibit 2 to the Agency's exceptions is the Complaint of Discrimination dated February 22, 1989, and signed by the grievant. In the narrative describing his allegations of discrimination, the grievant wrote the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">On or about 4/26/88, I was diagnosed as having severe allergies which resulted in afflicting me with asthma. On or about 4/29/88, I sought a reasonable accommodation by way of a management need transfer, at Government expense, to the northeastern U.S. I also filed a claim with OWCP covering my allergic asthmatic condition. Management denied my request for a medical transfer at Government request [sic]. On or about 1/6/89, I found out that management of the El Paso Border Patrol Sector had, through mismanagement and gross negligence, delayed processing of my OWCP claim. This delay has cost me financially as I have had to pay my medical expenses out of pocket. Management has failed to afford me a reasonable accommodation with respect to my handicapping condition of asthma.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our comparison of the grievance resolved by the Arbitrator with the allegations of discrimination contained in the formal EEO complaint...we conclude that the "matter" raised in both proceedings is the same--the Agency's failure to accommodate the grievant's handicapping condition and transfer the grievant to the northeastern United States. There is no question that the formal EEO complaint dated February 22, 1989 was filed prior to the grievance, which was filed on July 24, 1989. Accordingly, the conditions of section 7121(d) have been met and the Arbitrator was, therefore, precluded under section 7121(d) of the Statute from resolving the grievance submitted to him. We must, therefore, set aside the award.</p>

However, this alleged distinction is inconsistent with the EEO complaint itself, which plainly states that the Agency discriminated against the grievant by "issu[ing] a proposed removal." Moreover, even if the EEO complaint alleged that other Agency conduct contributed to the hostile-work-environment claim, the proposed removal need only be "central" to both the complaint and grievance for the complaint to bar the grievance.[41] Accordingly, the Union's contention does not establish that the EEO complaint and grievance concerned different matters for purposes of &#x00A7; 7121(d).[42]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">This case focuses on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), a provision of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.

<p class="noindent-1">Garry Heimrich was removed from his position as a power-plant mechanic for the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 2016. He initially challenged his removal by filing a grievance through his union's negotiated procedure. He then filed a separate complaint with the Army Corps's EEO office. The Army Corps contends that the EEO complaint raises the same matters as previously covered in Heimrich's union grievance, which is prohibited by &#x00A7; 7121(d). Heimrich, in response, argues that his EEO complaint contains allegations of a hostile work environment, a separate matter not explicitly raised in his union grievance. The district court agreed with the Army Corps, granting the latter's motion to dismiss Heimrich's complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">BACKGROUND</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Heimrich worked as a power-plant mechanic for the Army Corps from September 2011 to July 2016, at which time he was terminated from his position. In its notice to Heimrich, the Army Corps cited as reasons for Heimrich's removal his defiance towards supervisors, noncompliance with leave procedures, submission of fabricated medical documents in leave requests, and disruptive behavior.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Heimrich was a member of the United Power Trades Organization (UPTO). He was thus covered under the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between UPTO and the Army Corps, which allows UPTO and its members to file grievances against the agency. In August 2016, UPTO filed a grievance on Heimrich's behalf, challenging his termination as discriminatory and retaliatory. The CBA grievance described a difficult relationship between Heimrich and the Army Corps, which was "exacerbated by both personal issues being dealt with by Mr. Heimrich and by actions the [Army Corps] has taken in response to the symptoms of the stress related disability diagnosed in Mr. Heimrich."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, the CBA grievance alleged that Heimrich was "under constant observation by [Army Corps] management" and that he was subject to selectively imposed performance standards and leave restrictions. This heightened scrutiny, the CBA grievance asserted, allowed the Army Corps to gather negative material on Heimrich and to ultimately remove him from his position. Heimrich's CBA grievance also generally cited violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as CBA Article 4.1, which prohibits "discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, mental or physical disabilities, and reprisal."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Army Corps upheld Heimrich's termination at the first step of the CBA grievance procedure. UPTO then submitted the CBA grievance to the next step of the negotiated procedure, and the Army Corps again upheld its decision. UPTO finally requested that the CBA grievance be submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At that point, Heimrich filed a formal complaint with the Army Corps's EEO office. The EEO complaint alleged that Heimrich's termination resulted from discriminatory and retaliatory treatment. Specifically, Heimrich argued that he had been discriminated against due to (1) his disability status as an alcoholic, and (2) the race of his wife and children, who are African American (Heimrich is Caucasian). Heimrich further alleged that he was retaliated against because he raised safety concerns in Army Corps meetings. The complaint also described several specific acts by Army Corps employees not contained within Heimrich's CBA grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In October 2016, the Army Corps's EEO office dismissed the complaint, informing Heimrich that the EEO office could not consider his claims because he had made a prior election to pursue the matter via the negotiated grievance procedure. Heimrich filed an appeal of the dismissal with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) the following month. While awaiting the EEOC's decision, Heimrich withdrew his request for arbitration of his CBA grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1729"></span>The EEOC affirmed the Army Corps's dismissal of Heimrich's complaint in January 2017. Heimrich's request for reconsideration was subsequently denied, and the EEOC informed of him of his right to file an appeal in federal district court. He then timely proceeded to file his federal court complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Army Corps moved to dismiss Heimrich's complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. After determining that Heimrich's CBA grievance and his EEO complaint raised the same "matter," the district court granted the Army Corps's motion on the basis that Heimrich's EEO complaint was filed in contravention of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). <span class="Italic">See Heimrich v. Dep't of Army</span>, No. 3:17-CV-01615, 2018 WL 1938296, at *5 (D. Or. Apr. 20, 2018). This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) establishes labor-management-relations practices for most federal workers. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. Recognizing that "the right of employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations...safeguards the public interest," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1)(A), the CSRA authorizes specified employees to "form, join, or assist any labor organization," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102. The CSRA provides for the formation of collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) between labor organizations and federal agencies, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114, and it requires that CBAs "provide procedures for the settlement of grievances," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). A CBA's procedures constitute the "exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage," with several noted exceptions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision of the CSRA in question in the present case, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), constitutes one such exception. Section 7121(d) sets forth the options available to unionized federal employees who, like Heimrich, raise grievances involving allegations of discrimination. Where the employee is affected by one of the discriminatory practices listed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)--and where the applicable CBA allows employees to raise discrimination claims--&#x00A7; 7121(d) establishes two alternative means by which to raise the "matter."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The aggrieved employee may, as one option, raise the matter by filing a grievance under the "negotiated procedure" described in the CBA. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.301(a). In the alternative, the employee may raise the matter under the "statutory procedure" by filing a formal complaint with the employing agency's EEO office. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.301(a). The employee "shall be deemed to have exercised his option" under &#x00A7; 7121(d) when he or she files the grievance or the EEO complaint, whichever first occurs. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). These procedures are mutually exclusive, meaning that an aggrieved employee seeking redress for a prohibited personnel practice under the CSRA may "raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, <span class="Italic">but not both</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Vinieratos v. U.S. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 939 F.2d 762, 768 (9th Cir. 1991) (explaining that an employee's election is irrevocable).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Defining the term "matter" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">At issue is whether Heimrich's CBA grievance and his EEO complaint raised the same "matter" under &#x00A7; 7121(d). Heimrich contends that his EEO complaint contains allegations of a hostile work environment that were not presented in his CBA grievance, so that the grievance and the complaint did not raise the same "matter." The Army Corps, however, argues that Heimrich's EEO complaint covers the same matters previously raised in his CBA grievance. Therefore, the Army Corps argues, the EEO office properly dismissed Heimrich's EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court noted that "[b]inding Ninth Circuit case law that interprets the term 'same matter' under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.301(a) is sparse." <span class="Italic">Heimrich</span>, 2018 WL 1938296, at *4. Cases outside this circuit, however, provide guidance. The leading cases are <span class="Italic">Bonner v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 781 F.2d 202 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and <span class="Italic">Facha v. Cisneros</span>, 914 F. Supp. 1142 (E.D. Pa. 1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 106 F.3d 384 (3d Cir. 1996) (unpublished table decision).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Bonner</span> held that the term "matter" under &#x00A7; 7121(d) refers to the "underlying action" challenged in the CBA grievance or the EEO complaint. 781 F.2d at 205. In reaching this conclusion, the court looked to congressional reports preceding the enactment of the CSRA, which largely used the term "matter" to refer to the underlying actions by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 204. The court also noted that other subsections of &#x00A7; 7121 refer to underlying government actions as "matters." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 204-205. To assign any other definition to the term, the court decided, would be "inconsistent with the clear meaning of the statute." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 205.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Facha</span>, the district court embraced the definition of the term "matter" in <span class="Italic">Bonner</span> and established the following test: if the aggrieved employee "raised a topic in both" the CBA grievance and the EEO complaint, or if those assigned to handle the CBA grievance or the EEO complaint would "necessarily have needed to inquire into a topic in discharging their duties," then the employee has raised the same matter. 914 F. Supp. at 1149. This inquiry requires the court to "focus on the 'matter' that the employee raised..., not on legal jargon." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1148.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A number of courts in other circuits have relied on the approach set forth in <span class="Italic">Bonner</span> and <span class="Italic">Facha</span>. The D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">Guerra v. Cuomo</span>, 176 F.3d 547, 550 (D.C. Cir. 1999), for example, did not expressly adopt a definition of the term "matter" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), but the court cited <span class="Italic">Bonner</span> and <span class="Italic">Facha</span> with approval, noting that "courts have tended to construe the term 'matter' to encompass more than a legal claim and instead to encompass the 'underlying action,' or the 'topics' raised." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 550 (citations omitted). <span class="Italic">See also Rosell v. Wood</span>, 357 F. Supp.2d 123, 129-30 (D.D.C. 2004) (citing <span class="Italic">Guerra</span> and <span class="Italic">Bonner</span> as authority for the determination that the employee in question raised the same matter in both his CBA grievance and in his EEO complaint). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Mustafa v. Iancu</span>, 313 F. Supp.3d 684, 692 (E.D. Va. 2018), an employee attempted to raise a hostile-work-environment claim through the EEO process. The court determined that the employee had previously raised the bases for his claim as part of his earlier CBA grievance. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 692. Citing <span class="Italic">Bonner</span> and other cases, the court concluded that &#x00A7; 7121(d) prevented the employee from pursuing his claim through the EEO process, even though the employee did not "package defendant's actions as part of a hostile work environment claim" during the CBA process. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other courts have applied the tests in <span class="Italic">Bonner</span> and <span class="Italic">Facha</span> to determine that an employee had raised separate matters under &#x00A7; 7121(d). The court in <span class="Italic">Zuzul v. McDonald</span>, 98 F. Supp.3d 852, 861-62 (M.D.N.C. 2015), for example, cited the definition in <span class="Italic">Bonner</span> and the test in <span class="Italic">Facha</span> to conclude that an employee's CBA grievance involving an assault-and-battery claim and her EEO complaint involving allegations of gender and racial harassment raised different matters. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Jackson</span>, 539 F. Supp.2d 116, 131 (D.D.C. 2008), the court concluded that an employee's CBA grievance and his EEO complaint contained the same matter to the extent that both challenged the revocation of a Compressed Work Schedule and charges of Absence Without Leave, but the court determined that the EEO complaint also contained unrelated allegations of a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A similar approach to that in <span class="Italic">Bonner</span> and <span class="Italic">Facha</span> has been embraced by a district court within this circuit. In <span class="Italic">Macy v. Dalton</span>, 853 F. Supp. 350 (E.D. Cal. 1994), a group of federal employees challenged their Reduction in Force terminations through both CBA grievances and EEO complaints. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 352. The court in <span class="Italic">Macy</span> adopted the logic in <span class="Italic">Bonner</span> to conclude that the term "matter" encompasses not only the legal theory behind an employee's claim, but also the underlying adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 353. In reaching this conclusion, the court considered the implementing regulation of the EEOC, which makes clear that a plaintiff need not have raised a discrimination claim in order to have raised the same "matter" under &#x00A7; 7121(d). The regulation in question provides as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An aggrieved employee who files a grievance with an agency whose negotiated agreement permits the acceptance of grievances which allege discrimination may not thereafter file a complaint on the same matter under this part 1614 irrespective of whether...the grievance has raised an issue of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.301(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Considering the standard for reviewing interpretive rules put forth in <span class="Italic">Skidmore v. Swift &#x0026; Co</span>., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944), the court in <span class="Italic">Macy</span> determined that the EEOC's interpretation of the term "matter" in &#x00A7; 7121(d) was persuasive and worthy of deference, noting that "[t]he regulation would have to substantially contradict the statute in order to justify judicial tinkering with this comprehensive regulatory scheme." 853 F. Supp. at 354. The court concluded that "[t]he dictates of this regulation are clear: if an employee chooses the grievance route, she may not thereafter file an EEO complaint regardless of whether her grievance alleged unlawful discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the wording and legislative history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), as well as the persuasive consensus among courts within and outside this circuit, we adopt the definition of the term "matter" as set forth in <span class="Italic">Bonner</span>. In other words, we hold that the term "matter" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) refers to the "underlying action" in the CBA grievance or the EEO complaint. "Matter," then, as other courts have acknowledged, is broader than "legal theory": it refers to the factual basis of the employee's adverse action. This leads us to the consideration of whether Heimrich has challenged the same underlying government action in both his CBA grievance and in his EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Heimrich's CBA grievance and his EEO complaint</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Heimrich does not contest that, to the extent that both his CBA grievance and his EEO complaint challenge his termination, the complaint was rightfully dismissed. He instead argues that his EEO complaint contained matters in addition to his termination, and that the parts of the complaint addressing these additional matters were wrongfully dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Heimrich's brief asserts, more specifically, that his EEO complaint <span id="page_1730"></span>contained allegations of a hostile work environment based on "(1) race by familial association; (2) retaliation; and (3) disability discrimination." The key problem with this argument, however, is that his EEO complaint in fact contains no mention of a hostile-work-environment claim. It instead alleges that Heimrich <span class="Italic">was wrongfully terminated</span> on the bases quoted above, stating that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the grounds given by management for [Heimrich's] removal from the Corps of Engineers are false and that the real reasons are: 1) retaliation for raising safety concerns; 2) complaining to the OSC and the MSPB; 3) discrimination against [Heimrich] for being a recovering alcoholic and using medical leave; and 4) having an African American wife and children.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Heimrich's belated attempt to retroactively recharacterize his challenge to his termination is unavailing. We will not impute a hostile-work-environment claim where no such allegation expressly appears in Heimrich's EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Heimrich further argues that his EEO complaint discussed "several harassing acts" not addressed in his CBA grievance. Although he does not point to any specific sections of his complaint in support of this contention, two particular allegations arguably fall within this category. One paragraph in the complaint alleges that an employee referred to Heimrich's African-American wife and children using a racial epithet and that another employee made a racially charged statement regarding Heimrich's son. Another sentence notes that Heimrich informed his supervisors that his drinking was exacerbated by the harassment he received in the form of "unwarranted discipline and leave restriction."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We see no indication, however, that Heimrich intended to establish a separate hostile-work-environment claim on these bases. The natural reading of Heimrich's EEO complaint is that these allegations were included to support his challenge to his termination under a new legal theory--that he was removed on the basis of his family's race and his disability. Under the definition set forth in <span class="Italic">Bonner</span> and now adopted by this court, Heimrich's attempt to raise new legal arguments to challenge his termination must fail under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). Other courts have similarly rejected attempts to reframe CBA grievances under new theories of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rosell v. Wood</span>, 357 F. Supp.2d 123, 131 (D.D.C. 2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Heimrich's own EEO complaint supports our conclusion. He checked the box on the EEO form indicating that he had previously raised the same issues in his CBA complaint under a union-negotiated grievance procedure. His appeal to the EEOC also noted that he had previously filed a complaint on the same matter with his collective bargaining unit. Finally, the district court observed that Heimrich, in his federal-court complaint, described his EEO complaint as challenging his termination, but made no mention of a hostile-work-environment claim. <span class="Italic">See Heimrich</span>, 2018 WL 1938296, at *3 n.2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even if Heimrich's EEO complaint had contained a specific hostile-work-environment claim, this would not change the outcome because the basic underlying facts remain the same. Heimrich, after all, alleged in his EEO complaint that his family's race and his disability were factors that led to his termination. He therefore should have raised these facts in his CBA grievance, where an arbitrator charged with handling the grievance would necessarily have inquired into the specific acts allegedly supporting his claim of wrongful termination. <span class="Italic">See Facha</span>, 914 F. Supp. at 1149. Heimrich's failure to do so should not give him two bites at the apple. This is the precise point of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), which allows an employee to raise the "matter" in either a CBA grievance or an EEO complaint, <span class="Italic">but not both</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that, although Heimrich's EEO complaint is barred, there was a procedure available to Heimrich to raise his hostile-work-environment claim in the grievance process. Had he exhausted the union grievance procedure, he could have appealed to the EEOC. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.401(d). He could then have amended his CBA grievance under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106(d), which governs complaints within the EEOC's agency program. It provides that "[a] complainant may amend a complaint at any time prior to the conclusion of the investigation to include issues or claims like or related to those raised in the complaint." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Heimrich would have therefore been able to pursue a hostile-work-environment claim before the EEOC if he had so desired. But what he could not do is attempt to pursue a hostile-work-environment claim in a separate EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">The equivalence of, or distinction between, what is raised in an EEO complaint and what is raised in a grievance is illustrated by a few other decisions. A suspension was the "matter" raised in both systems in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Marshals Serv. and Int'l Council of Marshals Serv. Locals, AFGE</span>, 23 FLRA 564, 564-68 (1986), involving a proposed suspension raised in an EEO complaint and a grievance challenging the suspension decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievance in this case concerns the suspension of the grievant for malicious false statements and for an unexcused absence.&#x2003;On December 28, 1983, the Activity proposed to suspend the grievant for 5 days. On January 3, 1984, the grievant amended a previously filed unfair labor practice charge to claim that the Activity was threatening him with disciplinary action as a reprisal against him for protected activity. On January 4, 1984, he filed a formal complaint under statutory equal employment opportunity (EEO) procedures alleging he had been discriminated against because of his race and age and demanding that he not be suspended as proposed. On March 27, 1984, the Activity issued a final decision suspending the grievant for 5 days. On April 23, 1984, the grievant filed a grievance which was submitted to arbitration protesting that the suspension was discriminatory and not for just cause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the proceeding before the Arbitrator, the Activity argued that under section 7121(d) of the Statute, the grievance was barred by the earlier-filed EEO complaint. The Activity also argued that under section 7116(d) of the Statute, the grievance was barred by the earlier-filed amended unfair labor practice charge. The Arbitrator acknowledged that the EEO complaint was filed before the grievance and expressly concerned the suspension action. The Arbitrator found that "[t]he EEO complaint is therefore recognized as the employee's option in this case." However, the Arbitrator further found that the grievant had exercised his option under section 7121(d) only as to the issue of discrimination in the matter. He ruled that the issue of whether the suspension was for just cause had not been raised elsewhere and therefore was not precluded by section 7121(d). He similarly ruled that the issue of just cause in the matter was also not precluded by section 7116(d). On the issue of just cause, the Arbitrator determined that only the unexcused absence charge was sustained and he reduced the suspension to 1 day.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(d) effectively provides that when an employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) has timely raised the matter under an applicable statutory procedure, the matter subsequently may not be raised as a grievance. In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3230, AFL-CIO and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 22 FLRA No. 44 (1986), the Authority identified the two conditions of section 7121(d) which must be met in order for a grievance to be precluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The matter which is the subject of the grievance is the same matter which is the subject of the action initiated under the statutory procedure, and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Such matter was earlier raised by the employee timely initiating an action under the statutory procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case we conclude that both of the conditions of section 7121(d) were met and that consequently the matter before the Arbitrator was precluded by the Statute from being raised as a grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, we find in this case that the term "matter" as used in section 7121(d) refers not to the issue or claim of prohibited discrimination, but rather, to the suspension action. The term "matter" described in 7121(d) pertains to a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1). In turn, section 2302(b) describes prohibited personnel practices in terms of "any personnel action" with "personnel action" defined in section 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii) to include a suspension for 14 days or less. Section 2302(b)(1) prohibits any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action from discriminating with respect to such personnel action authority. Thus, a personnel action is central to the prohibited practice of section 2302(b)(1) and specifically encompasses recommended and approved personnel actions. Accordingly, we find that the matter raised both by the grievance and the formal complaint of discrimination was the suspension, either proposed or final, of the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted, the Arbitrator acknowledged that the EEO complaint expressly concerned the suspension action. The complaint expressly referenced the suspension action and the grievant in the complaint expressly requested as corrective action that he not be suspended as proposed. This is in contrast to the situation presented in <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, 22 FLRA No. 44. In that case there was no express reference in the EEO complaint to the suspension action over which the grievance was filed and no requested corrective action in the complaint relating to the suspension. Accordingly, we agreed with the arbitrator that the matters raised by the EEO complaint and the grievance in that case were different and denied the exception contending otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, there was an election by the grievant, the aggrieved employee, to raise the matter in this case under the statutory EEO procedure. The Authority has recognized that a primary purpose and effect of election-of-remedy provisions of the Statute is to prevent relitigation of a matter in another forum after a choice of procedures in which to raise the matter has been made by the aggrieved party.</p>
<p class="noindent">Cited in <span class="Italic">Marshals Serv.</span> was <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3230 and EEOC</span>, 22 FLRA 448, 448-450 (1986), involving an individual who placed into the EEO complaint references to individual disparate treatment, including past disciplinary actions, and assertions of class-wide disparate treatment, and who specifically challenged a suspension through the grievance process, with the result that the EEO <span id="page_1731"></span>complaint did not preclude the grievance; the matter at issue in the grievance, the suspension, was not a matter specifically referenced in the EEO complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 5, 1984, the grievant was issued a notice of decision suspending him for two days for failing to follow instructions of his supervisor. On June 21, 1984, the grievant filed with the Agency a formal complaint of discrimination because of race and reprisal. In the complaint the grievant alleged that he had been subjected to unwarranted disciplinary actions because he was black and as a reprisal for representing a former employee in a hearing on her complaint of discrimination. He claimed that his work had been subjected to greater scrutiny, that he had been unfairly counseled, and that he had been verbally harassed on a recurring basis. He also claimed that blacks, as a class, were subjected to disparate discipline and received fewer incentive awards. As corrective action, he sought written apologies from his supervisor and from the district director. On June 26, 1984, a grievance was filed on the grievant's behalf, and ultimately submitted to arbitration, contending that the grievant's suspension did not promote the efficiency of the service, but instead was motivated by personal animosity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the Arbitrator, the Activity argued that the grievance was barred by section 7121(d) of the Statute and the corresponding provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Specifically, the Activity maintained that by filing the formal complaint of discrimination and mentioning "unwarranted disciplinary actions," the grievant had raised the matter of his suspension under the statutory equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint procedures. Consequently, the Activity argued that the raising of the matter of his suspension subsequently under the negotiated grievance procedure was precluded by section 7121 and the agreement which permit an employee to raise such a matter under the statutory EEO procedures or the negotiated grievance procedure, but not under both. The Arbitrator however determined that the "matter" raised under the negotiated grievance procedure was not the same "matter" that the grievant had raised under the statutory EEO procedures. Accordingly, the Arbitrator ruled on this basis that the grievance was not precluded. On the merits the Arbitrator set aside the suspension finding that it violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(d) effectively provides that when an employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) has raised the matter under a statutory procedure, the matter subsequently may not be raised as a grievance. Thus, the elements of section 7121(d), both of which must attach in order for a grievance to be precluded, are: (1) the matter which is the subject of the grievance is the same matter which is the subject of the action initiated under the statutory procedure, and (2) such matter was earlier raised by the employee timely initiating an action under the statutory procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case the Arbitrator ruled that the matter raised under the statutory EEO procedures was different from the matter of the grievant's suspension raised under the negotiated grievance procedure and that consequently the grievance was not precluded. The Authority concludes that the Agency fails to establish otherwise and that therefore no basis is provided for finding the award deficient. Specifically, the Authority finds contrary to the position of the Agency that with no express reference to the June 5th suspension and with no requested corrective action relating to that suspension in the grievant's EEO complaint, the matter which was the subject of the grievance is not the same as any of the matters which were the subject of the EEO complaint filed with the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> was extended by <span class="Italic">SSA, OHA and IFPTE, AALJs</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-23.html">71 FLRA 123</a>, 123-25 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting), to bar a grievance challenging a reprimand that arose from an investigation earlier challenged as retaliatory under the EEO process:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an award dated December 20, 2017, Arbitrator Martin Henner found that an earlier equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint concerned a different matter than the grievance before him, and that the Agency did not have just cause to discipline the grievant. We consider one of the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that &#x00A7; 7121(d) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute) bars the grievance from arbitration. Because the earlier filed, formal EEO complaint concerns the same matter as the grievance, we grant this exception and set aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 14, 2016, the grievant received a favorable settlement on an EEO complaint she filed against the Agency. Two days later, the Agency informed the grievant that it was investigating her for conduct that had occurred in May 2016.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In March, 2017, the grievant filed a formal complaint with the EEO (second complaint) against the Agency alleging retaliation for the grievant's first EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following the conclusion of the investigation, the Agency issued a written reprimand to the grievant in May 2017. In response, the Union filed a grievance on June 29, 2017 on her behalf, alleging that the Agency violated the parties' agreement and did not have just cause to issue a written reprimand. The parties were unable to resolve the grievance, and it proceeded to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator framed two issues: first, whether the second EEO complaint barred the grievance from arbitration; and second, whether there was just cause for the reprimand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the question of arbitrability, the Agency argued that, under &#x00A7; 7121(d) of the Statute, the grievant's formal EEO complaint barred the grievance from arbitration because the grievance and the EEO complaint concern the same matters. The Union contended that the Agency's allegedly retaliatory investigation and the written reprimand were separate matters under &#x00A7; 7121(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Arbitrator found that the EEO complaint and the grievance alleged separate violations and "concern[ed] different subjects with no overlap." Further, the Arbitrator found that, because the discipline had not been imposed at the time the grievant filed the formal complaint, the grievant never had the election of remedies provided in &#x00A7; 7121(d) for the letter of reprimand. Ultimately, the Arbitrator found that there was no just cause for the written reprimand and sustained the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 18, 2018, the Agency filed exceptions to the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions: Section 7121(d) bars the grievance.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(d).[4] We review this exception <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.[5] Section 7121(d) provides that an employee may raise a "matter under a statutory [EEO] procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both."[6] For purposes of &#x00A7; 7121(d), the term "matter" refers "'not to the issue or claim of prohibited discrimination,' but, rather, to the personnel action involved."[7] In this context, personnel actions are "personnel practices" as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a).[8]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As to the current case, the grievant's formal EEO complaint, filed in March 2017, alleged that the Agency had initiated an investigation "in retaliation for her protected activity of filing" an EEO complaint. The grievance, filed in May 2017, alleged that, after the Agency completed that investigation, the Agency instituted a disciplinary action without just cause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Just as in <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span>, by filing a formal EEO complaint concerning the investigation, the grievant elected that procedure and &#x00A7; 7121(d) foreclosed the grievant from later filing a grievance on the reprimand letter resulting from that investigation.[12] In short, the investigation merged with the discipline as a single <span class="Italic">matter</span> under &#x00A7; 7121(d).[13] The dissent relies on a flawed rationale which forces us to make a clear distinction. Past majorities relied on interpretations of &#x00A7; 7121(d) and "matter" that, for all practical purposes, permitted grievants and unions to parse the fundamentally same matter into separate complaints for no other purpose than to get two bites of the proverbial apple. We do not believe that Congress intended for the application of the election-of-forum provisions--&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(d) and 7121(d)--to be based on "technical hair-splitting and artful pleading."[14] Instead, theses statutory provisions <span id="page_1732"></span>were intended to prevent unnecessary or redundant filings on related, similar, or same matters.[15]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;The dissent attempts to make our application of <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> appear unreasonable, but <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> is directly relevant here. In that case, an EEO complaint about a <span class="Italic">proposal</span> for discipline barred a grievance over the <span class="Italic">imposition</span> of discipline. And here, an EEO complaint about an <span class="Italic">investigation</span> for discipline bars a grievance over the <span class="Italic">imposition</span> of discipline. The similarity of these circumstances is plain to all but the dissent.</p>

In this case, &#x00A7; 7121(d) of the Federal Service Labor&#8209;Management Relations Statute (Statute) bars the grievance because an earlier filed equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint concerns the same matter as the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case involves a grievance alleging that the Agency's imposition of a fourteen&#8209;day suspension for the grievant's "lack of candor" in her EEO complaint was not for just and sufficient cause, was untimely, and was reprisal for engaging in protected EEO activity. Arbitrator Daniel M. Winograd found that the Agency's fourteen&#8209;day suspension of the grievant was not for just and sufficient cause as mandated by the parties' agreement because the Agency failed to prove the charge of lack of candor, the discipline was based on reprisal, and the discipline was untimely.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the grievant sent a memorandum to the Agency EEO specialist on February 23, 2016, alleging that her supervisor was creating a hostile work environment by stalking and harassing her. The Agency initiated the investigation into the allegations in March 2016. According to the record, the grievant subsequently filed a formal complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) based on the same allegations sometime before November 2016. In May 2017, the Agency concluded the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, on June 22, 2017, based on information obtained during the EEO investigation, the Agency issued a notice of proposed suspension for fourteen days based on a charge of lack of candor. Thereafter, the deciding official determined that the grievant lacked candor when "accusing [her supervisor] of stalking her, harassing her and discriminating against her because [the investigator] could find no corroboration for grievant's allegations." After returning from the fourteen&#8209;day suspension, the grievant filed the instant grievance on October 4, 2017, alleging that the Agency did not have just and sufficient cause for the suspension because it did not prove that she knew the statements to be false, the discipline was untimely, and the discipline was in retaliation for engaging in EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency failed to prove that the grievant lacked candor when reporting her concerns about her supervisor, that the Agency failed to comply with the time requirements for effecting disciplinary action set forth by the parties' agreement, and that the suspension constituted unlawful reprisal for the grievant's EEO complaint.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Member Abbott notes that the Arbitrator was correct in finding there was retaliation; however, the Arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to hear the grievance because &#x00A7; 7121(d) prevents him--and the Authority--from hearing a grievance when an earlier&#8209;filed EEO complaint concerns the same matter. As such, the grievant must pursue legal action through the forum she elected--the EEOC.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency did not challenge the arbitrability of the grievance in its exceptions; however, an award cannot stand if the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to resolve the grievance in the first place.[7] Furthermore, the Authority can consider jurisdictional issues <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>.[8] Therefore, we consider whether the grievance is barred by the earlier&#8209;filed EEO complaint in accordance with &#x00A7; 7121(d).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has emphasized that election&#8209;of&#8209;forum provisions "were intended to prevent unnecessary or redundant filings on related, similar, or same matters."[12] Further, discriminatory harassment is a "personnel action" for purposes of applying &#x00A7; 7121(d) when it results in a "significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions."[13] Here, the grievant's formal EEO complaint sought relief for allegations that her <span class="Italic">supervisor was stalking and harassing her</span>. The instant grievance alleged that the suspension--for her "lack of candor" in "<span class="Italic">accusing</span> [<span class="Italic">her supervisor</span>] <span class="Italic">of stalking her, harassing her, and discriminating against her</span>"--was in retaliation for the grievant's EEO complaint against her supervisor.[15] Therefore, the litigation of the EEO complaint and the grievance would both require the factfinder to address the same underlying personnel action--the allegations of discriminatory harassment. The grievant filed the formal EEO complaint <span class="Italic">before</span> she pursued the matter through the <span id="page_1733"></span>negotiated grievance procedure. As such, &#x00A7; 7121(d) bars the grievance, and the allegations raised in the barred grievance must be addressed in the forum that the grievant previously selected--the EEO&#8209;complaint process.[16]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">I disagree with the majority's decision to vacate the Arbitrator's award on grounds that the grievance is barred by &#x00A7; 7121(d) of the Federal Service Labor&#8209;Management Relations Statute (the Statute) As in its decision in <span class="Italic">SSA, Office of Hearings Operations</span> (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>),[2] the majority's application of this jurisdictional bar "belies any plausible interpretation of Authority precedent or the meaning of the term 'matter' in &#x00A7; 7121(d)."[3]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(d) states that an employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice may raise a "matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both." As the majority itself acknowledges, the term "matter" refers "'not to the issue or claim of prohibited discrimination,' but rather, to the personnel action involved."[6] Thus, to determine whether a grievance is barred by a previously&#8209;filed EEO complaint, "we must assess which personnel actions were at issue in the EEO complaint and the grievance."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Majority at 3 (quoting <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 71 FLRA at 124).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even adopting the majority's characterization of the contents of the grievant's EEO complaint, and its conclusion that the discriminatory harassment alleged in her complaint is a "personnel action" for the purposes of applying &#x00A7; 7121(d), there is simply no basis for concluding that it barred the Union's grievance. According to the majority, "the grievant's formal EEO complaint sought relief for allegations that her supervisor was stalking and harassing her." In contrast, the grievance challenged the Agency's suspension of the grievant for fourteen days, which is an entirely distinct "personnel action." That should be the end of the analysis.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., VA Waco</span>, 70 FLRA at 94 (EEO complaint barred the grievance because "it is clear from the record that the only underlying personnel action at issue in the EEO complaint, and in the grievance, was the [a]gency's denial of the grievant's request to work 100 [percent] official time"); <span class="Italic">Keyport</span>, 69 FLRA at 294 (EEO complaint barred grievance because the grievant's "reprimand was the personnel action--or 'matter'--at issue in both the EEO complaint and the grievance"); <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, U.S. Marshals Serv</span>., 23 FLRA 564, 567 (1986) (EEO complaint barred the grievance because "the matter raised both by the grievance and the formal complaint of discrimination was the suspension, either proposed or final, of the grievant"); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE Local 2145</span>, 61 FLRA 571, 574 (2006) (grievance concerning detail is barred by previously&#8209;filed EEO complaint challenging the same agency action, but portion of amended grievance challenging grievant's permanent reassignment, which included an allegation that the reassignment was in reprisal for the EEO complaint, was not barred by the complaint, which had been filed several months before the agency permanently reassigned the grievant and therefore did not address the reassignment).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ignoring these basic principles, the majority nevertheless concludes that the grievance is barred by the EEO complaint because "litigation of the EEO complaint and the grievance would both require the factfinder to address the same underlying personnel action--the allegations of discriminatory harassment." But this broad application of &#x00A7; 7121(d)'s jurisdictional bar is wholly unsupported by the cases upon which the majority relies for this conclusion.[13]</p>

U.S. Department of the Army</span>,[16] the court specifically determined that it was required to consider "whether [the plaintiff] has challenged the <span class="Italic">same underlying government action</span> in both his...grievance and in his EEO complaint."[17] Applying that standard, the court affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiff's EEO complaint under &#x00A7; 7121(d) because both his grievance and EEO complaint challenged the agency's termination of his employment.[18] And in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force Headquarters, Oklahoma City, Air Logistics Center, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma</span>,[19] the Authority found that the grievance was barred by the earlier-filed EEO complaint because they both involved the same matter--namely, "the alleged prohibited personnel practice of failing to promote the grievant."[20]</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2145 and VA Hunter Holmes McGuire MC</span>, 61 FLRA 571 (2006) (EEO challenge to detail did not bar grievance challenging permanent reassignment); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force Hq., Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 43 FLRA 290, 298-99 (1991), <span class="Italic">reconsideration</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 43 FLRA 955 (1992) (prior EEO complaint stripped arbitrator of jurisdiction in promotion case; it was immaterial that remedy claimed and description of issues in cases were slightly different; both sought entitlement to promotion).</p>
<p class="noindent">An amendment to an EEO complaint to include a reprimand barred a later grievance concerning the reprimand, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr., Keyport and Bremerton MTC</span>, 69 FLRA 292, 294 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the interim award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(d) of the Statute. As relevant here, &#x00A7; 7121(d) provides that an employee may raise a personnel "matter under a statutory [EEO] procedure or the negotiated procedure, <span class="Italic">but not both</span>." Further, an employee makes a binding choice between those two options when the employee "timely initiates an action under the applicable statutory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing...<span class="Italic">whichever event occurs first</span>." For purposes of &#x00A7; 7121(d), the term "matter" refers "'not to the issue or claim of prohibited discrimination,' but, rather, to the personnel action involved."[30]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[30]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force Headquarters, Okla. City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker Air Force Base, Okla.</span>, 43 FLRA 290, 297 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Tinker</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, U.S. Marshals Serv</span>., 23 FLRA 564, 567 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Marshals Serv</span>.)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with these standards, as relevant here, we must assess which personnel actions were at issue in the EEO complaint and the grievance, in order to resolve the Agency's exception. Initially, we note that the Union asked the Arbitrator to decide "[w]hether or not the [reprimand]...was for just cause." Relatedly, the Arbitrator found that the EEO complaint and the grievance both concerned the reprimand. Further, the grievant's email amending his EEO complaint, and the grievance itself, challenged the reprimand. Moreover, the relief that the grievance requested was the rescission of the reprimand and its removal from the grievant's record. We recognize that the grievance cited the parties' agreement, whereas the EEO complaint relied on nondiscrimination statutes and regulations, but that distinction did not change the <span class="Italic">personnel action</span> in dispute.[37] For those reasons, we find that the reprimand was the personnel action--or "matter"--at issue in both the EEO complaint and the grievance.[39]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Tinker</span>, 43 FLRA at 298-99 (where grievance and EEO complaint both alleged an improper failure to promote, albeit based on different theories, &#x00A7; 7121(d) barred later-filed grievance because of earlier-filed EEO complaint).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[39]&#x2003;Member Pizzella agrees with the majority that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(d) of the Statute. He reiterates, however, the inconsistency, which he noted in <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Metro. Corr. Ctr., N.Y., N.Y</span>., 67 FLRA 442, 452 (2014) (Dissenting Opinion of Member Pizzella), whereby the majority will bar an individual employee, as here, from filing a statutory-based EEO complaint and a grievance on the same matter because of &#x00A7; 7121(d) but will permit a union to file a statutory-unfair-labor-practice (ULP) charge and a contract-based grievance on the same matter. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. According to Member Pizzella, permitting a union to file a statutory-ULP charge and a contract-based grievance on the same matter, based entirely on the unfounded distinction between "matter" in &#x00A7; 7121(d) and "issue" in &#x00A7; 7116(d), runs counter to Congress' clear intent to prevent "<span class="Italic">duplicative proceedings</span> by requiring an aggrieved party to make <span class="Italic">an election of remedies</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citation omitted)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its opposition, the Union repeatedly asserts that the interim award is not deficient because the Agency allegedly denied the grievant "due process" by refusing to meet regarding the grievance. However, the Agency denied the grievance on the basis that &#x00A7; 7121(d) barred it, and the Union does not identify any authority to show that the grievant had a due-process right to meetings regarding a grievance that the law barred. Therefore, the Union's due-process argument does not provide a basis to find the interim award consistent with &#x00A7; 7121(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the grounds above, and because there is no dispute that the grievant amended his EEO complaint to include the reprimand before filing the grievance, &#x00A7; 7121(d) barred the Arbitrator from resolving the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 65</span>, 56 FLRA 292, 297 (2000), if a grievance was first filed as to a personnel action, e.g., a reassignment, and a later-filed EEO complaint resulted in a determination of no discrimination from EEOC, the FLRA would not set aside a contrary arbitration award favoring the grievant on the basis of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, for, in FLRA's judgment, the EEOC determination "is without legal effect."</p>
<p class="noindent">An election may be implied by a grievant's decision, expressed in an EEO settlement, to use the EEO process as the means to secure enforcement of the settlement, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1592 and Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB</span>, 57 FLRA 882, 882-83 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following her non-selection for a vacant position, the grievant, believing that she had been discriminated against because of her age, filed an informal complaint with an EEO counselor. She and the Agency subsequently entered into a settlement agreement resolving her complaint. As part of the settlement agreement, the grievant agreed not to pursue the issue in her complaint "under any other avenue of redress." The settlement agreement also provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In the event that the complainant perceives that management has failed to comply with the terms of this agreement or that this agreement is being violated in any way, complainant will notify, in writing, the Commander's Designee...within 30 days of the violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the settlement agreement permitted the grievant to request the reinstatement of her complaint in writing if the Agency failed to carry out the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 25, 2001, the grievant wrote the Agency's Chief EEO Counselor, stating her belief that the Agency had violated the settlement agreement. She also requested that, "we return to <span class="Italic">status quo</span> and I am permitted to start the EEO complaint process over in order to resolve my EEO complaint." The Arbitrator then found that the Union filed a grievance protesting the absence of a resolution in the case and the refusal of management to hold a step one grievance meeting on February 5, 2001. The Agency subsequently denied the grievance, informing the grievant that because she chose to raise the matter under a statutory procedure by contacting the Agency's Chief EEO Counselor on January 25, she could not also file a grievance over the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the grievant's January 25 letter, the Agency's Chief EEO Counselor informed the grievant that the Agency had complied with the terms of the settlement agreement and informed her of her right to appeal the matter to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). She then filed an appeal with the EEOC over the alleged breach of the settlement agreement on April 13, 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the grievant could not pursue the grievance, the Arbitrator relied upon the settlement agreement. In this connection, he found that the grievant had agreed, in the settlement agreement, to pursue relief through the EEO process in the event that she believed that the Agency had violated that agreement. This interpretation of the settlement agreement has not been challenged. Therefore, we will defer to the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant had bound herself to use statutory EEO procedures to pursue her claim that the Agency failed to comply with the terms of settlement agreement. As such, &#x00A7; 7121(d) of the Statute is not a relevant basis on which to challenge the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(d) of the Statute permits matters involving claims under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) to be filed under a negotiated grievance procedure or under the statutory procedure, but not both. For a grievance to be precluded under &#x00A7; 7121(d) of the Statute, two conditions must be met: (1) the matter which is the subject of the statutory proceeding is the same matter that is the subject of the grievance initiated under the negotiated grievance procedure; and (2) such matter must have been raised by the timely filing of an action under the statutory procedure. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force, Headquarters, Okla. City Air Logistics Ctr.,</span> <span class="Italic">Tinker Air Force Base, Okla., </span>43 FLRA 290, 296 (1991). The term "matter" as used in &#x00A7; 7121(d) of the Statute refers "'not to the issue or claim of prohibited discrimination,' but, rather, to the suspension action involved<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 297, <span class="Italic">quoting United States Dep't of</span> <span class="Italic">Justice, United States Marshals Serv., </span>23 FLRA 564, 567 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first prong of the test for preclusion under &#x00A7; 7121(d) of the Statute is satisfied as both the grievance and the grievant's letter to the Agency's Chief EEO Counselor concerned the same subject matter, the Agency's alleged noncompliance with the settlement agreement. With regard to the second prong of that same test, the Arbitrator found that the grievant, in the settlement agreement, had bound herself to pursue relief through the EEO process. Nothing in the Statute or Authority precedent prevents an employee from agreeing in advance to elect to use one procedure over another. Therefore, we conclude that the employee agreed to elect to use statutory EEO procedures to pursue her claim that the Agency failed to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement. Consequently, the Arbitrator's enforcement of that election does not establish that the award conflicts with &#x00A7; 7121(d).</p>
<p class="noindent">If EEO issues are not raised in a grievance brought to challenge an action, the grievant may have failed to exhaust administrative remedies required to pursue a subsequent EEO case as to the same action in court, <span class="Italic">Redmon v. Mineta</span>, 243 Fed. Appx. 920, 923-26 (6th Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-settled that "[a] person seeking to bring a discrimination claim <span id="page_1735"></span>under Title VII in federal court must first exhaust her administrative remedies." <span class="Italic">Randolph v. Ohio Dep't of Youth Servs., </span>453 F.3d 724, 731 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing <span class="Italic">Brown v. General Serv. Administration, </span>425 U.S. 820, 832, 96 S. Ct. 1961, 48 L. Ed. 2d 402 (1976)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A federal employee who suffers an adverse employment action and believes such action was discriminatory may challenge such adverse action in one of three ways. The aggrieved employee may file a direct appeal of the adverse action to the MSPB [Merit Systems Protection Board], file a grievance under his or her union's negotiated grievance procedure, or file a formal complaint with the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]. The aggrieved employee's election of any one of these three enumerated options precludes election of the other two.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Marbly v. Rubin,</span> 202 F.3d 269, 2000 WL 32009, (6th Cir. 2000) (table) (unpublished) (internal citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) &#x0026; (e). Thus, "[a]n aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice [including discrimination based on sex] which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d); <span class="Italic">see also Smith v. Kaldor,</span> 869 F.2d 999, 1005 (6th Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, according to the record on summary judgment, it is undisputed that Redmon elected to challenge her suspension and reassignment under her union's negotiated grievance procedure (the CBA in place between the FAA and the union).[6] Further, as she admitted in the district court proceedings, Redmon fully completed the procedures available under the CBA.[7] Redmon completed the union negotiated grievance procedure before she filed a complaint with the EEO. Since Redmon elected to pursue her union's negotiated grievance procedure to challenge her suspension and reassignment <span class="Italic">before</span> submitting the EEO complaint, she was foreclosed from utilizing the EEO administrative procedure to challenge these adverse employment actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) &#x0026; (e)(1); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;It is also undisputed that an employee may raise claims of sex discrimination and retaliation for protected activity under the CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The final stage of grievance procedures provided for arbitration, but only the union could request arbitration. ("The right of individual presentation does not include the right of taking the matter to arbitration unless the Union agrees to do so."). Redmon petitioned her union for arbitration, but the union denied her request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Redmon argues that she did not elect the union grievance procedure for the Title VII claims presented in the district court because she did not raise any claims for discrimination in the union negotiated grievance procedure and only raised these discrimination claims in the EEO charge.&#x2003;This argument is unavailing because both Redmon's union grievance and EEO charge dealt with the "same matters" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). The fact that she advanced different legal theories to challenge these actions in the union grievance and EEO complaint is inconsequential. "An aggrieved employee who files a grievance with an agency [such as the FAA] whose negotiated agreement permits the acceptance of grievances which allege discrimination may not thereafter file a complaint on the <span class="Italic">same matter</span> [with the EEO]...irrespective of whether the agency has informed the individual of the need to elect or of whether the grievance has raised an issue of discrimination." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.301(a) (emphasis omitted). As the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has aptly noted, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), the term "matter" "refer[s] to the underlying government action which precipitated the complaint[,]" not the legal theory employed to challenge the government action. <span class="Italic">Giove v. United States DOT,</span> 178 Fed. Appx. 814, 818 (10th Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (citing<span class="Italic"> Bonner v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., </span>781 F.2d 202, 204-05 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); <span class="Italic">see also Guerra v. Cuomo,</span> 336 U.S. App. D.C. 121, 176 F.3d 547, 550 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (discussing how under &#x00A7; 7121(d) "courts have tended to construe the term 'matter' to encompass more than a legal claim and instead to encompass the 'underlying action...or the 'topics raised[.]'").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the union negotiated grievance procedure, Redmon challenged her suspension; removal from the control room; and obligation to train, certify and maintain operational currency in another area of specialization that placed her in a pass/fail situation. She alleged that her suspension was issued in an untimely manner; and that supervisor Kyle did not handle her situation appropriately because he did not explain the charges and what had been taken into consideration in determining her punishment. She further claimed that the disciplinary actions imposed on her for the first offense of striking a co-worker were excessive and not in line with other regional disciplinary actions taken for similar offenses by other employees. She asserted that she had been singled out, treated differently, and that her rights had not been protected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her EEO complaint Redmon advance three theories of discrimination: disparate treatment, hostile work environment, and reprisal. Specifically, under a disparate treatment theory, she argued that her unpaid leave and removal from the control room exceeded the disciplinary actions imposed on male employees and that this disparity was on account of her sex. She argued that she was subject to a hostile work environment because the male members of her former work shift and House's friends sided entirely with House and would not listen to her side of the story about the August 8, 2003 incident. Redmon also claimed reprisal on the grounds that supervisor Hoyer retaliated against her by "keeping [her] away from [her] air traffic position, keeping [her] from earning full benefits, and destroying [her] career" because of her "earlier complaints of discrimination."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that both Redmon's union grievance and EEO complaint dealt with the same adverse employment actions or "underlying government action"--to wit, her suspension, removal from the control room, and obligation to train, certify, and maintain operational currency in another area of specialization. Thus, the union grievance and EEO complaint involved the "same matters" within the meaning of section 7121(d), and the EEO complaint is barred. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d); <span class="Italic">Bonner, </span>781 F.2d at 204-05. Therefore, as Redmon was foreclosed from bringing the EEO complaint, only the union grievance can be considered by this Court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question before this Court then is whether Redmon exhausted her administrative remedies as to her Title VII claims in the union grievance procedure.&#x2003;In the complaint before the district court, Redmon argued that she was treated differently because of her sex since "her discipline far exceeded that given to similarly situated male employees." She argued that the male employees created a "sexually charged hostile working environment" and that her employer knew of this hostile environment but failed to protect her. In the union grievance, Redmon never argued that she was subjected to sexual harassment or a sexually hostile work environment. Although she argued in the union grievance proceedings that her discipline was excessive and not in line with other regional disciplinary actions taken for similar offenses by other employees, and that she had been singled out and treated differently, she never argued that this disparity was due to her sex. She also never argued that the discipline imposed upon her was in retaliation for her 1991 EEO complaint or any other protected activity. As such, it is clear that Redmon failed to raise her sex discrimination, sexual harassment, hostile work environment, and reprisal for protected activity claims in the union grievance procedure, even though she could have raised such claims. Accordingly, Redmon failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as to the Title VII claims raised before the district court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the proceedings below, the district court held that Redmon had not exhausted her administrative remedies. In reaching this conclusion, the district court focused its analysis on the fact that Redmon failed to demonstrate that she had filed her EEO complaint within 45 days of any adverse employment action. The district court's emphasis on the timing of the EEO complaint was misguided, since Redmon's election of the union negotiated grievance procedure foreclosed her ability to file the EEO complaint on the "same matters." However, this error by the district court was harmless, because, as discussed above, Redmon failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under the union grievance procedure. As such, we conclude that summary judgment was properly entered in favor of the DOT.</p>
