<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-96"><span class="space">d.</span> Jurisdictional Issue</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1524"></span>Board law becomes confused or impenetrable in the application of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel to jurisdictional issues. <span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> is supposed to apply to cases previously adjudicated on the merits. Because the Board, contrary to the guidance of the Federal Circuit, occasionally confuses the inability to prove a claim with the failure to invoke Board jurisdiction--particularly in cases involving constructive adverse actions and IRA appeals--analysis of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> becomes muddled as the Board attempts to avoid relitigation of cases that it dismisses on jurisdictional grounds but in effect were dismissed because the appellant failed to prove a claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel are not bases for dismissing an appeal for lack of jurisdiction; rather, they are bases for dismissing an appeal within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Mycka v. OPM</span>, 56 MSPR 675, 679 (1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Merzweiler v. OPM</span>, 100 MSPR 442, 445 &#x00B6; 7 (2005) (<span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel are bases to dismiss an appeal within the Board's jurisdiction, but with limited exceptions those doctrines are not appropriate bases for dismissal of an appeal when jurisdiction is lacking) <span class="Italic">Martinez v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 356, 358-59 &#x00B6; 6 (2001) (stating rule); <span class="Italic">Besemer v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 260, 263 (1998) (stating rule); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Roesel v. Peace Corps</span>, 111 MSPR 366, 372 &#x00B6; 15, 2009 MSPB 90 (2009) ("<span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is not a basis to dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction"); <span class="Italic">Hicks v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 599, 604 &#x00B6; 12 (1999) (when a prior appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, there was no examination of the merits of the agency's action). <span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> is not a jurisdictional bar to repetitive litigation; if not timely raised it is waived. <span class="Italic">Castle v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 417, 423 n.6 (1995); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Alford v. OPM</span>, DC-844E-13-0283-I-1 (NP 2/4/2014) ("Collateral estoppel may be grounds for dismissing an appeal for lack of jurisdiction only where the decision being given preclusive effect was itself based on a lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Noble v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 693, &#x00B6; 11 (2003).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a prior appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, it does not serve to bar a subsequent appeal through <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, <span class="Italic">Abou-Hussein v. Dept. of Navy</span>, AT-1221-11-0850-W-1 (NP 8/1/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the administrative judge erred in determining that the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> applies and bars the appellant from re-litigating his claims that the agency made death threats, targeted his livelihood and employability, and made false allegations accusing him of espionage, terrorist connections, substance abuse, and having a mental disorder. Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> (also known as "claim preclusion"), a valid, final judgment on the merits of an action bars a second action involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action. <span class="Italic">Encarnado v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant's claims that his transfer and his restoration to duty were otherwise appealable actions were precluded by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, these four criteria are met with respect to the administrative judge's determination that the appellant's transfer and his restoration to duty are not otherwise appealable actions.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that the second collateral estoppel factor is not present because "[T]he initial decision was not fully litigated as the only question addressed [in the previous appeal] was jurisdictional."

A review of the initial decision in the previous appeal shows that the voluntariness issue was fully litigated, i.e., the administrative judge made a finding that the appellant's resignation was voluntary.

Here, the issue that was actually litigated in the prior appeal was whether the Board had jurisdiction over the appellant's WIGI appeal while his reconsideration request was still pending before the agency.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit explained the intersection of the two doctrines of preclusion in appeals involving jurisdictional issues, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 97 Fed. Appx. 297, 299-300 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Under [the doctrine of] <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action." <span class="Italic">Allen v. McCurry</span>, 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S. Ct. 411, 66 L. Ed.2d 308 (1980). Because Jackson's prior involuntary resignation and job restoration claims were not adjudicated on the merits, but were dismissed in the prior appeals for lack of jurisdiction, those dismissals may not constitute a basis for precluding all claims that could have been raised in those appeals under <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) (an involuntary dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is not an "adjudication on the merits"). However, the error is harmless because Jackson cannot attempt once again to revisit the jurisdiction issue simply by urging the same arguments, merely reworded. The Board previously dismissed Jackson's involuntary resignation and job restoration claims for lack of jurisdiction based on Jackson's failure to show that her retirement was involuntary or that she suffered a compensable injury<span class="Italic">. Jackson v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, No. SF-0752-98-0070-I-2, slip op. at 5-6 (M.S.P.B. July 9, 1998) (involuntary resignation claim); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, No. SF-0353-01-0167-I-1, slip op. at 2-3 (M.S.P.B. Apr. 23, 2001) (job restoration claim). These determinations are entitled to preclusive effect under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. "Under collateral estoppel, once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that <span id="Page_1525"></span>decision may preclude relitigation of the issue in a suit on a different cause of action involving a party to the first case." <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 449 U.S. at 94. Although the Board used the term "<span class="Italic">res judicata</span>" in characterizing its dismissal of Jackson's involuntary resignation and job restoration claims, rather than employing the more precise term "collateral estoppel," the Board's dismissal was nonetheless made on the correct ground. The term "<span class="Italic">res judicata</span>" is often generically used to encompass both issue preclusion (or collateral estoppel) and claim preclusion. <span class="Italic">Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ.</span>, 465 U.S. 75, 77 n.1, 104 S. Ct. 892, 79 L. Ed.2d 56 (1984) (noting that in its generic sense, "<span class="Italic">res judicata</span>" is a broad term that encompasses both issue preclusion, sometimes referred to as collateral estoppel, and claim preclusion, sometimes referred to as <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>). The Board properly applied the doctrine of issue preclusion, recognizing that this doctrine precludes Jackson's attempted relitigation of these claims following the Board's prior decisions on the underlying issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dooley v. VA</span>, 306 Fed. Appx. 594, 596 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), strongly implied that if the Board lacks jurisdiction over an appeal, it may not dismiss a subsequent appeal through <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding this error by the Board, the DVA asks this court to affirm the Board's dismissal. The DVA correctly points out that the Board not only would have lacked jurisdiction over Dooley's First Amendment claim if he had brought it in his earlier appeals, but likewise lacked jurisdiction over Dooley's First Amendment claim in this case. Because Dooley's employment was temporary, he was not an "employee" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a). The Board therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear any appeal concerning Dooley's termination, other than an IRA whistleblower claim. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 12 F.3d 1069, 1070-72 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (holding that Board lacks jurisdiction over appeals by temporary employees challenging termination). Both in the initial case and in this case, the Board lacked jurisdiction to render <span class="Italic">any</span> judgment on Dooley's First Amendment claim--including a judgment dismissing that claim on <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> grounds. "If it lacks jurisdiction, the Board is without authority to decide the issues presented by a petitioner. The [Board] has only the jurisdiction conferred on it by Congress. This jurisdiction, provided by statute, creates the power of the [Board] to hear and decide a case, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the Board's subject matter jurisdiction. Without jurisdiction, the Board's decision on the merits of a petition is a nullity." <span class="Italic">Schmittling v. Dep't of Army</span>, 219 F.3d 1332, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We decline to affirm a judgment that the Board lacked jurisdiction to enter, and instead we vacate the Board's judgment so that the Board can dismiss Dooley's petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 486 F.3d 1276, 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (vacating and remanding with instructions to dismiss claim when Board acted without subject matter jurisdiction). We therefore <span class="Italic">vacate</span> and <span class="Italic">remand</span> with instructions that the Board dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If, however, there was a prior jurisdictional decision, that decision is <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> as to a case involving that same jurisdictional issue--or at least that is what the Board appeared to suggest in <span class="Italic">Caple v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 262, 265-66 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> provides that matters that were settled in a prior appeal in which there has been a final decision are precluded from being brought before the Board in a subsequent appeal. <span class="Italic">West v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 44 MSPR 551, 561 (1990); <span class="Italic">Van Sant v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 39 MSPR 408, 412, <span class="Italic">review</span> <span class="Italic">dismissed,</span> 889 F.2d 1099 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table). The appellant argues that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> cannot apply in this case because there has never been a final decision on the merits of his reprisal claim. We disagree. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that the principle of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> applies to questions of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Underwriters National Assurance v. North Carolina Life and</span> <span class="Italic">Accident and Health Insurance Guaranty Association,</span> 455 U.S. 691, 706, 102 S.C. 1357, 1366, 71 L. Ed.2d 558 (1982); <span class="Italic">Durfee v. Duke</span>, 375 U.S. 106, 111, 84 S.C. 242, 244, 11 L. Ed.2d 186 (1963); <span class="Italic">American Surety v. Baldwin,</span> 287 U.S. 156, 166, 53 S.C. 98, 101, 77 LED. 231 (1932).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also applied the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to questions of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Schoening v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 43 MSPR 6 (1989). Because the need for finality of decisions applies with equal force to jurisdictional decisions as it does to decisions on the merits, there is no reason not to apply the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to jurisdictional findings by the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Underwriters National Assurance,</span> 455 U.S. at 706 n.13, 102 S.C. at 1366 n.13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board issued its final decision on the question of whether the agency's action in the fall of 1990 was taken in reprisal for the appellant's prior EEO complaint. MSPB Docket No. DC07529110148 (Initial Decision Feb. 6, 1991), <span class="Italic">petition for review</span> <span class="Italic">denied,</span> 49 MSPR 420 (1991) (Table). The Board found that it was not and that, because of the previous settlement agreement, the appeal was outside the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant now <span class="Italic">seek</span>s to have the Board reexamine that decision. The doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> precludes us from doing so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's decision to process the appellant's claim of reprisal as a non-mixed case does not alter this finding. Regardless of how the claim is processed, the Board has issued its final decision on the appellant's allegation of reprisal, and we will not reexamine the matter. Although the agency's labor relations manager stated in a letter to the appellant's representative that the agency's decision should render the appeal before the Board moot, the Board must independently determine the decision's effect. Here we find that the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> barred the Board from hearing the appellant's appeal, and, thus, the appeal was properly dismissed as outside the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Batiste v. USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 369, 373-74 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13 (2005), applied <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel to prevent litigation of a jurisdictional issue that was actually litigated in an earlier appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Where a first action was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, as it was here, the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> will not normally preclude the appellant from bringing the same action again. A second action in the same forum, however, might be barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, which precludes relitigation of the same jurisdictional issue<span class="Italic">. Peartree</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 338; <span class="Italic">see also Tanner v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 10 (2003). When he amended his petition for appeal, it appears that the appellant was indeed <span class="Italic">seek</span>ing to relitigate the jurisdictional issue. We thus examine whether collateral estoppel applies here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Collateral estoppel is appropriate when (1) an issue is identical to that involved in the prior action, (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action, (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment, and (4) the party to be precluded was fully represented in the prior action. <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The issue of constructive suspension meets this definition. First, the issue here is identical to the one involved in the prior action. In the earlier appeal, the appellant had asked the Board to deem the entire period between January 2003 and August 2004 to be a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Batiste I</span> at 2. In the instant appeal, the appellant sought below to raise constructive suspension as one of several reasons for the Board to recognize jurisdiction over his restoration appeal. On PFR, however, his focus shifts, and now he is simply arguing that the Board should deem his period of voluntary unemployment between January 22 and March 19, 2003, to be a constructive suspension. The time periods for the alleged constructive suspension fully overlap in the two claims. In our view, the appellant has presented in his PFR "the same set of events or documents and the same 'bundle of legal principles' that contributed to the rendering of the first judgment," <span class="Italic">Tanner</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 11, and thus, the issue is identical.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the jurisdictional issue was actually litigated in the earlier appeal. The appellant requested a jurisdictional hearing, which was held, and the AJ rendered a decision. <span class="Italic">Batiste I</span>; <span class="Italic">see Fisher v. Department of Defense</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 509, 514 (1994) (the "actually litigated" criterion requires that the issue be contested by the parties and resolved by an adjudicator). Third, the Board's determination that it lacked jurisdiction in the earlier appeal was its sole justification for dismissing the first appeal, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, it was necessary to the final judgment. <span class="Italic">Batiste I</span>. Fourth, the appellant, though <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, was fully represented in the earlier appeal. <span class="Italic">See Noble v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 693, &#x00B6; 9 (2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Fisher</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 515) ("a party's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status does not preclude the application of collateral estoppel; the 'fully represented' requirement is satisfied when the party to whom collateral estoppel is applied has had a full and fair chance to litigate the issue in question"). For these reasons, the Board finds that the appellant's claim of constructive suspension is barred by collateral estoppel....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit declined to become involved in formal distinctions between "merits" and "jurisdictional" adjudications when <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> was raised as a bar to an IRA case, essentially holding in <span class="Italic">Vanderford v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3278), that a "jurisdictional" dismissal that is based on factual determinations is really a "merits" determination that precludes relitigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case has been here before. Mr. Vanderford previously brought an individual right of action appeal to the Board, arguing that his ten-day suspension was an illegal reprisal for an alleged protected disclosure. In response, the Board held that Mr. Vanderford did not have a reasonable belief that his disclosure was protected, <span class="Italic">see Vanderford v. Department of the Navy</span>, No. SF-1221-95-0758-W-1 (Sept. 18, 1995), and dismissed his appeal. Mr. Vanderford petitioned for review in this court. We affirmed the Board's dismissal. <span class="Italic">See Vanderford v. Department of the Navy</span>, 86 F.3d 1178, 1996 WL 252838 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Vanderford thereafter filed another complaint with the Office of Special Counsel, arguing that his ten-day suspension was an unlawful reprisal for the disclosures previously held not to be protected. Not surprisingly, the Office of Special Counsel closed that complaint on May 5, 1997, stating that Mr. Vanderford's complaint had already been adjudicated by the Board and this court. Mr. Vanderford again repaired to the Board, duplicating his previous appeal. The agency moved to dismiss the second appeal to the Board on the ground of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> because the parties and issues were the same as in the previously decided case. The Board granted the agency's motion, and Mr. Vanderford returned to this court with his petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1526"></span><span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> prevents a party from litigating again against a same party issues that previously were or could have been litigated in a proceeding that has come to final judgment. <span class="Italic">See Federated Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Moitie</span>, 452 U.S. 394, 398 (1981). The doctrine applies to administrative decisions, <span class="Italic">see Astoria Fed. Say. &#x0026; Loan Ass'n v.</span> <span class="Italic">Solimino</span>, 501 U.S. 104, 107-08 (1990), and the Board enforces the doctrine in its decisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Peartree v. United States Postal</span> Service, 66 MSPR 332, 337 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the fact that this appeal raises precisely the same issues as previously adjudicated finally against Mr. Vanderford, Mr. Vanderford argues that the Board has the authority to reopen his first appeal of the ten-day suspension, and that the Board abused its authority in this case by refusing to reopen the first case and by dismissing the second case on <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> grounds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered and reject Mr. Vanderford's arguments that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> does not bar his second appeal to the Board from his ten-day suspension. We note that in Mr. Vanderford's first appeal to the Board, the Board stated that it dismissed Mr. Vanderford's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. However, the Board reached its decision by determining that Mr. Vanderford had made no protected disclosures and as such the Board's first decision was a determination upon the merits, rather than a jurisdictional ruling. <span class="Italic">See Barton v. Department of Justice</span>, 985 F.2d 547, 548-49 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In any event, "dismissals for lack of jurisdiction may be given <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect as to the jurisdictional issue." <span class="Italic">Amgen Inc. v. United States International Trade</span> <span class="Italic">Comm'n</span>, 902 F.2d 1532, 1536 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Thus, whether the Board's first decision is characterized as on the merits or jurisdictional, the result is the same. The Board's decision to dismiss Mr. Vanderford's petition for review is correct.<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cobb v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 187, 188 (1985) (unappealed finding of a district court that the Board had jurisdiction over an appeal from improper restoration to duty following military service was <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and immune from collateral attack during further Board consideration of the case). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Tisdale v.
