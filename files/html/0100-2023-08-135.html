<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-134"><span class="space">5.</span> Jurisdictional Effect of Lapse of Term or Temporary Appointment</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 752.401(b) (2022) excludes from adverse action procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(11)&#x2003;Termination of appointment on the expiration date specified as a basic condition of employment at the time the appointment was made;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(12)&#x2003;Action that terminates a temporary or term promotion and returns the employee to the position from which temporarily promoted, or to a different position of equivalent grade and pay, if the agency informed the employee that it was to be of limited duration[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the regulation, the Board lacks adverse action jurisdiction when employment ends by lapse of a term appointment. <span class="Italic">Kenney v. MSPB</span>, 356 Fed. Appx. 394 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP). Jurisdictional difficulties are not ordinarily encountered when a term appointment simply lapses. The jurisdictional and due process issues arise when the employee is terminated before expiration of the term appointment. The question of whether temporary appointees secure Board appeal rights is complicated, depending in part on whether the appointees are in the competitive or excepted service and whether or not they are preference eligibles. The significance of a proper determination of the employee's status and tenure, for purposes of Board appeal rights, is apparent once it is understood that a termination will be set aside if the term employee is entitled to, but does not receive, notice of charges and an opportunity to respond to those charges before the employee's adverse separation prior to the expiration date of the term appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. VA</span>, 86 MSPR 519, 523 &#x00B6; 7 (2000). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-051.html#sec1-52">Current Continuous Service</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smith v. DHS</span>, DC-0752-13-2302-I-1 (NP 2/25/2014), determined that there was no jurisdiction over the appellant's separation at the conclusion of her term appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument that she was terminated for misconduct, not due to the expiration of her employment term, is immaterial. The Board has held that an agency may consider a term employee's work performance in determining whether to reappoint her without creating Board jurisdiction, provided that her employment does not end before its specified term. <span class="Italic">See Scott</span>, 113 M.S.P.R.434, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Shelton v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 303, 306-08 (1988). There is no basis to treat employee conduct differently than performance. Similarly, the appellant's assertions of reprisal for filing a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement, harassment, and unlawful discrimination do not establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Penna v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 355, &#x00B6; 13 (2012) (a claim of unlawful discrimination is not a basis for a finding of Board jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Wren v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (prohibited personnel practices under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) are not an independent source of Board jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, regarding the appellant's claim of reprisal for whistleblowing, we note that the appellant did not raise this claim below and thus we need not consider it now. <span class="Italic">See Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980) (the Board generally will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence). In any event, although an allegation of reprisal for whistleblowing may constitute an independent cause of action before the Board, the Board has jurisdiction over such an allegation only if the employee has exhausted her administrative remedies before the Office of Special Counsel (OSC)--and there is no evidence here suggesting that the appellant has exhausted her remedies before OSC. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3); <span class="Italic">Cassidy v. Department of Justice</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 74, &#x00B6; 5 (2012).</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Scott v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 113 MSPR 434, 437-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10, 2010 MSPB 58 (2010), summarized the law concerning termination of an appellant's employment at the end of a three-year overseas term appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The undisputed evidence shows as follows: Effective April 3, 2006, the appellant was appointed to the position of Historian at the Yokota Air Base in Japan. Prior to his appointment, he had signed a Department of Defense (DOD) Transportation Agreement, Transfer of Civilian Employees Outside CONUS [Continental United States] . The agreement stated, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that it was an initial agreement; that the appellant was a new appointee; that his "prescribed tour of duty" was 36 months; and that, when he had completed his prescribed tour of duty, he would be eligible for return travel and transportation allowances to his actual residence at the time of his appointment "for purpose of separation from the service." He also signed a document, entitled "Overseas Employment Agreement (<span class="Italic">Without Return Rights</span>)," in which he acknowledged that his initial period of Foreign Service was limited to the prescribed tour of duty for the area to which he was assigned and that any extension beyond that period was subject to both his and management's approval. He agreed as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When notified that my foreign service will not be extended beyond that initial or subsequent tour of duty, or when advised that my return is required because of the DOD rotation program, I agree to return to the United States. I understand that I will need to register for return placement to Continental United States (CONUS) on the Priority Placement Program (PPP), until I am offered or decline a valid, continuing position. I understand that if I do not receive a valid offer within 90 days of PPP registration, the registration must be amended to include one grade interval below my current grade. Otherwise I may resign or be separated from the Air Force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He further agreed that he did "not have return rights back to a position in the United States[,] " and that to continue employment in the civil service, he could apply for positions after his tour expired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 23, 2009, Colonel Dan Rogers issued the appellant a Notice of Proposed Separation based on the expiration of his 3-year overseas tour of duty and his ineligibility to register in the DOD PPP due to an overall Level 1 performance rating. On March 17, 2009, Brigadier General Salvatore Angelella upheld the decision to remove the appellant. As previously noted, the appellant's separation was effective April 2, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the evidence establishes that the appellant received a term appointment. Admittedly, the Standard Form (SF) 50 documenting the appellant's appointment stated that he received a career-conditional appointment in the competitive service, and the Office of Personnel Management's regulations differentiate between such appointments and term appointments, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.201(a). An SF-50, however, is not a legally operative document controlling on its face an employee's status and rights. <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. U.S. Department of Commerce,</span> 729 F.2d 772, 776 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Although the issuance of an executed SF-50 is the customary documentation for a federal personnel action, it does not constitute the personnel action itself. <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of the Navy,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 282, 287 (1981). Rather, the Board looks at the totality of the circumstances in determining the nature of the appointment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Scott,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. at 287 (looking at the totality of the circumstances in determining whether an appointment has been effected). Here, despite any indication in the SF-50, the appellant's specific employment agreements, as described above, showed that he was appointed to a 3-year term and that he was separated at the expiration of that term.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The expiration of a term appointment is not an action appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Williams v. Department of the Army,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 2 (2008); <span class="Italic">Endermuhle v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 495, &#x00B6; 9 (2001); <span class="Italic">Law v. Department of the Navy,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 474, 476 (1998); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(11). That the appellant met the definition of "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) and had completed his probationary period is irrelevant to that determination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Endermuhle,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 495, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7. Further, that the agency considered the appellant's performance in deciding not to reappoint him fails to establish jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Shelton v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. 303, 306 (1988). Moreover, the agency's admitted error in notifying the appellant of a right of Board appeal, does not serve to confer jurisdiction on the Board, <span class="Italic">see Miles-Townsend v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 405, 407 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the agency's failure to place the appellant in the PPP is not an adverse action appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hill v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 309 Fed. Appx. 413, 416 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of the Navy,</span> 3 M.S.P.R. 295, 298 (1980); <span class="Italic">cf. Sturdy v. Department of the Army,</span> 440 F.3d 1328, 1335-36 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (the Board has jurisdiction over a reemployment priority rights claim asserted by an individual who registered for a reemployment priority list or an Office of Personnel Management-approved PPP during a reduction-in-force). Absent an appealable action, the Board also lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant's affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Law,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. at 477; <span class="Italic">Wren v. Department of the Army,</span> 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Characterization of expiration of a term appointment, one in a series of teaching appointments, as a performance-based removal did not vest jurisdiction in the Board, <span class="Italic">Colburn v. Dept. of Army,</span> SF-3443-14-0446-I-1 (NP 6/4/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant next argues that the termination of his appointment was actually a performance-based removal, over which the Board has jurisdiction, and that the agency has "deliberately mischaracterized" the action as a nonrenewal of his appointment in order to avoid its obligations under Title V. The Board has explained, however, that the fact that an agency considers an employee's performance in deciding not to reappoint him fails to establish jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 9 (citing <span class="Italic">Shelton v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 303, 306 (1988)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, the appellant argues that the agency is abusing its authority under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3101, which allows agencies to make excepted service appointments under certain circumstances, by "subjecting its employees to an endless cycle of time-limited appointments, while also asserting a blanket right not to renew those employees for any reason whatsoever, including for performance." The appellant did not raise this argument below, however, and has provided no reason why we should consider it for the first time on review. <span class="Italic">See Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980) (stating that the Board generally will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence). Moreover, even if the appellant's allegation were true, he has failed to point to any authority that would vest the Board with jurisdiction to consider this claim in the absence of an otherwise appealable action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Law v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 77 MSPR 474, 476-77 (1998), considered the appeal by a term employee who sought to litigate a restoration claim involving a term appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge correctly determined that the Board does not have jurisdiction over the appellant's March 29, 1997 separation under 5 USC Chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512; <span class="Italic">Youngs v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 MSPR 551, 560 (1997) (the separation of a term appointee at the expiration of the term specified at the time of appointment is not an appealable adverse action). In addition, the administrative judge correctly found that the Board does not have jurisdiction over the appellant's claim that the agency failed to restore her following her partial recovery from a compensable injury. An employee who was "separated or furloughed from an appointment without time limitation, or from a temporary appointment pending establishment of a register (TAPER) as a result of a compensable injury" may have restoration rights under 5 CFR Part 353. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.103(b). The record evidence, however, shows that the appellant was separated from an appointment <span class="Italic">with</span> a time limitation and there is no evidence that her appointment to that position was a TAPER. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction over the appellant's restoration claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(12).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer to <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec14-1">Chapter 14</a> concerning restoration rights of employees who are out of work as a result of compensable injuries.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee holds a permanent appointment with sufficient service credit to secure an appeal right and is then converted to and terminated from an NTE position, it is possible that the employee has an appeal right upon the expiration of the NTE position and simultaneous separation from federal service resulting from the expiration of that appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Berryman v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 558, 563-64 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16, 2010 MSPB 243 (2010) (remanding for further development of the record on a complex set of facts involving efforts to correct an erroneous appointment following by other appointments), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Berryman v.
