<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-144"><span class="space">6.</span> Restriction</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SEIU Local 150 and VAMC, Milwaukee</span>, 35 FLRA 521, 525-26 (1990), denied the
negotiability of Provision 2, requiring that employees receive
counseling, and show no improvement, before being placed on sick
leave restriction. The provision was inconsistent with management's right to take disciplinary action. Nothing precluded the negotiation of a provision that allowed, rather than required, management to issue a written warning to an employee before imposing leave restriction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and PTO</span>, 53 FLRA 539, 587-89 (1997) (Article 18). As to leave restriction, in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Pub. Debt and NTEU Chap. 199</span>, 37 FLRA 841, 847 (1990), reviewing an arbitration award, FLRA held management to its agreement, negotiated as an appropriate arrangement, not to require, in addition to a medical certificate, a medical diagnosis of an employee's condition as a prerequisite to granting sick leave. The contract clause that was implicitly upheld required that leave restriction letters include a notice to the employee that all subsequent sick leave absences must be supported by a medical certificate stating the period of medical care and certifying that, during the absence, the employee's condition was such that the doctor or practitioner considered the employee incapacitated for work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1156 and Dept. of Navy, Navy Ships Parts Control Ctr., Mechanicsburg, Pa.</span>, 42 FLRA 1157, 1157-58 (1991), was a proposal designed to require the equivalent of progressive discipline prior to the imposition of leave restriction:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where there is reason to believe the employee is abusing sick leave, the Employer shall caution the employee, in writing, that he/she has a questionable sick leave record and why the employee is suspected of abusing or using excessive sick leave and the improvement level desired. He/she shall also be advised that if his record does not improve, a medical certificate will be required for each future absence due to illness until the employee's leave record improves to the specified level or the employee shows that the leave is not excessive sick leave. If this does not improve his leave record, the employee shall be notified in writing, that all future requests for leave for medical purposes must be supported by a medical certificate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1156,</span> the proposal infringed management rights and was not appropriate arrangement, 42 FLRA at 1160-64:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision would require the Agency to take several actions prior to requiring an employee suspected of abusing or using excessive sick leave to provide a supporting medical certificate for a sick leave request or placing the employee on sick leave restriction.&#x2003;The first sentence of the provision would require the Agency to give an employee "suspected of abusing or using excessive sick leave" a written warning providing the employee with the following information: (1) the fact that the Agency believes the employee has a "questionable" sick leave record; (2) the Agency's reasons for suspecting sick leave misuse or abuse; and (3) the level of improvement that the Agency determines is necessary to remove its suspicion. The second sentence of the provision would require the Agency to inform an employee that the failure to improve his or her sick leave record will result in a requirement that all future requests for sick leave be supported by medical certification. The final sentence of the provision requires the Agency to give the employee written notice that he or she is required to support all future sick leave requests with medical certification.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, in situations where the Agency has reason to believe that an employee is misusing or abusing sick leave, the provision requires the Agency to first provide the employee with written notice that a medical certificate may be required for each subsequent absence due to sick leave and, second, to provide the employee with an opportunity to improve. If no improvement is noted, the provision requires the Agency to give the employee written notice that all future requests for sick leave must be supported by a medical certificate. The effect of the provision is to require the Agency to provide written notice to an employee suspected of sick leave abuse before the Agency may put the employee on sick leave restriction and require the employee to provide supporting medical certificates for all sick leave requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_714"></span>Because the use of leave restrictions is, in practical terms, a precondition of an agency's decision to discipline employees for suspected misuse or abuse of sick leave, provisions or proposals that preclude an agency from imposing sick leave restrictions directly interfere with management's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the provision in this case, management could not require a medical certificate for suspected misuse or abuse of sick leave unless an employee had been given written notice and an opportunity to comply with the Agency's stated level of improvement, regardless of the circumstances prompting the notice. In other words, for the incidents giving rise to a suspicion of sick leave abuse, the provision prevents the Agency from taking any action other than written warnings and substitutes these warnings for whatever form of sick leave restriction the Agency may want to impose. Under the provision, management would not be able to place an employee in a restricted leave category based on the incidents of suspected sick leave misuse or abuse. Because sick leave restriction is, as a practical matter, a precondition of management's decision to impose discipline on an employee for misuse or abuse of sick leave, the provision would effectively preclude management from responding to the employee's improper use of sick leave through discipline.... We conclude, therefore,...that the provision directly interferes with management's right to discipline....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the provision directly interferes with management's right to discipline, we note the Union's contention that the provision does not interfere with this management right because the issuance of the "Letter of Requirement" required by the provision does not constitute disciplinary action under the parties' agreement. We reject this contention. Regardless of whether the parties' agreement provides that a letter of requirement is not a disciplinary action, the provision's requirement that the Agency issue written notice prior to placing employees on sick leave restriction places a substantive precondition on the Agency's ability to impose sick leave restriction and, therefore, directly interferes with management's right to discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having determined that the provision directly interferes with management's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, we next address the Union's contention that the provision is nevertheless negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. To determine whether a provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement, we must decide whether a provision is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right, and whether the provision is appropriate or inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the provision constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by management's right to discipline employees because it would protect employees who management believes are misusing or abusing sick leave from being required to support their sick leave requests with medical certificates or being placed on sick leave restriction without first receiving written caution and an opportunity to remove management's suspicion that sick leave is being misused or abused.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that the provision in dispute constitutes an arrangement, we now consider whether it is an appropriate arrangement. To determine whether the proposed arrangement contemplated by the provision proposed is appropriate within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3), as asserted by the Union, we must examine whether the negative impact on management's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) outweighs the benefits conferred by the provision on employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that the provision will benefit employees, in instances where excessive sick leave usage or abuse is suspected but not proven, by requiring management to caution employees before requiring them to support a request for sick leave with a medical certificate. The Agency asserts that this benefit would have a "substantial impact" on the right of the Agency to require evidence to support requests for sick leave because the provision "conditions the employer's right to require the employee to furnish a medical certificate in support of any absence that is to be charged as sick leave."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the provision relieves employees of the need to support sick leave requests with medical certificates for the initial incidents of suspected sick leave misuse or abuse, the provision would preclude the Agency from placing employees on sick leave restriction based upon those incidents. Because the provision would preclude management from imposing sick leave restriction for the initial incidents of suspected sick leave abuse, it would effectively preclude management from disciplining employees in those instances.... By thus precluding management from disciplining employees in those instances, we find that the burden imposed by the provision on management's right to discipline outweighs the benefit to employees derived from the provision. On balance, therefore, we conclude that the provision excessively interferes with management's right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. Accordingly, we find that the provision does not constitute a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">For a similar result as to a proposal that "[i]f after oral counseling and the letter of warning the problem has not been corrected, the employee may be placed on leave restriction," refer to <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 858 and USDA, FDIC, Kansas City</span>, 42 FLRA 1169, 1170 (1991). Under an abrogation standard of review applied to an agency's head disapproval of a negotiated provision, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Pub. Debt</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-109.html">65 FLRA 509</a><span class="Italic">,</span> 515-17 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting), approved the negotiability of Article 22, Section 3B, requiring counseling, but precluding the use of a leave restriction notice, for an initial concern that an employee is abusing emergency annual leave. The abrogation standard for agency head review of contract provisions was set aside in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 739 F.3d 13 (D.C. Cir. 2014), discussed in Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-12-027.html#sec4-28">Management Rights Objection; Excessive Interference</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable as an appropriate arrangement was Article 10, Section 4(A) in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 66 FLRA 809, 810 (2012) (Member Beck dissenting) (recon. den., 66 FLRA 1030 (2012) (vacated, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 739 F.3d 13 (D.C. Cir. 2014)), challenged by the agency head and assessed, based on the level of the challenge, under an abrogation standard. The provision was, 66 FLRA at 810:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Office has reasonable grounds to question whether an employee is properly using sick leave including annual leave in lieu of sick leave (for example, when sick leave is used frequently or in unusual patterns or circumstances), the Office may inquire further into the matter and ask the employee to explain. Absent a reasonably acceptable explanation, the Office will counsel the employee that continued frequent use of sick leave, or use in unusual patterns or circumstances, may result in a written requirement to furnish administratively acceptable evidence for each subsequent absence due to illness or incapacitation regardless of duration.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Chief Counsel</span> explained, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, at 812-13:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The provision affects management's right to discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that "management's right to discipline includes placing an employee in a restricted leave use category." <span class="Italic">E.g., NTEU, </span>65 FLRA at 516 (quoting <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 405</span>, 42 FLRA 1112, 1131 (1991)). Thus, the Authority has held that provisions or proposals that preclude management from imposing a leave restriction in response to a first offense of leave abuse affect management's right to discipline employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 516-17 (citing <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R5-82, </span>43 FLRA 25, 28 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Local R5-82</span>);<span class="Italic"> Local 858, </span>42 FLRA at 1172; <span class="Italic">Local 1156, </span>42 FLRA at 1162).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the provision would preclude the Agency from requiring an employee to furnish administratively acceptable evidence for any absence due to illness or incapacitation until after the Agency has counseled the employee on suspected leave abuse. Thus, management would not be able to require an employee to justify all future sick-leave requests based on the incident that causes management for the first time to question the employee's use of sick leave. The Authority has repeatedly held that similar provisions affect management's right to discipline under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Local R5-82, </span>43 FLRA at 28;<span class="Italic"> Local 858, </span>42 FLRA at 1172; <span class="Italic">Local 1156, </span>42 FLRA at 1162).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the provision does not affect management's right to discipline because imposing a requirement that an employee justify all sick-leave requests does not equate to discipline under the CBA. But the Authority considered and rejected substantively identical arguments in <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>65 FLRA at 517, and <span class="Italic">Local 1156</span>, 42 FLRA at 1162, and the Union provides no basis for reaching a different conclusion here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the provision affects management's right to discipline employees.<span class="Italic"> See NTEU, </span>65 FLRA at 517.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The provision is an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> the Authority modified the standard it uses in negotiability cases for determining whether an agreed-upon, contract provision is an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 511-15. Under the Authority's revised framework, the Authority assesses: (1) whether the provision constitutes a sufficiently tailored arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right; and (2) if so, then whether the contract provision "abrogates"--i.e., waives--the affected management right. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 517. In determining whether a contract provision abrogates a management right, the Authority assesses whether the provision "precludes [the] agency from exercising" the affected management right. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 515 (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. DOT, FAA, </span>65 FLRA 171, 174 (2010)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying that framework here, the Agency does not dispute the Union's assertion that the provision is an arrangement. When an agency does not dispute that a provision is an arrangement, the Authority will find that the agency concedes that the provision is an arrangement. <span class="Italic">E.g., NATCA, </span><span id="page_715"></span>66 FLRA 213, 216 (2011) (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(c)(2)). Consistent with this precedent, we find that the provision is an arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to whether the arrangement is appropriate, the provision precludes the Agency from requiring an employee to furnish administratively acceptable evidence for any absence due to illness or incapacitation until after the Agency has counseled the employee on suspected leave abuse. But the provision does not preclude management from disciplining employees, even for a first instance of suspected sick-leave abuse, by means other than leave restriction. Thus, the provision merely limits the circumstances in which management may exercise its right to discipline; it does not preclude the Agency from exercising that right. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, </span>65 FLRA at 517.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">Local 858</span> and <span class="Italic">Local 1156 </span>is misplaced. In both cases, the Authority applied an excessive-interference standard, rather than an abrogation standard, in concluding that the provisions were not appropriate arrangements. <span class="Italic">Local 858</span>, 42 FLRA at 1172-73; <span class="Italic">Local 1156, </span>42 FLRA at 1162-64. The Agency also cites <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>. But in that decision, the Authority found that the cited proposals were appropriate arrangements, and the Agency fails to explain how this precedent supports its position that this provision is not an appropriate arrangement.<span class="Italic"> See Commerce,</span> 53 FLRA at 557-59.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the provision does not abrogate management's right to discipline employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, and that the provision is an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Accordingly, we find that the provision is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, and we direct the Agency to rescind its disapproval of the provision.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 739 F.3d 13, 13-21 (D.C. Cir. 2014), vacating <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span>, is discussed in Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-12-027.html#sec4-28">Management Rights Objection; Excessive Interference</a>." Following the D.C. Circuit decision, the controversy returned to FLRA and once again the provision was determined to be negotiable, FLRA upholding it under the excessive interference standard in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 67 FLRA 705, 706-08 (2014) (Member Pizzella dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> did not disturb the Authority's findings that: (1) the provision permits management to respond to a first offense of sick-leave abuse with any form of discipline other than the issuance of a sick-leave restriction; (2) the provision affects management's right to discipline employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute; and (3) the provision is an arrangement. Accordingly, the sole issue before us is whether the arrangement is "appropriate" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We adopt the court's opinion in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> as the law of the case.[34] Accordingly, we apply the "excessive[-]interference" test.[35] Under that test, the Authority assesses whether an arrangement is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the affected management right.[36]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[34] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Wash., D.C.,</span> 67 FLRA 69, 70 (2012) (adopting the court's decision, on remand, as "the law of the case"); Nat'l Weather Serv. Emps. Org., 64 FLRA 569, 571 (2010) (Member Beck dissenting) (same).</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[36] <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1770</span>, 64 FLRA 953, 959 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether an arrangement excessively interferes with the affected management right, the Authority weighs the benefits that the arrangement provides to employees against the burdens that the arrangement imposes on the exercise of management's rights.[37] Here, the provision would benefit employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right because management would be required to warn an employee suspected of leave abuse that a failure to correct his or her behavior could result in leave restriction before actually placing the employee on sick-leave restriction. Thus, the provision would protect employees suspected of abusing sick leave from being required to support future leave requests with documentation without first receiving counseling and the opportunity to correct problematic leave usage.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[37] <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 31-33 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the provision's intrusion on management's right to discipline, the Agency argues that the provision "dictates a course of action, substitutes non-disciplinary action for a disciplinary action[,] and precludes management from taking disciplinary action for the conduct that gave rise to the inquiry in the first place." However, the Agency overstates the provision's burden on the exercise of management rights. In this regard, the provision would entitle an employee to only a single counseling session before the Agency may impose leave restriction. And nothing in the provision prevents the Agency from providing this counseling session while simultaneously pursuing another form of discipline. This is because, as stated previously, under the provision, the Agency could respond to a first offense of leave abuse with any form of discipline other than the issuance of a leave-restriction notice. Thus, the Agency's argument is based on a misinterpretation of the meaning of the provision, and does not provide a basis for finding the provision contrary to law. As noted above, the court in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> did not disturb the Authority's interpretation of the meaning of the provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 858 (Local 858)</span>[40] and <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1156 (Local 1156)</span>[41] in support of its argument that the provision is contrary to law. In <span class="Italic">Local 1156</span>, the provision at issue would require the Agency to counsel an employee about suspected sick-leave abuse before placing the employee on sick-leave restriction.[43] In <span class="Italic">Local 858</span>, the provision at issue would require the Agency to first counsel, and then provide written warning, before placing an employee on leave restriction.[44] The Authority held that both provisions excessively interfered with management's right to discipline employees.[45] However, there is a crucial distinction between those provisions and the one now before us. Specifically, the Authority interpreted the provisions in both <span class="Italic">Local 858</span> and <span class="Italic">Local 1156</span> as precluding management from taking any disciplinary action in response to a first instance of leave abuse.[46] That is because the unions in <span class="Italic">Local 858</span> and <span class="Italic">Local 1156</span> did not assert that the provisions would preserve management's right to discipline first instances of leave abuse using disciplinary methods other than leave restriction.[47] By contrast, here, as discussed above, the provision would preserve the Agency's right to employ any and every disciplinary measure other than leave restriction in response to an employee's first instance of leave abuse. Thus, <span class="Italic">Local 858</span> and <span class="Italic">Local 1156</span> are distinguishable. In this regard, we note that the Authority bases its negotiability determinations only on the arguments presented by the parties.[48] And we note also that our interpretation of the meaning of this provision would apply in future disputes--including arbitration--unless modified by the parties through subsequent agreement.[49]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The dissent relies on several of the decisions (addressed above) that the Agency cites.[55] And the dissent's reliance is misplaced for the same reasons as the Agency's. In addition, the dissent cites two dissenting opinions.[56] But, <span class="Italic">by definition</span>, dissenting opinions are not Authority precedent.[57] Additionally, the dissent cites <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-82 (NAGE)</span>,[58] where the union "[did] not argue that [the provision at issue was] intended to be an appropriate arrangement," and the Authority found the "record...insufficient" to--and thus did not--"make a determination on that matter."[59] So <span class="Italic">NAGE</span> has no relevance whatsoever to the issue now before us: whether the provision in this case is an appropriate arrangement. And, finally, the dissent cites <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 2052 (Local 2052)</span>,[60] which addressed a proposal that would "totally prevent[ ] <span id="page_716"></span>the [a]gency from requiring employees to account for their sick[-]leave usage, thereby immunizing them from discipline for failure to account for absence."[61] The differences between the proposal in <span class="Italic">Local 2052</span> and the provision now before us are stark. Specifically, the provision in this case has no effect on management's right to require employees to account for their sick-leave usage, and it neither "totally prevents" the Agency from doing anything, nor "immunize[s]" employees from discipline.[62] Rather, as discussed above, it prohibits the Agency from taking one specific type of disciplinary measure--imposing a sick-leave restriction--in one and only one circumstance: in response to a <span class="Italic">first</span> instance of suspected sick-leave abuse. With that one exception, the Agency's complete arsenal of disciplinary (and, for that matter, investigatory) weapons remains intact. For example, management could issue a written reprimand to an employee for a first instance of suspected sick-leave abuse, while counseling the employee that the next instance will result in a sick-leave restriction (alone or in combination with any other form of discipline).
