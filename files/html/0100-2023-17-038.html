<h2 class="h2" id="sec9-39"><span class="space">V.</span> AWARDS INVOLVING ADVERSE ACTIONS AND PERFORMANCE ACTIONS UNREVIEWABLE BY FLRA: 5 USC 7122, 5 USC 7121(F)</h2>
<p class="noindent">The statutory scheme permits employees to elect between grievance arbitration, when available, and the MSPB, when available, to review adverse actions and performance-based action, but the statute treats the resultant awards in the same manner as MSPB decisions for purposes of further review: jurisdiction to review the award is placed in the Federal Circuit. There are variations on the review scheme when the employee raises allegations of discrimination as to an adverse action or performance-based action that is pursued through arbitration. MSPB and EEOC and federal district courts may then have a review role, but FLRA is still excluded from the review process. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-031.html#sec9-32">Adverse Actions; Performance Actions; 5 USC 7121(e)</a>," and to "<a href="0100-2023-17-021.html#sec9-22">Statutory Elections of Remedies that Preclude Grievance Arbitration</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Although FLRA generally reviews exceptions to arbitration awards, there is a significant exception to its review authority, defined by 5 USC 7122:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Either party to arbitration under this chapter may file with the Authority an exception to any arbitrator's award pursuant to the arbitration (other than an award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f) of this title). If upon review the Authority finds the award is deficient--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;because it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation; or</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;on other grounds similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the Authority may take such action and make such recommendations concerning the award as it considers necessary, consistent with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;If no exception to an arbitrator's award is filed under subsection (a) of this section during the 30-day period beginning on the date the award is served on the party, the award shall be final and binding. An agency shall take the actions required by an arbitrator's final award. The award may include the payment of backpay (as provided in section 5596 of this title).</p>
<p class="noindent">The "matter described in 5 USC 7121(f) of this title" is an adverse action or a performance-based action. 5 USC 7121 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(f)&#x2003;In matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with this section, section 7703 of this title pertaining to judicial review shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the Board. In matters similar to those covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which arise under other personnel systems and which an aggrieved employee has raised under the negotiated grievance procedure, judicial review of an arbitrator's award may be obtained in the same manner and on the same basis as could be obtained of a final decision in such matters raised under applicable appellate procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent">Adverse actions are enumerated by 5 USC 7512:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This subchapter applies to--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;a removal;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;a suspension for more than 14 days;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;a reduction in grade;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(4)&#x2003;a reduction in pay; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(5)&#x2003;a furlough of 30 days or less;</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1740"></span>but does not apply to--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;a suspension or removal under section 7532 of this title,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;a reduction-in-force action under section 3502 of this title,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;the reduction in grade of a supervisor or manager who has not completed the probationary period under section 3321(a)(2) of this title if such reduction is to the grade held immediately before becoming such a supervisor or manager,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(D)&#x2003;a reduction in grade or removal under section 4303 of this title,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(E)&#x2003;an action initiated under section 1215 or 7521 of this title, or</p>

<p class="noindent">Section 7121(f) presents problems of interpretation for FLRA, MSPB, and the Federal Circuit. The first sentence is an attempt to take unacceptable performance and adverse action cases decided by arbitrators and place review in the Federal Circuit (or in a district court, if the action is a "mixed [EEO] case") rather than in FLRA. The second sentence is rather opaque. FLRA construes the section to mean that it lacks review authority over cases similar to actions under 5 USC 4303 and 7512 if those cases arise in agencies having personnel systems intended to operate apart from the personnel system applicable to general federal civil service employees governed by title 5 of the United States Code. That select group includes personnel employed under the Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act and professional employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs hired within the Department of Medicine and Surgery. Temporary employees within the ordinary civil service, FLRA determined, were not in another personnel system within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(f). FLRA has jurisdiction to review exceptions to an award involving a temporary employee under <span class="Italic">SBA and Local 2532 of Nat'l Council of SBA Locals, AFGE</span>, 33 FLRA 28, 32-36 (1988)--presumably assuming the employee does not have sufficient service under 5 USC 7511 to qualify for MSPB appeal rights. [Refer to additional discussion in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-17-046.html#sec9-46">Statutory Appeal Not Available for Certain Employees</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-17-039.html#sec9-40">Adverse Action, Performance Cases</a>," concerning application of &#x00A7; 7121(f).]</p>
<p class="noindent">The effect of &#x00A7; 7121 is to preclude agencies from obtaining effective or, in some cases, any FLRA review of arbitration awards, for example, adverse actions. If an agency cannot obtain review with FLRA, in the typical adverse action case the best it can do is to attempt to persuade OPM to request reconsideration of the award from the arbitrator and for OPM then to seek review of the award in the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7121(f); 5 USC 7703(d). If, however, an arbitrator sets an adverse action or performance-based case aside as discriminatory, the Federal Circuit may lack jurisdiction over the substance of EEO allegations, and an agency may have no statutory authority, with or without the assistance of OPM, to take an award into the Federal Circuit or federal district court, an anomalous situation not yet decided at the Federal Circuit and not likely contemplated by drafters of the Reform Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and POPA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-090.html">61 FLRA 476</a>, 477-79 (2006), summed matters up as it dismissed, for lack of jurisdiction, exceptions filed by the agency to an award finding discrimination against the grievant and setting aside the removal of the grievant for unacceptable performance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to resolve exceptions to an award "relating to" a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute. Matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) include serious adverse actions, such as removals, that are covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303 or &#x00A7; 7512 and are appealable to the MSPB and reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv</span>., 57 FLRA 805, 806 (2002) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The phrase "relating to" in &#x00A7; 7122(a) is not defined in the Statute. The Authority has held that the phrase "relating to" applies both to the matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) as well as other matters that are connected to those matters explicitly set forth. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2986</span>, 51 FLRA 1549, 1553 (1996) (Member Armendariz dissenting as to other matters). Specifically, the Authority has concluded that under &#x00A7; 7122(a), it lacks jurisdiction to resolve exceptions to "the 'pure' section 4303 or 7512 matter[&#8197;]" as well as to exceptions to an award relating to a matter that "is inextricably intertwined with a section 4303 or 7512 matter." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1555.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has stated that by declining jurisdiction over awards relating to the matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) as well as to the matters inextricably intertwined with them, it ensures consistency and uniformity of process and discourages forum shopping, as Congress intended. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 1554.<span class="Italic"> </span>In addition, the Authority noted that the delineation between awards that are reviewable by the Authority, and those that are not, advances the desirable policy objective of avoiding the multiplicity of litigation over one claim that might result if aspects of the same claim were to be reviewed in more than one forum. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has not previously been presented with the argument presented by the Agency here; namely, that the Authority has jurisdiction over exceptions to an award involving a "mixed case" even though it does not have jurisdiction over exceptions to other awards relating to matters that are appealable to the MSPB. For the reasons that follow, we reject this argument and dismiss the Agency's exception for lack of jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7122(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we agree with the Agency that a "mixed case" is not a "'pure' section 4303 or 7512 matter[,]" as the Authority has used that term, so as to constitute a matter specifically referenced in &#x00A7; 7121(f). <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1555. However, as stated above, the Authority has consistently held that it lacks jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7122(a) to resolve exceptions not only to awards relating to "pure" &#x00A7; 4303 or &#x00A7; 7512 matters, but also to awards relating to matters that are "inextricably intertwined with a section 4303 or 7512 matter." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority has found several matters to be inextricably intertwined with a &#x00A7; 4303 or &#x00A7; 7512 matter. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE Local 2004, </span>59 FLRA 572, 573 (2004) (remedial relief in connection with &#x00A7; 7121(f) matters is inextricably intertwined with those matters); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv., </span>57 FLRA 805, 806-07 (2002) (issue of whether the grievant was a probationer was inextricably intertwined with the grievant's removal); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transportation, Fed. Aviation Admin., </span>57 FLRA 580, 581 (2001) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>) (awards enforcing settlement agreements relating to &#x00A7; 7121(f) matters are inextricably intertwined with those matters); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Newington, Conn., </span>53 FLRA 440, 443 (1997) (award relating to a charge of absence without leave was inextricably intertwined with the grievant's removal).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no doubt that the matter in this case--the grievant's removal for unacceptable performance under &#x00A7; 4303 and the grievant's affirmative defense of disability discrimination--is a matter that is inextricably intertwined with the grievant's removal under &#x00A7; 4303.[4] Accordingly, based on the text of &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute and the application of Authority precedent interpreting that statutory provision, the Authority lacks jurisdiction over the Agency's exception to the award in this case. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.3(b)(1) ("The Authority will not consider an exception with respect to an award relating to...[a]n action based on unacceptable performance covered under 5 U.S.C. 4303[.]").[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;In this regard, we note the Agency's description of a mixed case as essentially an adverse action "coupled with" an allegation of discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Agency has not cited any decision, and we are not aware of any, in which the Authority has asserted jurisdiction over exceptions filed to an arbitrator's award in a mixed case. We note that in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, the Authority found that it lacked jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7122(a) to resolve exceptions to a supplemental award that related to a mixed case. <span class="Italic">See FAA, </span>57 FLRA at 581. In <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, the Authority described the dismissal of exceptions to the arbitrator's initial award in an earlier, related decision (<span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., </span>54 FLRA 235 (1998)) so as to make it clear that the initial award also involved a mixed case. The Authority was not presented in those cases with the arguments made by the Agency in the instant case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on the court's decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2052</span> is misplaced. The court's decision addressed the judicial review aspects of the relevant statutory provisions before it. The court ruled that "in a mixed case an employee who chooses the negotiated grievance procedure must take the arbitrator's decision to the MSPB before seeking judicial review." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2052</span>, 992 F.2d at 335. In so doing, the court rejected the union's argument that judicial review was governed by &#x00A7; 7121(f). The court stated that "[a] close reading of &#x00A7; 7121 in its entirety...makes clear that subsection (f) does not apply to a mixed case." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 333.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the meaning and application of &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, which is the controlling statutory provision for purposes of determining the Authority's jurisdiction over exceptions to arbitrators' awards, was not an issue before the court in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2052.</span> Accordingly, the court's decision did not address, let alone resolve, whether exceptions to an arbitrator's award in a mixed case relate to a matter that is inextricably intertwined with a section 4303 or 7512 matter, so that the Authority lacks jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute to resolve the exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's argument that it "is inconceivable that Congress would have intended that the Agency have <span class="Italic">no </span>venue in which to appeal an arbitrator's award in a mixed case." As a general matter, the Authority has previously recognized that, under the statutory scheme enacted by Congress, there may be some awards that are not reviewable at all. <span class="Italic">See VAMC, </span>53 FLRA at 443 ("We acknowledge that there may be cases where no forum has jurisdiction to review an arbitrator's award."). In addition, with specific reference to mixed cases, Congress has made it clear that employees have certain avenues of appeal that are not available to agencies. For example, as acknowledged by the Agency, only individuals, not agencies, may petition the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to consider a final decision from the MSPB on a mixed-case appeal or on appeal of a final decision on a mixed-case complaint. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.303(a). Similarly, only individuals, not agencies, may ask the MSPB to review the final decision on a mixed-case grievance. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(d). Further, only individuals, not agencies, are authorized by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 to file civil actions in United States district court. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.310. Thus, Congress explicitly established certain rights of appeal that apply only to certain parties, not to all parties, in particular mixed-case proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, as the Authority has specifically held, the legislative history confirms that the statutory scheme of which &#x00A7; 7122(a) is a part was specifically designed to promote consistency and uniformity of process and to discourage forum shopping. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE Local 2986, </span>51 FLRA at 1554. These objectives are clearly served by a determination that under &#x00A7; 7122(a), the Authority lacks jurisdiction to resolve exceptions to mixed-case<span id="page_1742"></span> grievance arbitration awards, just as it lacks jurisdiction to resolve exceptions to awards relating to other matters appealable to the MSPB.</p>
