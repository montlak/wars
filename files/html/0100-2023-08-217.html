<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Sheiman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, SF-0752-15-0372-I-2 (NP 5/24/2022), involving an agency's efforts to recover a debt from a terminated, retired employee's retirement funds:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board currently has no jurisdiction over the agency's debt collection action</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, following the hearing, the appellant filed motions regarding the agency's efforts to offset his retirement benefits to collect debts totaling $33,105.83, including fees, interest, and penalties. In his cross petition for review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge abused her discretion by not addressing the debt issue, contending it was ripe for adjudication. He asserts that the administrative judge erred in failing to ensure that the agency afforded him due process in conjunction with the alleged debt. Although the agency argues that the debt is "not integral to the issues regarding the appeal," it appears that a portion of the debt may relate to the appellant's use of sick leave at issue in his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of whether the debt is related to the use of sick leave underlying the removal, the Board is without authority to order cancelation or amendment of the debt in this appeal. <span class="Italic">Mattern v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 65, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4, 11, 14-15 (2001) (finding that the Board could not award either back pay or <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief for the appellant's placement on restricted leave or administrative leave, even though these actions were related to his subsequent removal, which the Board reversed), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 291 F.3d 1366 (Fed.

If the appellant believes that the debt itself amounts to a suspension of more than 14 days, or a furlough of 30 days or less, he may wish to file a separate Board appeal of any such alleged adverse action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(2), (5); <span class="Italic">see Engler v.

The appellant alleges that the Department of Treasury has suggested his retirement benefits may be offset by his debt. However, he does not allege that the agency has actually sought to do so and he has not provided copies of the relevant correspondence or indicated that OPM has initiated such offsets.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Accordingly, the administrative judge properly denied his motions seeking to stop collection.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee's displeasure over the manner that the agency deducts a debt from his salary does not create an involuntary retirement if the agency's representations concerning the debt collection do not mislead the employee concerning his election to retire. <span class="Italic">See Bente v.

Furthermore, the appellant does not allege that the USPS did not afford her the required due process. Because the appellant has not shown jurisdiction over the underlying appeal, the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider her debt collection claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board jurisdiction over OPM's deduction from retirement funds of debts assessed by employing agencies was considered in <span class="Italic">Ramirez v. Dept. of Army</span>, 86 MSPR 211, 212-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-12 (2000). Board review of the debt issue is limited to ensuring proper procedures are followed. The Board did not appear to clearly address its own jurisdiction over the dispute leading to the debt, involving the Army's successful effort to collect funds from appellant's retirement account to satisfy a debt assessed for some government property:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly noted the Board's limited scope of review authority in connection with OPM's collection of a debt. The merits of the underlying debt issue between the appellant and the creditor agency are specifically excluded from its purview<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Lary v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 65 MSPR 291, 299 (1994), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom. King v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 105 F.3d 635 (Fed.

Thus, to the extent that he is attempting to appeal the propriety of the agency's finding that he was liable for the missing property, she properly found that his appeal did not raise a jurisdictional matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, we find that his pleadings also raise a procedural claim, specifically, that his former employing agency should have granted him a hearing, as he requested. In this regard, the record indicates that he was offered the election of a hearing, and that he requested one, but was told that he failed to make his request to the correct division of the agency. Such a claim, we conclude, fairly read, is one that comes within OPM's scope of review and, derivatively, the Board's. <span class="Italic">See King v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 105 F.3d at 639, 640, setting forth the procedures of 31 USC &#x00A7; 3716(a) antecedent to an agency's request for collection through administrative offset; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 4 CFR &#x00A7; 102.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 31 USC &#x00A7; 3716, before beginning administrative offset, an agency head must provide certain rights to the alleged debtor, among them an explanation of his rights under that section and an opportunity for review within the agency of its decision as to the claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> 31 USC &#x00A7; 3716(a)(1), (3). Moreover, the agency must also have adopted, without change, the administrative offset regulations previously promulgated by any of three other agencies or have prescribed regulations consistent with them. <span class="Italic">See</span> 31 USC &#x00A7; 3716(b)(1), (2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 102.1102.20, set forth more explicit requirements for administrative offsets generally, and for those that, as here, are accomplished through offset from amounts payable from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. At section 102.4, they provide that in making a claim to OPM, the creditor agency must first, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, certify in writing that it "has complied with the requirements of &#x00A7; 102.3 of Title 4], including any required hearing or review." In turn, the latter requires that an agency's debt collection regulations provide "appropriate procedural rights" 'to the alleged debtor (section 102.3(b)(2)) and specify the "[t]ype of hearing or review" required. 4 CFR &#x00A7; 102.3(c). Administrative offset may only be accomplished prior to the fulfillment of the person's procedural entitlements in very limited circumstances, where the government's ability to collect the debt would be substantially prejudiced by first providing the required protections. 4 CFR &#x00A7; 102.3(b)(5). Among the situations in which "a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing" is required are those in which "the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the agency determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity." 4 CFR &#x00A7; 102.3(c)(l)(H).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, in its own regulations applicable to non-fraud claims (defined at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1803), OPM has provided that the creditor agency must comply with the requirements of 4 CFR &#x00A7; 102.4 and that "[i]f the debtor responds to the notice [of the nature and amount of the debt] by requesting a review (or hearing if one is available), the review (or hearing) must be completed before the creditor agency submits the debt claim." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1804(b)(3)(B)(iii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the agency notified the appellant of his right to a hearing and he responded by both disputing his liability for the debt, and twice requesting a hearing. The agency's response to the first request was that he had directed it to an incorrect branch of the agency. There is no evidence of a reply to the second, but it appears to have been submitted after the date on which OPM indicated it would begin to offset his retirement account.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this record, we conclude that the merits of the appellant's claim that he is not liable for the debt are beyond both the Board's and OPM's scope of review. Nonetheless, we find that OPM's authority, and the Board's as a result, extends to the related matter the appellant seeks to vindicate--his entitlement to a hearing and whether, under the circumstances, one was properly not afforded prior to the offset.[*] We therefore remand the appeal for further consideration. While we recognize that the administrative judge correctly informed him that any question concerning OPM's debt recovery actions for another agency may be addressed to OPM, we remand this issue because it is one that goes to the Board's jurisdiction, a matter which is always properly before us. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Becker v.</span> Department <span class="Italic">of Veterans Affairs,</span> 76 MSPR 292, 296 (1997) (as a limited-jurisdiction tribunal whose authority to act is derived from statute and regulation, the issue of jurisdiction is always before the Board, and it is obligated to satisfy itself as to jurisdiction over the action before it).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] &#x00A0;We note that, pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1806(d)(3), OPM will not review the merits of a creditor agency's claim or its "decision that a hearing was not required in any particular proceeding." As stated, however, the Department of the Army did not decide that a hearing "was not required," which is an issue on the merits. Rather, it indicated that the appellant had the right to one, if properly requested, which appears to raise a procedural issue well within OPM's purview.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant appeal appears to be a request for the assistance of the Board in avoiding the agency's collection of a debt purportedly owed by the appellant.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, as the administrative judge correctly recognized, to the extent that the appellant is attempting to appeal the propriety of the agency's finding that he was liable for a debt, his appeal did not raise a matter within the Board's jurisdiction. The administrative judge also indicated, however, that "[w]ith regard to administrative offsets or debt collection actions, the Board has...limited jurisdiction to determine whether the agency complied with due process requirements prior to collection," and further, that "[t]he Board has jurisdiction over an employee's procedural claim that he requested and was denied a hearing on the merits of the underlying debt." ID at 2-3 (footnote omitted) (citing <span class="Italic">Ramirez v. Department of the Army</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 211 (2000)). This overstates the limited scope of the Board's authority to consider such matters. As set forth above, the Board may consider such issues only when they are integral to the disposition of an underlying appealable action. In <span class="Italic">Ramirez,</span> the Board considered the appellant's claim that his former employing agency should have granted him a hearing concerning a debt that the agency apparently collected by having OPM offset the debt from his retirement account. 86 M.S.P.R. 211, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6. The Board held that, although the merits of the underlying debt issue between the appellant and the creditor agency were excluded from the Board's purview, the appellant's procedural claim "fairly read, is one that comes within OPM's scope of review and, derivatively, the Board's." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, the appellant does not allege that the agency has requested OPM to proceed with collection of the debt through an administrative offset, nor is there any indication in the record that the appellant has retired or is eligible to retire.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, OPM agrees that it failed to provide the appellant with the procedural rights to which he is entitled under 5 C.F.R. part 831 and that the case should be remanded to it for further proceedings. However, OPM argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that OPM's action was governed by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1304 or other provisions of 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart M, and it maintains that collection of debts such as the alleged debt at issue in this case is governed instead by the provisions of 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart R.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's position is well founded. While subpart M of 5 C.F.R. part 831 prescribes procedures to be followed by OPM in collecting debts incurred by an annuitant, that subpart is applicable only where the debt allegedly is <span class="Italic">owed to</span> the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF). 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1301, 831.1302.

It also prescribes procedures OPM must follow in making such offsets. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In the present case, the debt allegedly is owed to OWCP, and the agency to which it allegedly is owed is seeking offset of the debt against the appellant's CSRS annuity payments. Subpart R of part 831--and not subpart M--therefore governs OWCP's claim and OPM's actions in response to that claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that OPM's scope of review under subpart R is limited, and that it does not extend to a review of the merits of the underlying debt issue between the appellant and the creditor agency. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1806(d)(3)(1). OPM is responsible, however, for determining whether the administrative offset was effected in a manner consistent with the procedural requirements of that subpart and the authorities cited there; and it is responsible for ensuring its own compliance with procedural requirements imposed on it under the subpart. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1805-831.1808; <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jackson v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 318, 323-24 (1995), commented on Board jurisdiction over appeals alleging that OPM improperly permitted an offset against a retirement account, contested by the appellant, who sought a retirement refund after separating from the federal service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the portion of our previous decision concluding that OPM's actions amounted to collection of a debt by administrative offset, we did not distinguish between that part of the appellant's retirement contributions that OPM claims is allocable to FERS, and that part it claims should have been used for payment of OASDI taxes. 62 MSPR at 11. <span class="Italic">Lary</span> modified this aspect of our previous decision, to the extent that it held that the portion of an individual's retirement contributions withheld under CSRS, but allegedly allocable to FERS, is subject to administrative offset procedures. <span class="Italic">Lary</span> held that administrative offset procedures for collection of a debt due the United States apply only to the portion of an individual's retirement contributions that it is later claimed should have been used for payment of OASDI taxes. Reallocation to FERS of funds originally withheld under CSRS, by contrast, is an accounting transaction within the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund that is not subject to administrative offset procedures. <span class="Italic">Lary</span>, 65 MSPR at 302-304. Similarly, we hold that, here, only that portion of the appellant's retirement contributions that OPM claims must be used to satisfy her liability for OASDI taxes is subject to administrative offset procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, in his decision on remand, ordered OPM to notify DOE that DOE had 120 days within which to afford the appellant her due process rights under OPM's regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 831.1806(a). OPM argues that the administrative judge's order for compliance is unenforceable. Specifically, it contends that DOE and IRS are responsible for determining the appellant's liability for OASDI taxes, and that OPM has no way to force them to make a determination within 120 days. Thus, OPM's position is that, even though its authority does not extend to administration of the OASDI system, it will not complete action on the appellant's request for a refund of her retirement contributions because it is concerned that she may be liable for OASDI taxes, and it cannot force the agencies responsible for administering the OASDI system to take final action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's view of the appellant's rights and its own obligations is backwards. The very fact that OPM is not responsible for determining OASDI coverage or collecting OASDI taxes makes its indefinite delay of the appellant's refund of her retirement contributions, on the ground that she may be liable for OASDI taxes, unjustified. If DOE and IRS can establish, in accordance with OPM's regulations governing collection of debts by administrative offset--including the regulatory time limit--that the appellant owes OASDI taxes, then OPM may allow those agencies to collect the taxes from funds held by OPM in the appellant's name. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 831.1806(a). Otherwise, OPM has no warrant for refusing to refund the full amount of the appellant's retirement contributions. <span class="Italic">See Lary</span>, 65 MSPR at 303. OPM has not shown that a claim for unpaid OASDI taxes by IRS and an employing agency, asserted against a refund of retirement contributions, is a special case of debt collection falling outside the coverage of OPM's own administrative offset regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Put another way, OPM knows that one of the following must be true: If DOE properly treated the appellant as a CSRS employee, she is entitled to a full refund of her retirement contributions under CSRS; or, if DOE should have treated her as a FERS employee, the appellant made an overpayment to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund equal to the amount of deductions from her pay that were treated as CSRS contributions, but that should have been used to pay OASDI taxes. <span class="Italic">See Lary</span>, 65 MSPR at 302-304. In either case, OPM does not claim authority under the laws it administers to continue to withhold a refund of the appellant's retirement contributions. It must, therefore, refund the money to the appellant, unless DOE and IRS establish a valid debt for OASDI taxes collectible from the refund. OPM's own regulations provide for resolution of a claim for collection of a debt by administrative offset within 120 days (unless the creditor agency requests an extension, in which case resolution must occur within no more than 180 days). 5 CFR 831.1806(a). We see no reason why OPM should not follow its own regulations under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lashley v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 360, 365 (1990), explored Board authority to hold OPM responsible for following proper debt collection procedures involving offsets to retirement accounts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we agree with OPM's argument that the Board has no right to adjudicate the merits of the debt claim, we find OPM's contention that the creditor agency need not advise OPM as to how it complied with due process requirements to be without merit. OPM's clear authority to initiate the set-off mechanism to collect the appellant's alleged debt does not relieve OPM of the duty to follow the dictates of due process. <span class="Italic">See Atwater v. Roudebush</span>, 452 F. Supp. 622, 627 (N.D. Ill. 1976). OPM may honor a creditor agency's request only if it meets certain requirements set by OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1804(b)(4); 4 CFR &#x00A7; 102.4. These requirements are contained in OPM's regulations and the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR 101.1 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>) and conform to fundamental due process principles that a person should have notice and the opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why the proposed action should not be taken. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Board of Education v.

<p class="Body-Text">These due process requirements include notice and an opportunity to present reasons, in person or in writing, why the proposed action (offset of the debt against the OPM retirement fund) should not be granted. <span class="Italic">See Lary v.

However, the Board, in <span class="Italic">Lashley v.

As part of that review, the Board may determine whether the creditor agency properly advised OPM 'as to how it complied with due process requirements.' <span class="Italic">Id.</span>"). <span class="Italic">Lary v.
