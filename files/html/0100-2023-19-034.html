<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-34"><span class="space">f.</span> Comparable Employees; Disparate Treatment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Although discriminatory intent may be established through an agency's failure to prove its case, coupled with direct anecdotal, statistical, or other evidence of prohibited animus toward an appellant or a protected group of employees, other cases attempt to establish intentional discrimination through the dissimilar treatment of comparable employees. The Board's focus in EEO analysis as to comparators has traditionally been narrow, as the decisions that follow illustrate. Considering mitigation of penalties, the Board has become more expansive in its examination of comparators. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ellis v. DOD</span>, 114 MSPR 407, 411 n.*, 2010 MSPB 141 (2010); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. VA</span>, 111 MSPR 388, 391-92 &#x00B6; 8 (2009). This results in a difference in the Board's approach to comparator evidence when it considers reasonableness of a penalty and when it considers discrimination. [Refer to Chapter 7, "<a href="0100-2023-14-076.html#sec7-75">Disparate, Comparable Penalties</a>," to Chapter 13, "Comparator Employees," and to Chapter 9, "Comparison of Employees' Performance."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's restricted consideration of comparators in EEO analysis is illustrated by <span class="Italic">Burton v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 115, 119-21 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-13, 2009 MSPB 157 (2009), involving removal of the appellant for unauthorized removal of mail for personal use:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant has alleged that the agency treated him more harshly than other, similarly situated employees based on his race and sex. He has identified six comparison employees. To show that other employees are similarly situated, the appellant must show that all relevant aspects of his employment situation are nearly identical to those of the comparison employees. <span class="Italic">Spahn v. Department of Justice</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 195, &#x00B6; 13 (2003). In a case that, like this one, involves disciplinary action for misconduct, the appellant must show, among other things, that he and the comparison employees engaged in similar misconduct without differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their misconduct or the appropriate discipline for it. <span class="Italic">See Godesky v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 280, &#x00B6; 12 (2006). Unless the appellant and the comparison employees were supervised by the same individual, they are not similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note first that one of the comparison employees evidently retired without having been charged with any offense.[1] Of the agency decisions in the cases of the remaining five comparators, only one was issued by the individual who issued the notice of decision to remove <span id="Page_3363"></span>the appellant. That decision was issued in the case of an employee who was demoted for making false entries on inventory forms, and for failing to follow agency financial and/or accounting practices. While those offenses appear to be serious, they involve conduct significantly different from that of the appellant. As the AJ noted, the appellant's conduct "violated the agency's core mission of delivering the mail safely and efficiently." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ruiz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 76, 80-81 (1993) (letter carrier's opening mail and removing its contents for his personal use "strikes at the heart of" and is "directly detrimental to the agency's mission"). The same cannot be said of the comparator employee. That comparator's treatment therefore does not support the appellant's claim of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;While the record includes little evidence regarding that employee, her retirement was effective the day before she was placed in a nonduty, nonpay status based on the results of a preliminary investigation into her alleged misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two of the other four comparators were demoted for misusing their government credit cards. Like the offenses mentioned above, this offense is materially different from that of the appellant and, although serious, does not directly affect the agency's mission. Even if the same individual who served as the deciding official in the appellant's case had served in the same capacity in the cases of those two comparators, those comparators would not be situated similarly to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Archuleta v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 404, 407 (1983) (to establish disparate penalties, the appellant must show that the charges and the circumstances surrounding the charged behavior are substantially similar).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cases of the remaining two comparators identified by the appellant also fail to support the appellant's claim of disparate treatment. As we have indicated above, the decision notices in those cases also were issued by deciding officials other than the official who issued the decision to remove the appellant. In addition, those comparators were charged with misappropriation of postal funds. Again, this offense differs significantly from that of the appellant. Moreover, one of those comparators held the position of nonsupervisory clerk, a position materially different from that of the appellant, and neither of the two was retained on the agency's employment rolls. Instead, the nonsupervisory clerk, whose removal proposal was held in abeyance after he agreed to reimburse the agency and retire, evidently was removed after he failed to pay the agreed-upon reimbursement. The other comparator charged with misappropriation of postal funds was scheduled to be removed, but was permitted to resign after remaining on the rolls briefly, in a nonduty, nonpay status.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;This employee, whose misappropriation offense involved postal money orders totaling less than $140, also was charged with other offenses, i.e., failing to properly protect, account for, and record receipt of postal funds and stamps.

That is, for other employees to be deemed similarly situated for purposes of a disparate penalty analysis, the Board does not require that all relevant aspects of the appellant's employment situation be "nearly identical" to those of the comparator employees. Rather, an appellant must show that there is enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and the other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated <span id="Page_3364"></span>employees differently, but the Board will not have hard and fast rules regarding the outcome determinative nature of these factors. <span class="Italic">Boucher</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20; <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged below that he was disparately treated because of his status as an African-American. We note that during the hearing, the appellant and some other agency witnesses discussed Mr. Irizarry, another Supervisory Air Traffic Control Specialist, who was alleged to have committed similar misconduct regarding currency; however, at the time of the hearing, the agency had not proposed any disciplinary action against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its notice of a proposed 30-day suspension, the agency charged Mr. Irizarry with misrepresenting information on government records based on a single specification that, on two occasions on May 17, 2008, he signed onto a position to obtain currency, but he did not actually work in that position. The notice stated that Mr. Irizarry admitted to this allegation and further "admitted to signing on positions in June and July 2008 without actually working the positions for a total of 2-3 hours each month." We note that there was no evidence in the record below, or on PFR, regarding the agency's penalty determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has the burden of proving his affirmative defense of race discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(iii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(C)].An employee may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of prohibited discrimination by introducing preponderant evidence to show that he is a member of a protected group, he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of the protected group, and he was treated more harshly or disparately than the individual who was not a member of his protected group. <span class="Italic">Buckler v. Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 476, 497 (1997). The Board has held that for other employees to be deemed similarly situated, all relevant aspects of the appellant's employment situation must be "nearly identical" to those of the comparator employees, including that they report to the same supervisor, are subject to the same disciplinary standards, and engaged in similar misconduct. <span class="Italic">Spahn v. Department of Justice,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 195, &#x00B6; 13 (2003). However, where the record is complete and a hearing has been held,[4] it is unnecessary to follow the traditional burden-shifting order of analysis; rather, the inquiry shifts from whether the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case to whether s/he has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency's reason for its actions was a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 46, 52 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only evidence in the record regarding Mr. Irizarry's race arose during Mr. Miller's cross-examination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Q Mr. [Irizarry] is not African/American?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A No.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We note that this is a somewhat unusual situation, in that the parties were aware of Mr. Irizarry's alleged misconduct at the hearing, there was testimony regarding his case, but no meaningful comparisons could be made because the agency had not yet proposed any discipline. However, such circumstances do not affect our conclusions herein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that Jose A. Garcia was the proposing and deciding official in Mr. Irizarry's case, not Mr. Miller. Moreover, there was no evidence in the record regarding Mr. Garcia's knowledge of Mr. Irizarry's race, and we could not find any identification of Mr. Irizarry's race in the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, the administrative judge rejected the appellant's affirmative defense, concluding that "differences in charges are many," the appellant and Mr. Irizarry were not similarly situated, and the appellant did not show that he was treated differently regarding the imposition of discipline. While there are similarities between the appellant's case and Mr. Irizarry's case, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant did not meet his burden with respect to his race discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For instance, the appellant and Mr. Irizarry were both Supervisory Air Traffic Controllers at the Jacksonville Center. They also had the same third line supervisor, Mr. Miller. Significantly, even though their respective charges had different labels--the appellant was charged with conduct unbecoming a manager, and Mr. Irizarry was charged with misrepresenting information on government records--they both were essentially disciplined for claiming currency when they were not actually at work in the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, there were significant differences between these two cases, mainly that the appellant was <span class="Italic">additionally charged</span> with AWOL and lack of candor. Furthermore, Mr. Irizarry, during the investigation, immediately admitted his wrongdoing, and he also admitted to improperly claiming currency for an additional period of time, whereas the appellant denied the allegations and, after the agency expended its resources to investigate these allegations, he later admitted to most of the misconduct. We note, too, that there were different proposing and deciding officials.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we believe that the appellant and Mr. Irizarry were not similarly situated. Moreover, we note that Mr. Miller was asked whether the appellant's race played a role, if any, in his decision to demote him and he responded "[a]bsolutely none." The appellant bears the burden of proving his affirmative defense, and based on the evidence, we conclude that he failed to show that he was disparately treated because of his race.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We note that there are some irregular aspects of Mr. Irizarry's case related to the appellant's race discrimination claim. For instance, Mr. Irizarry's conduct occurred in May 2008, yet the agency did not issue the proposal notice until over 7 months later, in January 2009, which was also 1 week after the hearing in this appeal. In the appellant's case, the agency investigated the allegations and proposed his demotion within 4 months of the alleged misconduct. Moreover, Mr. Garcia testified in his September 2008 deposition that Mr. Miller would be the deciding official in Mr. Irizarry's case; however, between then and January 2009, Mr. Garcia apparently became the proposing and deciding official, and the agency did not provide an explanation for why Mr. Miller was no longer the deciding official in that case. However, we are not persuaded that these concerns warrant a different conclusion regarding the appellant's race discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nichols v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 229, 232-33 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (1998), discussed claims of racial discrimination and reprisal by a postal clerk removed for mishandling funds:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, who is black, has not introduced any direct evidence that the removal was tainted by discriminatory animus. The only circumstantial evidence he has presented is the fact that he was the only black window clerk at the time of the October 15, 1996 test. There is no evidence that the agency singled the appellant out for the test because of his race, however, nor is there evidence that the agency tests black employees but not those of other races. Moreover, as noted above, the agency had good reason for testing the appellant's honesty because of his substantial shortages of stock and cash. Considering that the appellant actually committed serious misconduct, and given that there is no evidence that employees of other races committed similar misconduct but were not removed, upon weighing the evidence, we find that the appellant has not shown that he was removed because of his race in violation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(A). In this connection, the appellant's assertion that employees with shortages were not removed is unavailing, even if true, because the appellant was removed for mishandling an unendorsed money order, not for having a shortage. <span class="Italic">Cf. Valdez v. Department of Justice,</span> 65 MSPR 390, 400 (1994) (there is no impermissible disparity in penalty if the comparison employees identified did not commit misconduct similar to the appellant's).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim that he was removed in retaliation for his EEO activity also fails. There is no direct evidence that the removal was motivated by retaliatory animus, nor is there any circumstantial evidence (such as showing that employees who committed similar misconduct but did not make EEO complaints were not removed, or a showing that the appellant's EEO activity jeopardized the career of the official(s) who decided to remove him) sufficient to support a finding of a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the removal. <span class="Italic">See Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">Title VII does not award damages against employers who cannot prove a nondiscriminatory reason for adverse employment action, but only against employers who are proven to have taken adverse employment action by reason of [race, color, sex, religion, national origin, or retaliation].</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> to appeals before the Board, we find that an agency meets its burden to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason when it introduces evidence, "which, <span class="Italic">taken as true</span>, would <span class="Italic">permit</span> the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action," <span class="Italic">regardless</span> of whether the agency actually proves its charges. <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, __ U.S. at __, 113 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant reiterates his argument that the agency's removal action was discriminatory because the agency allowed a female employee, whose removal had been proposed and who had the same proposing and deciding officials as the appellant, to be reassigned to the Birmingham, Alabama, Post Office prior to the effective date of her removal. The record shows that the agency proposed the female employee's removal for AWOL, failure to follow instructions, and failure to report an accident. In proposing her removal, the agency relied upon her past disciplinary record, which included a 7-day suspension for unsatisfactory work performance and failure to follow instructions, a letter of warning for failure to follow instructions, and a 14-day suspension for an unsafe act in hitting a fixed object. The removal proposal notice also indicated that the employee had had three prior vehicular accidents and an industrial accident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency also relied on the appellant's past disciplinary record, which included a 5-day suspension for failure to follow instructions by not timely reporting a vehicular accident and for unsatisfactory work performance and attendance, a letter of warning for failure to follow instructions, a 3-day suspension for an unsafe act and failure to report an accident, and a discussion on failure to follow instructions. Both the appellant's and the comparison employee's offenses occurred within a relatively short period of time, i.e., 2 years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the proposing and deciding officials treated both cases identically and that the agency's stated reason for the ultimate difference in treatment, i.e., reassignment as opposed to removal, was that the female employee was able to persuade authorities in the agency's Birmingham Post Office to permit her reassignment to that facility prior to the effective date of her removal, while the appellant was unable to obtain a similar reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency has presented no satisfactory explanation as to why the female employee was reassigned, rather than removed, and the appellant was removed, rather than reassigned. The proposing official testified that he was not involved in the female employee's reassignment. The deciding official testified that she did not attempt to "block" either the female employee's or the appellant's reassignment to another facility and that, to the contrary, she attempted to assist the appellant in obtaining a reassignment. She further testified that the manager of the agency's general mail facility denied the appellant a transfer based on his prior record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the female employee's record as described above was no better than the appellant's and so the agency articulated no legitimate reason for the difference in treatment between the female employee's reassignment and the appellant's removal. In analogous cases concerning affirmative defenses of race discrimination, the Board has held that, in order to establish race discrimination based on disparate treatment, an appellant must show that the difference in treatment was based on an intent to discriminate and that such intent may be shown by circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Kline v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 46 MSPR 193, 201 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part</span>, 805 F. Supp. 545 (E.D. Tenn. 1992); <span class="Italic">Fenn v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 362, 366 (1987). We found in those cases that the appellant must establish facts, which, if not otherwise explained, are more likely than not due to the intentional consideration of an impermissible factor such as race. <span class="Italic">Fenn</span>, 35 MSPR at 367. We find similarly here that, to prove an affirmative defense of sex discrimination based on disparate treatment, an appellant must show, by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the difference in treatment was based on an intent to discriminate on the basis of sex. <span class="Italic">See Kline</span>, 46 MSPR at 201; <span class="Italic">Fenn</span>, 35 MSPR at 366-67.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by presenting circumstantial evidence of the agency's intent to discriminate based on sex by showing that he was disparately treated since the female employee's record was worse than his, and she was reassigned while he was removed. <span class="Italic">See Carter</span>, 61 MSPR at 665. The burden then shifted to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the difference in treatment by introducing evidence which, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action, regardless of whether the agency actually proved its charge. <span class="Italic">See Carter</span>, 61 MSPR at 666. The agency's argument that it simply did not attempt to "block" the appellant's reassignment to another facility does not even remotely meet this burden. The agency is responsible for ensuring nondiscriminatory treatment of its employees and it may not shirk its responsibilities by claiming that any discriminatory treatment was merely the action of its component facility. Under these circumstances, we find that the agency's complete failure to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse action, together with the appellant's proof of his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, suffices to show intentional discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Carter</span>, 61 MSPR at 668.</p>

DHS</span>, 108 MSPR 539, 546-50 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-15, 2008 MSPB 88 (2008), determined that the appellant's removal discriminated based on sex when the agency failed to provide to her informal limited or light duty to avoid problems caused by some physical impairments, but the agency, through the same deciding official, allowed another incapacitated employee to work on limited or light duty assignments. Canceling the removal, the Board left to the agency the problem of how to determine a position for the appellant that she could perform within her medical limitations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3366"></span>[T]he record does establish by preponderant evidence that the agency treated the appellant disparately from Doshen, a similarly situated employee outside the appellant's protected group. To establish a claim of prohibited employment discrimination, an employee first must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; the burden of going forward then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action; and, finally, the employee must show that the agency's stated reason is merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination<span class="Italic">. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973). Regarding disparate treatment, an employee may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of prohibited discrimination by introducing preponderant evidence to show that she is a member of a protected group, she was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of the protected group, and she was treated more harshly or disparately than the individual who was not a member of her protected group. <span class="Italic">Buckler v. Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 476, 497 (1997). However, in a case like this, where the record is complete and a hearing has been held, it is unnecessary to follow the traditional burden-shifting order of analysis; rather, the inquiry shifts from whether the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case to whether she has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency's reason for its actions was a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 46, 52 (1998). The agency, under the circumstances presented, may have properly removed the appellant for her physical inability to perform the duties of her AM 10 position, "but only if the same criteria is applied alike" to men and women. <span class="Italic">See McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 804 (noting that the introduction of evidence which indicated that the employer did not apply the stated criteria for such an adverse action equally would be especially relevant to a showing that the employer's stated reason for the adverse action was pretext for illegal discrimination). For the reasons set forth below, we find that the appellant established by a preponderance of the evidence that she was disparately treated with respect to her request for light-duty and that the agency's reasons for removing her were pretext for discrimination on the basis of sex.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the question of sex discrimination, the appellant contends that the AJ erred in determining that Tom Doshen, another aircraft mechanic at the ARSC whose physical condition, like the appellant's, also precluded the performance of some of the essential functions of his position, was not similarly situated to the appellant. The AJ found that the appellant and Doshen were not proper comparators because their respective situations were not "nearly identical." ID at 15 (citing <span class="Italic">Pleasant v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 602, &#x00B6; 15 (2005) (all relevant aspects of the appellant's and the comparison employee's employment situation must be nearly identical; they must have engaged in similar conduct without differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish either their misconduct or the appropriate discipline for it). The AJ determined that Doshen and the appellant were not similarly situated in part because of differences in their respective physical conditions, noting that Doshen only had knee surgery while the appellant had both neck and knee surgery. In further support of his determination that the appellant and Doshen were not similarly situated, the AJ noted that Doshen had not informed the CG that he could no longer work as an aircraft mechanic while the appellant had done so, and that Doshen had not provided the CG with restrictions from his physicians preventing him from performing the essential duties of an airline mechanic, while the appellant had 11 provided Dr. Sonnino's restrictions on lifting and working in tight spaces. However, there are significant similarities between Doshen and the appellant, and the Board has held that potential comparators' respective situations do not have to be perfectly identical to be considered similar and comparable without differentiating or mitigating circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Spahn v. Department of Justice</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 195, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 30-32 (2003). Thus, although the issue presented is whether the agency discriminated against the appellant on the basis of sex rather than on the basis of disability, we must explore the parties' respective physical conditions to determine if they are proper comparators.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the AJ correctly noted several differences between the appellant and Doshen, those differences obscure the basic facts set forth above, which establish that, although Doshen and the appellant were both physically incapable of performing some of the essential functions of the aircraft mechanic position, the agency allowed Doshen to work light-duty for an indefinite period of time, until he eventually found a position with less demanding physical requirements, and the appellant was removed for her physical inability to perform the essential functions of her position. Although the AJ also correctly noted that only the appellant, not Doshen, presented medical documentation which prevented her from performing some of the essential functions of her aircraft mechanic position, Cook's and Dorsey's testimony make it clear that Doshen, without having to ask, received the same consideration that the appellant requested but that the agency denied to her, i.e., relief from the performance of the essential functions of the aircraft mechanic position that Doshen was unable to perform on account of his medical condition. Despite the fact that Doshen never presented medical evidence to the agency which documented his limitations, the record establishes that the agency perceived that both Doshen and the appellant were unable to perform essential functions of their aircraft mechanic position, but that each employee suffered disparate fates; Doshen received open-ended informal light-duty and the appellant was removed for her physical inability to perform the essential functions of her position. Further, the agency apparently allowed Doshen to return to work after his knee surgery solely on the strength of his word that his physician gave him a full release and despite the fact the agency witnesses testified that they observed occasions when Doshen was barely able to walk or fell at work, but the agency required the appellant to provide further details following Dr. Sonnino's April 18, 2006 letter before it would let her work. The agency's insistence on further medical documentation from the appellant, while demanding none from Doshen, in spite of his patent physical deficits and the agency's knowledge of his condition, also establishes that the agency treated the appellant and Doshen disparately.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that, had the agency offered the same consideration in work assignments to her that it gave to Doshen, "there would have been no need for a letter from her doctor" as well. As the appellant aptly notes in her PFR, "the evidence supports the existence of a gentlemen's implied agreement or practice of only assigning Mr. Doshen work that he was physically able to perform." Based on the testimony of these two employees' supervisors recounted above, we agree. Although the agency established legitimate reasons to remove the appellant for her physical inability to perform essential functions of the aircraft mechanic position, the agency's reasons are pretext because the same reasons applied equally to Doshen, but the agency afforded him open-ended light duty instead of removing him for his physical inability to perform the essential function of the position. Hale's testimony that the appellant's medical condition made him "scared from a government liability point of view" to allow the appellant to continue working, and Dorsey's similar testimony that the appellant's assertion that she could not perform some of the essential functions of the position "tie[d] our hands," could apply equally to Doshen. Hale and Dorsey's testimony that they were aware of Doshen's serious physical shortcomings, as well as Cook's testimony that he had observed that Doshen could barely walk and that he saw him fall down on the job, in light of the agency's decision to allow him to remain in his position anyway, support the existence of a tacit agreement to allow Doshen to work light-duty without proper documentation despite his known inability to perform essential functions of the AM position. The agency fails to explain why Dr. Sonnino's letter regarding the appellant's condition tied the agency's hands or made the government liable for the appellant's physical safety but the agency's obvious knowledge of Doshen's physical condition did not. The record reflects that the agency's stated rationale for removing the appellant, i.e., her physical inability to perform essential functions of the aircraft mechanic position, applied with equal force to Doshen, but the agency did not remove him. Hale's other stated rationale for removing the appellant, that the agency needed to have someone performing the full duties of the AM position in a full time capacity, also applied with equal force to Doshen, yet the agency did not remove him. Thus, the reasons which the agency set forth to justify the appellant's removal for her inability to perform the duties of the AM position, concern for her physical safety and the need to unencumber an aircraft mechanic billet to an employee that could do the full range of aircraft mechanic duties on a full time basis, applied equally to Doshen as well as to the appellant, but the agency failed to remove Doshen for his physical inability to perform the duties of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the appellant has established by preponderant evidence that she was similarly situated to Doshen, an individual who was not a member of her protected group, in that both the appellant and Doshen could not perform some of the essential functions of the aircraft mechanic position, and that the agency treated them disparately; the agency allowed Doshen to work light-duty without requiring medical documentation of his obvious physical deficits until he found a position within his physical requirements while the appellant was forced to document her physical condition and was then removed for her physical inability to perform the essential functions of her position based on that medical evidence. Because the agency removed the appellant, but failed to remove Doshen, even though the agency's stated reason for the appellant's removal applied equally to Doshen, the appellant has established that the agency's stated reason for her removal, i.e. her physical inability to perform the duties of the AM position, was pretext. Thus, we find that the appellant has established her affirmative defense of sex discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. A removal motivated by discrimination against an employee on the basis of her sex is a personnel practice prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2320(b)(1)(A), and, in light of our finding that the appellant has established that the decision to remove her was based on this prohibited personnel practice, we DO NOT SUSTAIN the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B).</p>

The Board allowed dissimilar treatment to be established under Title VII by considering settlements reached with other employees involved in substantially similar misconduct. <span class="Italic">Spahn</span> also noted that a disparity analysis is to be conducted by examining the treatment of the underlying misconduct rather than by examining only those charges against employees that are similarly phrased. [<span class="Italic">Spahn</span> is discussed in Chapter 7, "<a href="0100-2023-14-076.html#sec7-75">Disparate, Comparable Penalties</a>" and in "<a href="0100-2023-11-096.html#sec4-97">Settlement</a>."] Of interest in <span class="Italic">Spahn</span> was the Board's analysis of how it would redetermine a penalty when treatment of comparable employees demonstrates discrimination; the Board adjusted the appellant's penalty to that of the comparator:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final issue we must consider is the appropriate remedy for the agency's sex discrimination. Under Title VII, if an appellant proves that sex was a motivating factor in the agency's personnel action and, as here, the agency fails to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of this impermissible motivation, the employee is entitled to "such affirmative action as may be appropriate," including, but not limited to, reinstatement and back pay. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(m), 2000e-5(g); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of a Title VII remedy is to make the aggrieved party whole, i.e., "persons aggrieved by the consequences and effects of the unlawful employment practice [should] be, so far as possible, restored to a position where they would have been were it not for the unlawful discrimination." <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 421, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 45 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1975) (quoting legislative history). Where the evidence shows that an employee has engaged in misconduct that would have resulted in some discipline, but that the agency would not have imposed as serious a penalty but for the unlawful discrimination, the EEOC has held that the make-whole remedy is to substitute a lesser penalty, because reversing the personnel action in its entirety would place the appellant in a better position than she would have been absent discrimination<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant committed misconduct that merited discipline. The way to restore her to the same position she would occupy but for the unlawful discrimination is to punish her to no greater extent than similarly situated male employees: by reinstating her to employment with no more than a 14-day suspension, subject to the condition that any serious violation of DEA Standards of Conduct during the two years following her return to a duty status will result in removal without a right to appeal in any administrative forum.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hodge v. DHS</span>, 114 MSPR 636, 641 &#x00B6; 13, 2010 MSPB 190 (2010), reversing an indefinite suspension, but finding no discrimination, suggested a slight relaxation of a strict substantial similarity test to permit examination of the nature, rather than near identity, of conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Our review of the record shows that the administrative judge found that the appellant's claim of disparate treatment failed largely because one comparator "was not supervised by anyone involved in the agency action against the appellant," and because there was "no evidence that the same management officials were involved in" the remaining two comparators' cases. While these factors are relevant to the issue of whether the appellant established discrimination based on disparate treatment, there are other relevant factors as well, including the similarity of the comparators' alleged misconduct to that of the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Wiley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 535, &#x00B6; 20 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 218 Fed. Appx. 1001 (2007); <span class="Italic">Spahn v. Department of Justice,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 195, &#x00B6; 13 (2003). The record shows that the appellant's alleged misconduct differs materially from that of the three individuals she identified as having received more favorable treatment than the appellant. Specifically, the appellant allegedly was involved in an incident with New Orleans police officers wherein she challenged their authority when they asked her to leave a car wash, resisted arrest, refused their attempts to handcuff her, and struck one of them in the face with her fist. The misconduct of the three comparator employees consisted, respectively, of: being intoxicated and firing his weapon; having an affair with the wife of a man who was the subject of an investigation; and being the subject of domestic violence charges filed against him by the comparator's wife. The conduct of the comparator employees clearly conflicts less directly with the duties of a law enforcement officer than the appellant's direct and public confrontation with other law enforcement officers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Moultrie v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 153, 160-62 (1994), decided that treatment of arguably similarly situated employees did not demonstrate intentional discrimination; there were reasons for the dissimilarities in treatment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, where the appellant alleged that the agency discriminated against her based on disparate treatment, she had to establish by the preponderance of the evidence her assertion that the agency treated her less favorably than another employee and she had to show that the basis of this less favorable treatment was intentional prohibited discrimination. Proof of discriminatory motive is critical, although it can in some situations be inferred from the mere fact of similarly situated employees of different protected groups being treated disparately. As the Court stated in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, "proving the employer's [articulated nondiscriminatory] reason false becomes part of (and often considerably assists) the greater enterprise of proving the real reason was intentional discrimination."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming without finding that the appellant in this case made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, she did not meet her ultimate burden to prove that the agency disciplined her because of her race. As the administrative judge found, the appellant proved that white coworker Willis stated to the appellant on one occasion, "Kiss my white ass," and was not subjected to discipline. As the administrative judge also found, the appellant established further that agency management officials had constructive knowledge of that white coworker's racially tinged remarks because Ms. Topp, the appellant's supervisor, was a management official who should have been aware of the slurs....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge also found, the record established that the appellant phoned a coworker, who is white and was on-duty, three times to discuss a letter to the editor that had appeared that day in the Pensacola News Journal. The administrative judge found that the letter, which was written by the white employee whom the appellant phoned, criticized the appellant by name for dressing inappropriately and unprofessionally in the workplace. He found that, during the phone conversations, one of which the employee who received the calls put on a speaker phone for coworkers to hear, the appellant stated that she would "throw [the coworker's] fucking ass onto the street," that the coworker would not always be protected by her white friends, and that the coworker was a "fucking bitch" and a "white bitch."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds no basis on which to disturb these findings. The Board finds, however, that the administrative judge's conclusion that the conduct of the two employees was substantially similar and equally unacceptable is not supported by the record. The testimony as to the nature and frequency of Ms. Willis' racial remarks is vague and the only specific thing that Ms. Willis was found to have said, "Kiss my white ass," is less abusive than the language for which the appellant was disciplined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the administrative judge found that the appellant had a prior disciplinary record. That record included a 14-day suspension for insubordination, which the appellant was serving when she made the harassing phone calls, and a prior reprimand for using abusive and obscene language. More important, the appellant did not show that her coworker had a prior disciplinary record, or that the coworker's speech was comparable to that for which the appellant was disciplined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's first discipline, a reprimand, was based on two instances of abusive speech to a male coworker. The appellant was charged with saying that, if he went off base, she would "mess him up so bad [his] Mama won't recognize [him]." Further, in speaking abusively, she had used racial epithets, such as "this black woman will whip your white ass." The appellant's first disciplinary action was therefore based on inflammatory language of a more serious nature than the language that the appellant established that her white female coworker addressed to her. Although the agency officials had knowledge of the language used by both employees, and although we emphatically do not condone the appellant's white coworker's use of racial epithets, we find that the offenses and disciplinary records of the two employees were different, and that, as explained more fully below, differing responses to their complaints were appropriate.[20]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[20]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf. Stewart v. United States Postal Service</span>, 8 MSPB 427, 9 MSPR 71, 75 (1981) (evidence regarding suspension of white employee was insufficient to show pretext in reasons stated for removing minority employee, since, though there was in fact a disparity in treatment of the two employees, their offenses were not similar, minority employee having been charged with and admitted to falsification of official records relating to sick leave, whereas charge against white employee was for flagrant abuse of sick leave).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note the administrative judge's finding that, when the white employee made the allegation of racially abusive language, the agency responded by directing an investigation by a commissioned officer and instituting adverse action procedures. We also note his finding that, on the other hand, when the appellant made her allegation of racial harassment during her oral response to the notice of proposed removal, the deciding official only reminded the appellant of her right to file an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3368"></span>Based on the evidence of record, however, we do not find that the actions and disciplinary records of the appellant and the white coworker to whom she compares herself were sufficiently similar to find that the agency acted disparately in its differing responses to the two employees' complaints. The appellant did not state specifically what she told the deciding official regarding her coworker's words and actions. The deciding official describes the appellant's statement as a general allegation of unspecified harassment, and this description is consistent with the memorandum of the oral reply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that the appellant did not show that the agency's articulated nondiscriminatory reason for removing her from federal service, her proven misconduct, was not the real reason for its adverse action, or that its treatment of her complaint regarding abusive language was evidence of intentional discrimination. As the appellant has presented no additional evidence from which the Board could impute a discriminatory motive to the agency, she has not proven that the agency's action was intentional discrimination. Thus, we conclude that the appellant did not prove her affirmative defense of discrimination on the basis of race.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Morrison v. NASA</span>, 65 MSPR 348, 353-54 (1994), concluded that treatment of other employees was insufficient to establish discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim that the agency's penalty selection constituted disparate treatment based on racial discrimination constitutes an affirmative defense which, if proven, requires that the Board reverse the disciplinary action in its entirety. 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(B). To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of racial discrimination based on disparate treatment, an appellant must show that he is a member of a protected group, he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of his protected group, and he was treated more harshly or disparately than the individual who was not a member of his protected group. He must also show that the difference was based on an intent to discriminate. <span class="Italic">Mascarenas v. Department of Defense</span>, 54 MSPR 303, 308-09 (1992); <span class="Italic">Fenn v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 362, 366-67 (1987); <span class="Italic">see also Johnson v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 61 MSPR 601, 603-04 (1994). If the appellant comes forward with <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence of unlawful discrimination, the agency must produce evidence showing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the different treatment. <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 61 MSPR at 604; <span class="Italic">Fenn</span>, 35 MSPR at 367. The appellant then must prove that the agency's reason is merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 61 MSPR at 604; <span class="Italic">Fenn</span>, 35 MSPR at 367.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant, who is African-American, is a member of a protected group, but he has failed to show that he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of his protected group. In his cross petition for review, the appellant cites to a number of documents in the record that indicate that the agency has consistently imposed a penalty of a written reprimand to a 1-day suspension for the first offense of misuse of a government computer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The disciplinary actions relied on by the appellant do not involve employees similarly situated to him. None of the other employees worked in the same office as the appellant. In addition, the proposing and deciding officials in the appellant's disciplinary action were not involved in any of the disciplinary actions relied on by the appellant. Furthermore, only one of the incidents of misconduct by another employee cited by the appellant is even remotely comparable to the appellant's misconduct. In that incident, an employee downloaded onto a personally owned floppy disk sexually explicit programs from an authorized computer bulletin board and took the floppy disk home. There is no indication in the record that the employee displayed the material to another agency employee on an agency computer. The employee, who had 15 years of government service, received a letter of reprimand. We believe that the appellant's misconduct of maintaining numerous sexually explicit programs and computer games on his agency computer and showing those programs to other employees is more serious than the misconduct described above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, although the appellant is a member of a protected group, he has failed to show that he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of his protected group. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Golden v. United States Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 263, 274 (1994); <span class="Italic">Mascarenas</span>, 54 MSPR at 309. Accordingly, the appellant's affirmative defense of racial discrimination is without merit.</p>

DOD</span>, 66 MSPR 146, 152-53 (1995), demonstrated how difficult it can be for an appellant to prove discrimination through a comparison of the appellant's circumstances with those of other employees. <span class="Italic">Richard</span> imposed a "near identity" test of the appellant's and the comparable employees' employment situations to establish substantial similarity for EEO analysis, although the "near identity" test may have been relaxed by the Board's 2003 analysis in <span class="Italic">Spahn, supra,</span> focusing on the underlying misconduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a claim of prohibited employment discrimination through circumstantial evidence, an employee must first establish by preponderant evidence a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing that: (1) She is a member of a protected group; (2) she was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of her protected group; and (3) she was treated more harshly or disparately than the individual who was not a member of her protected group. <span class="Italic">See Mascarenas v. Department of Defense</span>, 54 MSPR 303, 308 (1992); <span class="Italic">Fenn v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 362, 366-67 (1987). The employee must also show that the difference in treatment was based upon an intent to discriminate. <span class="Italic">See Mascarenas</span>, 54 MSPR at 309; <span class="Italic">Fenn</span>, 35 MSPR at 366-67. If the employee succeeds in establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, the burden of going forward shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its different treatment of the appellant. <span class="Italic">Fenn</span>, 35 MSPR at 367. If the agency articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the different treatment, an appellant must be afforded the opportunity to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the proffered reasons were not the true reasons and were merely a pretext for discrimination based on prohibited factors. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant must show both that the stated reason was false, or not the real reason for the action, and that discrimination was the real reason for the action. <span class="Italic">Carter v. Small Business Administration</span>, 61 MSPR 656, 666 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993)).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, in order for comparative employees to be considered similarly situated, all relevant aspects of the appellant's employment situation must be nearly identical to those of the comparative employees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., O'Neal v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Decision No. 05910490 (July 23, 1991). Among other things, comparative employees must have engaged in conduct similar to the appellant's, without differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their misconduct or the appropriate discipline for it. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Here, the appellant has not shown either below or on review that all relevant aspects of her employment situation were nearly identical to those of the comparative employee. The record does not reveal why the proposed removal of the comparative employee was "not supported at the Washington level," or that the circumstances surrounding the comparative employee's situation were nearly identical to that of the appellant.</p>

USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 471, 476-77 (1997) (following <span class="Italic">Richard</span> ("[I]n order for comparative employees to be considered similarly situated, all relevant aspects of the appellant's employment situation must be nearly identical to those of the comparative employee.")); <span class="Italic">Newberry v.

<p class="Body-Text">The EEOC's decision in <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. USPS</span>, EEOC 05910490 (1991), identified factors to consider in determining if employees are similarly situated for comparison under the EEO laws: other comparative employees must have (1) reported to the same supervisor; (2) been subject to the same standards governing discipline; and (3) engaged in conduct similar to the appellant's, without differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their misconduct or the appropriate discipline for it. The Commission added a few other factors. To be comparably situated according to <span class="Italic">O'Neal</span>, the employees must also have (4) been on the same tour; (5) performed the same job function; and (6) been disciplined during roughly the same time period.<span class="Italic"> Heffernan v. DHHS,</span> 105 MSPR 41, 2007 MSPB 54 (2007), accepted an EEOC finding of religious discrimination. In one iteration of that case, <span class="Italic">Heffernan v. Leavitt,</span> EEOC 03A60015 (Feb. 21, 2006), the Commission rejected a strict analysis of comparable treatment of employees when there was some direct evidence of discrimination and some evidence of dissimilar treatment of two employees, both chaplains, as to imposition of training or certification requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sherman v. Runyon</span>, 235 F.3d 406, 409 (8th Cir. 2000) ("[N]either employee worked in the main postal facility...and neither employee was disciplined by the same supervisors[.] "); <span class="Italic">Redschlag v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to be considered similarly situated for purposes of a disparate treatment allegation of discrimination, however, all relevant aspects of the appellant's employment situation must be nearly identical to those of the comparison employees<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Finally, the appellant's claim that her supervisor discriminated against her lacks evidentiary support.

<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Deas v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 108 MSPR 637, 649-50 &#x00B6; 21, 2008 MSPB 101 (2008), showed some flexibility when the actual decisional level in an adverse action was at a higher level (and therefore offered a broader scope of comparators) than the level of decision shown on the adverse action decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we find that information relevant to the appellant's discrimination claim could include information regarding the agency's treatment of employees outside the appellant's work unit. Generally, in order to be considered similarly situated, comparators must be in the same work unit as the appellant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wentz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 176, &#x00B6; 22 (2002) (to be considered similarly situated, employees must be in the same work unit, must have the same supervisors, and the misconduct alleged must be substantially similar). However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has indicated a willingness to consider employees outside an appellant's work unit as similarly situated where the evidence establishes that a central office is responsible for the review and coordination of disciplinary and adverse actions against employees of different work units and the officials who execute the notices do not exercise a sufficient degree of autonomy in determining the disciplinary actions to be taken against the employees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lam v. Widnall,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03940023 (June 2, 1994). In this case, the appellant alleged that AOS-16 proposes and decides personnel actions for several work units, though the officials located at the various work units actually sign and deliver the triggering documents. <span class="Italic">[S]</span> <span class="Italic">ee Rosenberg v. Department of Transportation,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 130, &#x00B6; 22 (2007) (the deciding official is the one who makes the decision, not necessarily the one who executes the decision). If the appellant's allegations with respect to this issue are true, then the comparators the appellant may identify from other work units serviced by AOS-16 cannot be excluded as not similarly situated to the appellant based solely on the fact that they are not in the appellant's work unit. Thus, evidence regarding AOS-16's treatment of employees outside the appellant's work unit may be relevant to the appellant's race discrimination claim if the appellant can demonstrate that those employees were otherwise similarly situated to him.</p>
