<h2 class="h2s"><span id="Page_i"></span>PREFACE</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">A year and a little more have passed since the Board's quorum was restored. Then, Member Leavitt left the Board when his term concluded on February 28, 2023. We wish him well and commend his service as a Board member and earlier in Board leadership positions. Its quorum maintained, the Board continues to produce decisions. The restored Board started with a backlog (restyled "inventory") of some 3,500 PFRs, with a monthly influx of forty or fifty new PFRs. From March of 2022 to now, they have issued over a thousand nonprecedential and fifty precedential decisions. The rate of decline in the overall docket of old and new PFRs is slower than some might hope (those with pending cases), faster than some might wish (your author, writing about them). It will take another couple of years for the Board to return to what in years past would have passed as a normal docket of pending PFRs. Decisions are occasionally issued in batches: those affecting VA employees under 38 USC 714; multiple cases involving a particular appellant. Some nonprecedential decisions affirm in a couple of pages the result reached by the AJ--what once was styled a short form order. Some nonprecedential decisions are lengthy (often IRA appeals). Some nonprecedential decisions are graced with dissents. The analytical quality of factual and legal analysis appears the same in the nonprecedential and precedential issuances. The author disagrees with characterizing substantive decisions as nonprecedential, but no one appointed him to the Board. Lawyered cases seem to generate longer decisions than PFRs filed by <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants (40% or so of the decided cases)--lawyers tend to raise more issues. Some <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants prevail; plenty of lawyered appellants do not. Most appellants whose PFRs succeed will continue their appeals through remands.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Appointments Clause controversy, resolved by the Board when it resumed operations, was considered by the Federal Circuit, that court determining that AJs operate under administrative control by MSPB--their decisions subject to reopening through the PFR process or through the Board's authority to reopen its own decisions. Those controls, exercised through the politically-appointed Board members, provide the constitutional basis for AJs' delegated decisional authority. <span class="Italic">McIntosh v. DOD,</span> 53 F.4th 630 (Fed. Cir. 2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Several decisions slightly enhance civil service protection for adverse actions against VA employees under 38 USC 714--a statute providing for expedited adjudication and greater Board deference to adverse actions. <span class="Italic">Wilson v.</span> <span class="Italic">VA,</span> 2022 MSPB 7 (2022), allowed 30 days to appeal a mixed case (rather than the 10 days for a Board appeal of a nonmixed case under &#x00A7; 714). VA hybrid employees appointed under 38 USC 7401(3) are not subject to &#x00A7; 714 procedures. Their appeals are adjudicated under Chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Richardson v. VA,</span> 2023 MSPB 1 (2023).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board treatment of whistleblowers' appeals is mixed. To avoid adjudicating EEO-related claims through IRA processes, <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Labor,</span> 2022 MSPB 9 (2022), attempted to establish a bright-line test--if the disclosure and resultant reprisal relate to EEO issues, the remedy is through the EEO process, not an IRA appeal. Mr. Edwards alleged reprisal--reassignment-- after he protested to management discriminatory workplace management practices. His concerns were about treatment of others. The Board said his relief was through the EEO process. <span class="Italic">Edwards</span> is on appeal to the Federal Circuit. Stay tuned. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army,</span> 2022 MSPB 4 (2022), found reprisal when the appellant was not selected for a position following her disclosures to the media and to a congressional office--resulting in adverse publicity for DOD (Air Force) and known to the Army managers--concerning violations of DOD policies governing disposition of the remains of the appellant's husband, a servicemember killed in action in Iraq. <span class="Italic">Soto v. VA,</span> 2022 MSPB 6 (2022), affirmed whistleblower protection, with customary IRA burdens of proof, for reemployed annuitants (was there doubt?). And for those who are not federal employees when they make their disclosures, <span class="Italic">Abernathy v. Dept. of Army,</span> 2022 MSPB 37 (2022), involving a contractor employee who made a protected disclosure to, and was later was not selected by, the agency for a civil service position, offers some comfort, explaining that protections against reprisals by agencies are available to those who are neither employees nor applicants for employment when the disclosures are made (with subsequent adverse effect).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to whistleblowing motivational analysis, <span class="Italic">Wilson v. VA,</span> 2022 MSPB 7 (2022), reaffirmed that those responsible for the agency's overall performance may be motivated to retaliate if protected disclosures implicate them or their agency. Further, an agency's failure sufficiently to investigate a disciplinary charge could suggest an improper motive. For whistleblowers who assert their disclosures resulted in a marked deterioration in their workplace interactions, <span class="Italic">Skarada v. VA,</span> 2022 MSPB 17 (2022), tied IRA protection to personnel actions (defined at 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A)): "only agency actions that, individually or collectively, have practical and significant effects on the overall nature and quality of an employee's working conditions, duties, or responsibilities, and are likely to have a chilling effect on whistleblowing or otherwise undermine the merit system will be found to constitute a covered personnel action under section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii)." To be actionable, an alleged hostile environment must meet that test. A supervisor might act out against an employee, as in <span class="Italic">Skarada,</span> by yelling at or degrading him, without that being a covered "personnel action." Following the analysis of <span class="Italic">Skarada, Spivey v. DOJ,</span> 2022 MSPB 24 (2022), informs us that a notice to an employee that her responses to an investigation lacked candor, with no record of that notice in personnel records, and no warning as to future discipline, did not constitute a covered personnel action: "an allegation of wrongdoing alone, without any ensuing disciplinary or adverse action, or threat of disciplinary or adverse action, does not constitute a personnel action."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mohler v. DHS,</span> CH-1221-18-0119-W-2 (NP 7/18/22), instructs that while disclosures made after an action has been finalized cannot be a contributing factor to that decision, an action that was "contemplated and in preparation" before a disclosure can lead to a retaliatory final decision. The Board did not suggest how one proves or disproves that affirmation of a tentative decision is retaliatory; for Mr. Mohler, that will be assessed on remand. As to whistleblower comparator analysis, <span class="Italic">Rickel v. Dept. of Navy,</span> 31 F.4th 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2022), suggests that the burden is on the appellant to produce specific evidence of comparators who are not whistleblowers, while <span class="Italic">Carr</span> imposes no affirmative burden on the agency to produce evidence for that or other <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors. "The proper inquiry still remains whether the agency would have taken the same action, absent the whistleblowing."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Corrective action in an IRA appeal did not include extension of a term appointment, placement in a permanent position, or employment for time equaling the difference between the date of separation and the expiration of the term appointment. As to the argument that the appellant should have been appointed to a vacancy that was open after she separated, the Board determined the appellant was responsible for applying for the job; if she was not selected, she could initiate another IRA claim. <span class="Italic">Gharati v. Dept. of Army,</span> 2022 MSPB 16 (2022). For appellants whose IRA appeals challenge performance ratings, gradations count. Under <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Army,</span> DC-1221-21-0374-W-1 (NP 8/25/2022), though the overall rating may be outstanding, the appellant may challenge an undesirable rating in a single element. "[W]ere the appellant to apply for a promotion or for another position altogether, she could conceivably be competing against another candidate or candidates with an 'outstanding' rating in all elements and, therefore, be placed at a disadvantage." Acknowledging the paucity of whistleblower compensatory damages decisions, <span class="Italic">Guzman v. DHS,</span> SF-0752-15-0170-P-3 (NP 1/6/2023), expressed interest in following EEOC damages decisions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whistleblower appeals are complex, especially so when disclosures involve matters of specialized expertise. The Board credits those with specialized knowledge--the appellant and agency managers. <span class="Italic">Pridgen v. OMB,</span> 2022 MSPB 31 (2022), intoned "[a]lthough grant law and policy are highly complex, the test of whether a disclosure is protected is not whether the administrative judge understands every nuance of the law. Here, given the appellant's particular responsibilities as well as GAO's ongoing work on this specific law, it seems quite clear that those involved in making and receiving the disclosure well understood the law's requirements...."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A series of decisions, usually nonprecedential, usually IRA appeals, demonstrate the willingness of the repopulated Board to consider new evidence and new arguments at the PFR level when the evidence and argument implicate jurisdiction. Since jurisdiction in IRA appeals (and other appeals, e.g., constructive adverse actions) depends on well-pleaded facts, the result is that the Board provides <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of everything material presented in the record to the AJ below and to the Board above on jurisdictional questions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Having reviewed hundreds of Board (and Federal Circuit) whistleblower decisions, many requiring remands, to the author it seems the complexity of the law is causing so many difficulties for parties and AJs that the Board should issue a research paper summarizing the statutory principles and decisional nuances of whistleblower law, written for the common man or judge. It might be reasonable to add a succinct, understandable summary of the burdens of proof for each species of EEO and related reprisal affirmative defense--a topic so nuanced that that uniform application of law is predictably unpredictable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For appeals from awards of arbitrators on
 grievances challenging adverse or performance-based actions, a
 claim of discrimination--required for MSPB review-- must be squarely presented to the arbitrator. Unelaborated reference to discrimination in a brief to an arbitrator was insufficient to establish MSPB jurisdiction to review the award. <span class="Italic">Scanlin v. SSA,</span> 2022 MSPB 10 (2022). For arbitration awards taken to the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3438 v. SSA,</span> ____Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP), determined that a union lacked associational standing to seek Federal Circuit review of an award denying counsel fees to the union. (And the court's decision extends to any union effort to obtain, in the name of the union, review of an arbitrator's merits award in an adverse action or performance case.) Judge Reyna offered "additional views" suggesting the need for corrective legislation. The judge is right. Often the union prepares the grievance, only the union can invoke arbitration and, once invoked, it is generally union counsel that prosecutes the grievance to the issuance of an arbitrator's award. The grievant is a third-party beneficiary. Judicial review rights should not depend on whether a judicial appeal is initiated by counsel for the union or counsel for the grievant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_ii"></span>Speaking of grievances, given FLRA's limited or
 nonexistent role in reviewing matters otherwise appealable to
 MSPB, e.g., adverse actions, of significance from the Board is the determination that employees' representation of a union and bargaining unit members, and prosecution of their grievances may support an IRA appeal under 5 USC 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">Rizzo v. VA,</span> CH-0752-15-0104-I-2 (NP 8/5/2022). But if the IRA appeal involves the appellant's own appeal, complaint, or grievance, to be actionable as an IRA, that appeal, complaint, or grievance must disclose a traditional whistleblowing matter embraced by 5 US 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Johnson v. MSPB,</span> ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerning appeals of performance-based actions, readers will recall last year's Preface's mention of the Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Santos</span> decision, requiring proof that pre-PIP performance was unacceptable to sustain an action based on unacceptable PIP performance. MSPB followed <span class="Italic">Santos</span> in <span class="Italic">Lee v. VA,</span> 2022 MSPB 11 (2022), leading to a bunch of remands for AJs to get the facts and apply <span class="Italic">Santos.</span> And as to elections of remedies in performance-based appeals, <span class="Italic">Brookins v. Dept. of Interior,</span> 2023 MSPB 3 (2023), determined that a collective bargaining agreement does not bar an appeal of a WIGI denial when a prohibited personnel practice--not limited to discrimination--is alleged as an affirmative defense.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Turning to adverse actions, deciding that analysis of penalty comparability needed a substantial rewrite, the Board provided it in <span class="Italic">Singh v. USPS,</span> 2022 MSPB 15 (2022). Among the revisions wrought by <span class="Italic">Singh,</span> the relevant inquiry is whether the agency knowingly and unjustifiably treated employees differently. Comparability analysis is for the same types of offenses, not for offenses of comparable severity. Analysis is limited to those employees whose misconduct or other circumstances closely resemble the appellant's. Analysis does not extend to nationwide searches. There must be a close connection between the misconduct or some other factor for an employee from another work unit or supervisory chain to be a comparator. And while evaluation should include whether the appellant receives a penalty more severe than a comparator's, mitigation is not required. Disparity of penalties is but one <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor. Speaking of a different type of comparator analysis--in performance cases--EEO considerations may implicate the fairness of the opportunity period, <span class="Italic">Pridgen v. OMB,</span> 2022 MSPB 31 (2022): "We find that as an employee in the same position, assigned work by the same supervisor and subject to the same general standards governing performance, the appellant's coworker was similarly situated to the appellant for purposes of determining whether the tasks assigned to the appellant during the PIP period were the product of discrimination.. " And returning to adverse actions, conduct that is sexually tinged continues to receive rebuke. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Army,</span> 2022 MSPB 35 (2022), affirmed termination of a supervisory HR specialist for inappropriate remarks to female colleagues: "[W]e observe that an agency need not tolerate inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature until it becomes so pervasive and severe that it exposes the agency to liability under equal employment opportunity statutes."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">EEO issues receive continuing Board attention. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> DA-0752-21-0227-I-1 (NP 2/2/2023), sustained an attendance-related removal of a pharmacy technician. The employee's absence resulted from her religious objections to wearing a mask required by the agency for the safety of personnel at an agency medical facility. The employee's requested accommodations imposed an undue hardship on agency operations: she could not have performed her job through telework and she could not have performed her duties at the workplace without using a mask while meeting the clinic's safety and security requirements. <span class="Italic">Davis</span> included extensive analysis of religious discrimination and accommodation requirements. In the Board's continuing effort to explain burdens of proof in EEO cases--an endeavor ongoing since the early 1980s--<span class="Italic">Pridgen v. OMB,</span> 2022 MSPB 31 (2022), offered elaborate guidance, not to be repeated here (read the decision or check it out in this <span class="Italic">Guide).</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Haas v. DHS,</span> 2022 MSPB 36 (2022), clarified, modified, and synthesized decisions involving removals for inability to meet medical standards for positions. Under 5 CFR 339.206, an employee may not be removed from a position subject to medical standards "solely on the basis of medical history."The regulation allows an exception only if the condition itself is disqualifying, recurrence "is based on reasonable medical judgment," and the position's duties are such that a recurrence "would pose a significant risk of substantial harm to the health and safety of the...employee or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation or any other agency efforts to mitigate risk." For a charge of inability to perform that does not involve medical standards, when the removal is based on a current medical condition the agency must prove either a nexus between the employee's medical condition and observed deficiencies in his performance or conduct, or a high probability, given the nature of the work involved, that his condition may result in injury to himself or others. If an agency's request for medical information is overbroad and an action based on the failure to provide information is reversed, the agency may find that it violated the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Litton v. DOJ,</span> DC-0752-14-0791-I-1 (NP 10/11/2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Considering one of the few disciplinary cases pursued by OSC, <span class="Italic">Coffman v. OSC &#x0026; DHS,</span> 2022 MSPB 18 (2022), granted fees to the successful employee-respondent against the employer and not against OSC. The Board recognized that the employer did not institute or control the litigation. DHS paid for OSC's unsuccessful prosecution. Said the Board: "The adverse impact of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) [the fee shifting statute] on an agency with a small budget could be significant. However, the Board's role as an adjudicatory agency is not to set or debate policy, and Congress has spoken clearly on this issue."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although remedies under the Privacy Act are not precluded by the CSRA, if the challenge is to a negative notation on an SF-50 recording an employee's resignation pending a personnel investigation, 5 USC 3322 provides a (seldom-used) MSPB notational appeal right, and that right precludes use of the Privacy Act or Tort Claims Act to challenge the SF-50's contents. <span class="Italic">Manivannan v. Dept. of Energy,</span> 42 F.4th 163 (3rd Cir. 2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Compliance cases involving back pay and benefits can be complex, particularly when the employing agency uses a third-party payor, e.g., DFAS. Sustained efforts may be required by the Board to obtain proper accountings for pay and benefits. E.g., <span class="Italic">Cobia v. VA,</span> PH-0752-16-0283-X-1 (NP 1/6/2023) (requiring that VA: provide narrative statements and supporting documentation regarding pay, leave, TSP, insurance premiums, and notice concerning elections as to benefits restoration; document its efforts to obtain related information from DFAS; submit biweekly status reports (eighteen in all, stretching over about three years).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the regulatory front, 5 CFR 315.803, governing probationary appointments, was revised in 2022 to delete a regulatory requirement that agencies provide notice to supervisors of expiration dates of probationary periods. Regulatory restrictions on clean paper settlements were also removed by OPM. Of statutory changes, the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act of FY2023 included Section 5304, extending MSPB jurisdiction to FBI employees pursuing whistleblower reprisal allegations under 5 USC 2303, adding appeal rights at 5 USC 2303(d), and incorporating the processes of 5 USC 1221.</p>

<p class="Body-Text1">Order Denying <span class="Italic">Sua Sponte</span> Motion to Dismiss Under 11 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 707(b)<br/>This cause came on to be heard <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> upon the court's own motion to dismiss this chapter 7 petition pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 707(b) and the court having received the inspiration for the motion from a little old ebony bird and not from any party in interest or any other person and having considered the presumption in favor of debtor provided in 11 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 707(b) and not deeming it appropriate to take evidence, the court finds:</p>
<p class="Body-Text1">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary<br/>Over many quaint and curious files of chapter seven lore<br/>While I nodded nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping<br/>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door,<br/>"Tis some debtor" I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door --<br/>Only this and nothing more."</p>
<p class="Body-Text1">Ah distinctly I recall, it was in the early fall<br/>And the file still was small<br/>If someone tried to substantially abuse it<br/>No party asked that it be heard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text1"><span class="Italic">"Sua sponte"</span> whispered a small black bird.<br/>The bird himself, my only maven,<br/>Strongly looked to be a raven.<br/>Upon the words the bird had uttered<br/>I gazed at all the files cluttered</p>
<p class="Body-Text1">"Sua <span class="Italic">sponte"</span> I recall, had no meaning; none at all.<br/>And the cluttered files sprawl, drove a thought into my brain.<br/>Eagerly I wished the morrow--vainly I had sought to borrow<br/>From BAFJA, surcease of sorrow--and an order quick and plain<br/>That this case would not remain as a source of further pain.<br/>The procedure, it seemed plain.</p>
<p class="Body-Text1">As the case grew older, I perceived I must be
 bolder.<br/>And must <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> act,
 to determine every fact,<br/>If primarily consumer debts, are faced,<br/><span id="Page_iii"></span>Perhaps this case is wrongly placed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text1">This is a thought that I must face, perhaps I should dismiss this case.<br/>I moved <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> to dismiss it for I knew I would not miss it.<br/>The Code said I could, I knew it.<br/>But not exactly how to do it, or perhaps some day I'd rue it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text1">I leaped up and struck my gavel.<br/>For the mystery to unravel<br/>Could I? Should I? <span class="Italic">Sua sponte,</span> grant my motion to dismiss?<br/>While it seemed the thing to do, suddenly I thought of this.</p>
<p class="Body-Text1">Looking, looking towards the future and to what there was to see<br/>If my motion, it was granted and an appeal came to be,<br/>Who would be the appellee? Surely, it would not be me.<br/>Who would file, but pray tell me, a learned brief for the appellee?</p>
<p class="Body-Text1">The District Judge would not do so<br/>At least this much I do know.<br/>Tell me raven, how to go.</p>
<p class="Body-Text1">As I with the ruling wrestled<br/>In the statute I saw nestled<br/>A presumption with a flavor clearly in the debtor's favor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text1">No evidence had I taken<br/><span class="Italic">Sua sponte</span> appeared foresaken.<br/>Now my motion caused me terror<br/>A dismissal would be error.</p>
