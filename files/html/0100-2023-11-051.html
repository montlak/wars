<section>
<h2 class="h2" id="sec3-52"><span class="space">V.</span> RIGHT TO INFORMATION</h2>
<p class="noindent">Assuming that the union has its financial base secured through dues, and that it has an allocation of official time to negotiate and to represent, it needs information pertaining to employment conditions to fulfill its statutory representational mandate. The Statute provides that right to the exclusive representative. The statutory right may be expanded, limited, or controlled through contract.</p>
<p class="noindent">We start with the statutory entitlement. 5 USC 7114(b) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The duty of an agency and an exclusive representative to negotiate in good faith under subsection (a) of this section shall include the obligation--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;in the case of an agency, to furnish to the exclusive representative involved, or its authorized representative, upon request and, to the extent not prohibited by law, data--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(A)&#x2003;which is normally maintained by the agency in the regular course of business;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(B)&#x2003;which is reasonably available and necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of bargaining; and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(C)&#x2003;which does not constitute guidance, advice, counsel, or training provided for management officials or supervisors, relating to collective bargaining[.]</p>
<p class="noindent">The obligation to provide information assumes that there is a collective bargaining relationship; without a duty to bargain with the union over the conditions of employment, the employer has no obligation under 7114(b)(4) to provide the union with information concerning conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE</span>, 34 FLRA 182, 188 (1990). If the unit members cannot engage in collective bargaining, then there is no right to pursue information requests, according to <span class="Italic">VA v. FLRA</span>, 1 F.3d 19, 22-23 (D.C. Cir. 1993), a decision with significant implications involving Title 38 professional employees of the VA who were (when the information request was generated) without collective bargaining rights, but who still had some protection under the FSLMRS:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA, supported by the Union as intervenor, maintains that the right to information secured by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) may be grounded on the full range of a union's representational activities, and is not confined to the negotiation and enforcement of collective bargaining agreements. This assertion, we conclude, is incompatible with a statutory text that first ties information release to "[t]he duty of an agency and an exclusive representative <span class="Italic">to negotiate in good faith</span>," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b) (emphasis added), and then delineates, precisely, what information shall be disclosed: "data...necessary for...discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects <span class="Italic">within the scope of collective bargaining</span>." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Attempting to accommodate its construction to the language of section 7114(b)(4)(B), the FLRA urges that "subjects within the scope of collective bargaining" means all subjects within the statutory definition of "collective bargaining," even if no collective bargaining is mandated, and no collectively-bargained agreement exists, in the particular case. "[C]ollective bargaining," the Authority points out, is defined as the "mutual obligation" of employer and union to bargain on "conditions of employment," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12), and "conditions of employment" encompass "personnel policies, practices, and matters...affecting working conditions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14). Section 7103(a)(14), however, continues: "except that [conditions of employment] does not include policies, practices, and matters...specifically provided for by Federal statute." Title 38 is such an overriding statute, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span>, 851 F.2d at 1492, one that, until 1991, left no room for the collective bargaining commanded by the FSLMRS.</p>
<p class="noindent">Assuming the existence of a collective bargaining relationship, a union has a right to the information solely within an employer's possession that is necessary and relevant to the union's representational responsibilities. The entitlement to information extends to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance and complaint representation--the full range of the union's statutory and contractual authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">The decisions that follow suggest that, at the onset, the union is responsible for articulating and explaining its interests in disclosure of the information. This duty is generally referred to as a demonstration of a particularized need for the requested information. Satisfying that burden requires more than a conclusory or bare assertion. A request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether information must be disclosed under the Statute. Similarly, an agency may not satisfy its burden by making conclusory or bare assertions; its burden extends beyond simply saying "no." The parties are expected to communicate with and respond to each other when the initial information requests and responses are made. The parties may not add reasons for their actions for the first time at the ULP hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The range of information that should be provided to a union that demonstrates <span id="Page_291"></span>a particularized need for it (a matter later discussed) was described in <span class="Italic">FAA and NATCA</span>, 55 FLRA 254, 258-61 (1999), involving a request for information that the union sought to permit it to administer seniority provisions that it controlled through its contract with the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">A.&#x2003; The Duty to Furnish Information within the "Scope of Collective Bargaining" under Section 7114(b)(4)(B) of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arguments presented here by the Respondent in support of this exception, as to why existing case law is not dispositive but, rather, should be reversed, are not persuasive. It is a longstanding principle that the scope of the information entitlement under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute extends to the full range of representational activity, not just the context of pending negotiations between labor and management. <span class="Italic">See Local 1345,</span> 793 F.2d at 1363, wherein the court held that this right to information "applies not only to information needed to negotiate an agreement, but also to data relevant to its administration," and that this meant the "full <span class="Italic">range of</span> union responsibilities." (emphasis in original). In so holding, the court also held that this broad duty to provide information was "part and parcel of the fundamental duty to bargain<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The circuit court cited <span class="Italic">NLRB v.</span> <span class="Italic">Acme Industrial Co., </span>385 U.S. 432, 435-36 (1967) and <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Truitt Manufacturing Co., </span>351 U.S. 149, 153 (1956). In doing so, the court acknowledged the longstanding private sector law which requires employers to give unions access to information in connection with contract administration, and not just contract negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This same broad range of union information entitlements was also true under Executive Order 11491, as amended, which preceded section 7114(b)(4). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span> <span class="Italic">and Portsmouth Federal Employees Metal Trades</span> <span class="Italic">Council, </span>4 FLRA 619, 624 (1980); <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Health Education and Welfare, Social Security Administration, Kansas City Payment Center and Social Security Local 1336, American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, AFL-CIO, </span>A/SLMR 467, 472 (1974). Congress indicated that it expected continuity of administration from the Executive Order to the Statute, providing that policies established under the Executive Order would remain in effect "unless superceded by specific provision of this chapter or by regulations or decisions issued pursuant to this chapter." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7135(b). Given the <span class="Italic">Local 1345 </span>court's statement that the duty to supply information is part and parcel of the fundamental duty to bargain, it is worth noting that the stated duty to bargain under the Executive Order and the Statute is virtually identical. <span class="Italic">Compare </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a) <span class="Italic">with</span> Executive Order 11491, section 10(a). In interpreting the Statute, we agree with our concurring colleague, who quotes Justice Ginsberg's observation that it is doubtful that Congress would have denied "unions information their private sector counterparts routinely receive."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The breadth of the information entitlement flowing from section 7114(b)(4), and that it extends beyond just those situations involving actual negotiations, continues to be affirmed time and again. <span class="Italic">See Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Northern</span> <span class="Italic">Region, Twin Cities, Minnesota v. FLRA, </span>144 F.3d 90, 93 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (union may request information under the Statute "by articulating a particularized need for the information in terms of fulfilling its representational duties and overseeing the administration of the collective bargaining agreement"); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2343 v. FLRA,</span> 144 F.3d 85, 88-89 (D.C. Cir. 1998) <span class="Italic">(AFGE Local</span> <span class="Italic">2343) </span>(union must articulate connection between uses to which requested information will be put and union's representational responsibilities under the Statute). This broad interpretation of an agency's duty has been applied in a variety of contexts. In <span class="Italic">NLRB II, </span>for example, the D.C. Circuit held that an agency's duties under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute apply to contract administration as well as contract negotiations. 952 F.2d at 526.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are mindful that the meaning of an individual section of a statute is determined in reference to the entire statutory scheme.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Division of Military and Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs, (New York National Guard), Latham, New York,</span> 53 FLRA 111, 118 (1997) (citing Sutherland, Statute. Const. &#x00A7; 46.05 5th Ed.). However, requiring the Respondent to furnish the disputed information here does not entail any deviation from the statutory definition of collective bargaining. "Collective bargaining" has the same meaning in section 7114(b)(4)(B) as that which is set forth in section 7103(a)(12). The determination of seniority policy clearly relates to a condition of employment. Thus, the matter falls within the scope of collective bargaining, as evidenced by the Agreement that the Respondent itself negotiated with the Union here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the Respondent contends that the Union may only make information requests in the context of negotiations, our inquiry necessarily turns to the uses that the Union intends to make of the information it has requested. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 2343, </span>144 F.3d at 88-89. It is here that the Respondent's argument proves to be unconvincing. The plain language of section 7114(b)(4)(B) of the Statute calls upon agencies to furnish unions with data that is "necessary for full and proper <span class="Italic">discussion, understanding, </span>and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining (emphasis added)." While here, the Union is not seeking information to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement, the information sought is nevertheless necessary for "full and proper discussion [and] understanding" of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining, namely, the determination of seniority policy and the administration of the Agreement itself. Nothing in section 7114(b)(4)(B) requires that a union prove "the existence or requirement of negotiations," in the present tense, to obtain information within the scope of collective bargaining. The Respondent's own citation to Sutherland's <span class="Italic">Statutory</span> <span class="Italic">Construction </span>(at 21.14), when read more fully, discounts any attempt at arguing for a conjunctive reading of this portion of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, as a practical matter, accepting the Respondent's narrow construction of its duty to furnish information would effectively strip exclusive representatives of the ability to obtain information that they need to adequately represent their membership and discharge their responsibilities under the Statute. It would be internally inconsistent for the Statute to permit agencies to negotiate an agreement that cedes to a union the right to determine seniority policy for the bargaining unit, and then not also require agencies to furnish the union with information necessary for an understanding of the subject matter so that the union may carry out its obligations under that agreement. The Respondent's interpretation of its statutory duty would create other anomalies as well. For example, section 7121(a) of the Statute requires parties to include an arbitration provision in their negotiated agreement, yet the Respondent's construction of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute would deprive the exclusive representative of the means to determine whether to submit a grievance to arbitration. For these reasons, we reaffirm that an agency's duties under section 7114(b)(4)(B) apply to all aspects of a union's "representational responsibilities" under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">B.&#x2003; The Judge Correctly Determined that the Union's Showing of Particularized Need Outweighed the Respondent's Countervailing Interests in Non-Disclosure of the Requested Information</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence shows that any countervailing interests presented by the Respondent are insufficient to outweigh the Union's particularized need for the information sought. As noted by the General Counsel, the Respondent did not question the validity of the Union's seniority policy at the time that it denied the information requests. An agency must articulate its interest in non-disclosure at the time that it denies a union's request for information. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Northern Region, Twin Cities, Minnesota</span>, 51 FLRA 1467, 1473 (1996), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied, </span>52 FLRA 1323 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd, </span>144 F.3d 90 (1998); <span class="Italic">IRS-Kansas City,</span> 50 FLRA at 670. The record indicates that the Respondent failed to articulate its interests to the Union in this manner. Thus, the Respondent's expression of countervailing interests for the first time at the unfair labor practice hearing does not absolve the Respondent of its obligations under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even if such countervailing interests are considered, they must be rejected. Thus, the Respondent would not have been exposing itself to joint and several liability by complying with the Union's request for information. In <span class="Italic">Wolf Trap</span> [287 NLRB 1040 (1988)], the union's hiring hall discriminated on its face; thus, the employer's acquiescence to the hiring hall implicated the employer. Here, the charges against the Union in the related unfair labor practice case stem from the Union's decision to use a questionable forum to determine a facially neutral seniority policy. The record does not show that the Union's decision to use its convention to vote on the policy is something that the Respondent contemplated or sanctioned. Thus, the Respondent would not have been liable for providing the requested information. Nothing prevented the Respondent from complying with its duty under the Statute to provide the requested information unless and until the underlying seniority policy was invalidated. As noted in <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping I,</span> 21 FLRA at 606, the fact that an agency and a union are engaged in an ongoing dispute that touches upon the information sought does not negate an agency's obligation to provide the requested information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's attempt to distinguish this case from <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping I </span>is flawed. To be sure, there are circumstances in which the necessity of the information sought by an exclusive representative may be called into question. In <span class="Italic">IRS-National Office</span> [21 FLRA 646 (1986)], for example, the Authority noted that in circumstances wherein an underlying grievance is not cognizable under law, an agency would be relieved of its duty to produce information<span class="Italic">. Id. </span>at 649, n.3. Here, the subject matter of the Union's request (seniority) unquestionably falls within the ambit of "collective bargaining" under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent bases its refusal to furnish the requested information not upon the nature of the information sought, but rather upon the "propriety" of the request in light of the dispute surrounding the Union's seniority policy. The Respondent's assertions that the Union's seniority policy is "contractually barred" and "contrary to the express terms of the collective bargaining agreement" ignore the fact that an arbitrator found the Union's seniority policy to be consistent with the Agreement.<span class="Italic"> See </span>n.1 <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Indeed, the Respondent concedes that if its underlying grievance <span id="Page_292"></span>challenging the Union's seniority policy is ultimately rejected, the prior failure to provide the disputed information would constitute an unfair labor practice. Furthermore, even if the instant seniority policy were to be invalidated, the Union still possesses the right to determine seniority policy under the Agreement. Accordingly, the Union would have the same particularized need to the information in question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the Respondent has not excepted to the Judge's finding that the Union has established a particularized need for the requested information, and since the Respondent has failed to demonstrate a countervailing interest that would outweigh the Union's particularized need, the Judge's determination on this point was proper.</p>
<p class="noindent">The union's right extends to information necessary to process a pending grievance and to information necessary to determine whether to file a grievance at all. <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 3314</span>, 28 FLRA 260, 265 (1987); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Portsmouth FEMTC</span>, 4 FLRA 619, 624 (1980) (ALJ Decision) ("It is well settled...that a union has a right to information solely within an employer's possession which is necessary and relevant to the union's representational responsibilities. Such right extends not only to information necessary to process a pending grievance but also to information necessary to determine whether nor [sic] not to file a grievance in the first instance."). The timing of the request does not appear to be critical; information may be requested as the union prepares for the arbitration of a grievance. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA, New England Region and NAATS</span>, 38 FLRA 1623, 1629 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA Local 171</span>, 57 FLRA 604, 606-07 (2001) (agency failed to provide information requested by union to prepare for arbitration; not reaching issue of whether agency was required to provide union with information acquired after agency responded to union's information request).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an agency is required to furnish information to a union under &#x00A7; 7114(b), it must do so without charge. <span class="Italic">VARO, Denver and AFGE Local 1557</span>, 10 FLRA 453, 457-58 (1982). The information may be requested in the form of documents or answers to specific questions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 3314</span>, 28 FLRA 260, 265 (1987). It is immaterial that the information could be obtained by the union directly from the employees. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1655 and DOD, Dept. of Military Affairs, Springfield</span>, 39 FLRA 1087, 1098 (1991). The right to information is quite specific for purposes of the labor relations responsibilities of the parties. This right exists under &#x00A7; 7114 of the Statute. A failure to comply with the Freedom of Information Act does not constitute a ULP. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Field Assessment Office and AFGE</span>, 12 FLRA 390, 405 (1983) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">The statutory right to information is for the benefit of the union; the statute does not extend to proposals requiring disclosure of information by the agency to its employees. <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 39 FLRA 783, 813 (1991) (Proposal 12). But the union may expand its right to information through its contract. The union also may contractually restrict its right to obtain information. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Portsmouth FEMTC</span>, 4 FLRA 619, 624-25 (1980) (ALJ Decision). The analysis of information rights under the statute and under negotiability case law is distinct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 39 FLRA 783, 813 (1991) (Proposal 12); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">DHS ICE and AFGE Nat'l Council 118</span>, 67 FLRA 711, 713 (2014) ("Although the Agency contends that Article 9 should be read to include the particularized need requirements of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4), that provision makes no mention of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4), either explicitly or by mirroring its language. Thus, the issue of whether the parties complied with Article 9 was a matter of contract interpretation for the Arbitrator. As a result, the cases cited by the Agency--all of which involve the application of the particularized need standard under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)--are inapposite, and the Agency's exception fails to provide a basis for finding the award deficient.").</p>
<p class="noindent">If management's denial of information is challenged in a ULP case, it may not be until the ALJ employs <span class="Italic">in camera</span> inspection that the issue of relevance is resolved. The time spent litigating cases involving information requests is considerable, and the results are not indicative of constructive collective bargaining. The problem was noted in the case reports: FLRA affirmed the dismissal of a ULP complaint charging that management failed to provide a document concerning search procedures at installation gates. The agency denied the document as "intra-management," but the dismissal appeared to be based on a finding that the information sought by the union, concerning entitlement to a union representative and the time allowed for an employee to obtain a steward when stopped for a search, was not in the document. <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow and AFGE Local 1482</span>, 14 FLRA 772, 773, 780 (1984) (ALJ Decision). The ALJ criticized the agency for its zeal in withholding the material, stating that much time, money, and effort to defend the case could have been saved by making a good faith effort to inform the union that the information it sought was not contained in the directive or advising the union of the information contained in the document. As to the defense that the documentation was "intra-management," the ALJ said that it might well be that some intra-management communication might be necessary and relevant to policing an agreement and therefore within the entitlement of the union. But on <span class="Italic">in camera</span> review, the ALJ determined that the document was not relevant to bargaining or any representational need of the union.</p>
<p class="noindent">The discussion that follows includes some negotiability determinations. Negotiations may expand on or regulate the union's statutory entitlement to information. The significance of negotiations concerning informational disclosure was stressed in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapters 243 and 245 and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 45 FLRA 270, 275-76 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2 requires the Agency to provide supervisory training manuals concerning drug testing to "each bargaining unit," if such manuals are different from the drug testing manuals given to unit employees. The Union states that the proposal is intended to require the Agency "to provide the Union a copy" of the manual so that the Union "can ensure that supervisors implement the drug testing plan properly."...&#8197;Based on the wording of Proposal 2 and the Union's statement of intent, which is consistent with the wording of the proposal, we interpret the proposal as requiring the Agency to provide each unit a copy of such a supervisory manual, if that manual is different from manuals given to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's only contention concerning Proposal 2 is that the proposal is nonnegotiable because the release of the information sought by the proposal is precluded by section 7114(b)(4)(C) of the Statute. We reject this contention. In negotiability cases involving proposals that require an agency to release information to a union, the "issue is not what information the Union is entitled to by law, but, rather, what it may bargain for." <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Association and Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 39 FLRA 783, 815 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office</span>). Moreover, as the Authority has consistently held, the entitlement to information under section 7114(b)(4) is a "statutory floor and not a ceiling." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of Energy</span>, 22 FLRA 131, 134 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Department of Energy</span>). Nothing in that section of the Statute prohibits a union from negotiating a right to information over and above the statutory entitlement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing Authority precedent, we find that section 7114(b)(4)(C) does not prohibit the disclosure by an agency to a union of information that constitutes guidance, advice, counsel, or training provided for management officials or supervisors relating to collective bargaining. Rather, section 7114(b)(4)(C) constitutes a limit on the information which an agency is required to provide a union under the Statute. We find, therefore, that section 7114(b)(4)(C) does not preclude the negotiation of proposals that would provide for the disclosure of information that constitutes guidance, advice, counsel, or training provided for management officials or supervisors relating to collective bargaining. Consequently, to the extent that the Authority's decision as to Provision 1 in <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1979 and U.S. Forest Service, San Dimas Equipment Development Center</span>, 16 FLRA 369 (1984), is inconsistent with the decision herein, we will no longer follow that decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the union seeks to use a contract to expand its statutory right to information, the proposal will be negotiable if the disclosure provision concerns working conditions. Then information requests will not be measured according to the case-by-case analysis method under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Energy</span>, 22 FLRA 131, 184 (1986). <span class="Italic">United Am. Nurses and VA Healthcare Network 5</span>, 64 FLRA 879, 881-82 (2010), noted of a proposal that the union president have access to electronic scheduling information concerning unit employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency further argues that the proposal is nonnegotiable because the information sought by paragraph 2 of the proposal is not normally maintained in the regular course of business or reasonably available within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4). The Unions do not dispute the Agency's claim that the proposal would entitle the Unions to information greater than that to which they would be entitled under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4). Nevertheless, the Agency's position is inconsistent with Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In negotiability cases involving proposals that require an agency to release information to a union, the "issue is not what information the Union is entitled to by law, but, rather, what it may bargain for." <span class="Italic">Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n</span>, 39 FLRA 783, 815 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Patent Office</span>). The Authority has held that the language of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) represents a legal minimum that would exist notwithstanding the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, <span class="Italic">Chapters 243 &#x0026; 245</span>, 45 FLRA 270, 276 (1992). In other words, the entitlement to information under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) is a "statutory floor and not a ceiling." <span class="Italic">Patent Office</span>, 39 FLRA at 815. Nothing in that section of the Statute prohibits a union from negotiating a right to information over and above the statutory entitlement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">If a contract grievance challenges a denial of information under a contract provision, FLRA reviews the ensuing arbitration award to determine if it failed to draw its essence from the contract or was contrary to law.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Bremerton MTC and Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-203.html">71 FLRA 1033</a> (2020).

<p class="noindent">As a result of the provisions of the Privacy Act, limiting availability of information that is of a personal nature, FLRA tends to reject broad contract provisions as nonnegotiable; FLRA appears to prefer to adjudicate requests for personal information on a case-by-case basis through ULP proceedings following specific refusals by agencies to honor specific information requests by unions under &#x00A7; 7114.
