<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 635, 641 (1991), the Board avoids reading into a settlement a term, e.g., back pay entitlement, that might by implication be read into another term explicitly stated in the agreement, e.g., cancelation of a suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ricketts v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 257, 260 &#x00B6; 6 (2003) ("The Board will not imply a term into an agreement that is unambiguous."); <span class="Italic">Abney v. Dept. of Army</span>, CH-0351-13-1386-C-2 (NP 9/9/2016) ("When an agreement's words and meaning are unambiguous, its terms are not subject to variation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Slattery v. Department of Justice</span>, 590 F.3d 1345, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The fact that an agreement is silent as to a term does not mean it is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">De Luna v. Department of the Navy</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 526, 530 (1993)....As such, the administrative judge correctly found that the agency's placement of the appellant in an Explosives and Material Handler, WG-6502, step 5 position in the Industrial Services Division complied with the terms of the settlement agreement and declined to imply a term into the settlement agreement based on the appellant's assertion that the parties had previously discussed placing him in the Maintenance Division."); <span class="Italic">Corsiglia v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 65, 69 (1996) ("We see no basis for reading such statements into the parties' agreement, which was signed two and a half years earlier and is entirely silent concerning subsequent salary increases."). But a settlement will be interpreted to include necessary statutory and regulatory requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Day v. OPM</span>, DA-0841-15-0596-C-1 (NP 11/21/2016) ("[i]t is presumed that the parties are aware of the applicable retirement statutes and regulations and intend to incorporate them. <span class="Italic">Young v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 39 n.4 (2010)"); <span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 609, 626 n.4, 2010 MSPB 92 (2010) ("It is a well-settled principle in contract law, however, that because parties are presumed to be aware of applicable statutes and regulations and intend to incorporate them, the law existing at the time a contract is executed becomes a part of the contemporaneous circumstances of the contract's execution and is incorporated, without reference, into the agreement itself."); <span class="Italic">Morris v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 358, 361 (1987) ("The agency agreed in the settlement agreement to award appellant full back pay and all benefits. It can be presumed that the agency intended that the agreement be implemented in accordance with its internal regulations. In general, 'full back pay' and 'all benefits' is understood to mean that these benefits will be awarded consistent with governing statutes or regulations."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">United States v. Winstar Corp</span>., 518 U.S. 839, 869 n.15 (1996) ("But few contract cases would be in court if contract language had articulated the parties' post breach provisions as clearly as might have been done, and the failure to specify remedies in the contract is no reason to find that the parties intended no remedy at all."). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-222.html#sec16-221">Agreement to 'Cancel' Action; Back Pay, Interest, Damages, or Other Entitlement; Bonus or Award; Lump Sum Provision."</a>]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The need to be precise in defining settlement provisions was emphasized, <span class="Italic">Beard v. DOD</span>, 57 MSPR 355, 357-58 (1993) (directing a specific placement remedy):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract and the interpretation of its terms is a question of law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dati v. Department of the Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 397, 400 (1989). In construing the terms of a settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance to determine the intent of the parties at the time that they contracted. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a recent case, <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 635 (1991), we held that a right that is ordinarily available to an employee who has prevailed before the Board is not implied by a settlement agreement. The parties had entered into a last chance settlement agreement in which a removal action was cancelled. Generally under the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596(b)(1), an agency is required to return the employee as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> when a personnel action is cancelled, and the Board is authorized to award back pay and benefits after there has been a finding that the personnel action was unjustified or unwarranted. There was no such finding in that case, and there was no mention in the settlement agreement of any entitlement to back pay or benefits. We held that in compliance appeals that are filed after <span class="Italic">Kelley</span>, we will reject the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> analysis of settlement agreement provisions and construe the terms of the agreement by examining what is written within the four corners of the settlement agreement to determine the intent of the parties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 642. Because the Board announced the rule in <span class="Italic">Kelley</span> prospectively, it found that fairness to the parties required a remand to permit the parties to inform the Board what they intended the disputed term to mean.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement in this case provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The parties agree that under the provisions of 5 CFR Part 353 Appellant's restoration rights attached on March 6, 1990. The parties agree that Appellant is entitled to placement on the Department of Defense Reemployment Priority List and to priority consideration for any temporary or permanent WG-2 Laborer, or equivalent, position in existence after that date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the parties specifically cited the applicable regulations on the issue of entitlement to restoration. While they did not agree to "make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee in his former or equivalent position within such department or agency, or within any other department or agency," as 5 USC 8151(b)(2) provides, and they did not define the word "equivalent," the agreement makes clear that the appellant's entitlement is based on the regulations at 5 CFR Part 353. Therefore, we do not believe a remand is necessary in this case to determine the parties' intent because the definition of the term "equivalent" can be determined by resort to case law under Part 353.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fowler v. USPS</span>, 103 MSPR 80, 85-86 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16, 2006 MSPB 239 (2006), noted of another dispute concerning entitlement to a position under a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The interpretation of the parties' intent at the time of contracting is determined, most importantly, by the words of the agreement itself. <span class="Italic">See Kelley v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 635, 641 (1991). In other words, the four corners of the agreement itself shall be examined to determine the parties' intent. <span class="Italic">See Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 560. Parol evidence may only be considered if the terms in the settlement agreement are ambiguous. The Board will not imply a term into an agreement that is unambiguous. <span class="Italic">See Kelley</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 641.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The words of paragraph 3 of the settlement agreement are unambiguous and clear, and are not susceptible to different meanings. That paragraph expressly gives the appellant, and not the agency, the choice to pick her position in her prior supervisory level (EAS-17) through the use of the words <span class="Italic">"[</span>a<span class="Italic">]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ppellant</span> will identify a vacant funded supervisory position <span class="Italic">she wishes</span> to fill<span class="Italic">,</span> and inform the human resources manager...of <span class="Italic">her choice.</span>" (Emphasis supplied). Indeed, contrary to the agency's position that the parties could not have intended that the appellant select a supervisory position in maintenance operations where she had no experience, the paragraph appears to provide for that very circumstance by stating that the appellant would receive training if she chooses a position requiring additional training. We thus agree with the administrative judge's finding that the settlement agreement's silence with respect to the particular positions available to the appellant does not render the agreement ambiguous because the agreement specifically directed the appellant's repromotion to be her choice of supervisory jobs within her prior supervisory level (EAS-17). <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 594, 599 (1998). The agency's contention that the appellant's choice should be limited to specific jobs was not mentioned in the agreement, and the Board cannot unilaterally modify the agreement's material terms to limit the appellant's choice of jobs available to her. <span class="Italic">Cf. De Luna v. Department of the Navy</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 526, 530 (1993) (when a contract is silent as to a term, the term is removed from the Board's jurisdiction and the Board lacks the authority to unilaterally modify the material terms in a settlement agreement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Brown v. GSA</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP) (determining the meaning of what an agency had to do to "initiate" a payment of back pay: "We agree with GSA and hold that the Board did not err in reading the term ‘initiate' in the Settlement Agreement to mean ‘taking steps to initiate payment.' The normal meaning of initiate is to begin, not to complete."; dissent by Judge Chen: "initiation of payment must mean initiation of the transfer, not, as the majority holds, initiation of internal and preliminary steps, like, say, opening up a file, which may be necessary to eventually effectuate a transfer").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will not imply terms that the parties might have included had they considered the possible scope of their agreement. One settlement called for issuance of a letter of admonishment, but the terms of the letter were not specified. The appellant, unhappy with the letter he received, sought relief through enforcement. On review, the Federal Circuit announced that "[b]ecause the settlement agreement did not specify the contents of the letter, the Board did not abuse its discretion in deciding that the letter did not violate the settlement agreement and was not unreasonable." <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 91-3500). <span class="Italic">Kinney v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 30 MSPR 170, 172-73 (1986), determined that an agreement to amend an appraisal did not require the agency to replace the appraisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the performance appraisal, appellant contends that the agency's action of crossing out the contested portions, principally the summary rating of "marginally meets standard," and checking the agreed-upon rating of "meets standard," does not comply with the terms of the settlement agreement. Appellant suggests that the agency must destroy the old appraisal and issue him a new one which reflects a fully satisfactory rating. However, the settlement agreement only required the agency to "amend" appellant's old performance appraisal. We find that the agency did precisely what it was required to do, and that it did comply with that portion of the settlement agreement.</p>

The appellant, however, has not explained why this type of correction is impermissible or constitutes a breach of the agreement, much less a material breach of the agreement."). <span class="Italic">But cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 517, 519-20 (1990) (agency was required to correct its records following the reversal of adverse action: altering written versions of the computerized record did not constitute purging record; white-out did not completely conceal references to demotion).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 108 MSPR 502, 505-09 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-16, 2008 MSPB 83 (2008), decided that a settlement agreement that resolved an appeal was sufficiently ambiguous that it could not be determined without parol evidence whether the intent of the agreement was to waive a future appeal to the Board, when the agency insisted that the agreement was meant to preclude an appeal from removal of the appellant, the agreement did not reference a removal, and the agreement contained an integration or "zipper" clause. The effect of the decision appeared to be to supply an omitted term into an agreement that, by its terms, was supposed to be complete and final:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that the AJ's decision to reverse the appellant's removal was based solely on her erroneous interpretation of the June 14, 1999 settlement agreement. It contends that she ignored the express language and intent of the agreement, as well as the parties' subsequent actions in applying its terms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">As a final and complete settlement of the subject grievance, the following resolution has been arrived at between the parties</span>: The grievant shall be allowed ten (10) calendar days to clear through the medical unit, including a fitness for duty exam if necessary, and be found fit for full duty, as a Mail Handler, with no restrictions. If he does not clear, or is found not fit for full duty, as a Mailhandler, the grievance will be considered closed. In addition, this case will be considered closed if, upon notification of being found fit for full duty with no restriction the grievant fails to report immediately. The parties agree that should the grievant be unable to clear the medical unit, he has the right under the provisions of the ELM to apply for a disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">The above resolution constitutes a full and final settlement of the subject grievance and resolves all issues pertaining thereto.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement was signed by agency designee Labor Relations Manager Glenn E. Lee and union designee James K. Gettys.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, the interpretation of which is a matter of law. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The words of the agreement are of paramount importance in determining the parties' intent when they contracted, and parol evidence will be considered only if the agreement is ambiguous<span class="Italic">. See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Department of the Army</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 9 (2005). Ambiguity exists if the settlement agreement's terms are reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation. <span class="Italic">Romano v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 319, 323 (1991). When the parties' intended meaning is not apparent from the face of the agreement, it is appropriate to examine extrinsic evidence of intent. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 5 M.S.P.R. 546, &#x00B6; 17 (2000). The Board may review a settlement where the agreement was reached outside of a Board proceeding to determine its effect on a party's right to pursue a Board appeal.[5]. <span class="Italic">E.g., Swidecki v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 7 (2006); <span class="Italic">Laity</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 261.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Board has no authority to enforce or invalidate a settlement agreement reached in another forum, however. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Goodwin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 136, 139 n.2 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 983 F.2d 226 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Gorelick v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 81, 85 (1990); <span class="Italic">Danelishen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 376, 379-80 (1990). Further, the Board generally will not entertain an appeal that amounts to a collateral attack on a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Nease v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 365, 367 (1995). If the appellant believes that the agency's decision to remove him is inconsistent with the settlement agreement, or that he should not be bound by the agreement, he should bring a direct proceeding to invalidate or enforce the agreement in the proper forum, namely, as set forth in the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency apparently asserts that the settlement agreement unambiguously provided that the appellant would be removed if he did not meet the conditions set forth in the agreement. It contends that the grievance's subject matter was the appellant's removal, that the parties executed the settlement agreement to resolve the grievance, and that they expressly agreed that the grievance would be considered closed if one of the stated conditions was not met. It claims that, in finding that the term "the grievance will be considered closed" was not tantamount to an agreement that the appellant would be removed, the AJ looked beyond the four corners of the settlement agreement to find that it did not preclude a Board appeal over his removal. It argues that, in doing so, the AJ placed "her own gloss" on the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree that the settlement agreement unambiguously provided that the appellant would be removed if he did not meet the conditions set forth in the agreement. As previously noted, the words of the agreement are of paramount importance. <span class="Italic">See Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 560. Here, the settlement agreement does not refer to the appellant's "removal." Indeed, the agency admits as much. It states the AJ "went to great pains to highlight the fact that the settlement agreement did not contain any express language stating that the Appellant would be fired if he failed to satisfy any of these conditions precedent." The agency has not provided any basis for its assertion that the term "the grievance will be considered closed" is unambiguously tantamount to stating that the appellant will be removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, the agency appears to concede that the settlement agreement was ambiguous by asserting that the AJ ignored the parties' actions and statements subsequent to the settlement agreement, and, in doing so, failed to consider the most reliable and convincing parol evidence as to what they intended. In that regard, the agency contends that the AJ erred in finding that the appellant was not removed based on the charge set forth in the notice of proposed removal, which was the subject of the settlement agreement, but instead based on a new charge of being "not fit for duty." It states that the only references to the phrase are in the December 26, 2000 PS Form 50 and Lee's December 18, 2000 memorandum to Personnel Services. It asserts that those documents as a whole show that the phrase was nothing more than an explanation of the reason for invoking the express terms of the settlement agreement and not a new and independent basis for discharging the appellant. It further asserts that the appellant himself acknowledged that the settlement agreement called for his removal if he failed to satisfy one of its conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that the parol evidence shows that the settlement agreement provided for the appellant's removal if he did not meet the conditions set forth in the settlement agreement and that the appellant was removed based on the charge that was the subject of the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement was analogous to a last-chance settlement agreement. That is, the appellant had to meet the conditions set forth in the settlement agreement to prevent the previously proposed removal from taking effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In that regard, the AJ erred in relying simply on the PS Form 50's reference to the appellant being "not fit for duty" without considering the other evidence. Specifically, on December 18, 2000, Lee sent a routing slip to Personnel Services Acting Manager Phylliss A. Williams requesting a PS Form 50 Notice of Removal for the appellant. The slip identified the removal infraction as "attendance/awol," and cited the authority for the action as the "notice of proposed removal--dated October 20, 1998 (not fit for duty)." Under "remarks," it stated that "per pre-arbitration settlement dated June 14, 1999, if not found fit-for-full duty as a mailhandler, grievance is considered closed." Moreover, the PS Form 50, although it stated "(not fit for duty)," also stated that the removal was "per labor relations dtd 12/18/00" and cited as "authority," "notice of proposed removal--dtd 10-20-98." The agency concedes that it took longer than expected for the appellant's removal to become effective. We note, however, that the record indicates that the appellant had been on leave without pay since June 6, 1998, i.e., throughout the entire period of time at issue. Further, as the agency asserts, the appellant admitted that the settlement agreement provided that, if he could not perform the full duties of his position, he would be removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">Hanna</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 8, the agency asserts that, given that the settlement agreement provided that the appellant would be removed if he did not meet the conditions set forth in the agreement, the AJ erred in finding that the settlement agreement did not divest the Board of jurisdiction over the appellant's removal. The agency argues that <span class="Italic">Hanna</span> is directly on point and controls the outcome of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that, under <span class="Italic">Hanna</span>, the settlement agreement resolving the appellant's grievance divested the Board of jurisdiction over the appeal. A preference eligible at the U.S. Postal Service may file both a grievance and a Board appeal of the same action. <span class="Italic">Milligan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 106 8 M.S.P.R. 414, &#x00B6; 7 (2007). As the AJ recognized, however, a presumption exists that Board appeal rights are waived when the other procedural avenue is a grievance and settlement of that grievance does not specifically reserve the right to file a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Hanna</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 8. In making that determination, the Board reviews the terms of the settlement agreement and the surrounding circumstances. <span class="Italic">Hanna</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 8<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, union representative Gettys and agency representative Lee signed the settlement agreement resolving the appellant's grievance concerning the notice of proposed removal. They agreed that the settlement was "<span class="Italic">a final and complete settlement of the subject grievance,"</span> and "<span class="Italic">constitutes a full and final settlement of the subject grievance and resolves all issues pertaining thereto."</span> By so specifying, the appellant waived his right to challenge his removal before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Hanna</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 9. <span id="Page_5082"></span>Moreover, as the agency contends, the burden was on the appellant to expressly reserve Board appeal rights in settling the grievance, which he did not, and it is immaterial whether the agency's failure to inform him of a Board appeal right caused him to be unaware of such a right when he entered into the settlement agreement.<span class="Italic"></span> Finally, the appellant has shown no error in the AJ's findings that he asked that a grievance be filed on his behalf; designated the union as his representative; became aware of the settlement by June 18, 1999; ratified the agreement by presenting himself to the agency's medical unit for a fitness examination; and failed to show that the union lacked authority to settle the matter on his behalf. Thus, the appellant is bound by the union's actions in the grievance procedures. <span class="Italic">See Hanna</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 14-15. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agreement calls for the appellant to resign and the agency to facilitate the successful application of the appellant for disability retirement, the Board will not construe the agreement to require the agency to contact OPM to state its belief that the appellant was physically disabled from performing his job. <span class="Italic">McClain v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 66 (1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 355, 358-59 (1991) (agency could not seek to recover greater indebtedness from employee than was specified by settlement agreement resolving an adverse action encompassing funds the agency sought to recover from appellant's back pay; agency could recover a different shortage not embraced by underlying removal action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agreement guarantees benefits in a general fashion, e.g., "additional pay as authorized by Subchapter V of Chapter 55 of Title 5, United States Code," or the agreement provides that the employee will receive "all the rights, both substantive and procedural, of a federal employee encumbering his position which are not specifically excluded or waived by this agreement," then the employee's claims for benefits, e.g., administratively uncontrollable overtime, will be granted only if the employee has complied with specific statutory requirements for the benefits claims. The general language of the agreement confers no greater benefits than the statutes it references. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schaffler v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 68 MSPR 31, 34 (1995). But extrinsic evidence may be developed as to an element of an agreement necessary to the agreement but not specifically expressed, e.g., the date of an employee's reinstatement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDavid v.
