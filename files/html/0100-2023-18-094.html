<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-95"><span class="space">2.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Sullivan</span></span>; Adverse External Influences</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Against the backdrop of the Court of Claims decisions, the Federal Circuit, established in 1982, adopted the precedent of the Court of Claims and <span id="Page_3245"></span>continued to issue occasional decisions interpreting due process requirements relative to the agency adverse action decision process. An early, principal decision of that court is <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266, 1271-74 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (following remand, 20 MSPR 67, 67 (1984)), concluding that an adverse action is fatally flawed if the decision process is improperly biased by outside influences unknown to the employee until after the action has been taken. <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> essentially involved an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> adversarial participant in the adverse action process. A Navy employee filed a grievance against his superior who, angered and suspecting that the employee was reporting that he had worked during periods that he had not, ordered surveillance of the employee. After surveillance showed the possibility of improper reporting of attendance, the superior decided he would remove himself from involvement in disciplinary procedures against the employee. He designated a subordinate to determine whether adverse action was warranted, after giving the subordinate a clear indication that the removal of the employee was desired. The subordinate prepared the adverse action proposal. It was reviewed by the employee's superior and passed along to the designated deciding official for a decision. The employee's supervisor submitted one written recommendation of removal to the deciding official and made sure that the individuals hearing the reply of the employee and those advising the deciding official were aware that the removal was strongly desired. The employee was unaware of any of the communications among his supervisor, the deciding official, and his aides until after he was removed. The removal was sustained by the Board. From all of this, the court concluded that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications deprived the employee of due process and rendered his removal a nullity, contrary to law, warranting reversal of the Board's decision sustaining the action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Claims, a predecessor court whose decisions are binding on us, held in an <span class="Italic">in banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Camero v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States</span>, 375 F.2d 777 (1967) that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications by an adversary with those participating in a decision to remove a government employee from his employment invalidates the removal proceedings and entitles the employee to reinstatement with back pay. In this regard the court said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[P]laintiff contended that his dismissal was invalidated by certain alleged activities on the part of Theodore M. Kostos, the attorney who had represented the Agency before the Grievance Committee. These activities, according to plaintiff, involved <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between Kostos and those participating in the ultimate decision to sustain his removal, as well as actual participation by Kostos in that decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Plaintiff's other assertion--that Kostos engaged in <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with those participating in the decision to sustain his removal--unlike the allegation of actual participation in the decision, was amply supported by the evidence adduced at the trial proceedings, and it is for Kostos' activities in this regard that we hold plaintiff's removal to be invalid. 375 F.2d at 778-779</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In that case, the court held further:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We have no doubt that Wolverton formed his own opinion on what recommendations he should make to General Anderson, just as we have no doubt that General Anderson made up his own mind when he decided to sustain plaintiff's removal. The problem is, however, that both decisions were made, at least in part, on the basis of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication of the opinion of Kostos, who certainly, albeit perhaps not consciously, had as an adversary more than a neutral stake in the final outcome of plaintiff's case. This is enough to require us to invalidate plaintiff's removal as being in violation of the regulations governing the Army grievance proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is difficult to imagine a more serious incursion on fairness than to permit the representative of one of the parties to privately communicate his recommendations to the decision makers. To allow such activity would be to render the hearing virtually meaningless. We are of the opinion that due process forbids it. <span class="Italic">See Vitarelli v. Seaton</span> [359 U.S. 535, 79 S. Ct. 968, 3 L. Ed.2d 1012], <span class="Italic">supra;</span> <span class="Italic">Service v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dulles</span> [354 U.S. 363, 77 S. Ct. 1152, 1 L. Ed.2d 1403], <span class="Italic">supra</span>. 375 F.2d at 780-781.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the court held:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Accordingly, plaintiff is entitled to recover back pay from the date of his wrongful removal to the date of judgment, less any salary he may have received during the period from other employment. Judgment is entered to that effect. 375 F.2d at 781.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Claims had occasion to again consider the effect of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications on a decision to remove a government employee from his employment in the case of <span class="Italic">Ryder v. United States</span>, 585 F.2d 482 (1978). In that case a Col. Peach, a government attorney, who was the superior of employee Ryder and was the prime instigator of the charges against him, wrote a memo to the deciding official, a Gen. Berry, recommending the decision Berry should make. The memo was an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication from Peach to Berry that was made without Ryder's knowledge. The court pointed out that Ryder had no opportunity to answer the memo. Gen. Berry's removal decision was in accordance with Peach's recommendation. The court invalidated the entire proceeding because of Peach's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication to the deciding official, citing and quoting <span class="Italic">Camero</span> as the leading case on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications by adversaries in personnel-removal cases. The court, in referring to the decision in <span class="Italic">Camero</span>, said, among other things:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The court held that this taint of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications from an adversary vitiated the entire removal proceeding; Camero was awarded back pay for the wrongful removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent then argues that they are not of the type found unlawful in <span class="Italic">Camero</span> and <span class="Italic">Ryder,</span> but are comparable to the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications involved in <span class="Italic">Della Valle v. United States,</span> 231 Ct. Cl. -- (Order, 1982); <span class="Italic">Grover v. United States,</span> 200 Ct. Cl. 337 (1973); <span class="Italic">Salter v. United States,</span> 412 F.2d 874 (Ct. Cl. 1969); and <span class="Italic">Joyce v. United States,</span> 2 Cl. Ct. 226 (1983). We do not agree. We have carefully considered those cases and have concluded that they are clearly distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Camero</span> and <span class="Italic">Ryder</span> and from the instant case. In <span class="Italic">Della Valle v. United States,</span> the plaintiff was removed from his position with the Navy for unsatisfactory work. He had complained of medical problems. A doctor found him to be fit and filed a report to that effect, a copy of which was not given to the plaintiff but was placed in his file. The hearing officer who received plaintiff's oral reply recommended removal. This recommendation was also placed in plaintiff's file, but a copy of it was not given to him. The court held that these were not impermissible <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications of the <span class="Italic">Camero</span> type, because they were not communications to the decision-maker from an adversary, but were merely internal documents of an advisory nature. That case is clearly distinguishable from our case where a true adversary with motives of reprisal sought to pressure the deciding official into making a decision to remove the petitioner from his employment. In <span class="Italic">Joyce v. United States,</span> the plaintiff was removed from his position as a VA Contact Representative. He complained of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> submission of a memorandum to the hearing officer by another VA official. The Claims Court held that this was not improper. However, on appeal to the Civil Service Commission (now MSPB) (the Board), the Board relied on some of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> evidence in the memo without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to introduce evidence regarding it. The court, on appeal, reversed and remanded the case because of this error. As can be seen, the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications in our case and those in <span class="Italic">Joyce</span> are quite different. In our case a non-disinterested adversary sought to improperly influence the deciding official. In <span class="Italic">Joyce</span> the writer of the memo was not shown to be an adversary of the plaintiff. Furthermore, the memo was only furnished by him to the hearing officer. In the instant case, we are not concerned with <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with the hearing officer, but with those to the ultimate deciding officer, Admiral Shugart.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Grover v. United States,</span> the plaintiff was removed from his job with the IRS for, among other reasons, falsification of records. He complained of an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> statement given to the reply officer by plaintiff's supervisor, who did not get along well with plaintiff. The Court of Claims held that since the supervisor was not present at the hearing, it was proper for the reply officer to take his statement so that he could make a proper recommendation. Again, this is not the kind of improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications we have in our case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The case of <span class="Italic">Salter v. United States,</span> like <span class="Italic">Grover</span>, deals mainly with evidence considered by an agency in a removal case, and does not involve <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with the final decision official such as we have in the instant case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we see that the cases cited and relied on by the respondent are inapposite to the instant case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent also argues that even if the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were improper, the fact that they occurred was harmless error because petitioner had the opportunity to present the issue to the Board on appeal. The Court of Claims answered this identical argument in the <span class="Italic">Ryder</span> case by pointing out that the error is committed when the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> statements are made to the first deciding official who could decide the case in favor of the employee. In this regard the court said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">But Gen. Berry did have full and final authority to accept the examiner's report and to find for Mr. Ryder; he could on his own have ordered the removal set aside and plaintiff reinstated--and the whole proceeding would have ended there without any participation by FORSCOM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is this power of Gen. Berry to end the case in Ryder's favor, without referral to higher authority, which implicates the Camero principle of freedom from <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> taints.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">***</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">***</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An official who could authoritatively and finally restore the employee failed to do so after the exertion of improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> influence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3246"></span>It makes no difference that, at the next level when the case reached FORSCOM, Ryder had the opportunity to answer the views which had stemmed from Col. Peach (later transformed into Gen. Berry's own position). By then it was too late; plaintiff had irretrievably lost his valuable opportunity, explicitly given him by the regulations, to have Gen. Berry decide finally in his favor, untrammeled by improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> approaches. 585 F.2d at 486-487</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There can be no question that Admiral Shugart could have decided the case in favor of the petitioner, but did not do so. The only removal decision on appeal was that of Shugart. It was Shugart's decision that was affirmed by the presiding official of the Board's Atlanta Field Office, and it was Shugart's decision that was affirmed by the Board when it denied the petition for review. Therefore, the controlling decision was that of Shugart. The injury from the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications had already been done before the case reached the appellate stage, and this occurred without the knowledge of petitioner and without his having any opportunity to defend against it before the removal decision was made against him by Shugart. Obviously, it was too late for petitioner to do anything on appeal to prevent Shugart from making a decision he had already made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, respondent contends that Westbrock's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications made absolutely no difference in the case because of the evidence and the ultimate determination by the Navy. In other words, respondent argues that the petitioner would have been removed in any event because of the evidence against him. Again, this very argument was answered by the Court of Claims in the <span class="Italic">Ryder</span> case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In that case, the government argued that the decision should be against Ryder despite the procedural defect, because he would have been removed on the merits in the absence of the procedural defect in his firing. The court rejected this reasoning, saying:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">However, where a serious procedural curtailment mars an adverse personnel action which deprives the employee of pay, the court has regularly taken the position that the defect divests the removal (or demotion) of legality, leaving the employee on the rolls of the employing agency and entitled to his pay until proper procedural steps are taken toward removing or disciplining him. In that situation, the merits of the adverse action are wholly disregarded. (citations omitted)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The perfect illustration is <span class="Italic">Camero</span> in which the court first held squarely against the employee on the merits of his separation, 345 F.2d 798, 170 Ct. Cl. 490 (1965), and later ruled that he could nevertheless recover back pay because of the same type of procedural defect we see in the present case. 375 F.2d 777, 179 Ct. Cl. 520 (1967). 585 F.2d at 487-488 (Emphasis Supplied)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that Westbrock's improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were not only unfair, but also denied petitioner his rights under the due process clause of the Constitution. We hold further that they tainted the investigation, voided the entire proceeding, and rendered Admiral Shugart's removal decision a nullity. The decision of the Board to the contrary is erroneous as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dominguez v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-623), reaffirmed that adverse actions are vitiated if officials with an interest in removing an appellant manipulate the reply and decisional processes through <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications so that the result is foretold. Removal was reversed after a third-level supervisor, assaulted by the appellant, persuaded lower-level supervisors to agree to remove the appellant from his position, although the lower-level officials favored a lesser punishment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties and the board have not addressed the long-standing law of this court's predecessor, the United States Court of Claims, and a recent decision in which this court upheld those precedents and declared that it is a violation of due process, for a person in an adversary position, such as commissary manager Barrera, to have <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts with the decisionmaker before announcement of the decision. This misconduct is not cured by the fact that a later adversary proceeding was held by the MSPB, at which time the employee had an opportunity, as he did here, to cross-examine his adversaries and to raise all issues <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Department of Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266 (Fed. Cir. 1983), and cases collected therein. This is true notwithstanding the merits of the removal action or whether the issue was squarely presented to or decided by the board. The error is committed when the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> statements are made to the first deciding official who could decide the case in favor of the employee.... Fairness and due process command that, when an agency designates a deciding official, it permit him to make a decision without outside influence from the employee's adversary and on the basis only of the reasons specified in the removal notice and information which can be disclosed to the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The continuing validity of <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> as a broad holding governing <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications was touched on in <span class="Italic">Welcker v. United States</span>, 752 F.2d 1577, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The employee challenged a dismissal on security grounds through a Tucker Act suit in the Claims Court. One basis for the challenge to the dismissal was an allegation of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. The court essentially determined that before such communications warrant reversal, there must be a law, regulation, or practice forbidding the contacts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The principal precedent for this court's sustaining a claim of impermissible <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications during an administrative proceeding is <span class="Italic">Camero v. United States</span>, 345 F.2d 798 (Ct. Cl. 1965), and 375 F.2d 777, 780 (Ct. Cl. 1967). In that case, plaintiff was removed from his position as a civilian Army employee at a supply depot in Philadelphia after the Government charged him with falsely certifying travel vouchers and receiving bribes from contractors. A grievance committee investigated the charges and moderated the penalty. The depot commander, the ultimate deciding official, solicited comments from, among others, the Army attorney who had prosecuted the case before the grievance committee. He then reinstated the harsher penalty. The Court of Claims awarded plaintiff back pay on the ground that the commander acted improperly in soliciting the attorney's comments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ground on which the court rested its holding in <span class="Italic">Camero</span> was not, as plaintiff argues, that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between an adverse Government agency and an administrative tribunal are always <span class="Italic">per se</span> improper. Rather, the court ruled that by seeking the advice of an adverse party the decision maker had violated applicable regulations...governing [A]rmy grievance proceedings....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The sum of it is that, in the <span class="Italic">Camero-</span>type cases, the statute, regulations, or practice precluded <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> adversarial contacts.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In one case reversing a dismissal on the ground of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the court made no mention of particular regulations violated by the misconduct. The court did, however, specifically quote the language in <span class="Italic">Camero</span> which is set forth <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and evidently believed that the whole structure of the employee-removal system precluded such communications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In stark contrast, appellant enjoyed the benefit of no such statute, regulations, or practice....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather than the full hearing available to plaintiffs in <span class="Italic">Camero</span>,...appellant's hearing was merely an opportunity to state his case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The continued validity of <span class="Italic">Welcker</span>, as to <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, is unlikely under <span class="Italic">Stone v. FDIC</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Building on <span class="Italic">Welcker,</span> the Federal Circuit stated in <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. DLA</span>, 772 F.2d 887, 892 (Fed. Cir. 1985), that management may obtain advice from those who are not in a position adversarial to an employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no prohibition against a decision-maker calling for advice from those who are not in an adversarial position with the offending employee. "We have before us nothing more than an example of permissible institutional decision-making." <span class="Italic">Della Valle v. United States,</span> 231 Ct. Cl. 818, 821 (1982). In the real world of government decision-making, administrators cannot be expected to perform their duties in a complete vacuum without consultations or search for advice. Petitioner has shown us no <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact which is barred by statute, regulation, or practice. <span class="Italic">Welcker v. United States,</span> 752 F.2d 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Not only has Gonzales failed to support his allegation of a prohibited personnel practice, but even assuming some procedural defect here, he has not met the statutory requirement to demonstrate that it was harmful. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7701(c)(2)(A); <span class="Italic">Shaw v. United States Postal Service,</span> 697 F.2d 1078, 1080 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Like <span class="Italic">Welcker</span>, the continuing encompassing validity of <span class="Italic">Gonzales</span> as to the nature of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications is placed in doubt by <span class="Italic">Stone v. FDIC</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">post</span>. <span class="Italic">See Reuter v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, ___F.4th___ (Fed. Cir. 2023) (reviewing Federal Circuit authority concerning <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications including and postdating <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> and <span class="Italic">Stone</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Attempting to synthesize the great <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> morass, <span class="Italic">Farris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 26 MSPR 299, 302-03 (1985), offered that as to <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> concerned intervention in the proceedings by a third party who bore some malice toward the appellant. As to proposing and deciding officials conferring, neither a proposing nor a deciding official is necessarily an adversary only because she is doing his or her job of investigation and bringing charges or making a recommendation. Nothing in law or regulation prohibits the proposing and deciding officials from meeting, discussing, or consulting on a case if no evidence, subject matter, or material is introduced that the appellant has not had the benefit of responding to or viewing, and if there is no undue pressure to influence the actions of either the proposing or deciding official. Reviewing <span class="Italic">Farris</span>, the Federal Circuit determined, <span class="Italic">Farris v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-2164):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to petitioner's argument, the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts between the agency's deciding official and the agency's proposing official and its investigator were not impermissible. As this court explained in <span class="Italic">Welcker v. United States</span>, 752 F.2d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1985), only those <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts proscribed by statute, by regulation, or by the structure of an agency's removal system are deemed improper. Petitioner has not identified any statute or regulation proscribing the contacts at issue, as <span id="Page_3247"></span>in <span class="Italic">Camero v. United States</span>, 375 F.2d 777 (Ct. Cl. 1967), nor was the removal system shown to be an adversarial type of proceeding as in <span class="Italic">Ryder v. United States</span>, 585 F.2d 482, 486-87 (Ct. Cl. 1978). Also, unlike the person who pressured the deciding official in <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the proposing official and the investigator here had no motive for reprisal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Were all <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts barred during the adverse action decisional process, was the limitation only on communications to the decision-maker from those clearly adversary in position to the appellant, or did the whole matter rest on the nature of the particular step of the process and the regulatory limits on that process? The answer was not clear, and <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> generated judicial comment. On the subject of internal agency <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, the Federal Circuit opined in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of State</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2538), a performance case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the issue of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, we have carefully considered the contentions of the petitioner and <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> but conclude that the board correctly analyzed the issue in its opinion. The communications engaged in by the proposing and deciding officials violated no statute or agency regulation. We see nothing wrong with the proposing official discussing with agency personnel points raised by petitioner in his written and oral response to the charges. Nor do we see impropriety in discussions occurring between the proposing and deciding officials. If anything, these discussions indicate a reasonable approach by the agency in making a determination based on a careful consideration of the petitioner's response to the charges. Indeed, the deciding official in his decision determined that certain of the charges were not sustained by the evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> joined by Judge Bissell, Judge Nichols commented on <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[B]oth Mr. Anderson and the <span class="Italic">amicus</span> make much of the alleged <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> approach to the deciding officer, Mr. Lauderdale. These were the ordinary things of an executive consulting with his subordinates in the ordinary course of business. A good many minds were never in sympathy with the efforts of Congress which sought to "reform" the Civil Service in 1978 to make it once more possible to get rid of incompetent civil servants. Every now and then a court decision comes along that is seen as a lever to work the switch and get the train back on its former track. It is easy to see that the holding of this court in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> has been selected for a major role in such employment. Its attractiveness resides in the statement...that in a case such as the court found Sullivan's to be "the merits of the adverse action are wholly disregarded." That is, the taxpayers must go on paying an incompetent or a wrongdoer, entrusting the public weal and perhaps its safety to his hands, because someone not working within the limits imposed by a judicial role, has talked to someone else when a judge shouldn't have. The majority in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> made pretty plain its view that the case against Sullivan was no good anyway, but disclaimed this as a ground for its decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sullivan's adverse action was stated in the opinion to be far from the ordinary. His superior, a Captain Westbrook, had recused himself, ostensibly, from participating in the adverse action against Sullivan, but had continued to put pressure on those left responsible by the refusal, including the "deciding official," and had demanded the most severe action possible. Judges normally take a recusal as a commitment to say no more about the case to anyone, but not so Westbrook. Westbrook had a motive in a grievance previously filed against him by Sullivan. The opinion, at 1272, distinguishes between "communications [which are] merely internal documents of an advisory nature," and a case where "a true adversary with motives of reprisal sought to pressure the deciding official...." Much as he disliked <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> approaches, I think the able author would be startled to know his opinion is being invoked to preclude executives not serving as judges, confronted with instances of supposed wrongdoing or incompetence, from discussing their problems with their natural aides and advisers. <span class="Italic">DeSarno v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 761 F.2d 657 (Fed. Cir. 1985), further explains <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> as a case where the party making the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact was "seeking vengeance."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Anderson was claimed to be a "whistleblower," a characterization effectively refuted in the board proceedings and not seriously argued by him here. Nevertheless, we have an <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> brief by a high-minded organization dedicated to the safeguarding of whistleblowers which, however, devotes the whole thrust of its argument here to the <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> approach issue. Our choice not to publish our opinion is probably warranted by absence of any real substance in the issues actually present, but I think the way this case is presented, especially by the <span class="Italic">amicus</span>, points to the likelihood this court will have to do a lot of writing in the future to draw the line properly between the unusual case where <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> demands a disregard of the merits, and other cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I think (or thought before <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> changed my mind for me), Congress provided such meticulous due process at the MSPB appeal level of an adverse action, hoping thusly to excuse agencies from having to provide due process at an earlier level, except the elements specified in <span class="Italic">DeSarno</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, as exacted by <span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy</span>, 416 U.S. 134 (1974). In carrying more than those over from cases under the old law, into the new, we are reviving the terrors of officials trained in other disciplines than the law, that in adverse actions they will be stepping into traps for the unwary laid for them by the courts. <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> not only is a case where Sullivan himself is absolved from his sins, if any, by the sins of his adversary. It is also a case where a probably well-meaning "deciding official" is pilloried for the intransigence of a third party who did not make the decision. This well illustrates how a "deciding official" allows himself to be the "fall guy" in an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> might have been approached, given the facts stated by the majority, as a case of agency bad faith, without seemingly imposing on an executive standards of conduct appropriate to a judge, standards as to which he has received no training and of which he has probably never heard. We have, however, promulgated <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> and are "stuck" with it, and are now hearing it cited in just about every other MSPB appeal it is rapidly becoming our most celebrated decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As late as 1998, there were decisions from the Federal Circuit coming close to analyzing due process issues under a harmful error standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hendrix v. USDA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3071) (sustaining the Board decision when the record, without the extraneous material challenged under <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, fully supported the agency action).</p>
