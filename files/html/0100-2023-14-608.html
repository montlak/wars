<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-609"><span class="space">C.</span> BROAD CRITERIA</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 3 FLRA 784, 789, 791-93 (1980), considered a proposal that "[a]ll performance standards will be fair and equitable and consistent with the classification standards for the job. An employee who believes a standard does not meet the above criteria may grieve...." The agency resisted, contending that the "fair and equitable" portion prevented it from exercising discretion in establishing standards and might ultimately permit a third party to establish the standards. As to the "classification standards" comparison, the agency argued that the proposal violated the statutory requirement that the <span id="page_1069"></span>standards relate to the job or position rather than to classification standards. The proposals were not, however, objectionable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Bureau of the Public Debt</span>, 3 FLRA [768] (1980),...the Authority found that the rights to direct employees and to assign work...include the authority to establish critical elements and performance standards. Accordingly, the Authority held that the proposal in that case which identified a critical element and established a quantitative performance standard for that job element was not within the duty to bargain. However, as was emphasized in that decision, an agency has a duty to bargain under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, on appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its authority under section 7106(a), <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, actions taken under such standards. More particularly, the Authority stated that nothing in its decision would preclude an exclusive representative from negotiating criteria for the application of performance standards which management has established. Accordingly, insofar as the proposal here merely would establish a general, nonquantitative requirement by which the application of critical elements and performance standards established by management may subsequently be evaluated in a grievance by an employee who believes that he has been adversely affected by the application of management's performance standard to him, and the Authority so interprets the proposal for purposes of this decision, it is within the duty to bargain.... Such review by an arbitrator would not...preclude the Agency from initially determining the content of the standard, nor would it result in the substitution of the arbitrator's judgment for that of the Agency and the setting of a new standard; it would simply determine if the standard established by management as applied to the grievant complied with "fair and equitable..." requirements of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the proposal here does not impose on the Agency a particular decision as to the quantity, quality, and timeliness of production or the establishing of priorities, or otherwise establish the content of performance standards in derogation of management's right to direct employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the...portion of the proposal which states that "performance standards will be...consistent with the classification standards for the job"...[t]he sole and limited effect of the Union's proposal as interpreted by the Union...is as follows: In the rare instance where an applicable classification standard uses a quantitative or qualitative performance criterion to distinguish among grade levels, the performance standard established should reflect this distinction. That is, under this proposal, where such a classification standard is applicable, an employee could grieve the application of a performance standard with respect to any task assigned to him if that performance standard reflected a level of achievement different from the level specified for the grade to which the employee's position is classified. In essence, the "classification standards" portion of the proposal merely constitutes a specific aspect of the "fair and equitable" requirement of the proposal under which the application of performance standards may be reviewed by an arbitrator.... [T]he proposal does not prevent the agency from establishing...performance standards related to the job performed by the employee....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency contends that it would be unable to assign duties not prescribed in the classification standards, it would be unable to assign duties unrelated to those standards, and it would be unable to establish performance standards where no classification standards are applicable to the position or to any particular duties thereof.... [W]ithout regard to whether the duties assigned to an employee are stated in or are unrelated to the classification standards applicable to the employee's job, or whether there is any classification standard applicable to the employee's job, the proposal does not conflict with management's right to assign to an employee any duties and to establish performance standards and critical elements with respect to any one of them.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal is negotiable that does no more than reflect statutory requirements governing performance standards. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 213 and Dept. of Energy</span>, 32 FLRA 578, 583 (1988). A proposal is negotiable that mandates "reasonable" performance standards. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3656 and FTC, Boston Reg'l Office</span>, 4 FLRA 702, 702-03 (1980). A proposal was negotiable that required that performance standards and critical elements be "objective, reasonable, and directly related to an employee's official position"; these were general, nonquantitative requirements. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2192 and VA Reg'l Office, St. Louis</span>, 9 FLRA 716, 717-18 (1982) (Proposal 2). In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1409 and Army Adjutant Gen. Publications Ctr.</span>, 28 FLRA 109, 114 (1987), Provision 1 was approved (over the dissent of Chairman Calhoun, noted below) that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The program will include performance standards which will permit the accurate evaluation of an employee's performance of the duties and responsibilities of his job on the basis of objective criteria related to the individual employee's position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The FLRA majority determined, 28 FLRA at 114-15:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first sentence of Provision 1 is to the same effect as Proposal 2 in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO Local 2192 and Veterans Administration Regional Office, St. Louis, Missouri</span>, 9 FLRA 716 (1982), which the Authority found to be within the duty to bargain because it established general, nonquantitative requirements by which the application of performance standards established by management could subsequently be measured in a grievance. Contrary to the Agency, we find that the first sentence of Provision 1 is intended by the Union to provide a contractual standard by which management action under the Agency's performance standards may be reviewed. Since the first sentence of Provision 1 would also establish a general, nonquantitative standard by which the application of performance standards to employees can be measured in a subsequent grievance, it is...likewise within the Agency's duty to bargain.... Because we find that the first sentence of Provision 1 does not directly interfere with management's rights, we do not need to reach the question of whether it constitutes an "appropriate arrangement."...</p>
<p class="noindent">Dissenting in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1409</span>, Chairman Calhoun pointed out the philosophical differences within FLRA over something as basic as a proposal that did little more than restate the statutory and regulatory requirements governing performance standards, 28 FLRA at 116-17:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first sentence of Provision 1 would require the Agency to establish performance standards based on "objective criteria related to the individual's position." Based on the wording of the sentence and the record in this case, I conclude that this portion of the provision establishes substantive criteria which will govern management's determination of performance standards.... I disagree with my colleagues' conclusion that this part of Provision 1 concerns the application of performance standards....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first sentence of the provision omits the statutory requirement that agencies establish performance standards which will, "to the maximum extent feasible," permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria related to each job or position under the system. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1). By omitting the phrase "to the maximum extent feasible," the first sentence of Provision 1 is more restrictive than the law governing the establishment of performance standards. It would establish a separate contractual limitation on management's determination of the content of performance standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By providing a separate contractual criterion governing the establishment of performance standards, the first sentence of Provision 1 has an effect similar to Sections 3.H and 3.J in <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Association and Patent and Trademark Office, Department of Commerce</span>, 25 FLRA No. 29 (1987).... In that decision it was determined that Sections 3.H and 3.J, although purporting to require the establishment of performance standards in accordance with law, would in fact preclude management from establishing standards which it was legally entitled to prescribe.... The first sentence of Provision 1 would deprive management of the flexibility to establish the standards which in its judgment best serve its appraisal needs, a flexibility which is afforded management under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1).... By precluding management from establishing performance standards which would be within the permissible range of feasibility under law, the first sentence of Provision 1 directly interferes with management's rights under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute and...is outside the duty to bargain. I would also find that the first sentence of Provision 1 does not constitute an "arrangement" under section 7106(b)(3) for the reasons set forth in the discussion of Section 3.K in <span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable was a proposal requesting agreement that standards be objective to the maximum extent feasible, <span class="Italic">UPTO and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Walla Walla</span>, 44 FLRA 1145, 1158-59 (1992) (Proposal 3):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first part of Proposal 3 provides that, to the maximum extent feasible, performance standards shall be objective. The Union claims that the proposal is "meant simply to track the provisions of law[.]" We find that the Union's explanation is consistent with the plain wording of the first part of Proposal 3. In particular, we note that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) requires that agencies establish performance standards that, "to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria...." The effect of Proposal 3 is to incorporate into the parties' agreement the requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) that performance standards be based on objective criteria to the maximum extent feasible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(2) is subject to "applicable laws." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 42 FLRA 377 (1991), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, No. 91-1573 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 25, 1991) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>). Because the first part of Proposal 3 concerns the contractual incorporation of the limitations on management's rights to direct employees, under section 7106(a)(2)(A), and to assign work, under section 7106(a)(2)(B), contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1), we must address whether the limitations <span id="page_1070"></span>contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) and imposed by the proposal constitute "applicable law" within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">IRS</span> we determined that the phrase "applicable laws" includes "provisions of the United States Code." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 389. We conclude, therefore, that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) constitutes an applicable law within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute and a permissible limitation on the exercise of management's rights to direct employees and assign work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 404. Because the first part of Proposal 3 incorporates a permissible statutory limitation on the establishment of performance standards, we find, consistent with <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, that the first part of Proposal 3 is negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the first part of Proposal 3 is distinguishable from the proposal that we found nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">FNS, Western Region</span>, 42 FLRA at 986. The proposal in that case required that performance standards be "objective." We found that the proposal established a substantive criterion governing the determination of the content of performance standards. The first part of Proposal 3, however, provides that, <span class="Italic">to the maximum extent feasible</span>, performance standards shall be objective and, thus, that part of the proposal incorporates the requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent">The same result, based on similar reasoning, was reached as to Provision 12 in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 37 (1993), approving as negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the maximum extent feasible, all performance standards and application of the standards to the individual's work shall permit the evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria (which may include the extent of courtesy demonstrated to the public) related to the job in question for the employee or position, and must be described in objective, job-related terms that are independent of the individual making the evaluation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">POPA</span> explained, 47 FLRA at 38-39:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union maintains that "[c]onsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1), [Provision 12] requires that the standards and their application permit evaluation of job performance based on objective criteria 'to the maximum extent feasible.'" We find that the Union's explanation is consistent with the plain wording of the provision. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) requires that agencies establish performance standards "which will, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria...related to the job in question for each employee or position...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute is subject to "applicable laws." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 42 FLRA at 389. We have determined that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) constitutes an applicable law within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2). <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, 44 FLRA at 1158.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 12 incorporates into the parties' agreement the requirement in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) that performance standards permit evaluations based on objective criteria to the maximum feasible extent. Consequently, we find that Provision 12 does nothing more than obligate the Agency to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) to direct employees and assign work consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the provision is inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) because it requires "rigid, mechanical standards devoid of any subjective judgment." We disagree. Although the last clause of the provision requires that performance standards be described in "terms that are independent of the individual making the evaluation[,]" we find that this clause is also covered by the introductory clause requiring objectivity "to the maximum extent feasible," the same wording that appears in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1). We conclude, therefore, that Provision 12 allows the same latitude for managerial subjectivity in rating employees as does 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, we find that Provision 12 is negotiable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, 44 FLRA at 1156-59 (proposal, requiring objective performance standards "to the maximum extent feasible," found to incorporate permissible statutory limitation and held to be negotiable).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that the agency has the right to establish critical elements, noncritical elements, and performance standards, subject to law, regulation, and "this Agreement." There was no limitation of management or imposition of substantive contractual limitations. The agency was only required to adhere to any requirements in effect at the time the agency identified critical elements and established performance standards. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, Office of Sec'y, Hq., Office of Gen. Counsel, Social Security Div.</span>, 21 FLRA 178, 179-81 (1986). Negotiable were proposals requiring performance standards to be established in accordance with applicable law, including 5 USC 4302(b). <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Metal Trades Council and Dept. of Navy, Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span>, 38 FLRA 59, 62 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA strikes down proposals that it decides cross the line from very general to specific criteria governing performance standards. <span class="Italic">NTEU and USDA, Food and Nutrition Serv., W. Region</span>, 42 FLRA 964, 984-85, 986-87 (1991) (Provision 7), resolved as nonnegotiable portions of a proposal that standards "be objective" and "be observable and measurable and reasonable and realistic":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding the reference to application that appears in the prefatory portion of this provision and the Union's claim that the disputed portions of this provision only come into effect in relation to the application of performance standards, we conclude that the disputed portions, as written, concern the content of performance standards. Subsection 2 states, "[t]hey will be objective." Subsection 5 states, "[t]hey will be observable and measurable and reasonable and realistic." It is clear that the "they" to which those portions refer are the performance standards themselves and that the reference to application establishes the point at which others will be judged for compliance with the criteria specified in the provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[P]roposals that specify substantive criteria with which the content of performance standards and critical elements must conform directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work. As we noted in our discussion of Provision 6, what is critical is not the point at which the Agency will be held accountable for complying with prescribed criteria but whether the prescribed criteria place conditions on the content of performance standards and critical elements. In our view "objective," "observable," "measurable," "reasonable," and "realistic" all constitute substantive criteria. Although these terms may be general in nature, they establish characteristics that performance standards must possess and, consequently, "[condition] the content of standards consigned to management discretion[.]" <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 767 F.2d at 1318.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that general criteria governing the determination of the content of a performance standard of critical element directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">OHA, Baltimore</span>, 39 FLRA at 350-54; <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Association and Patent and Trademark Office, Department of Commerce</span>, 25 FLRA 384, 386 (1987)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have found that the disputed portions of this provision specify substantive criteria governing the determination of the content of performance standards, we conclude that the disputed portions directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work. As was the case with Provisions 5 and 6, the record established in conjunction with this provision is insufficient to allow a determination as to whether any of the disputed portions of the provision constitute an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the disputed portions of Provision 7 are not within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was a proposal that "performance element standards shall be fair and equitable." The requirements of the proposal were not restricted to the application of the performance appraisal system but, instead, "applied to the content of the system." <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-144, FUSE and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 38 FLRA 456, 464-66 (1990) (Proposal 3) (relying on <span class="Italic">AFGE, Dept. of Educ. Council of AFGE Locals and Dept. of Educ.</span>, 34 FLRA 1114 (1990) (Proposal 1)). Proposals that, in one sentence, required performance standards to be fair, objective, job-related, and measurable, and in the next sentence stated that the application of standards will be made in a fair and equitable manner, were nonnegotiable. The structure of the proposals permitted an arbitrator, under the first sentence, to review the standards in isolation and not only in the context of application of the standards. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3748 and Agric. Research Serv., N. States Area</span>, 20 FLRA 495, 497 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Dept. of Educ. Council of AFGE Locals and Dept. of Educ.</span>, 34 FLRA 1114, 1115-18 (1990) (Proposal 1 was nonnegotiable: requiring performance appraisal system that will be fair, equitable, and job related; proposal would determine content of performance standards).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that performance standards and their application must be fair was not negotiable: the proposal was specifically directed at the content of the standards themselves and permitted an arbitrator to substitute his judgment as to the content of the standard for that of agency management. Only general requirements pertaining to the application of established standards could be negotiated. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 17 FLRA 790, 792 (1985). <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Baltimore</span>, 39 FLRA 346, 350-51 (1991), resolved as nonnegotiable Provision 2 for undue specificity. The proposal defined standards to include requirements that they be objective ("free from personal feelings or opinions that might bias the ratings of actual performance"), explicit ("clearly written and free of ambiguities"), observable or measurable (specifying "discernable conditions, characteristics...allow[ing] for differentiation between levels of performance"), and attainable ("barring unexpected circumstances beyond the employee's control, the expectations will most likely be met because they are commensurate with the level of the employee's job responsibilities"). Limitations on contractual refinement of standards notwithstanding, FLRA permits grievances to be reviewed in arbitration that challenge the objectivity of standards. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station and AFGE Local 2221</span>, 30 FLRA 616 (1987). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-615.html#sec6-616">Factors Beyond Control of Employee</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-14-654.html#sec6-655">Definition of Work Errors and Productivity</a>"; <span class="Italic">Newark AFS</span> is discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-14-626.html#sec6-619">Coverage of Grievance Procedure; Grievance Review Standard</a>," and in Chapter 9, "<a href="0100-2023-17-326.html#sec9-324">Critical Elements, Performance Standards</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">If a proposal seeks to define critical elements or rating elements in qualitative <span id="page_1071"></span>terms, it will be assessed in the same manner as a proposal seeking to provide qualitative or quantitative definition to a performance standard [discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-14-655.html#sec6-656">Performance Measurement; Statistical Applications; Forced Distributions</a>"]. Criteria for ratings elements for Veterans Administration Title 38 employees were nonnegotiable to the extent proposals required them to be job-related, accurate, measurable, and not abstract or subjective. The proposals interfered with the right to assign work by permitting arbitral review of management's determination of the content of performance standards. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 29 FLRA 515, 534-42 (1987) (Proposal 8).</p>
