<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-269"><span class="space">h.</span> Family Medical Leave Act; Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act</h5>
<p class="noindent">The FMLA and FEFFLA provide the government flexibility to meet the needs of employees for leave to deal with exceptional health or family problems. [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-148.html#sec6-149">Family Leave</a>," concerning negotiability of proposals implementing the statutes.] <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2328 and VAMC Hampton</span>, 62 FLRA 63, 64 n.1 (2007), said of the FMLA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Private sector employees are covered by Title I of the FMLA, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2611, and implementing regulations issued by the Department of Labor at 29 C.F.R. Part 825. Most federal employees are covered by Title II of the FMLA, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6381, and implementing regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) at 5 C.F.R. Part 630, subpart L. Certain employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, including nurses employed by the Veterans Health Administration under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(1), are covered by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, which must be consistent with Title I and II of the FMLA, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1201(b)(3)(i), and follow the Department of Labor regulations for private sector employees, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1201(b)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent">Sustaining an award determining that an agency could properly require documentation to support FMLA or FEFFLA leave requests, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2006 and SSA, Philadelphia</span>, 54 FLRA 110, 115-17 (1998), explained operation of the two statutes:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Agency's disciplinary action was not justified, because the grievant's absences were excused under both the FEFFLA [Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act] and FMLA [Family Medical Leave Act]. Enacted in 1994, FEFFLA revised existing provisions pertaining to Federal employees' sick leave. The FMLA, enacted in 1993, set forth new rights and obligations regarding both annual and sick leave for public and private sector employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Existing sick leave law pertaining to Federal employees, as implemented by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.403, provided that an agency may require medical documentation or other administratively acceptable evidence to substantiate a request for sick leave. The FEFFLA revision expanded the permissible grounds for sick leave as well as the amount of time allowed for sick leave. However, it did not alter the Agency's right to require corroborative documentation. Consequently, prior Authority precedent in this regard was unaffected by the FEFFLA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the provisions of the FMLA permit the employer to require medical certification for absences.[7] Regulations implementing the FMLA, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.311,[8] specifically state that if the employee does not produce proper certification, the leave will not be considered FMLA leave and the employee can be considered AWOL. Additionally, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in its Final Rules and Regulations, explained that "[a]n employee may not retroactively invoke his or her entitlement to FMLA leave for a previous absence from work." Family and Medical Leave, 61 Fed. Reg. 64,445 (1996) (codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1203(b) (1998)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383 states, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An [employer] may require that a request of leave [to care for a family member or for a serious health condition of the employee] be supported by a certification issued by the health care provider.... The employee shall provide, in a timely manner, a copy of such certification to the [employer].</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;According to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.109, most Federal employees are covered by the FMLA under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6302-87.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the FMLA, when an employee's unscheduled absence satisfies the requirements of the FMLA, the agency's charge of AWOL must be scrutinized in light of the employee's rights and requirements under FMLA. <span class="Italic">See Manuel v. Westlake Polymers</span> <span class="Italic">Corp.</span>, 66 F.3d 758, 760 (5th Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">Manuel</span>). The court in <span class="Italic">Manuel</span> held that an employee does not need to request family medical leave to get the protection of the FMLA<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 764. However, OPM, in its Final Rules and Regulations, revised 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1203(b) to clarify that an employee who chooses to take FMLA leave must request entitlement to such leave. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1203(b) (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the Authority has held that an employee is entitled to sick leave, and may not be charged AWOL, when the employee submits administratively acceptable evidence of illness prior to the disciplinary action<span class="Italic">. American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2408 and</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Juan, Puerto Rico</span>, 52 FLRA 992, 995-96 (1997) (<span class="Italic">VAMC, San Juan</span>); <span class="Italic">see also, U.S. Department of the Air Force, Robins Air Force Base</span>, <span class="Italic">Warner Robins, Georgia and American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 987</span>, 41 FLRA 635, 639 (1991) <span id="page_2210"></span>(<span class="Italic">Warner Robins</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that an arbitrator cannot sustain an agency's discipline of a grievant for AWOL solely on the basis of failure to follow sick leave procedures without deciding whether the grievant submitted "administratively acceptable evidence" to support an absence. <span class="Italic">Warner Robins</span>, 41 FLRA at 640. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.403, administratively acceptable evidence may be, but is not limited to, such documentation as the employee's certification as to the reason for the absence or a medical certificate.[9] An agency's discretion as to whether an employee's documentation constitutes "administratively acceptable" evidence is limited only by the requirement of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">VAMC, San Juan</span>, 52 FLRA at 996 n.6 (citing <span class="Italic">Miller v. Bond</span>, 641 F.2d 997, 1003 (D.C. Cir. 1981)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.403 states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An agency may grant sick leave only when supported by administratively acceptable [evidence]. Regardless of the duration of the absence, an agency may consider an employee's certification as to the reason for his or her absence as evidence administratively acceptable. However, for an absence in excess of 3 workdays, [or] for a lesser period when determined necessary by an agency, the agency may also require a medical certificate or other administratively acceptable evidence as to the reason for an absence....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Arbitrator found that although the grievant was required by the Agency to submit medical documentation showing the reasons for her absences, the grievant did not do so. The record contains only one medical certification for the time period in question, for which the Agency did not charge the grievant AWOL. The Arbitrator also found that the record showed that the grievant was familiar with the requirements for FMLA leave as she had taken FMLA leave previously. Thus, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant's statements, without the requisite medical documentation as required by Agency, did not constitute administratively acceptable evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, we find that, based on his factual findings, the Arbitrator properly sustained the Agency's 1-day suspension of the grievant for being AWOL on the basis of the grievant's failure to follow sick leave procedures, and correctly considered the issue of whether the grievant presented administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity in support of her absences.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Hockman</span> decision, cited by the Union, is distinguishable from this case. In that case, the MSPB did not find that the employee failed to request or provide reasons for the absence. Rather, the MSPB found that the agency erred by not proving that the employee's request and reason were not <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>. In the instant case, the Agency never challenged the grievant's reasons for her absences. The Agency simply required the grievant to report her unscheduled absences in a timely manner and submit documentation to corroborate such absences. The Arbitrator found that the grievant failed to do either.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, neither the FEFFLA nor the FMLA relieves employees of the responsibility to properly document such absences, as required by an Agency. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's award is not contrary to the FEFFLA or the FMLA.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">USDA, FSIS and AFGE Nat'l Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals</span>, 63 FLRA 559, 561-64 (2009), set aside an award that improperly interpreted FMLA documentation requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title II of the FMLA, which covers most federal civil service employees, entitles an employee to twelve workweeks of leave where, among other circumstances, the employee suffers a "serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1)(D); <span class="Italic">see also Bremerton Metal Trades Council,</span> 62 FLRA 391, 393 (2008) (<span class="Italic">Bremerton</span>). Under the FMLA, agencies may require that a request for leave for a serious medical condition be supported by a written medical certification from the employee's health care provider. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(a). As relevant here, the required certification will be sufficient if it states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;the date on which the serious health condition commenced;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;the probable duration of the condition;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;the appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the condition; [and]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;...(B)...a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of the position of the employee[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(b); <span class="Italic">see also </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(b)(1)-(3), (5). The implementing regulations for Title II of the FMLA state that, if an employee does not produce proper certification in a timely manner, then the agency may treat the employee as AWOL. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(i)(1); <span class="Italic">see AFGE, Local 2006,</span> 54 FLRA 110, 115-17 (1998) (employee who failed to report unscheduled absences in a timely manner and to submit corroborating documentation not covered by FMLA); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, Local 2328,</span> 62 FLRA 63, 65 (2007) (finding of AWOL appropriate where employee failed to enter request for all types of leave, including FMLA leave, into the computer system and to submit appropriate documentation); <span class="Italic">Dias v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 53, 55-56, 58 (2006) (sustaining finding of AWOL where employee failed to provide requested medical documentation in a timely manner).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the absence of Authority precedent addressing the requirement governing the content of FMLA medical certification, the Authority looks to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) for guidance. <span class="Italic">See Bremerton,</span> 62 FLRA at 393 (Authority citing MSPB precedent as guidance on FMLA issue). When interpreting FMLA certification requirements, the MSPB has held that a report describing the history and progress of an employee's condition, including when and how he became incapacitated, how he was treated, and the duration of the incapacity, was sufficient to meet the FMLA requirements. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Dep't of the Interior,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 54, 77 (1997). By contrast, the MSPB has found that a physician's note, which stated only that the employee's "condition rendered him unable to work" for one month did not comply with the medical certification requirements of the FMLA because it did not provide "the date that the serious health condition commenced, its probable duration, and appropriate facts regarding [the] condition, incapacitation, examination, or treatment." <span class="Italic">Burge v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 75, 85-86 (1999) (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Arbitrator found that the medical certification forms submitted by the grievant contained the physician's name, contact information and signature; the dates of the grievant's medical visits; the dates that the grievant was unable to work; the date he could return to work; and a statement that he was unable to work due to a "medical illness." The Arbitrator stated that this information "substantially complie[d]" with the requirements for FMLA. He found that, in conjunction with the grievant's applications for leave, these certifications established that the grievant had a serious health condition that prevented him from performing his normal job duties, that he was treated for this condition, and that he was incapacitated for the period specified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After considering the entire record, we find that the grievant's medical certifications are inadequate under the FMLA because they give no "appropriate medical facts...regarding the serious health condition" and no "statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of the position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(b)(3) and (4)(8); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(b)(3) and (5). In this regard, the FMLA regulations provide that "appropriate medical facts" include "a general statement as to the incapacitation, examination, or treatment that may be required." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(b)(3). The regulations also require that the statement regarding an employee's ability to perform essential job functions be based on written information from the agency or a discussion with the employee about these job functions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(b)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant's medical certifications were insufficient because they stated only that the grievant was unable to work due to a "medical illness." Although, under the FMLA, the grievant was not required to provide a diagnosis, he was required to provide medical documentation with sufficient medical facts to explain the nature of his incapacity and the reasons he was disabled from performing his essential job functions. Because the grievant's medical documentation did not supply this information, the Arbitrator erred in finding that the grievant's medical certifications substantially complied with the minimum requirements of the FMLA statute. <span class="Italic">See Burge,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. at 85 (a physician's note stating that the employee's "condition" rendered him "unable to work" for one month was not sufficient under the FMLA).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In coming to his decision, the Arbitrator relied, in part, on the July 25, 2005 letter from the grievant's physician, the contents of which are not in the record. Even without considering the contents of that letter, it would not provide a valid basis for FMLA leave because it was not timely submitted. The FMLA regulations require that an employee provide adequate medical information within 15 days of an agency request or, if that is not practicable, within 30 days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(h). The regulations further state that, if an employee does not provide the requested documentation after the leave has commenced, then the agency may charge the employee with AWOL. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(i)(1). Here, the physician's letter was not provided until nearly nine months after the Agency notified the grievant that his medical certification was not adequate. Therefore, the physician's letter, was untimely under the regulations and was not a valid basis for finding that the grievant had established his entitlement to leave under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">See Dias,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. at 57-58 (reversing administrative law judge's finding that agency had abused its discretion in denying FMLA where employee did not meet time limits under FMLA regulations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Arbitrator's award is deficient because it is contrary to the medical certification requirements of Title II of the FMLA.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;The information on the medical certification shall relate only to the serious health condition for which the current need for family and medical leave exists.

If an employee submits a completed medical certification form signed by the health care provider, the agency may not request new information from the health care provider. However, a health care provider representing the agency...may contact the health care provider...for purposes of clarifying the medical certification.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(h)&#x2003;An employee must provide the written medical certification required by paragraph[ ] (a)...no later than 15 calendar days after the date the agency requests such medical certification.

<p class="noindent-1">(i)&#x2003;If, after the leave has commenced, the employee fails to provide the requested medical certification, the agency may</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(I)&#x2003;Charge the employee as absent without leave (AWOL); or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Allow the employee to request that the provisional leave be charged as leave without pay or charged to the employee's annual and/or sick leave account, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA sustained an award that the grievant was properly denied FMLA leave while the employee was on an indefinite suspension. Despite the medical condition of the grievant, the arbitrator determined that the reason the employee could not work was the indefinite suspension, not a condition covered by FMLA, <span class="Italic">Bremerton MTC and Dept. of Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</span>, 62 FLRA 391, 393 (2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the grievant was denied his rights under the FMLA because the Arbitrator misinterpreted 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1208(k). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1208(k) an agency may pursue a performance or adverse action against an employee even where the employee has requested FMLA leave. However, contrary to the Union's assertion, nothing in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1208(k) requires an agency to grant FMLA leave in circumstances where such leave is not otherwise appropriate. Here, whether the grievant's suspension was or was not an adverse action has no bearing on the case because the grievant's illness occurred after he was placed on an indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this respect, the FMLA entitles an employee to 12 workweeks of leave where, among other circumstances, the employee suffers a "serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1)(D). Here, as the Arbitrator found that the basis for the grievant's inability to perform his job was the loss of his security clearance and placement on an indefinite suspension, a fact to which we defer, the Union has not shown any statutory basis entitling the grievant to leave under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">See generally</span>, <span class="Italic">Abramson v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, 2006 MSPB Lexis 5366 (2006) (where agency action was not predicated on leave related conduct and the appellant was already on administrative leave, there was no reason to grant FMLA leave).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union argues that the grievant is "entitled to evoke [sic] FMLA for the times he was under doctor's care while on indefinite suspension" and that "[t]here is nothing in the C.F.R. stating the [g]rievant cannot evoke [sic] [the] FMLA while in an indefinite suspension. However, the Union fails to establish any basis under which the grievant would be entitled to sick leave under the FMLA. In this regard, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6382 provides for an entitlement to this leave where a "serious health condition," not a loss of a security clearance, is the reason for an employee being unable to perform the functions of his position. Consequently, as the Union failed to meet any of the criteria set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1), we deny the Union's contrary to law exception.</p>
