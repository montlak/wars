<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-121"><span class="space">6.</span> Medical Requirements; Accommodations and Waivers</h4>
<p class="noindent">Reviewed in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 723 and Dept. of Interior, Geological Survey</span>, 66 FLRA 639, 643-46 (2012), were several arrangements proposals designed to mitigate the effects of medical requirements and medical examinations the agency decided to impose on scientific personnel assisting in operation of agency vessels. The proposals excessively interfered with the right of the agency to establish internal security; they did not constitute permissive subjects of bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_694"></span>B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Meaning</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree that: (1) Proposal 4 would define as crewmembers only employees whose primary duties involve vessel operations; (2) Proposal 5 would maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> with regard to medical testing; and (3) Proposal 6 would require the Agency to make reasonable accommodations that are not required by law for scientific personnel with disabilities. In addition, the parties agree that all three proposals would prevent the Agency from applying the policy to scientific personnel, thus barring the Agency from subjecting scientific personnel to medical and physical exams and to random drug and alcohol testing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union disputes the Agency's claim that the proposals affect management's rights, argues that the proposals are within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and (3), and are also electively negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). In these circumstances, the Authority will first address the proposal's claimed effect. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NAGE, Local R1-109</span>, 54 FLRA 521, 527 (1998). <span class="Italic">See also AFGE, HUD Council of Locals 222, Local 2910</span>, 54 FLRA 171, 178 (1998). If the proposal affects a management right, the Authority will then consider whether the proposal is negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) or (b)(3), and then, if necessary, whether the proposal is electively negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NAGE, Local R1-109</span>, 54 FLRA at 527.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The proposals affect management's right to determine internal security practices</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's right to determine internal security practices includes the authority to determine the policies and practices that are part of an agency's plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, or operations against internal and external risks. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 1547</span>, 63 FLRA 174, 175-76 (2009). Where an agency shows a link or reasonable connection between its security objective and a policy or practice designed to implement that objective, a proposal that conflicts with the policy or practice affects this management right. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 176.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has stated that it is "well established that the implementation of a drug testing program constitutes an exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices." <span class="Italic">Int'l Fed'n of Prof'l &#x0026; Technical Eng'rs, Local 89</span>, 48 FLRA 516, 519 (1993) (Member Armendariz concurring) (<span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 89</span>). <span class="Italic">See also, e.g., NTEU</span>, 43 FLRA 1279, 1302 (1992); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 446</span>, 43 FLRA 836, 852, 906-07 (1991) (Member Talkin dissenting); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Nat'l Border Patrol Council &#x0026; Nat'l Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv. Council</span>, 42 FLRA 599, 626 (1991). The Authority also has stated that "[d]rug testing is linked to management's right to determine its internal security practices because it contributes to the objective of protecting the [a]gency's personnel, property, and operations from the threat of employee use of illegal drugs." <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 89</span>, 48 FLRA at 519. <span class="Italic">See also, e.g., AFSCME, Local 3097</span>, 42 FLRA 412, 424 (1991). Further, the Authority has found that a proposal similar to Proposals 4, 5, and 6--which would have limited the types of positions the agency could subject to random drug testing--affected management's right to determine internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 443.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency argues that applying the policy to scientific personnel will enable the Agency to ensure that scientific personnel are medically and physically fit, and not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, when assisting in the operation of Agency vessels. The Agency contends that, as a result, the policy will decrease the risk of danger to employees, vessel operations, and the public. Based on these arguments, and consistent with the precedent set forth above, we find that the Agency has demonstrated a link between its safety-related objectives and the policy. Further, because Proposals 4, 5, and 6 would bar the Agency from applying the policy to scientific personnel, we find that the proposals conflict with the policy, and therefore affect management's right to determine internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so finding, we acknowledge the Union's claim that the policy is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(5), 46 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101(31), and 46 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 16.105. However, negotiability proceedings under &#x00A7; 7117 of the Statute are not the appropriate vehicle to challenge the legality of the policy. <span class="Italic">See AFSCME, Local 2830</span>, 60 FLRA 124, 127 n.* (2004). Accordingly, the Union's arguments do not provide a basis for finding the proposals within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Union's claim, that the proposals enforce applicable laws, does not support a finding that the proposals are within the duty to bargain.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the proposals enforce applicable laws.&#x2003;But management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute--including management's right to determine internal security practices--are not limited by applicable laws. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 58 FLRA 175, 178 (2002). As such, the Union's claim does not provide a basis for finding that the proposals are within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The proposals are not negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">i.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 7106(b)(2)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the proposals are procedures under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute because "[the policy] will have [a] significant impact on...scientific personnel," and that "[w]ho is impacted by the implementation of [the policy] will be determined by procedures agreed upon."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2424.25(c)(1)(ii) of the Authority's Regulations, an exclusive representative must set forth its arguments and authorities supporting any assertion that its proposals constitute an exception to management rights, including "[w]hether and why the proposal[s]...constitute[ ]...negotiable procedure[s] as set forth in...[&#x00A7;] 7106(b)(2)." When a union fails to support such a claim, the Authority rejects it as a bare assertion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NLRB Union</span>, 62 FLRA 397, 403 (2008). Here, the Union claims that the proposals are procedures, but presents no argument or authority to support that claim. Consistent with the above-cited regulation and precedent, we reject the Union's claim regarding &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) as a bare assertion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">ii.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 7106(b)(3)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">When considering whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority applies the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under this analysis, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 31; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 58 FLRA 616, 617-18 (2003) (citing <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-100</span>, 39 FLRA 762, 766 (1991)). If the proposal is determined to be an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right(s). <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;The Union asserts that the Authority "no longer applies the 'excessive interference' test." While the Authority does not apply an excessive-interference test when reviewing exceptions to arbitration awards, <span class="Italic">see EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 116-18, or in negotiability cases involving an agency head's disapproval of an agreed-upon contract provision, <span class="Italic">see NTEU</span>, 65 FLRA 509, 511-15 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting), <span class="Italic">pet. for review dismissed sub nom. U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of the Pub. Debt, Wash., D.C. v. FLRA</span>, 670 F.3d 1315 (2012), the Authority continues to apply this test when considering whether a bargaining proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), <span class="Italic">see, e.g., NATCA</span>, 66 FLRA 213, 216 (2011). Accordingly, we apply it here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the proposals are arrangements, we find, for reasons set forth below, that they are not appropriate because they excessively interfere with management's right to determine internal security practices. <span class="Italic">Cf. Int'l Fed'n of Prof'l &#x0026; Technical Eng'rs, Local 1</span>, 49 FLRA 225, 244 (1994) (Member Talkin dissenting as to other matters) (assuming an arrangement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the proposals would benefit scientific personnel by relieving them from: (1) performing crewmember duties; (2) being disciplined for performing crewmember duties poorly; (3) undergoing medical and physical exams; and (4) undergoing random drug and alcohol testing. But by precluding the Agency from subjecting scientific personnel to medical and physical exams, and random drug and alcohol testing, the proposals would prevent the Agency from ensuring that scientific personnel are fit, and drug and alcohol free, to safely contribute to vessel operations and help during emergencies. As such, the proposals would impose a heavy burden on the exercise of management's right to determine internal security practices. In this regard, the Authority repeatedly has found proposals that barred or significantly limited random drug testing excessively interfered with management's right to determine internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">Weighing the benefits that the proposals would provide against the burdens they would impose, and consistent with the above-cited precedent, we find that the proposals excessively interfere with management's right to determine internal security practices, and are not appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">iii.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 7106(b)(1)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that Proposal 4 is negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. Under &#x00A7; 2424.25(c)(1)(i) of the Authority's Regulations, an exclusive representative must set forth its arguments and authorities supporting any assertion that its proposals constitute an exception to management rights, including "[w]hether and why the proposal[s]...constitute[ ] a matter negotiable at the election of the agency under...[&#x00A7;] 7106(b)(1)."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Types of Employees</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that Proposal 4 pertains to the "types" of employees. As relevant here, &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) provides that an agency may elect to negotiate on the "numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty." In determining whether a proposal is within the scope of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), the Authority assesses whether the proposal concerns: (1) the numbers, types, and grades; (2) of employees or positions; (3) assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty. <span class="Italic">E.g., NAGE, Local R5-184</span>, 51 FLRA 386, 394 (1995). In this connection, the phrase "numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty" in &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) applies to the establishment of agency staffing patterns, or the allocation of staff, for the purpose of an agency's organization and the accomplishment of its work. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 1546,</span> 58 FLRA 368, 369-70 (2003). The Authority interprets "types" as referring to distinguishable classes, kinds, groups, or categories of employees or positions that are relevant to the establishment of staffing patterns. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R5-184</span>, 52 FLRA 1024, 1031 (1997) (Member Armendariz dissenting). Because the Union claims that Proposal 4 concerns the "types" of employees within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), the Union "bears the burden of establishing a relationship between the claimed type and staffing patterns." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1031. <span class="Italic">Accord</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.25(c)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that Proposal 4 "seeks to define two types of employees[:]...crewmembers and scientific personnel," and argues that the Agency "could negotiate the proper mix of employees and the duties that each group performs." Although the Union asserts that the proposal concerns "types" of "employees," it does not assert that, or explain how, the proposal relates to any "organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty," <span class="Italic">see NAGE, Local R5-184</span>, 51 FLRA at 394, and does not establish a relationship between the claimed type and staffing patterns, even though the Union has the burden to do so, <span class="Italic">see NAGE, Local R5-184</span>, 52 FLRA at 1031. <span class="Italic">See also Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Evergreen Chapter</span>, 55 FLRA 591, 593-94 (1999) (<span class="Italic">ACT</span>). <span class="Italic">Accord </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.25(c)(1)(i). As such, the Union has not demonstrated that Proposal 4 concerns the types of employees assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Methods and Means of Performing Work</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the Agency could "elect to negotiate over the methods and means of performing work." In determining whether a proposal concerns the methods or means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), the Authority has construed "method" to refer to the way in which an agency performs its work, and has construed "means" to refer to any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work. <span class="Italic">E.g., ACT</span>, 55 FLRA at 593.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the proposal concerns a method or a means, then the Authority employs a two-part test to determine whether the proposal affects the management right. <span class="Italic">E.g., NTEU, Chapter 83</span>, 64 FLRA 723, 725 (2010). In this connection, it must be shown that: (1) there is a direct and integral relationship between the method or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission; and (2) the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">E.g., Prof'l Airways Sys. Specialists</span>, 56 FLRA 798, 803 (2000). Where a party fails to support its claim that a proposal concerns a method or means of performing work, the Authority rejects the claim as a bare assertion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, Local 2139</span>, 57 FLRA 292, 295 n.7 (2001) (Member Wasserman dissenting) (<span class="Italic">Local 2139</span>). <span class="Italic">Accord</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.25(c)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union's only assertion regarding methods and means is that "[s]ince this [p]roposal could also affect the way the Agency accomplishes [its] mission, [the Agency] could elect to negotiate over the methods and means of performing work." The Union does not: (1) explain how the proposal involves a method or a means; (2) demonstrate a direct and integral relationship between a method or means and the accomplishment of the Agency's mission; or (3) demonstrate that the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which a method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Accordingly, we reject the Union's claim as a bare assertion. <span class="Italic">See Local 2139</span>, 57 FLRA at 295 n.7.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 and Army Med. Dept. Agency,</span> 64 FLRA 949, 950-61 (2010), involved a proposal that employees have the right to refuse in a flu shot program for medical, religious, or personal reasons when the agency insisted on immunization of employees to reduce potential outbreaks of influenza that could adversely affect military preparedness and medical care. The proposal infringed the right to establish internal security and it was not an appropriate arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, the right to determine internal security practices includes an agency's right to determine the policies and practices that are necessary to safeguard its personnel, physical property, or operations against internal and external risks. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Fed. Prison Council 33,</span> 51 FLRA 1112, 1115 (1996) (<span class="Italic">AFGE-FPC</span> <span class="Italic">33</span>). Internal security practices may also include safeguarding the public. <span class="Italic">See NTEU,</span> 59 FLRA 978, 981 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where management shows a link or a reasonable connection between its objective of safeguarding its personnel, physical property, or operations or the public, and a policy or procedure designed to implement that objective, a proposal that "conflicts with" that policy or procedure affects management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). <span class="Italic">AFGE-FPC 33,</span> 51 FLRA at 1115. Once a link has been established, the Authority will not review the merits of an agency's plan in the course of resolving a negotiability dispute. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2143,</span> 48 FLRA 41, 44 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has established the requisite link between its internal security objectives and its mandatory vaccination policy.&#x2003;The Agency has implemented its mandatory vaccination policy to prevent the occurrence and spread of influenza among its staff and those with whom its staff comes in contact. The Agency has determined that by vaccinating all health care personnel who have direct patient contact, it will reduce the frequency with which those individuals contract influenza. This in turn will reduce employee absences and the risk of transmission of the virus to patients, including military personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's policy is reasoned and supportable. Further, there is a clear and logical connection between immunization through vaccination and the Agency's objective of safeguarding the public, and its personnel, property, and operations. For these reasons, the Agency has established a reasonable link between its mandatory vaccination policy and its internal security objectives.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's claims challenging the efficacy of the Agency's vaccination policy do not require a different result. For example, the Union questions whether vaccinations would prevent the spread of influenza or would interfere with the Agency's performance of its work. As indicated above, the Authority does not review the merits of an agency's plan once a reasonable link has been established between an agency's policy and its internal security objectives. <span class="Italic">AFGE-FPC 33,</span> 51 FLRA at 1115. Therefore, the Union's claims, addressing the merits of the Agency's vaccination policy, are not apposite.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, it is undisputed that the Union's proposal conflicts with the Agency's mandatory vaccination policy by making the policy optional for all affected employees. Therefore, we find that the proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The proposal is not an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proposal that affects management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute is nevertheless negotiable if it constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. A proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement if it is: (1) intended as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right; and (2) appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87,</span> 21 FLRA 24, 31 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). The Authority determines whether a proposal excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right by weighing the benefits afforded employees under the proposed arrangement against the burden on the exercise of the right. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA at 981.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As argued by the Union, the proposal affords unit employees a number of benefits. With respect to influenza vaccinations, the proposal would reinforce employees' right to make decisions regarding their health and determine which invasive medical procedures they will subject their bodies to. In addition, by providing employees with the right to opt out of the Agency's mandatory vaccination program, employees would be able to eliminate any risk of an adverse reaction to a flu shot, such as contracting influenza or experiencing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_696"></span>However, the extent and character of these benefits is uncertain. The Agency's policy already provides an "opt out" opportunity for employees with medical or religious objections. The Union does not supply any information concerning the proportion or number of employees not covered by these exclusions who might opt out for other unspecified personal reasons. Furthermore, the record does not disclose any information regarding the process employees would use to opt out or how (or whether) frivolous employee claims would be screened out.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, the weight attributable to the proposal's benefits is diminished to the extent that the benefits are vague and generalized, rather than clearly and precisely substantiated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal's burden on the exercise of management's internal security right is significant. The proposal would prevent the Agency from implementing a plan to deal with the risk of serious harm to its staff and patients as a result of the influenza virus. The Agency's plan is specific and targeted, applying to health care workers with direct patient care responsibilities. That the proposal affects actions at a health care facility only reinforces the significance of the proposal's burden on management's rights. Similarly significant are the studies the Agency cites regarding the benefits of immunization of health care workers for both the patients and the workers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, the proposal's burden on the Agency's exercise of its management right to determine its internal security practices outweighs the proposal's uncertain benefit to employees. Accordingly, the proposal excessively interferes with management's right to determine its internal security, and is not an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">Cf. NAGE, Fed. Union of Scientists &#x0026; Eng'rs, Local R1-144</span>, 42 FLRA 730, 737 (1991) (in finding that a union proposal to ameliorate effect of mandatory drug testing was unduly burdensome, the Authority "recognize[ed] that employees' personal convictions are important to them[,]" but found that, "if management were required, without exception, to accommodate employees' personal beliefs in determining assignments to positions, the effective and efficient operation of the Agency could be severely handicapped").</p>
