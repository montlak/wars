<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-99"><span id="Page_3517"></span><span class="space">2.</span> Job Training; Change in Supervision</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Accommodation may include additional training in the work performed by an appellant, enhanced supervision, specific structured assignments and clear written assignment directions, as long as it can be said that the accommodations "quite possibly" will ameliorate the adverse effects of a disability, e.g., epilepsy, on the appellant's ability to perform. <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 37 MSPR 12, 15 (1988). However, under <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 490, 495-96 (1995), an agency need not train an employee in new job skills to accomplish a reassignment to another position sought by a disabled individual, a carpenter, seeking to avoid removal by assignment to a clerical position requiring typing skills:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency found that the appellant was not qualified for these positions as he lacked the requisite typing proficiency of 40 words per minute. The appellant does not challenge the agency's assertion that typing proficiency of 40 words per minute was a valid criterion of the clerical positions. However, he contends that the agency was obligated to offer him training and the opportunity to improve his typing skills to the requisite level. We disagree. There is no obligation to find a position for an applicant who is not qualified for the position sought. <span class="Italic">See Americans With Disabilities Act Handbook</span>, Appendix M, p. 2 (1991). Our conclusion is consistent with case law under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as courts have consistently recognized that an employer could decide not to consider those applicants with disabilities who lacked the qualifications for a position as long as the qualification was unrelated to any physical or mental limitation imposed by the disability. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Pandazides v. Virginia Board of Education</span>, 946 F.2d 345 (4th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Upshur v. Love</span>, 474 F. Supp. 332, 342 (N.D. Cal. 1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant appeal is not a case in which the training at issue was requested as a means of accommodating a disability, in conjunction with an argument that the employee was otherwise qualified to perform the position sought with reasonable accommodation of his disability. The training requested by the appellant was solicited as a means to accommodate a lack of qualifications/skills deficiencies which are <span class="Italic">unrelated</span> to the appellant's physical limitations. This is more than is required by the Rehabilitation Act, which only obligates an employer to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability (unless to do so would impose an undue hardship). Thus, since the appellant is not an "otherwise qualified" individual with respect to the clerical positions, as he lacks the minimal typing speed, we find that the agency's duty to accommodate the appellant's disability did not extend, under the facts of this appeal, to providing him with typing training.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, when a laborer became unable to perform her work, the agency was not required to continue assignment of the individual in a secretarial position requiring heavy typing when the appellant could only perform light typing. The appellant must be able to perform the full range of work in the new job. <span class="Italic">Faulk v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 415, 417 (1987), determined that the agency would not be required to provide training to qualify the employee to take the reassignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency repeats its earlier assertion that appellant possessed neither the education nor the experience necessary to qualify for the clerical position. The agency further alleges that according to Handbook X-118 entitled "Qualification Standards for Positions Under the General Schedule," the GS-2 Clerk-Typist position requires skill in operating a typewriter evidenced by a performance test or certification and, for the GS-3 Clerk-Typist position, six months' experience or one year of full-time study in a business or secretarial school. The agency asserts that appellant would have to attend school for one year to qualify for the GS-3 level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, 30 MSPR at 486, reassignment of a handicapped employee is within the scope of reasonable accommodation. A handicapped employee, however, is entitled to such reassignment only upon a showing that the employee is able to perform the essential functions of the position in question. <span class="Italic">See Rosiak v. Department of the Army</span>, 31 MSPR 140, 144 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, appellant admitted at the hearing that her typing skills were severely limited and that while she occupied the Clerk-Typist position, she typed only names or performed other light typing. While the record shows that appellant's performance in the temporary Clerk-Typist position was clearly satisfactory, the agency asserts that, when occupied by a permanent employee, typing is a major duty of the position. Since appellant lacked the requisite typing skills, she was unable to perform an essential duty of the position. Therefore, she was not entitled to reassignment to the Clerk-Typist position as an accommodation to her physical handicap, <span class="Italic">see Rosiak,</span> 31 MSPR at 144, and appellant has not proved that her removal was based on handicap discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some employees develop adverse reactions to their supervisors. <span class="Italic">Miller v. DHHS</span>, 23 MSPR 128, 134-35 (1984), decided that accommodative responsibility to an employee with a mental impairment did not extend to her reassignment to a supervisor with whom she might work better:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also conclude that the presiding official erred in finding that the agency did not reasonably accommodate appellant's mental handicap. Our review of the record shows that the agency demonstrated a sympathetic, understanding attitude towards the appellant over a period of several years. Two previous supervisors, Robert Bottomley and Dale Allen, testified that in 1979 and 1980, they discussed counseling with the appellant, specifically the Employee Assistance Program, and spent an inordinate amount of time supervising the appellant for her work and conduct deficiencies. During those times, the appellant never alleged handicap, disability or discrimination based on handicapping condition. Appellant was referred to the Employee Assistance Program by her supervisor, Don Johnson in August, 1981. She was then transferred to the VA Psychiatric Clinic in October, 1981, under the care of Beth Voso, psychiatric social worker. Additionally, she was treated by Dr. Renner, psychiatrist, who prescribed anti-anxiety medication for her psychiatric problems.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has shown remarkable tolerance, patience and restraint in progressively disciplining the appellant, complying with her requests for transfer and counseling her. The requirement of an agency to reasonably accommodate an employee's handicap, however, does not obligate the agency to tolerate indefinitely misconduct or inefficiency stemming from that handicap. <span class="Italic">See Smith v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service,</span> 13 MSPB 267, 14 MSPR 656, 658 (1983). Appellant has failed to present evidence of any psychosis or significant memory or intellectual deficits which would have prevented her from fully understanding the nature of her problems and her need for psychological counseling. Accordingly, we conclude that the presiding official erred in finding that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate the appellant's handicap.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant has argued that the agency could have accommodated her handicap by reassigning her from her supervisor, the individual she perceived as an adverse atmosphere. Although the Board held in <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. United States Postal Service,</span> 16 MSPR 530, at 537-38 (1983), that an agency is not required to consider reassignment of an employee in order to accommodate her handicapping condition, in this case the agency had reassigned appellant without success on numerous occasions.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">As to accommodation for an individual suffering from a stress-related disability through reassignment to another supervisor, the Board seemed to endorse the possibility without finding that it was required by the facts of <span class="Italic">Day v. Dept. of Army</span>, 47 MSPR 617, 618-22 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from the position of Supervisory Recreation Specialist, GS-9, at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, on December 3, 1988. It based the removal on a charge of inability to perform the duties of the position due to a medical condition. In the notice of proposed removal, the agency cited an October 3, 1988 statement from the appellant's doctor, Bernard H. Shulman, to support its action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge with the Board's Chicago Regional Office found that the agency proved the charge by a preponderance of the evidence. The administrative judge cited Dr. Shulman's opinion that the appellant had the ability to perform if she were not under stress but that she was unable to continue working under the supervision of Joan Capella, the main cause of her stress. She found that both the agency and the appellant agreed that the appellant could not continue working under Ms. Capella, and therefore that the agency's reason for removing the appellant was meritorious when the action was taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, however, that the appellant's removal did not promote the efficiency of the service because Ms. Capella testified at the Board hearing that she was leaving Ft. Sheridan, and thus, would <span id="Page_3518"></span>no longer be the appellant's supervisor. In reaching this conclusion, the administrative judge cited the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Street v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 23 MSPR 335 (1984), for the proposition that a removal does not promote the efficiency of the service where evidence is produced before the Board that an employee removed for inability to perform is now able to perform. She found that here the appellant's disabling mental condition arose from the supervision of Ms. Capella. Because Ms. Capella would no longer be the supervisor over the appellant's position, she found that the agency's decision, although proper when taken, could no longer stand because of the changed circumstances. In doing so, she cited Dr. Shulman's opinion that the appellant could perform the duties of her position under different supervision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Concerning the second defense, the administrative judge found that the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination because she is a handicapped person under 29 CFR 1613.702(a) and she identified possible accommodations for her handicap. The administrative judge concluded, however, that the appellant was not a qualified handicapped person because at the time of her removal there was no reasonable accommodation available. Specifically, she found that removing or disciplining Ms. Capella or Frank Zerbinos, the appellant's second-line supervisor, was not a reasonable accommodation. She also found that there were no vacant positions available that were compatible with the appellant's mental condition. Finally, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to establish that the agency's stated reasons for failing to accommodate her were a pretext for handicap discrimination. She rejected the appellant's assertion that Ms. Capella and Mr. Zerbinos caused her mental illness, finding that the appellant's medical history showed that she had been treated for depression before she worked under these supervisors. In addition, she found that appellant failed to show that Ms. Capella's supervision amounted to harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency contends that the administrative judge erred in relying on <span class="Italic">Street</span> to reverse the appellant's removal. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Street</span>, the agency removed the appellant for physical inability to perform the duties of his position. After he was removed, however, the appellant received medical treatment that resulted in his full recovery. The Board found that although the agency proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant was physically unable to perform when he was separated, his new evidence of recovery was timely submitted and showed that the agency's action did not promote the efficiency of the service. In reaching its conclusion, the Board stressed that there had been "a unique intervening substantial change" in the appellant's physical condition after the agency's decision and that it was considering the "unique circumstances" of the case in arriving at its decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Street</span>, however, for the reasons discussed below, the evidence here does not show that the appellant is able to perform the duties of her position at this time. Thus, the analysis in <span class="Italic">Street</span> concerning the efficiency of the service does not apply<span class="Italic">. See Cason v. NASA</span>, 37 MSPR 261, 266-67 (1988). Rather, we find that if any consideration should be given to the departure of Ms. Capella at all, it should be in the context of the appellant's affirmative defense of handicap discrimination, that is, whether Ms. Capella's departure shows that the agency could reasonably accommodate the appellant's handicap. <span class="Italic">See Cason</span>, 37 MSPR at 265-69.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously noted, the administrative judge found that although the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination, she failed to prove her affirmative defense because she did not articulate a reasonable accommodation or show that the agency's action constituted a pretext for handicap discrimination. In her cross petition for review, the appellant has not clearly contested the administrative judge's finding that her condition could not be reasonably accommodated, although she does assert that Mr. Zerbinos, her second-line supervisor, has also left his position, implying that the sources of stress in her former position have at least decreased.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence, however, supports the administrative judge's findings that the appellant's mental condition did not begin with Ms. Capella and Mr. Zerbinos. In a March 22, 1988 letter, Dr. Shulman stated that the appellant had a history of dizziness dating back to 1985, and that she was treated for depression in 1983 and 1987. Similarly, there is an indication that the appellant's problems may have begun in her previous position at Camp Carol in Korea.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the evidence does not show that the appellant could work in stressful situations under other supervision.[5] In this regard, we note that the administrative judge's finding, apparently based on Dr. Shulman's testimony, that the appellant could perform the duties of her position under different supervision was inconsistent with her later finding that Dr. Shulman's testimony was at odds with his October 3, 1988 letter, which she interpreted as meaning that the appellant could not work in any stressful position....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The description of the appellant's former position reveals the stressful nature of the job. It indicates that the appellant served as director of a program for a large community of over 27,000 people. The appellant had full responsibility for the planning, development and organization of a wide range of programs and activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of Dr. Shulman's testimony reveals that although Dr. Shulman indicated that he did not intend the letter to state that the appellant could not work in any stressful environment, he did not assert that she could work under a different supervisor. Moreover, Dr. Shulman admitted that he had not met the appellant's supervisors, had not been to the appellant's work site, and had not observed the appellant while she was working. Thus, even if the departures of the appellant's supervisors after her removal should be considered, we find no error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's condition could not be reasonably accommodated by the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once again, the possible accommodation of a supervisory switch was considered but rejected, <span class="Italic">Camacho v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-10-0967-I-4 (NP 8/25/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge did consider the appellant's claim that, because of her difficulties with the Deputy Brigade Commander, the agency should have assigned her to another supervisor. The administrative judge found that the agency was not required under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to transfer the appellant to another supervisor, citing <span class="Italic">Weiler v. Household Finance Corp</span>., <a href="http://openjurist.org/101/f3d/519/weiler-v-household-finance-corporation">101 F.3d 519</a>, 526 (7th Cir. 1996) (the ADA does not allow an employee to establish the conditions of her employment, notably, who will supervise her, and nothing in the ADA allows this shift in responsibility). On review, the appellant urges that, in <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. Dresser Rand Co</span>., 193 F.3d 120, 122-23 (2d Cir. 1999), such a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule was found to be inconsistent with ADA case law. In <span class="Italic">Kennedy</span>, the court found that there is a presumption that a request to change supervisors is unreasonable and that the burden of overcoming that presumption lies with the employee. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We have considered the appellant's claim that, based on the alleged threat, she should be reassigned to another supervisor and not be required to have any interaction with the Deputy Brigade Commander, even though her position is within the Brigade. We find, however, that it is not sufficient to overcome the presumption that her request to change supervisors was unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. DOD</span>, 85 MSPR 463, 467-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-13 (2000), disclaimed any interest in setting aside a removal based on behavior the appellant asserted resulted from aggravation of a stress disorder that could have been alleviated by a reassignment away from the supervisor:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reopen this appeal to modify the AJ's analysis of the appellant's disability discrimination claim. The first step in such an analysis is to determine whether the appellant is disabled by his bipolar disorder. Not every individual who suffers from an impairment is disabled under the law, and the question of who is disabled is an individualized one. <span class="Italic">See Caseres v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 642, 644 (1997). To be considered disabled, one must have a "physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual," have "a record of such an impairment," or be "regarded as having such an impairment." 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(1) and 1630.2(g). After reviewing all of the medical evidence of record, the AJ found that the appellant established that he is disabled because he suffers from a mental or emotional condition, bipolar disorder, that substantially limits a major life activity, his ability to work as a teacher.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">According to the lnterpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> [ADA] issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), an employer or an EEOC investigator should examine whether an impairment limits an individual's ability to work only after determining that the impairment does not limit other major life activities such as performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, breathing, walking, or caring for one's self<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR Part 1630 App. (explaining 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(3) (giving examples of "major life activities"). Although the ADA does not apply to federal agencies, its standards have been incorporated into the Rehabilitation Act, under which the appellant's disability discrimination claim arises. 29 USC &#x00A7; 791(g). Here, the AJ focused on whether the appellant was substantially limited in working, as do we, but only because that is the way the appellant argued his case; the appellant did not attempt to show that his bipolar disorder limited other major life activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, for the activity of working, "substantially limits" means that the individual is generally foreclosed by his impairment from the type of employment involved. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3); <span class="Italic">Groshans v. Department of the Navy,</span> 67 MSPR 629, 636 (1995). More generally, the individual's impairment must significantly restrict him with respect to the condition, manner, or duration under which he can perform a particular life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which an average person in the general population can perform the same activity. <span id="Page_3519"></span>29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1); <span class="Italic">Stevens v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 MSPR 619, 624 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not allege that he was generally foreclosed by his bipolar disorder from performing the work of a teacher. In fact, although he was diagnosed in 1986, he performed his teaching duties satisfactorily, with the exception of some minor performance-related problems in 1994, from 1988 until 1996 when he was notified that he was to be reassigned to Japan. And, he has consistently claimed that he could continue to perform his teaching duties if allowed to remain in Germany, or if assigned to a working environment free from stress, a claim the AJ reasonably construed as meaning if allowed to work under a principal other than Mr. Grenier. An inability to work for a particular supervisor or in a particular position does not constitute a disability under the Rehabilitation Act because it is not a barrier to employment and does not foreclose an employee generally from his line of work. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i); <span class="Italic">see Vyas v. Department of the Army,</span> 83 MSPR 452 &#x00B6; 12 (1999); <span class="Italic">Sublette v. Department of the Army,</span> 68 MSPR 82, 86-88 (1995). As such, and notwithstanding the episodic nature of bipolar disorder, which we acknowledge, we find that the appellant has not shown that he was disabled by his bipolar disorder.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that we were to find that the appellant was disabled, and even if, contrary to the AJ's finding, we were to conclude that his misconduct was consistent with, and a manifestation of, his bipolar disorder, <span class="Italic">see Brinkley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 37 MSPR 682, 684 (1988), we would still find, as set forth below, that he did not prove his allegation of disability discrimination. Subsequent to the issuance of the ID in this case, the Board issued <span class="Italic">Laniewicz v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 83 MSPR 477 (1999), which did not make new law, but synthesized an existing principle regarding an agency's obligation to accommodate a disabled employee who commits misconduct. In <span class="Italic">Laniewicz</span>, relying on extensive precedent of the courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Board clearly held that neither the Rehabilitation Act nor the Americans with Disabilities Act immunize disabled employees from being disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, provided the agency would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8. In other words, an agency is never required to excuse a disabled employee's violation of a uniformly-applied, job-related rule of conduct, even if the employee's disability caused the misconduct. And, because agencies have a duty to provide accommodation only to "otherwise qualified" employees, agencies have no obligation to accommodate employees who have committed misconduct because, as a, result of their misconduct, they are not "otherwise qualified" employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official explained why the sustained misconduct was serious, detrimental and disruptive to the educational process, and deserving of removal. Specifically, she explained that the appellant's disrespectful and disorderly conduct adversely affected public confidence in him, in his assigned school, and in DoDDS as an educational institution; that his intimidating behavior and verbal outbursts caused continual disruption and reflected a lack of proper attention to his academic program; and that his actions impaired his ability to be a positive role model in the community. Although the appellant denied engaging in some of the charged misconduct, the AJ generally found his denials incredible as to the sustained specifications, further finding on the appellant's part a tendency to misconstrue people's motives and conduct, and to become agitated and upset at the slightest provocation....&#8197;As such, we find that the sustained incidents of disorderly and disrespectful conduct and failure to follow directives were not only job-related, but reflected a violation of workplace standards, consistent with the business necessity of running the school and its mission of providing quality education within a safe environment for its students. <span class="Italic">See Laniewicz</span>, 83 MSPR 477 at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7. And, the appellant submitted no evidence, nor did he allege, that the agency treated him differently from other employees who engaged in similar actions, or even that there were any other employees who had engaged in such actions. Thus, we find no basis upon which to find disparate treatment in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Aldrup v. Caldera</span>, 274 F.3d 282, 287 (5th Cir. 2001) (claim that the disability of depression was caused by having to work with certain employees showed only that the employee was unable to perform a job at a specific location and was not evidence of a general inability to perform a broad class of jobs).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Bolstein v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 55 MSPR 459, 462-65 (1992), the appellant, a GS-14 attorney, was demoted to GS-13 based on a charge of unacceptable performance. The appellant claimed that reasonable accommodation included restructured job requirements and enhanced supervision. That accommodation was not required:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator apparently found, that the appellant had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination, concluding that: (1) The appellant was a "handicapped person" as defined under 29 CFR 1613.702(a), and his demotion was based on his handicap; and (2) he had articulated what he believed to be "reasonable accommodations" under which he could perform the essential functions of his position<span class="Italic">. See Savage v. Department of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 152 (1988). Once an appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination, the agency has the burden of showing that the action at issue was based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, a burden that can be met by showing that the appellant is not a "qualified handicapped person." <span class="Italic">See Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 153. "Qualified handicapped person" is defined as a handicapped person "who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others." 29 CFR 1613.702(f). "Reasonable accommodation" may include actions such as job restructuring, acquisition of special equipment, and other, similar actions, but does not include accommodation that would impose an undue hardship on the agency's operations. 29 CFR 1613.704(b),(c). In his request for review, the appellant challenges the arbitrator's finding, that he was not a qualified handicapped employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In making this finding, the arbitrator relied on two reports from a physician (Dr. Katzow) that described the appellant's handicapping condition. Dr. Katzow stated in those reports that the appellant suffered from chronic depression of moderate severity and also had a serious personality disorder marked by obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Analyzing the effect of these problems on the appellant's work performance, Dr. Katzow commented that the appellant's ability to perform comprehensive legal analysis and prepare written legal material was significantly impaired. He also observed that the appellant had little interest in his work, preferring limited, less complex tasks and not wishing to take on projects requiring much responsibility or initiative. Dr. Katzow's diagnosis was pessimistic, indicating that the appellant's condition was not likely to improve. He suggested that the appellant's work performance could be improved by very close supervision and a more structured work environment. In his written reply to the agency's proposal to demote him, the appellant argued that his condition could be accommodated by restructuring his position to eliminate appellate brief preparation duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record contains the appellant's position description and his performance standards, both of which make clear that a GS-14 Attorney is expected to handle complex matters with little or no supervision. The position description further notes that the incumbent is expected to display a high degree of independence, resourcefulness, and initiative in analyzing problems for their impact on the legal, administrative, and policy areas. The appellant's first- and second-line supervisors testified as well that all the GS-14 Attorney positions in their office required the incumbents to work on difficult, complex issues with little or no supervision. An agency classification specialist confirmed that the position required the exercise of a high degree of responsibility and judgment, with minimal supervision, in resolving complex problems.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As outlined above, the evidence of record amply supports the arbitrator's finding that Dr. Katzow's suggested accommodation (more structured work environment, close supervision) was inconsistent with the essential functions of the appellant's position. It is clear that the incumbent of a GS-14 Attorney position is expected to exercise substantial responsibility and independence of judgment without a great deal of supervision, and that Dr. Katzow's accommodation would not enable the appellant to perform with that degree of independence, discretion, and responsibility. The appellant argues that he could perform the essential functions of his position with the requested accommodation, asserting that he performed acceptably in the position for many years <span class="Italic">before</span> his performance problems began. This argument merely begs the question of whether his suggested accommodation would ameliorate those problems to the extent that he could now perform the essential functions of his position. The appellant thus has not shown error in the arbitrator's finding here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the appellant argues that the arbitrator should not have accepted the agency's "conclusory claims," that removing appellate work from the appellant's position was not a reasonable accommodation that would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of his position. In fact, the appellant's first- and second-line supervisors offered detailed explanations of their position on this point. They reported that appellate brief preparation constituted a major component of the work that the attorneys in their office performed, and that removal of those duties from the appellant's position would substantially lessen the value and responsibility of the position. It was also pointed out, with reference to the evidence of record, that the appellant had failed to perform acceptably on nonappellate work. In addition, the hearing record and the other evidence of record show that even if appellate work was removed from the appellant's duties, the nature of his position would still require him to do complex work with little or no supervision, work that according to Dr. Katzow the appellant is incapable of performing. The agency met its burden here of showing that its action was legitimate and nondiscriminatory<span class="Italic">. See Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 153.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also appears to make the general argument, that regardless of the formal duties and requirements of his position, the agency was <span id="Page_3520"></span>required to adjust those duties and requirements so that he would be capable of performing them. The Board has held that the employing agency must consider restructuring the position to which a handicapped employee seeks to be assigned<span class="Italic">. See Clark v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 36 MSPR 162, 165-66 (1988). However, it has also held that an agency is not required to provide an accommodation that would result in a substantial modification of job requirements<span class="Italic">. See Lynch v. Department of Education</span>, 31 MSPR 519, 528 (Spec. Pan. 1986), <span class="Italic">vacated on other grounds sub nom. Lynch v. Bennett</span>, 665 F. Supp. 62 (D.D.C. 1987). Here, Dr. Katzow flatly states that the appellant is unable to analyze comprehensively, that his condition significantly impairs his ability to perform appropriate legal analysis, and that it impairs his capacity to prepare written legal material, including briefs and opinions. It is equally clear that the exercise of those legal skills constitutes an indispensable part of the appellant's position. Under these circumstances, the agency is not obligated to consider every conceivable accommodation advanced by the appellant especially when to do so would clearly require substantial modification of the essential requirements of his position<span class="Italic">. See Lynch</span>, 31 MSPR at 528.</p>
