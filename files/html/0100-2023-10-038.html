<p class="Body-Text">Appellant has the right to counsel. If he is going to use an attorney, however, he must timely make his own arrangements. The appellant cannot expect a continuance if counsel is selected right before a hearing date. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Milner v. DOJ</span>, 77 MSPR 37, 42 (1997) (continuance was properly denied to the appellant who had no "sound reason" for delaying several months in selecting new counsel until days before the start of the hearing); <span class="Italic">Weirauch v. Dept. of Army</span>, 26 MSPR 53, 58 (1985) ("Although appellant is entitled to a representative of his own choosing, he is responsible for arranging his representative's presence at the hearing."); <span class="Italic">Hoyt v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 22 MSPR 264, 267 (1984) ("[T]he appellant failed to show good cause why the one month period between her request [for a postponement] and the scheduled hearing date would have been insufficient to obtain a representative, particularly in view of the fact that her appeal had been active for over one year."); <span class="Italic">Springer v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 534, 535-36 (1982) (AJ did not err by denying a continuance request, received on the day before the hearing, by a lawyer who was withdrawing from the case after the lawyer had received four separate communications from the Board's regional office concerning the removal appeal); <span class="Italic">Sofio v. IRS</span>, 7 MSPR 667, 669, 7 MSPB 493 (1981) (on the third request for a postponement of the hearing, "appellant's representative failed to show good cause...or why he was unable to avoid scheduling the hearing on a date when he had prior commitments"); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Larry v. DOJ</span>, 76 MSPR 348, 352 (1997) (appellant proceeded without counsel at the hearing; to the extent that the appellant argues that his counsel was negligent, the appellant is responsible for the actions and inactions of his chosen representative); <span class="Italic">Brothers v. USDA</span>, 20 MSPR 377, 379-80 (1984) ("That appellant did not select an attorney as his representative earlier in the proceedings does not constitute a basis for finding good cause where he voluntarily designated the union official to represent him."; "That appellant has a right to select a representative of his own choosing, including a lawyer, does not diminish his responsibility to timely select a representative in such a manner that he is able to prepare appellant's case and represent him at the hearing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On July 14, 1982, the Board's Assistant Managing Director for Regional Operations issued a Regional Office Memorandum providing guidance about requests for continuances by attorneys protesting scheduling conflicts in consolidated air traffic controller appeals. Although the memo was advisory, it provides some direction as to resolution of continuance requests based on retention of counsel or based on counsel's workload:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The right to retain counsel of one's own choice is not absolute and must be balanced against the public's interest in the prompt and orderly administration of justice and the avoidance of unreasonable delays. <span class="Italic">United States v. Burton</span>, 584 F.2d 485, 489 (D.C. Cir. 1978), <span class="Italic">cert. den.</span>, 439 U.S. 1069 (1979). These countervailing considerations must be weighed in the context of the individual case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Ungar v. Sarafite</span>, 376 U.S. 575, 589 (1964). Among the several factors to be considered in arriving at the delicate balance required are the inconvenience to the parties, witnesses, counsel and the court, and whether the defendant has contributed to the circumstance which gives rise to the request for a continuance....&#8197;Unreasonable delays can adversely affect the rights of other defendants as well as the public interest....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The cases involving counsel's conflicting obligations to appear in other proceedings turned on whether there was ample notice of the conflict or whether the court was promptly informed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. United States</span>, 288 F.2d 259 (D.C. Cir. 1923); <span class="Italic">In re Sutler</span>, 543 F.2d 1030 (2d Cir. 1976). In ruling on a motion for continuance, the presiding official can presumably take notice of the number of other cases before the Board in which the appellant's attorney is also the designated representative and may consider whether counsel should reasonably have foreseen the likelihood of a conflict and whether he should have taken steps to ensure that associates would be available and prepared to appear in that event. An attorney's obligation to prepare adequately and give appropriate attention to his work (<span class="Italic">see</span> ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 6, Ethical Consideration 6-4 and Disciplinary Rule 6-101[A] (3)) must impose some outer limit on the number of clients whose representation he can undertake singlehandedly....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1332"></span>A representative should be timely identified to the Board. If the circumstances of the case suggest that the appellant is representing himself, a continuance will not be granted because the appellant states, on the date of the hearing, that he has a representative who cannot attend the hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ciccone v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 40 MSPR 224, 228 (1989). A hearing need not be continued if the union that is the designated representative fails to provide a properly prepared representative at the hearing. <span class="Italic">Berry v. VA</span>, 3 MSPR 237, 239, 3 MSPB 332 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ramos v. VA</span>, 4 MSPR 516, 519, 5 MSPB 46 (1981) (continuance was properly denied when the chief steward of the union could have made arrangements for alternate representation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should it become clear that an appellant's representative will not be able to assist the appellant, the appellant has the duty to obtain a new representative promptly; indefinite or repeated continuances will not be provided if the appellant fails to exercise reasonable diligence to obtain a new representative who can pursue the case through a hearing. <span class="Italic">Doles v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 547, 548, 4 MSPB 65 (1980); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Shorter v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 28 MSPR 622, 625 (1985) (AJ did not err in denying a continuance after determining that the appellant's representative should be disqualified for a conflict; another representative was present who was familiar with the case; instead, the appellant decided to waive the hearing); <span class="Italic">Castle v. USDA</span>, 12 MSPR 159, 160 (1982) (appellants had adequate time to retain new counsel if they deemed it necessary).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant acts quickly to seek a continuance after a representative has withdrawn, the AJ errs by denying a continuance if there was but one earlier continuance requested by an earlier representative. <span class="Italic">Mann v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 44 MSPR 197, 200 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Kendrick v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 696, 698 (1988) (continuance should have been granted to an appellant whose union representative withdrew from the case six days before the hearing; the appellant moved the next day for a 30 day extension to secure another representative); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 267, 270 (1991) (it was an abuse of discretion for the AJ to deny a continuance requested at the hearing when the appellant learned that his representative withdrew only shortly before the hearing; there was no showing that a continuance would have been burdensome or caused undue delay, and no prior continuance had been requested). <span class="Italic">Schnugg v. DOD</span>, 60 MSPR 510, 512-14 (1994), spelled out the need to grant a continuance when a principal representative withdrew right before the hearing and left the alternate representative inadequately prepared to proceed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's right to a hearing is of cardinal importance, and an appellant may waive this right only by clear, unequivocal, and decisive action. <span class="Italic">See Berry v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 51 MSPR 317, 321 (1991). Indeed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has noted that, in passing the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Congress provided appellants with the right to a hearing to protect their rights and to guarantee a full and fair consideration of their cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Callahan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 748 F.2d 1556, 1558-59 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Because of its circumscribed standard of review of Board fact findings, the court noted that the hearing, which is the appellant's only opportunity "to probe anew the factual portion of his case before an impartial tribunal...will not be cavalierly or lightly disregarded." <span class="Italic">Id. See also Frampton</span> <span class="Italic">v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Interior</span>, 811 F.2d 1486, 1489 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding that a fair hearing on appeal to the Board is "the basic cornerstone of employee rights").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The basis for a hearing continuance rests upon this sound policy, that employees be given a hearing on the merits of their cases and be ensured a fair opportunity to secure an independent review of an agency's action. <span class="Italic">See Mann v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 44 MSPR 197, 200 (1990). In determining whether a continuance is warranted, the Board must also balance the competing interests of avoiding unwarranted delays and expediting the administrative resolution of employee appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 183 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these considerations to the present case yields the conclusion that the administrative judge erred by denying the appellant's request for a postponement of the scheduled hearing, and by concluding that the appellant waived his right to a hearing. In reaching this conclusion, we note that it is uncontested that the appellant learned on the morning of the scheduled hearing that Mr. Maxwell withdrew from the case. While the appellant still had the services of the AFGE, his assertions that AFGE's role was limited to supporting Mr. Maxwell and that AFGE was not privy to the conversations between Mr. Maxwell and the agency representative regarding his case in the weeks immediately preceding the scheduled hearing, are also uncontested. Moreover, while a designation of Mr. Maxwell as representative was not filed until less than a week before the hearing, the affidavit the appellant filed with the administrative judge states that he retained Maxwell about three weeks prior to that date, thereafter limiting the union to only a supporting role.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, this was the appellant's first request for a continuance, there was no showing that a continuance would have been unduly burdensome or caused unwarranted delay, there was no indication that the agency would have been prejudiced by a brief delay, and the appellant's submissions requesting the continuance were ultimately in compliance with the Board's regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.51(c). While the appellant failed below to make as detailed a case for postponement as he did on petition for review, we find nonetheless that the basic facts entitling him to the delay he sought were timely submitted to the administrative judge. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant is entitled to the hearing he requested. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 47 MSPR 267, 270 (1991). <span class="Italic">Cf. Lee v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 48 MSPR 274, 278-79 (1991) (continuance not warranted where appellant's request did not comply with Board's regulatory requirements, denial of request did not cause him to be unprepared to present case on day of hearing, and prior continuance had already been granted).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board determined that an AJ improperly denied a continuance to allow new counsel to prepare for a hearing when the continuance was requested approximately a week in advance of the hearing, <span class="Italic">Bergstein v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 56, 59-60 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant explained further to the presiding official that his time to seek counsel was cut short. He said that he had received materials from the Board which he believed should have been sent to his representative. He tried to get in touch with his representative on account of this, but was unable to reach him. He then borrowed money and retained an attorney.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official did not question the appellant about these representations or the time frame in which they occurred. After the appellant had offered his explanation, the presiding official indicated the hearing would proceed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A number of times during the hearing, the appellant reiterated his belief that he could not adequately represent himself without counsel. He declined to make an opening statement or to cross-examine the first two witnesses for this reason. After the testimony of two other witnesses, he attempted to ask questions. However, the presiding official did not allow him to continue because he found that the appellant was testifying rather than cross-examining. Finally, the appellant declined to make a closing statement because, he repeated, he could not properly represent himself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, it was incumbent on the presiding official in this case to weigh the adverse effects of the delay which would be necessitated by a postponement against the public policy to afford a fair opportunity for the appellant to exercise his statutory right to be represented by counsel of his choice. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a)(2). The appellant explained to the presiding official how he used the time he had to retain counsel. Within two weeks of filing his appeal, he had obtained representation. Later, he expended time trying to locate his non-attorney representative and, being unsuccessful, he spent additional time arranging to borrow money to retain counsel and, presumably, locating and meeting with his chosen attorney.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that appellant tried to avoid any adverse consequences to himself as a result of the inaction of his first chosen representative, by borrowing money and retaining legal counsel, or from his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> presentation of his appeal, by repeatedly requesting a postponement of his hearing so that his attorney could represent him. It is clear from the outset of the Board appeal that the appellant intended to be represented before the Board and he acted diligently and prudently to exercise that right.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's attorney, too, acted reasonably under the circumstances. He sought a postponement promptly upon being retained and he set forth specifically the bases of his request. This was the first and only continuance in the matter which counsel sought, and he had not participated in the choice of the hearing date, which was scheduled before he was retained by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, any adverse effects from delay of the hearing are indeterminate. The hearing date asked to be postponed was to occur more than 40 days prior to the end of the 120-day time frame, mentioned by the presiding official at the hearing, within which appeals are expected to be completely adjudicated by the Regional Office. The length of the delay which would have been responsive to the two bases for counsel's request, a prior court appearance commitment and the need to become familiar with the appellant's case, is not specified in the record. However, the uncertainty of the length of the delay in case adjudication could have been overcome by granting a limited postponement. There is no indication in the record that continuance of the hearing in this case would have prejudiced the agency or would have resulted in inordinate delays of the kind Congress intended to remedy in enacting 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(i)(4). <span class="Italic">See Dickerson v. Government of the District of</span> <span class="Italic">Columbia,</span> 3 MSPB 282, 3 MSPR 181 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Viewing this case in perspective, we find that the competing interests weigh more heavily on the appellant's side. The request for a postponement was made promptly after the appellant had acted diligently to retain counsel upon finding his original representative was inaccessible. There had been no prior postponements in the case, a short postponement was reasonable under the circumstances, and the appellant's assertion that his mental and physical condition prevented him from properly representing himself adequately at the hearing was unchallenged and confirmed by his actions at the hearing. In addition, the agency had no objection to a delay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Pecina v. Dept. of Army</span>, 65 MSPR 100, 103-04 (1994), <span id="Page_1333"></span>that an AJ erred by denying the appellant a continuance to obtain new counsel to conduct a telephonic hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The decision to grant a continuance of a hearing before the Board rests upon two considerations: (1) an employee's right to be given a hearing on the merits of his case and to be ensured a fair opportunity to secure an independent review of the agency's action; (2) the need to avoid unnecessary delays and expedite the administrative resolution of employee appeals. <span class="Italic">Schnugg v. Department of Defense,</span> 60 MSPR 510, 513 (1994). Thus, when a request for a continuance presents good cause and relates to a matter material to the appeal, the request should be granted in the absence of a showing that it would be unduly burdensome, harassing, or cause unwarranted delay<span class="Italic">. Wildberger v. Small Business Administration,</span> 63 MSPR 338, 343, <span class="Italic">dismissed,</span> 36 F.3d 1114 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying those considerations to the facts in this case, we find that the administrative judge erred in denying the appellant's request for a continuance of the hearing. On May 2, 1994, two days before the scheduled date of the hearing, the appellant's former attorney informed the administrative judge that, at the appellant's request, she would no longer be handling the appeal and requested in writing that a continuance be granted the appellant to allow him to retain new counsel. At the hearing on May 4, 1994, the appellant objected to the administrative judge's denial of his motion for continuance and argued that he would not be able to effectively represent himself without counsel. We do not find this unreasonable as the appellant had been represented throughout the proceedings and, therefore, would not have prepared himself to appear <span class="Italic">pro se</span> at the hearing. Furthermore, the issues in the appeal were complex, physical inability to perform the duties of his position and an affirmative defense of discrimination based on disability. Nor is the appellant's failure to obtain new representation in the brief period remaining before the hearing unreasonable. Therefore, we find that the appellant has shown good cause for the continuance and that the matter is material to the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon consideration of the other relevant factors, we find that granting a continuance would not have been burdensome, harassing or have caused undue delay. As the hearing was telephonic, it did not require travel of any of the parties. Furthermore, the appellant retained new counsel by May 10, 1994, less than a week after the originally scheduled hearing. Finally, the record does not show that a short delay would have placed any undue burden on the agency. The agency itself had been granted an eight-day continuance earlier. The record also shows that the hearing was continued a second time for approximately five days, although it does not indicate which party requested the second continuance. Thus, we find that the administrative judge abused his discretion in denying the appellant's motion for continuance....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Reid v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 182, 185-86 (1998), faulted an AJ for denying a continuance based on the appellant's need to obtain substitute counsel. The Board did not require the appellant to prove that harmful error was committed by having to represent himself at a hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that by motion dated November 7, 1996, and received by the regional office on November 12, 1996, the appellant's counsel requested a continuance of the November 15, 1996 hearing until December 13, 1996, on the basis that she was scheduled to be in a jury trial on November 25 and 26, 1996. The agency opposed the motion on the basis that the jury trial was not scheduled until 10 days after the Board hearing and that counsel had failed to show good cause for a continuance. The record does not document the administrative judge's response to this motion. By motion received by the regional office on November 15, 1996, however, the appellant's counsel indicated her withdrawal from the appellant's case. The record shows that the hearing proceeded as scheduled on November 15, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's allegation that he indicated that he wished to be represented by counsel is tantamount to an allegation that he desired a continuance of the hearing to do so. "'Good cause' warranting the grant of a postponement or continuance of Board proceedings is an elastic concept which rests upon principles of equity and justice." <span class="Italic">Etheridge v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 67 MSPR 53, 57 (1995). Here, the appellant's ability to adequately represent himself in the hearing is a matter that is material to his case, and the administrative judge should have informed him of the options of a postponement or continuance of the hearing, or dismissal of the appeal without prejudice to a timely refiling. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record, however, does not document any discussions between the administrative judge and the appellant concerning his representation after the withdrawal of his counsel. Thus, it is impossible to determine whether the appellant was denied his right to representation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a)(2); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.31(a); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Larry v. Department of Justice,</span> 76 MSPR 348, 352 (1997) (the appellant was not denied his right to legal representation during his hearing inasmuch as he stated that he did not want legal representation at the hearing because he could not afford it, he stated that he wished to proceed with the hearing and to represent himself, and he made that decision after consulting with his attorney). However, we note that the appellant had not previously been granted any continuances and that consideration must be given to his right to be ensured a fair opportunity to secure independent review of the agency's action. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant established that good cause existed for a continuance of the hearing in his appeal....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Bergstein v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 56, 58 (1985), a continuance should have been granted because counsel, who was obtained with some diligence by the appellant, had a court conflict and sought a postponement promptly after being retained. It was counsel's first request for a continuance, and counsel had not participated in the choice of a hearing date. There was nothing in the record to show that a continuance would have prejudiced the agency or resulted in inordinate delays of the nature Congress intended to remedy through enactment of 5 USC 7701(i)(4). The appellant maintained throughout the hearing that his mental and physical condition prevented him from properly representing himself. The denial of a continuance was reversed in another case involving counsel whose heart condition prevented her appearance; counsel notified the Board about a week before the hearing and the written notice of the condition arrived on the day of the hearing. <span class="Italic">Graham v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 439, 440 (1986). The AJ erred in refusing to continue a hearing when the appellant's attorney was admitted to the hospital on the day of the hearing; an unprepared associate appeared at the hearing to request the postponement. The AJ offered the associate an hour to review the file and prepare the case for hearing, an offer the associate could only refuse. There was no waiver of the right to a hearing by the associate's refusal to accept the offered hour to prepare the case. There was no evidence that the agency would be prejudiced by a reasonable hearing delay. <span class="Italic">Proos v. USDA</span>, 22 MSPR 541, 545 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A continuance was improperly denied where there was no demonstrable prejudice to the agency and when, six days before the hearing, the appellant informed the AJ of a scheduling conflict of the appellant's representative. <span class="Italic">Roberson v. DHHS</span>, 24 MSPR 240, 242 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army</span>, 41 MSPR 110, 113-14 (1989), an AJ was faulted for denying a continuance sought as a result of counsel's scheduling conflict:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Administrative judges have substantial discretion under 5 CFR 1201.41(b)(6) and (8) with respect to convening a hearing and ruling on motions....&#8197;However, a request for postponement of a hearing may be granted for good cause shown....&#8197;"Good cause" is an elastic concept which rests upon principles of equity and justice....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that such good cause for postponing the hearing exists under the circumstances of this appeal. The administrative judge originally scheduled a hearing 2 months in advance, and then, just 10 days before the originally scheduled hearing was to begin, he advanced the hearing date by 2 days. At the time, the appellant's attorney informed the administrative judge that he had hearing conflicts for both of the earlier days, but that he would seek their postponement. Shortly thereafter, 5 days before the hearing began, the appellant's attorney had the administrative judge notified orally that he was unsuccessful in his attempts to reschedule those earlier hearings, so that he could not attend the first 2 days of the Board hearing. We also note that the agency has not disputed the assertion of the appellant's attorney that the agency's representative had no objection to a continuance of the Board's hearing when the scheduling conflict was first raised. The administrative judge nonetheless informed the appellant that the hearing would proceed as scheduled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, the Board's regulations require that a motion for hearing continuance be made in writing, 5 CFR 1201.55, and, in this case, the appellant's attorney did not file a written motion for continuance until the first day of the hearing, just before it was to begin. We find that the administrative judge abused his discretion by not granting the motions for continuances upon being informed that the appellant's attorney could not alter his prior commitments. Scheduling conflicts can establish good cause for granted a requested postponement....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A continuance will not always be required when an attorney drops out of the case and another cannot quickly be found, <span class="Italic">Shindler v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 19 MSPR 60, 61 n.* (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We find that the presiding official did not abuse his discretion when he refused to postpone the hearing as good cause for the postponement has not been shown. In a notice sent on April 11, 1983, appellant was advised that the hearing was scheduled for Tuesday, May 24, 1983. He was further advised that pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.51, requests for postponement must be supported by an affidavit showing good cause and, in addition, that the request must be received "...as soon as the need for postponement is known but no later than five calendar days before the hearing." In a letter dated May 18, 1983, and received by the presiding official on May 23, 1983, appellant requested a postponement because he was dissatisfied with his current counsel and wanted a new one. At the hearing appellant stated that some two weeks prior to the hearing, his attorney had informed him that he did not wish to represent him. He also stated he contacted another attorney who "didn't have time" to <span id="Page_1334"></span>represent him. Appellant offered no explanation either as to why he took no additional steps to find an attorney or as to why he failed to promptly notify the presiding official of the problem. The presiding official found that good cause did not exist for postponing the hearing in light of appellant's failure to timely notify the Board, his lack of due diligence in securing representation and the Board's policy of adjudicating cases in 120-days. We concur. On their face, these facts do not constitute good cause for postponement. Moreover, when the presiding official asked appellant if he was prepared to go forward, appellant said "yes." The petition for review makes no showing of specific harm to appellant and we can find none. The postponement was properly refused and does not represent an abuse of the presiding official's discretion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Slatem v. Department of Defense,</span> 6 MSPB 623, 624 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The denial of a continuance was reasonable when there was a prior continuance; the appellant already designated and dismissed two representatives during the appeal; and the appellant was warned that a continuance would not be granted for the purpose of obtaining or changing counsel. The appellant was responsible for prosecuting his case in a timely manner. <span class="Italic">Manriquez v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 540, 541 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lee v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 274, 278 (1991) (AJ did not abuse discretion by declining a continuance of two weeks for the appellant to secure substitute counsel when one continuance was already granted, a proper continuance motion was not filed, and the appellant was aware that his lawyer was not responding to the agency's attempts to process the appeal); <span class="Italic">Burns v. DOD</span>, 36 MSPR 567, 568 (1988) (continuance was properly denied after appellant designated a first and second representative and could not come to terms with either by the time of the hearing); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hill v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 439, 444 (1990) (right to representation was not denied after the appellant's representative would not participate in a hearing; no further continuance was requested by the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant). The failure of an appellant to provide his representative correct information concerning a hearing date was insufficient to support a continuance motion made on the opening day of a hearing, when counsel was not previously designated after Board requests for a designation and notification concerning continuance requirements. <span class="Italic">Pendergraft v. TVA</span>, 6 MSPR 512, 513-14, 6 MSPB 430 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It was within the discretion of an AJ to decline to postpone a hearing when, although one representative of the appellant counsel appear, the appellant had two representatives, the hearing site was secured, and subpoenas were served, <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. IBWC</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCCARTHY_ROBERT_JOHN_DA_1221_09_0725_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_628714.pdf">116 MSPR 594</a>, 608-09 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-24, 2011 MSPB 74 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the administrative judge abused his discretion in denying the appellant's motion to postpone the hearing. Again, we find no abuse of discretion. On February 5, 2010, the appellant requested that the hearing scheduled for February 11 and 12, 2010, be postponed, stating that one of his designated representatives had conflicting obligations in another pending matter. The request did not suggest that his other designated representative was unavailable, and it stated that "Mr. McCarthy has entered his appearance in the case and is prepared to conduct the hearing himself." The administrative judge denied the appellant's request, noting, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that neither party had raised any objection to the hearing date at two previous prehearing conferences or indicated any potential conflict, and that hearing facilities had been reserved and subpoenas had been served on witnesses. He also noted that the appellant had designated two representatives and that the conflict appeared to involve only one and that he had advised the appellant during a telephonic conference concerning the request that he could proceed <span class="Italic">pro se</span> at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge has the authority to grant a request for postponement only upon a showing of good cause. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.51(c). We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to make such a showing below. Accordingly, the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the appellant's request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant next contends on review that the administrative judge erred in denying the appellant's motion at the hearing to admit as evidence documents that he claims were previously unavailable and that were wrongfully withheld by the agency in discovery. At the hearing, the administrative judge rejected the appellant's proffer of several documents into evidence on the ground that they were not included as exhibits in his prehearing submission. The appellant claims on review, as he did below, that these documents were previously unavailable because the agency wrongfully refused to provide them in response to his document production requests, and that he therefore had to obtain them "from alternative sources only days prior to the hearing." Again, we find that the appellant's own conduct during the course of discovery renders without merit his complaints concerning the agency's failure to comply with his document requests. Because the appellant has not established that the agency failed to comply with his document production requests, he likewise has failed to establish that the documents he sought through those requests were previously unavailable. The administrative judge therefore did not abuse his discretion in denying the appellant's motion to admit those documents as exhibits at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to continuances requested and granted for conflicting engagements of counsel, appeals are not to be held "in abeyance indefinitely pending the adjudication of a matter not shown to be related to the matters appealed." <span class="Italic">Brown v. Marine Corps</span>, 27 MSPR 178, 180 (1985). A continuance was properly denied to an appellant who was represented by a union chief steward after the desired representative could not attend the hearing because he wanted to attend a convention. General inconvenience is not a valid basis for a continuance; undue hardship must be shown. There was no showing of specific harm to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Daniels v. VA</span>, 5 MSPR 134, 137, 5 MSPB 197 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Teague v.

A continuance was denied when supporting medical evidence was unconvincing or nonexistent. A continuance was denied at the behest of an appellant's representative who claimed "gas pains." <span class="Italic">Mahnken v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 1, 6 (1987).</p>
