<p class="Body-Text">A dismissal with prejudice should not occur unless appellant clearly intends that result. The appellant's intent to withdraw an appeal with prejudice--as opposed to, for example, the need for a continuance--should be clearly expressed, <span class="Italic">Etheridge v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 53, 55-58 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 17, 1994, the appellant filed an appeal with the Board alleging that her retirement from her ES-2 Medical Center Director position, effective August 15, 1994, was involuntary. On November 27, 1994, the appellant submitted a letter to the administrative judge stating that she had just learned of her mother's stroke, her mother's doctor had "called for [her] to come to her bedside," and she could not "continue to pursue her appeal in a timely or reasonable manner." Because the appellant's submission was ambiguous, on December 1, 1994, the administrative judge ordered the appellant to advise him by December 12, 1994, as to whether she wished to withdraw her appeal. The administrative judge thereafter issued a December 13, 1994 order noting that the appellant had not responded to the first order, nor had she responded to the telephone messages that the administrative judge left on her answering machine. Accordingly, on December 13, 1994, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal with prejudice to refiling as withdrawn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge misunderstood the intent of her November 27 letter. She contends that she did not respond to the administrative judge's December 1 order and telephone messages because she was out of town until December 27, 1994, and could not retrieve her mail or her telephone messages until she had returned. She also submits an affidavit in which she describes her mother's serious illness and its effect on the appellant. The agency has timely responded in opposition to the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, an appellant's withdrawal of her appeal is an act of finality, and, in the absence of unusual circumstances such as misinformation or new and material evidence, the Board will not reinstate an appeal once it has been withdrawn. <span class="Italic">See DeVitto v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 64 MSPR 354, 356 (1994). However, a relinquishment of one's right to appeal to the Board must be by clear, unequivocal, and decisive action. <span class="Italic">See Massey v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 31 MSPR 435, 436-37 (1986); <span class="Italic">see also Schnugg v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 60 MSPR 510, 512 (1994) (an appellant's waiver of the right to a hearing must be by clear, unequivocal, and decisive action); <span class="Italic">Tozier v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, 41 MSPR 167, 169 (1989) (the appellant's letter to the administrative judge plainly and unequivocally stated that he wished to withdraw his appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the administrative judge was uncertain whether the appellant's November 27 letter was a request to withdraw her appeal. He dismissed the appeal as withdrawn because the appellant did not respond to his order for clarification and telephone messages. On petition for review, the appellant asserts that her November 27 letter was not intended as a withdrawal and submits an affidavit to show good cause for her failure to timely respond to the administrative judge's December 1 order and telephone messages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the appellant's affidavit, she learned on November 26, 1994, that her mother, who lives in New Jersey, had suffered a stroke. On November 27, her mother's doctor advised the appellant that her mother was deteriorating and that she should "come now if [she] wanted to speak to [her] Mother again." The appellant further states that she left Nebraska on November 28, that her mother was hospitalized and then transferred to a rehabilitation center where she remains, and that the appellant did not return to her home until December 27, 1994. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant's unrebutted affidavit is competent evidence to show the existence of her mother's medical emergency, the time period during which she was unable to prosecute her appeal, and her unawareness of the administrative judge's attempts to clarify her November 27 letter. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 54 MSPR 609, 611 (1992); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 52 MSPR 450, 452 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The circumstances that the appellant describes which led her to write the November 27 letter would justify an extension of time or withdrawal of the appeal without prejudice to refiling. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Biberstine v. DODDS</span>, 37 MSPR 248, 254 (1988) (a motion for continuance that presents good cause and clearly relates to a matter that is material to the case, in the absence of a showing that it would be unduly burdensome, harassing, or cause unwarranted delay, should be granted). "Good cause" warranting the grant of a postponement or continuance of Board proceedings is an elastic concept which rests upon principles of equity and justice. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 41 MSPR 110, 113 (1989); <span class="Italic">Roberson v. DHHS</span>, 24 MSPR 240, 241-42 (1984). The appellant's ability to participate in the adjudication is a matter material to the case. Had the administrative judge been aware of the circumstances requiring the appellant's absence, he could have advised the appellant of the options of a postponement or continuance of the proceedings or dismissal of the appeal without prejudice to a timely refiling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before an appeal is dismissed without prejudice to refiling, the other party should be afforded an opportunity to respond to the proposed dismissal. <span class="Italic">See Padilla v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 561, 564 (1993). The agency filed below an objection to considering the appellant's November 27 letter as a request to withdraw her appeal without prejudice to refiling. We find that the agency's argument that a dismissal without prejudice should not be granted "[i]n the interest of conservation of Board and Agency resources," does not outweigh the appellant's right to have her appeal adjudicated and to participate in that adjudication under the particular circumstances of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we find under these circumstances that this appeal should not have been dismissed as withdrawn with prejudice to timely refiling because the appellant did not withdraw it by clear, unequivocal, and decisive action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Massey</span>, 31 MSPR at 436-37.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ improperly dismissed an appeal when the appellant was not advised by the AJ that an alternative to withdrawal of the appeal was enforcement of a subpoena for a critical witness, <span class="Italic">Casimier v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 35, 36-38 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant does not deny that he withdrew his appeal. He claims, however, that he only withdrew his appeal because his witness, Dr. Hontas, could not appear on the date of the hearing, the administrative judge informed him that she had no power to enforce her subpoena of Dr. Hontas outside of Chicago, and she further counseled him that, without Dr. Hontas' testimony, he would not prevail. According to the appellant, the administrative judge advised him to choose between withdrawing his appeal and filing for disability retirement or losing everything by having the hearing without Dr. Hontas. On petition for review, the appellant asks why the administrative judge did not postpone the hearing instead of allegedly forcing him to choose between those two unpleasant alternatives.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the hearing tape, the administrative judge merely stated that the appellant had decided to withdraw his appeal and to pursue, instead, disability retirement from OPM. Nor does the initial decision shed any further light on the hearing or the appellant's decision to withdraw his appeal. Indeed, the administrative judge did not indicate in the initial decision whether she was dismissing the appeal with or without prejudice to refiling. Thus, we are unable to confirm the appellant's account of the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, if the appellant in fact requested at the hearing, either verbally or in writing, that the administrative judge enforce the subpoena of Dr. Hontas, the administrative judge should have considered requesting the appropriate United States district court to enforce the subpoena regardless of whether the hearing was held in Chicago or New Orleans. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.55, 1201.85(a); <span class="Italic">see also Porter v. Department of the Navy,</span> 6 MSPB 257, 6 MSPR 301, 305-06 (1981). If the appellant requested a continuance of the hearing in order to obtain Dr. Hontas' appearance at his hearing, the administrative judge should have granted this request. <span class="Italic">See Pecina v. Department of the Army</span>, 65 MSPR 100, 103 (1994) (when a request for a continuance presents good cause and relates to a matter that is material to the appeal, the request should be granted in the absence of a showing that it would be unduly burdensome, harassing, or cause unwarranted delay). Even if the appellant did not specifically request a continuance, given the appellant's problems in obtaining Dr. Hontas' testimony, the administrative judge should have informed him of the options of, e.g., a postponement or continuance of the hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Reid v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 MSPR 182, 185-86 (1998) (where the appellant's representative withdrew on the day of the hearing and the appellant indicated that he wished to be represented by counsel, the administrative judge should have informed the appellant of the options of a postponement or continuance of the hearing, or dismissal of the appeal without prejudice to a timely refiling). If the administrative judge in fact informed the appellant that he had to choose between withdrawing his appeal and filing for disability retirement or losing everything by having the hearing without Dr. Hontas, the administrative judge misinformed the appellant by failing to mention the appellant's<span id="Page_1085"></span> other options, e.g., a postponement or continuance of the hearing or enforcement of the subpoena, and by erroneously implying that the appellant could only file an application for disability retirement if he first withdrew his Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, the appellant has clearly indicated that his appeal was not resolved as he had thought in withdrawing his appeal, and that he desires to continue his Board appeal. Indeed, he timely filed his petition for review on the same day that the initial decision was issued. Under all of these circumstances, we find that this case must be remanded for further adjudication. <span class="Italic">See Scarboro v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 494, 496-98 (1992) (because of the appellant's erroneous belief that the Board lacked jurisdiction over her appeal, the appellant was permitted to reinstate her appeal and have her case adjudicated on the merits despite her earlier withdrawal of her appeal); <span class="Italic">Dodd v. Department of the Interior</span>, 48 MSPR 582, 584-85 (1991) (the Board reinstated a withdrawn appeal when the administrative judge failed to correct the appellant's erroneous belief that his only choice in obtaining an adjudication on the merits was between a hearing or withdrawing his appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hopkins v. OPM</span>, 67 MSPR 289, 291 (1995), remanded a case to the region after an AJ improperly dismissed the appeal as withdrawn. The evidence established that the appellant's representative told the AJ that the appellant was considering withdrawal of the appeal if the agency met certain conditions. The AJ then dismissed the appeal as withdrawn. The Board concluded that "the appellant did not make a clear, unequivocal, and decisive waiver of her Board appeal right." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 71 MSPR 381, 384 (1996) (remanding to determine why the AJ dismissed the appeal as withdrawn when the appellant's representative withdrew the request for hearing). <span class="Italic">Soto v. DOJ</span>, 95 MSPR 552, 555-56 &#x00B6; 8 (2004), remanded an appeal because the appellant withdrew her appeal when she was unable to secure satisfactory representation. Her submission to the Board suggested that she did not intend to abandon her case, just her representative. The AJ should have informed the appellant of the option of having the appeal dismissed without prejudice while the appellant sought representation.
