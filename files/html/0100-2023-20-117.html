<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-113"><span class="space">u.</span> Private Sector Employee; Applicant for Employment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Greenup v. USDA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GREENUP_CYNTHIA_M_SF_1221_06_0855_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_273481.pdf">106 MSPR 202</a>, 205-06 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6, 2007 MSPB 167 (2007), the appellant was a program technician with the Morrow County Office of the Farm Service Agency, a component of the Agriculture Department. She alleged that her County Office supervisor and the USDA retaliated against her for making whistleblower disclosures under 5 USC 2302(b)(8). Because the appellant was not an employee as defined by 5 USC 2105(a), her disclosures did not qualify for protection in an Individual Right of Action appeal under 5 USC 1221(a) as to any personnel actions involving her position with the County Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The record evidence shows, and the appellant does not dispute, that she was appointed to a Program Technician position with the County Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committee in May 1990, and the nature of her appointment did not change in the ensuing years. Documents also show that her initial appointment was approved by County Executive Director (CED) Ronald Matthews, although they are not definitive evidence that Matthews was the appointing official. According to the affidavit of Assistant to the Deputy Administrator for Field Operations, USDA, FSA John Chott, she was supervised by Matthews, who was not a Federal employee but had been hired by the County Committee comprised of local farmers and producers. The appellant has not refuted this statement. Thus, the appellant does not meet the definition of "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) because she was not supervised by someone who meets the definition of "employee" at section 2105(a)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also has jurisdiction over IRA appeals filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 1221(a), which provides that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may, with respect to any personnel action taken, or proposed to be taken, against such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8), seek corrective action from [the Board].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plain language of this statute extends the Board's IRA jurisdiction beyond individuals who meet the definition of "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a), to include "applicants for employment." Nevertheless, the administrative judge correctly found that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's IRA appeal in regard to her allegations that Matthews took personnel actions against her while she was employed by the County Committee because of any disclosure protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). At the time that these alleged retaliatory personnel actions took place, the appellant was a Program Technician for the County Committee and was not an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But in <span class="Italic">Greenup,</span> after appellant separated from the County Committee, she applied for a secretarial position with the USDA Office of General Counsel. Following her nonselection, she asserted that she was the victim of reprisal because of whistleblowing disclosures that she made while an employee of the County Committee. The Board had jurisdiction to consider the claim that the disclosures Greenup made as a private sector employee adversely affected her employment opportunities as applicant for employment with the federal government, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 207-09 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In addition to allegations that she suffered retaliation while employed by the County Committee, the appellant also alleged that the USDA did not select her for a secretarial position in the Office of General Counsel for which she applied, after she resigned from her County Committee Program Technician position. As stated above, the protections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 cover "applicants for employment" in addition to employees. Thus, the fact that she was not a Federal employee while she worked for the County Committee does not bar an IRA appeal based on her status as an applicant for employment. The administrative judge found that the appellant's disclosures of alleged wrongdoing by her County Committee supervisor Matthews were not protected because "she...was not entitled to WPA protections." We do not read the WPA so narrowly. The statute proscribes retaliation for</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences [] a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or [] gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). The statute does not specify that the disclosure must have been made when the individual seeking protection was either an employee or an applicant for employment. In the case of applicants for employment who were not Federal employees at any time prior to their application, such a limitation would severely restrict any recourse they might otherwise have, since the disclosure would necessarily have to be made while their application was pending. We do not believe that Congress intended to grant such a limited right of review, when it determined to protect applicants for employment.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., Fishbein v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 8 (2006) (because the WPA is remedial legislation, the Board will construe its provisions liberally to embrace all cases fairly within its scope, so as to effectuate the purpose of the Act). Thus, we find that the appellant may file an IRA appeal regarding the agency's failure to select her for the secretarial position in its Office of General Counsel, if she otherwise satisfies the jurisdictional burden set forth in <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001).[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In a non-precedential decision, the Board's reviewing court held that an individual must be either an "applicant" or an "employee" when a disclosure is made in order to qualify for whistleblower protection. <span class="Italic">Amarille v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 28 Fed. Appx. 931 (Fed. Cir. 2001). We do not find the court's short rationale for its holding to be persuasive, and accordingly, we do not follow <span class="Italic">Amarille. See Worley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 8 (2000) (the Board is not bound by non-precedential decisions of the Federal Circuit, and will follow them to the extent it finds them to be persuasive). There is no precedent from either the Federal Circuit or the Board on the question of whether a disclosure made by an individual who is neither an "applicant" nor an "employee" can later be found to have been protected whistleblowing under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, if the appellant has exhausted his or her administrative remedies before OSC and makes nonfrivolous allegations that: (1) He engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure, and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, the appellant has shown that she exhausted her remedy with OSC in regard to the failure to select her, which is a <span id="Page_3849"></span>"personnel action." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(i). We further find that she made nonfrivolous allegations that she made a protected disclosure. In a January 17, 2003 letter to OSC, she stated that she believed that the CED of Morrow County had not followed policy and procedure regarding a particular producer's payment eligibility requirements and that vital facts had been concealed in an appeal from this producer. She cited several provisions of what appear to be regulations that she believed the CED had violated. She also submitted the first page of her November 12, 2003 letter to the Office of the Inspector General in which she alleged generally that Matthews engaged in</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">possible illegal acts, his management is not consistent with the USDA/FSA rules, regulations and policy, his decision making is often questionable and at times programs under his control or under his instructions to his staff, are not managed with integrity and are not in compliance with applicable rules, regulations, and policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other documents also support a finding that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that she made protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, we find that she has made sufficient allegations to satisfy the jurisdictional standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Yunus</span> that her alleged disclosures were a contributing factor in the determination not to select her for the Office of General Counsel position. She states that the agency selected her for the secretarial position, contingent on receiving a reference from her County Committee employer. Upon learning from Matthews that she had received an unsatisfactory performance evaluation, the selecting official, William Perrelli, withdrew the tentative offer of employment. The appellant alleges that Matthews lowered her performance evaluation in reprisal for her disclosures, in addition to taking other retaliatory actions. She has not specifically alleged that Perrelli knew of her protected activity when he withdrew the offer. However, the Board has held that an appellant can show that a disclosure described under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) was a contributing factor in a personnel action by proving that the official taking the action had constructive knowledge of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Marchese v. Department of the Navy,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 104, 108 (1994). An appellant may establish constructive knowledge by demonstrating that an individual with actual knowledge of the disclosure influenced the official accused of taking the retaliatory action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, the appellant has alleged that Matthews had actual knowledge of her disclosures and that Matthews influenced Perrelli to withdraw the offer by providing a negative reference including the allegedly retaliatory performance evaluation. On remand, the appellant will have an opportunity to present evidence and argument to show that Perrelli had either actual knowledge or constructive knowledge, and that her disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's decision to withdraw the offer of employment.</p>

Under that precedent, the appellant's disclosures are not excluded from whistleblower protection simply because he was neither a Federal employee, nor an applicant for employment, when he made them.
