<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-156"><span class="space">c.</span> Postal Personnel Officials, Confidential Employees</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Benifield v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 50, 52-54 (1989), construed the statutory phrase "engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity." Drawing support from NLRB decisions and the legislative history, the Board concluded that the benefits of the statute granting appeal rights limited to a defined group of individuals without collective bargaining rights. The Board relied on the NLRB interpretations requiring a "labor-nexus" test, and concluded that the appellant, a personnel assistant, did not assist and act in a confidential capacity in the field of labor relations or the collective bargaining process. Access to personnel information was alone insufficient to establish confidential status. The appellant was entitled to be included in a bargaining unit. She was not covered by the Reform Act MSPB appellate procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act amended 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a) and granted certain nonpreference eligible employees of the Postal Service appeal rights to the Board from agency actions taken under 5 USC Chapter 75, Subchapter II. The Act applies, in pertinent part, to any individual who:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">is in the position of a supervisor or management employee in the Postal Service, or is an employee of the Postal Service engaged in personnel work in other than a <span class="Italic">purely nonconfidential clerical</span> <span class="Italic">capacity</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the Act sheds little light on the meaning of "purely nonconfidential clerical capacity." The above-cited language, however, is identical to 39 USC &#x00A7; 1202(2), which forbids the NLRB from including confidential Postal employees in collective bargaining units. The Postal Reorganization Act (PRA) established the Postal Service as an independent establishment of the Executive Branch, subject to very limited application of federal employment law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 201. The PRA was designed to bring postal labor relations within the private sector framework, subject, to the extent not inconsistent with the PRA, to the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 1209(a). Since federal labor laws are not applicable to the Postal Service absent a specific provision in the PRA, or other statute, <span class="Italic">see</span> section 410(a), we find that the administrative judge appropriately used relevant definitions of the NLRB in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 232 NLRB 556 (1978), a case construing the identical language of 39 USC &#x00A7; 1202(2), the NLRB held that secretaries, employed in the agency's research and development department, are not confidential employees even though they type merit evaluations and other personnel documents because they do not have any input into the substantive creation of the documents nor do they have access to labor relations policy data. In that case, the NLRB applied the definition of confidential employee articulated in <span class="Italic">The B.F. Goodrich Co.,</span> 115 NLRB 722 (1956), which is limited to those employees who assist and act in a confidential capacity to persons who formulate, determine, and effectuate management policies in the field of labor relations. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 232 NLRB at 558 n.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As further noted by the administrative judge, citing <span class="Italic">Pullman Standard Division of Pullman, Inc</span>., 214 NLRB 762, 762-63 (1974), employees who regularly have access to confidential information concerning anticipated changes that may result from collective bargaining negotiations are confidential employees excluded from participating in union activities because such participation constitutes a critical conflict of interest and impairs their trust relationship with the employer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, consistent with the general rules of statutory construction, Congress can be presumed to know NLRB's administrative interpretation of "any employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity." If Congress had intended that a different interpretation was to be used for that term in the Act concerning Board jurisdiction over non-preference eligible Postal Service employees, it could have expressed that intention. Its failure to do so indicates a purpose not to.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that had Congress wished the narrower NLRB interpretation of confidential employee to become part of the PRA, it would not have written in the PRA the language of 39 USC &#x00A7; 1202(2), which forbids the inclusion of confidential Postal employees in <span id="Page_257"></span>bargaining units. The agency further states that the Board must look to the less restrictive statutory language of the PRA rather than the NLRB interpretation of confidential employee in determining whether the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal. We disagree.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of any prior interpretation of the Act relevant to this appeal, we find that it is useful to look for guidance to NLRB's interpretation of the identical language.[6] <span class="Italic">Cf.

In our view, any change in NLRB's interpretation of "purely nonconfidential clerical capacity" should originate with Congress, not the Board. We find, therefore, that reliance on the NLRB's interpretation requiring a labor-nexus test, i.e., access to confidential business of the employer, is proper,[7] and we defer to NLRB's construction of the language of 39 USC &#x00A7; 1202 concerning confidential employees.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the appellant's testimony, her job duties include preparing packets of information on candidates for postmaster, writing an analysis of each candidate's qualifications, meeting with employees involved with the employee assistance program, and overseeing the merit awards program. The appellant testified that she also participated in the evaluation of craft employees and sat in on the interviews of applicants for postmaster and other supervisory positions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. While these duties may appear to be managerial in nature, the appellant did not indicate that she formulated management policies and also failed to show that she exercised discretion within, or independent of, established policy. She also did not indicate that her duties were different from those of other employees in the same office. Therefore, the appellant has failed to establish that she was a manager.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has also failed to establish that she is a supervisor. The National Labor Relations Act defines a supervisor as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any individual having authority to, in the interest of the employer, hire, transfer, suspend, layoff, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibility to direct them or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.</p>

That fact alone is sufficient to find that the appellant does not qualify as a supervisor. <span class="Italic">Heck's Inc.</span>, 277 NLRB 916, 918-19 (1985).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The NLRB has developed two tests to determine if an individual is a confidential employee. The first test is whether the employee assists and acts in a confidential capacity to an individual who formulates, determines, and effectuates management policies in the field of labor relations. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Hendricks County Rural Electric Membership Corp.</span>, 454 U.S. 170, 188-89, 102 S. Ct. 216, 227-28, 70 L. Ed.2d 323 (1981). (This test has been called the labor-nexus test.) The second test is whether the employee has regular access to confidential information concerning anticipated changes that may result from collective bargaining negotiations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The NLRB has narrowly construed these tests and requires that an employee be involved in the collective bargaining or grievance process, even if only to a limited extent, to be deemed confidential. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Mega Van and Storage</span>, 294 NLRB No. 90 at 7 (1989); <span class="Italic">Associated Day Care Services</span>, 269 NLRB 178, 179-81 (1984); <span class="Italic">Emanuel Lutheran Charity Board</span>, 268 NLRB 1344, 1347 (1984); <span class="Italic">Missouri Pacific Employees' Hospital</span>, 251 NLRB 1547, 1549-50 (1980).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that she was involved in the hiring and promotion of individuals for the post office, and that she dealt with the employee assistance program and with employee evaluations and merit awards. She also testified that much of the information she handled needed to be kept confidential and that there was a great deal of interest by other workers in seeing the material. There is no indication, however, that the appellant was involved in the collective bargaining or grievance process. Thus, the appellant has failed to show that she was a confidential employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the appellant has failed to show that she was a manager, supervisor, or confidential employee, she does not fall within the coverage of the Postal Employees Appeal Rights Act.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The NLRB is charged with interpreting the definition of "employee" contained in 29 USC 152(3) for the purposes of distinguishing persons includable in collective bargaining units from those excludable from such units.

Bell Aerospace Co.</span>, 416 U.S. 267, 288, 94 S. Ct. 1757, 1768, 40 L. Ed.2d 134 (1974). "Supervisor" is defined by the National Labor Relations Act as:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">29 USC 152(11).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The NLRB defines "confidential employees" as those employees who: (1) "assist and act in a confidential capacity to persons who formulate, determine and effectuate management policy in the field of labor relations," or (2) "regularly have access to confidential information concerning anticipated changes which may result from collective-bargaining negotiations." <span class="Italic">NLRB v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB, in <span class="Italic">Benifield v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 50 (1989), reasoned that the NLRB definition of confidential employee was controlling for the purposes of determining whether the MSPB had jurisdiction to hear and decide the appeal of a postal employee under 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I). The MSPB found:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There is no dispute that the appellant was engaged in personnel-related work of a confidential and sensitive nature. The appellant, however, did not assist and act in a confidential capacity in the field of labor relations or the collective bargaining process.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB reasoned that the NLRB definition of "confidential employee" was controlling for the purposes of 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I) because the NLRB had applied that definition in <span class="Italic">USPS</span>, 232 NLRB 556 (1978), to identical language in 39 USC 1202(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">USPS</span>, 232 NLRB 556 (1978), the NLRB concluded that Postal Service secretaries in the research and development department were not confidential employees. The NLRB found:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The record does not demonstrate, however, that these secretaries have any input into the substantive creation of documents relating to merit evaluations, disciplinary actions, or related activities. Nor does it appear that these secretaries have access to labor relations policy data. In these circumstances, we find that they are not confidential employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 558. More importantly, this statement was followed by a footnote which stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">San Diego Transit Corporation</span>, 182 NLRB 428 (1970): access to personnel records does not constitute a secretary a confidential employee as defined in <span class="Italic">The B.F. Goodrich Company</span>, 115 NLRB 722, 724 (1956), which is limited to "those employees who assist and act in a confidential capacity to persons who formulate, determine, and effectuate management policies in the field of labor relations."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">232 NLRB at 558 n.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact specific statement of USPS is consonant with the definition of confidential employee required under The B.F. Goodrich Company, 115 NLRB 722, 724 (1956), for exclusion from the definition of employee under 29 USC 152(3) and the plain language of PRA in 39 USC 1202(2) and of PEARA in 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I). Clearly, an employee who meets the NLRB standard of participation in formulating, determining or effectuating management policy under 29 USC 152(3) would be "engaged in personnel work other than in a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity" under 39 USC 1202(2) or 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I). It does not follow, however, that an employee "engaged in personnel work other than in a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity" under 39 USC 1202(2) or 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I) would necessarily also meet the NLRB standard of participation in formulating, determining or effectuating management policy under 29 USC 152(3). Accordingly, reading USPS as finding that the definition of an excluded "confidential employee" under 39 USC 1202(2) to be indistinguishable from a "confidential employee" excluded pursuant to 29 USC 152(3) overstates the holding in that case and places an inappropriate emphasis on the footnote reference to The B.F. Goodrich Company.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question presented here, and not answered by USPS is whether an employee not satisfying the NLRB definition for the purposes of 29 USC 152(3) (participation in management policy) may, nevertheless, be eligible to take an appeal under 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I) (other than purely nonconfidential clerical personnel workers).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB, in <span class="Italic">Benifield,</span> properly assumed that Congress was aware of the established administrative interpretations at the time of the enactment of PRA and PEARA. Curiously, the MSPB then reasoned that Congress was presumedly aware that the NLRB had interpreted 39 USC 1202(2) as setting forth the same standard as applied to identify excluded confidential employees for the purposes of 29 USC 152(3). As discussed, USPS, 232 NLRB 556 (1978), cannot fairly be read to establish that 39 USC 1202(2) (other than purely nonconfidential clerical) is necessarily interpreted as adopting or requiring the standard developed for 29 USC 152(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The better application of the assumption that Congress was aware of the established administrative interpretations would look to the body of "confidential employee" law prior to the enactment of PRA, rather than a single decision predating PEARA, resting as it does on the implications to be drawn from a footnote reference to a standard not necessary to the decision. Viewed against this backdrop, the exclusion from a postal worker bargaining unit under 39 USC 1202(2) of "any employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity" is a marked expansion over the exclusion standard being applied to 29 USC 152(3) employees. Indeed, assuming Congress' awareness of the established standard for exclusion of "confidential employees" under 29 USC 152(3), it is counterintuitive to assert that Congress intended that standard to apply by including an incompatible standard in the statute creating NLRB jurisdiction over Postal Service collective bargaining units.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It follows then that Congress' use in 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I) of a definition identical to 39 USC 1202(2) reveals an intention that the employees excluded from the collective bargaining units under...the jurisdiction of the NLRB would have appeals rights within the jurisdiction of the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB relies on incompatible principles: (1) that Congress intended the NLRB's established definition of "confidential employee" to apply to 39 USC 1202(2), in spite of the clear difference between that definition provided in that section and the established definition for 29 USC 152(3) <span id="Page_259"></span>purposes, but (2) the MSPB is free to determine its jurisdiction over postal employees under 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I), without regard to whether the employee was excluded from the collective bargaining unit pursuant to the identical language of 39 USC 1202(2). As a consequence, the MSPB asserts that, although 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I) is the mirror image of 39 USC 1202(2), a third group exists comprised of those Postal Service employees that are not included under the former section even though they are excluded under the latter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the MSPB must determine whether it has jurisdiction over an appeal from an adverse employment decision affecting a Postal Service employee, that determination must also be consonant with the language and purposes of the PEARA. The MSPB's jurisdictional determination in these cases rests on reasoning that the mirror image language of 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I) and 39 USC 1202(2) was not intended to identify a single demarcation between the jurisdiction of the NLRB and the MSPB, but was somehow intended to permit the emergence of a third group of Postal Service employees without rights before either body. There is no support in the record of these cases for the MSPB position that its jurisdictional inquiry is not constrained by the clear language of the statute or may result in the creation of a group of Postal Service employees with neither grievance nor appeal rights. Even without revisiting the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Benifield</span> that no significance attaches to Congress having provided a definition of confidential employee in 39 USC 1202(2) that is distinct from the established definition for the purposes of 29 USC 152(3), the statutory scheme of PRA and PEARA cannot fairly be construed to permit the amorphous jurisdiction of the MSPB suggested by these cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service, in its brief <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span>, stipulates that McCandless is a "confidential employee" excluded from any collective bargaining unit under the jurisdiction of the NLRB. The MSPB's response that third parties may not determine the jurisdiction of an adjudicatory body goes too far. The Postal Service and the NLRB are not strangers to the statutory scheme that defines the jurisdiction of the MSPB. The MSPB inquiry into whether it has jurisdiction cannot be, as it was in <span class="Italic">McCandless</span>, divorced from the factual record and the determination of the Postal Service or the NLRB as to the classification of the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCandless</span> and related cases were remanded to AJs for additional analysis, <span class="Italic">McCandless v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 383, 387 (1994):</p>

Accordingly, to the extent the administrative judge may have erred in issuing the initial decision without allowing time for the receipt of the appellant's response to the acknowledgment order, he made no error that affected the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Panter v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant is a nonpreference eligible employee. A nonpreference eligible employee of the Postal Service has appeal rights to the Board under PEARA from adverse actions taken under 5 USC chapter 75 if the employee is a manager, supervisor, or employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity and has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions. 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">Dodson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 MSPR 84, 86 (1995). The Board has adopted the definition of the term "confidential employees" set forth by the NLRB, which includes "those employees who: (1) '[A]ssist and act in a confidential capacity to persons who formulate, determine and effectuate management policy in the field of labor relations,' or (2) 'regularly have access to confidential information concerning anticipated changes which may result from collective bargaining negotiations.'" <span class="Italic">McCandless v. Merit Systems Protection</span> <span class="Italic">Board,</span> 996 F.2d 1193, 1199 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged below that the duties of the EAS-14 Senior Legal Secretary position "included typing briefs in cases of employee grievances and appeals, assuming basic legal research for those briefs, such as checking citations, maintaining docket calendars for that litigation, and maintaining and copying confidential documents related to employee grievances." She stated that she "regularly handled [o]fficial [p]ersonnel [f]iles and other confidential information regarding employees and personnel matters in the context of MSPB and federal court employment actions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. She further stated that her "bosses were responsible for formulating Postal Service policies regarding employment matters, which were kept confidential prior to promulgation," and that, as a staff employee of the Postal Service Law Department, she "had contact with these draft policies and working documents of a sensitive nature."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to allege or to submit evidence showing that she satisfied either of the two NLRB criteria for eligibility as a "confidential employee," as set forth in <span class="Italic">McCandless.</span> She found that the appellant did not show that the employment matters for which she alleged her supervisors formulated Postal Service policies concerned labor relations or collective bargaining. The administrative judge further found that the appellant did "not allege that she had access to labor relations policy data" and that "it appear[ed] that she merely handled, viewed, and typed the confidential paperwork, and that she had no input into the substantive creation of such documents." Therefore, the administrative judge found that the appellant did not show that she qualified as a "confidential employee" entitled to appeal to the Board. Moreover, the administrative judge found, her review of the appellant's position description did not indicate that the appellant met the applicable requirements under 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that she indeed meets the definition of "confidential employee" as set forth in <span class="Italic">McCandless</span>. She contends that the administrative judge erred by interpreting her Third Affidavit as not including duties relating to labor relations. She claims that her statement in her Third Affidavit that her "bosses were responsible for formulating Postal Service policies regarding employment matters, which were kept confidential prior to promulgation," referred to "collective-bargaining matters." In an attempt to clarify her Third Affidavit, the appellant has submitted on review a fourth affidavit, stating that her duties as a Senior Legal Secretary included "typing briefs in cases of employee grievances and arbitrations...[and] maintaining and copying confidential documents related to labor arbitrations and union grievances." The appellant also states that she "regularly handled Official Personnel Files and other confidential information regarding employees and personnel <span id="Page_260"></span>matters in the context of MSPB, federal court, and arbitration and union grievance actions." She further states that her "bosses were responsible for formulating Postal Service policies regarding postal union matters, including revisions to the collective-bargaining agreement, which were kept confidential prior to promulgation," and that she "had contact with these draft policies and working documents of a sensitive nature....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We find...that the appellant's allegations, as stated above, are sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that she meets the definition of a "confidential employee" under PEARA. <span class="Italic">See McCandless,</span> 996 F.2d at 1199.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hayden v. USPS</span>, NY-0752-15-0025-I-1 (NP 10/7/2015) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Hayden v. MSPB</span>, 646 Fed. Appx. 1008 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>)), concluded that an Executive and Administrative Schedule Human Relations Specialist (EAS-16) was not a confidential employee (nor was she a manager, a point discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-156.html#sec1-155">Postal Supervisors, Managers</a>"):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The NLRB defines "confidential employees" as employees who: (1) "assist and act in a confidential capacity to persons who formulate, determine and effectuate management policy in the field of labor relations"; or (2) "regularly have access to confidential information concerning anticipated changes which may result from collective-bargaining negotiations." <span class="Italic">McCandless</span>, 996 F.2d at 1199 (quoting <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Hendricks County Rural Electric Membership Corp</span>., 454 U.S. 170, 189 (1981)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that her work was of a confidential nature. She further argues that, although some of her work was clerical, this does not exclude her from coverage because all labor relations employees have some clerical tasks. We agree with the appellant that her work may have involved handling some employees' confidential information. Nonetheless, confidential information for purposes of 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) refers to information regarding collective bargaining and labor relations--not to employees' personal data. Mere access to personnel information is insufficient to establish confidential status. <span class="Italic">Benifield</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. at 54. Therefore, regardless of whether all or only some of the appellant's personnel work was of a clerical nature, we find that she has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that she was a confidential employee under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed that the human relations specialist was not a confidential employee with Board appeal rights, <span class="Italic">Hayden v. MSPB</span>, 646 Fed. Appx. 1008, 1010-12 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hayden was a non-preference-eligible Human Resources Specialist in the New York division of the Labor Relations Office of the United States Postal Service ("USPS"). In this position, she handled unemployment claims for former USPS employees and represented the USPS at unemployment compensation hearings. She had access to confidential agency databases and performed information processing tasks, such as verifying information from claims in the Employee Personnel Action History ("EPAH") database, receiving and inputting "Step 2 grievances" and "Formal A appeals" into the agency's Grievance Tracking System ("GATS"), inputting disciplinary information into the Disciplinary Tracking Program ("DTP"), and running reports against the Time and Attendance Control System ("TACS") in response to union requests. She also had access to the Labor Relations Research Information System ("LRRIS"), a national database of USPS arbitration decisions. Ms. Hayden was paid according to the Executive and Administrative Schedule ("EAS") pay scale, level 16, and was not a member of a collective bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that Ms. Hayden completed one year service and was neither a preference-eligible employee nor a supervisor. Thus, in order to establish Board jurisdiction, she had to prove that she was either a "management employee" or was "engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity." 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I). The Board concluded that Ms. Hayden failed to show that she fell within either of these categories. On appeal, Ms. Hayden challenges these determinations and argues that she was denied due process. We address each argument in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Supreme Court and National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB") precedent, a "management employee" is one who "formulate[s] and effectuate[s] management policies by expressing and making operative the decisions of their employer." <span class="Italic">Waldau v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 19 F.3d 1935, 1398 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co. Div. of Textron</span>, 416 U.S. 267, 286 (1974)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether an employee meets this criteria is not determined by her job title, but by her "actual job responsibilities, authority, and relationship to management." <span class="Italic">Bell Aerospace</span>, 416 U.S. at 290 n.19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge considered these principles and determined that Ms. Hayden failed to allege facts that she "formulate[d] and effectuate[d] management policies by expressing and making operative the decisions of their employer." We agree. Ms. Hayden has not asserted or provided evidence that she actually formulated USPS policy as a Human Resources Specialist. Indeed, it appears that her responsibilities largely involved carrying out policy set by others. For example, Ms. Hayden stated that, in representing the USPS in unemployment compensation cases, she "investigate[d] the validity" of unemployment claims against the EPAH database. This type of verification work is simply enforcement of existing policy, which is insufficient to render her a "management employee."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hayden's arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. Ms. Hayden points to certain pieces of evidence which seem to classify her job as managerial, including an excerpt from the USPS letter of decision terming her "a postal employee representing Management," her membership in the National Association of Postal Supervisors ("NAPS"), and her placement in the Labor Relations Office, which she contends only offered management-level positions. However, being labeled "management" does not make one a "management employee" within the meaning of 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I). Instead, the inquiry must focus on the employee's actual job duties; as discussed above, Ms. Hayden failed to allege sufficient facts on this point.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hayden also argues that she was a "management employee" because she was placed on the EAS pay scale, had been given a non-bargaining salary increase in the past, and was not a member of a collective bargaining unit. We have held that USPS employees who are legally barred from participation in a collective bargaining unit have appeal rights to the Board. <span class="Italic">McCandless v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 996 F.2d 1193, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 1993). However, none of these facts alleged by Ms. Hayden would, if true, establish that she is precluded from joining a collective bargaining unit as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See Bolton</span>, 154 F.3d at 1321 (affirming a denial of jurisdiction where "Bolton [has not] shown any legal authority suggesting he is ineligible for union membership as a matter of law"); <span class="Italic">Coursen v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 256 F.3d 1353, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (affirming a denial of jurisdiction where "Coursen failed to demonstrate that he was precluded as a matter of law from joining a CBU"). Moreover, her placement on the EAS pay scale is not sufficient to term her a "management employee." Accordingly, Ms. Hayden is not entitled to Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Ms. Hayden is not a "management employee," the Board would only have jurisdiction over her appeal if she is "engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity." 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). To fall within this category, she must satisfy the NLRB's definition of "confidential employee." <span class="Italic">McCandless</span> 996 F.2d at 1199. The NLRB defines "confidential employee" as one who (1) "assist[s] and act[s] in a confidential capacity to persons who formulate, determine and effectuate management policy in the field of labor relations," or (2) "regularly ha[s] access to confidential information concerning anticipated changes which may result from collective-bargaining negotiations." <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Hendricks Cnty. Rural Elec. Membership Corp</span>., 454 U.S. 170, 189 (1981) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that, although Ms. Hayden regularly had access to confidential information as a part of her work on unemployment compensation cases, she neither assisted in the "formulat[ion] ...[of] management policy in the field of labor relations" nor "had access to confidential information concerning anticipated changes which may result from collective bargaining negotiations."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Substantial evidence supports these findings. Ms. Hayden conceded to the administrative judge that she did not participate in arbitration or grievance proceedings at the USPS, and she presented no other evidence that she was involved in labor disputes or collective bargaining negotiations. In addition, a declaration submitted by her supervisor states that Ms. Hayden "did not perform any Labor Relations Specialist (EAS-19) work such as deciding on grievances, meeting with unions, reviewing and preparing employee discipline, or providing advice to postal supervisors/managers on contractual issues." Although Ms. Hayden had access to the GATS system, nothing in the record shows that she performed anything more than clerical data entry. Thus, we see no reason to disturb the administrative judge's factual findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hayden argues that she was a "confidential employee" because she had access to confidential information in the EPAH, TACS, GATS, DTP, and LRRIS systems, but this argument fails as a matter of law. "Mere access to personnel information is insufficient to establish confidential status." <span class="Italic">McCandless</span>, 996 F.3d at 1200 (quoting <span class="Italic">Benifield v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., No. CH07528810478, 1989 WL 17814 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 28, 1989)). Accordingly, we agree that Ms. Hayden was not "engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity" under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_261"></span>A Postal Service employee has a right to appeal an adverse action to the Board, if he (1) is a preference eligible, a management or supervisory employee, or an employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity,[2] and (2) has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(ii); <span class="Italic">Clark v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;For ease of reference, we will refer to employees engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity as "confidential employees."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant is not a preference eligible, manager, or supervisory employee. Thus, the Board would only have jurisdiction over his appeal if he is a confidential employee. The Board has adopted the definition of the term "confidential employees" set forth by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which includes "those employees who: (1) '[A]ssist and act in a confidential capacity to persons who formulate, determine and effectuate management policy in the field of labor relations,' or (2) 'regularly have access to confidential information concerning anticipated changes which may result from collective-bargaining negotiations.'" <span class="Italic">Law v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 30, 34 (1997) (quoting <span class="Italic">McCandless v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 996 F.2d 1193, 1199 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). The first prong of this definition is referred to as the labor-nexus test. <span class="Italic">See National Labor Relations Board v. Hendricks County Rural Electric Membership Corporation</span>, 454 U.S. 170, 188-89 (1981); <span class="Italic">see also Benifield v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 50, 53-54 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As described in the initial decision, the appellant testified below that he met the definition of a confidential employee based on three examples of his job duties. First, he asserted that in or around November 2014, management enlisted his assistance in its efforts to keep forensic computer analyst positions exempt from overtime payment requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). He contended that management provided him with confidential proposed position descriptions to review and confidential strategy memoranda on how to argue that these positions were exempt under the FLSA. The appellant then met with the agency's Organizational Effectiveness Office and explained the nature of the positions. Second, he contended that in October 2014, he was allowed access to confidential personnel records of agency employees in the course of investigating a cyber intrusion. Third, he argued that in 2010, he had access to computers used by agency employees when he participated in a confidential investigation regarding the theft of test answers for an employment examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge considered the appellant's testimony concerning these job duties but found that he failed to establish he was a confidential employee. Regarding the first type of confidential employee, the administrative judge found that none of the examples cited met the labor-nexus test because they showed only that the appellant on occasion had access to certain labor-related or personnel type information, which the NLRB has found to be insufficient. <span class="Italic">See</span> ID at 3, 6 (citing <span class="Italic">In re E.C. Waste, Inc</span>., 339 N.L.R.B. 262, 282 (2003), <span class="Italic">enforced</span>, 359 F.3d 36 (1st Cir. 2004)). The administrative judge further found that the appellant failed to show that the relevant individuals to whom he alleged he was providing assistance were individuals who formulated, determined, and effectuated management policy in labor relations. Lastly, he found that the appellant failed to demonstrate that he acted in a confidential capacity regarding the first example because the alleged confidential information was not confidential relative to the forensic computer analysts who would be affected by the decision at issue. Regarding the second type of confidential employee, the administrative judge found that none of the purportedly confidential information the appellant had access to concerned anticipated changes which may result from collective bargaining negotiations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Regarding the other two examples, the administrative judge found that these were "even less compelling than the first." We interpret this as meaning that such matters are nonlabor related and so, even if confidential, fail to establish that the appellant is a confidential employee. <span class="Italic">See also Hamilton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6; 20 (2016) (stating that, although the appellant may have handled sensitive employee personnel information in the course of administrative investigations, mere access to personnel information is insufficient to establish confidential status).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that he was not a confidential employee. He reiterates his testimony below concerning the first two examples of job duties, which he contends establish he is a confidential employee, including his roles in assisting management's efforts to keep the forensic computer analyst positions exempt from the FLSA overtime requirements and investigating a high-profile cyber intrusion matter. The administrative judge, however, considered such testimony but found that it failed to establish that the appellant met the definition of a confidential employee. We find that the appellant's arguments on review constitute mere disagreement with the administrative judge's explained findings and thus do not provide a basis for reversal. <span class="Italic">See Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 98, 105-06 (1997) (finding no reason to disturb the administrative judge's findings when she considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate references, and made reasoned conclusions); <span class="Italic">see also Broughton v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 357, 359 (1987) (same). For the reasons set forth in the initial decision, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to establish that he is a confidential employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant also contends that the administrative judge erred in finding that he was not a confidential employee because his position description and Standard Forms 50 designate his position as nonbargaining. He also disputes the administrative judge's finding that, although he was unable to join any of the four existing unions due to their bylaws, he was not precluded by statute or regulation from forming his own collective bargaining unit. The appellant contends that this finding was erroneous because various agency policies preclude him from forming a collective bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find such arguments unavailing. The Board's jurisdiction is limited to those appeals filed by Postal Service employees who are excluded from bargaining unit membership because they are a manager, supervisor, or confidential employee under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1202. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A); <span class="Italic">Coursen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 256 F.3d 1353, 1355-56 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Thus, the agency's description of the appellant's position as a "nonbargaining" position is not determinative. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 60, &#x00B6; 10 (2008). Further, neither the absence of an existing collective bargaining unit for the appellant to join nor the fact that he may be ineligible for bargaining unit membership for reasons unrelated to 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1202(1)-(2) is sufficient to bring the appeal within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Coursen</span>, 256 F.3d at 1355-57; <span class="Italic">Carrier v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 183 F.3d 1376, 1378-80 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 60, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Finally, the appellant argues that the administrative judge improperly failed to address his argument that the denial of the right to a Board appeal will deprive him of due process because he waived his grievance right by filing a Board appeal. However, because the Board's jurisdiction is constrained by statute, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has rejected similar arguments. <span class="Italic">See Hayden v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 646 F. App'x 1008, 1012-13 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (rejecting the appellant's argument that the denial of a right to appeal to the Board deprived her of due process because jurisdiction is a threshold issue and no further process was due once the Board determined it lacked authority to hear the case); <span class="Italic">Carrier</span>, 183 F.3d at 1379-80 (finding nothing in the relevant statutes or precedent to suggest that an appellant who fails the jurisdictional test under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005 may nevertheless appeal to the Board on a showing that he had no readily available collective bargaining unit to which a grievance could be taken).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 261 (1994), resolved that the appeal of an occupational health nurse who was eligible to be represented by the National Postal Professional Nurses to be beyond the Board's jurisdiction. Her involvement with employees' medical records did not make her a confidential employee. The handling of confidential medical records involving applicants and employees did not establish that the appellant performed personnel work. Nor was Ms. White covered by the portions of 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), extending appeal rights to nonpreference eligibles with two years of current continuous service in the same or similar position. That section specifically excludes employees in the Postal Service unless they are otherwise covered as preference eligibles or a postal managers or personnelists under 39 USC 1005(a). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 266; 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Speaking of collective bargaining status, the Board declared that an appellant's status as a union official did not make him a confidential employee for jurisdictional purposes, <span class="Italic">Lewis v. USPS,</span> CH-0752-10-0807-I-1 (NP 3/2/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that he satisfies the first jurisdictional requirement described above because he engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity through his work as a union steward. However, the administrative judge concluded, and we agree, that the appellant's work as a union steward does not confer on him the status of a confidential-personnel employee for the purpose of Board jurisdiction. Indeed, if the appellant had been a confidential-personnel employee, then he would have been barred from being a member of the collective bargaining unit for which he alleged he worked as a union steward. <span class="Italic">See McCandless v.
