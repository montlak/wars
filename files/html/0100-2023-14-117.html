<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-118"><span class="space">3.</span> Dangerous Conditions</h4>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was not negotiable that employees need not perform duties under conditions that may endanger themselves, others, or property. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2182 and Propulsion Lab., Army Research and Tech. Labs.</span>, 26 FLRA 600, 604-06 <span id="page_689"></span>(1987) (Provision 4). Another proposal was nonnegotiable that permitted cessation of work in serious emergency situations if an employee felt that his life or health was immediately endangered, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg Dependent Sch.</span>, 28 FLRA 493, 507 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Since this portion of the provision is inconsistent with a Government-wide regulation, it is outside the duty to bargain.... Specifically, OSHA regulations provide that when employees have a "reasonable belief" that they are in "imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm" from a work assignment, and do not have sufficient time to seek redress through normal abatement procedures, they may decline to perform the assignment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1960.46(a). Section 2, however, provides that where an employee "feels" that his or her life and health are "immediately endangered," work operations will cease. Employee refusals to work are only protected under OSHA regulations where they are based on a "reasonable belief" on the part of employees that they are subject to "imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm." The standard set forth by section 2 therefore is broader than, and exceeds the limitations set forth in, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1960.46(a). Section 2 would replace the objective standard which is set forth in the regulation with a standard which is essentially subjective....</p>
<p class="noindent">But a proposal, determined to be an appropriate arrangement in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 29 and DOD, Hq., Military Entrance Processing Command</span>, 29 FLRA 726, 732-33 (1987), proffered that an employee may decline his or her assigned task because of a reasonable belief that, under the circumstances, the task poses an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm, coupled with a reasonable belief that there is an insufficient time to seek effective redress through normal hazard reporting and abatement procedures:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We believe that the scope of protection which this provision affords employees is sufficiently narrow that it does not excessively interfere with management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a practical matter, under Provision 2 not just any perceived threat to employee health and safety is sufficient to justify a decision by an employee to stop work. There must be facts which would support a reasonable belief that: (1) the threat is imminent; (2) it poses a risk of serious bodily harm or is life-threatening; and (3) it cannot be abated through normal procedures....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...A risk of injury of any sort is not sufficient. Finally, the threat must be so pressing and severe that it is not possible to deal with it in time to prevent the harm....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, therefore, we conclude that the benefit afforded by the provision to employees who may be required to work in situations where their health and safety is seriously threatened outweighs the detriment to management caused by the provision's limited interference with management's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1655 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Alexandria</span>, 49 FLRA 874, 882-85 (1994) (nonnegotiable, there being no properly structured arrangements claim, Provision 6, that supervisor grant immediate relief--including, at election of employee, termination of immediate assignment--from unsafe or unhealthy circumstances).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA provided additional explanation concerning the metes and bounds of safety proposals in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1458 and DOJ, U.S. Attorney, S. Dist. of Florida</span>, 29 FLRA 3, 4-5 (1987). The proposal was that "[a]n employee has the right to decline to perform an assigned duty if the employee has a reasonable belief that the duty poses an immediate risk to the employee's health or safety. The employee is to report the situation to his/her supervisor or other supervisory individual whoever is available immediately." The proposal was not negotiable. It interfered with the right to assign work and it was not an appropriate arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The regulation governing the matter covered by Provision 1 is 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1960.46(a) which was issued under authority of Executive Order 12196. The regulation permits an employee to decline to carry out a task when the employee has a reasonable belief that the "task poses an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm coupled with a reasonable belief that there is insufficient time to seek effective redress through normal hazard reporting and abatement procedures in accordance with this part."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 1, however, seeks to protect an employee's refusal to carry out a task based on a reasonable belief "that the duty poses an immediate risk to the employee's health or safety." The provision, therefore, contains a less rigorous standard--"an immediate risk to the employee's health and safety" as contrasted with the regulatory "imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm"--of protection for employees refusing to undertake assigned work. Furthermore, the provision makes no reference to the regulatory requirement that the employee reasonably believe there is insufficient time to seek relief through normal hazard reporting and abatement channels.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the provision would circumscribe management's authority to a greater degree than does the regulation which the provision purports to enforce, in that it insulates employees from the consequences of refusing to perform work involving a lesser degree of perceived peril than described by the regulation. The provision, therefore, conflicts with 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1960.46(a) [a government-wide regulation]....</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable provisions providing a limited disciplinary defense to employees facing imminent and serious danger were discussed in <span class="Italic">AFGE and AAFES</span>, 30 FLRA 909, 909-10 (1988). Provision 1 in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> was:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "imminent danger" means any conditions or practices in any work place which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm immediately or before there is sufficient time for the imminence of such danger to be eliminated through normal procedures. In the case of imminent danger situations, employees shall make reports by the most expeditious means available. The employee has the right to decline to perform assigned tasks because of a reasonable belief that, under the circumstances, the tasks pose an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm, coupled with a reasonable belief that there is insufficient time to effectively seek corrective action through normal hazard reporting and abatement procedures. In these instances, the employee must report the situation to his supervisor or the next immediately-available, higher level supervisor. If the supervisor believes the condition or corrected condition does pose an immediate danger, then the supervisor shall request an inspection by the Employer's Safety and Security Technician or Specialist (SST or SSS) as well as contact the Local Union safety representative, who shall be afforded the opportunity to be present at the time the inspection is made. Should the SST or SSS decide the condition does not pose an immediate danger and give an instruction to return to work, continued refusal by the employee at this point would be justified, if there was a reasonable basis for the employee to believe that imminent danger was present.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE</span> declared the provision negotiable, 30 FLRA at 911-14:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that this provision would prevent the Agency from assigning work to employees in circumstances where employees reasonably believe that the duties present an imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm coupled with insufficient time within which to abate the hazard even if the Agency had abated the imminent danger or decided that it did not exist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals which prescribe conditions on management's ability to require employees to perform particular duties directly interfere with management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2094, AFL-CIO and Veterans Administration Medical Center, New York, New York,</span> 22 FLRA 710 (1986) (Proposal 4), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2094 v. FLRA,</span> 833 F.2d 1037 (D.C. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center, New York,</span> the Authority found that Proposal 4, which prevented the Agency from assigning overtime work to employees if the employees believed, that it would endanger their health, was a substantive infringement on the agency's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) and that it was not a "procedure" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. Provision 1, likewise, would prevent the Agency from assigning work to employees under the circumstances stated in the provision. We find, for the reasons stated in <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center, New York,</span> that it directly interferes with the right to assign work. Furthermore, since the right to direct employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) involves the right to supervise and guide them in the performance of their duties, the right to direct employees is reflected in the supervisory function of assigning work. <span class="Italic">International Plate Printers, Die Stampers and Engravers Union of North America AFL-CIO, Local 2 and Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C.,</span> 25 FLRA 113, 120 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the fact that the provision reflects essentially the same wording as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation, 29 C.F.R. 1960.46(a), does not make it negotiable. The provision goes beyond the contractual recognition of externally imposed limitations and imposes an independent, substantive contractual requirement. <span class="Italic">See National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1167 and Department of the Air Force, Headquarters, 31st Combat Support Group (TAC), Homestead Air Force Base, Florida,</span> 6 FLRA 574, 577 (1981) (Proposal 1), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1167 v. FLRA,</span> 681 F.2d 886 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the Union's intent and the wording of the provision, we find that the provision does not prevent management from initiating disciplinary actions against employees. Consequently, the provision does not concern the exercise of management's right to discipline employees. The provision is distinguishable from Provisions 26-28 in <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing,</span> 25 FLRA 113, 135-37. In that case, we found that the provisions stating that an employee "shall not be subject to disciplinary action" did not concern an employee's defense to discipline but totally precluded management from instituting discipline against employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Provision 1 conflicts with management's rights to assign work and derivatively to direct employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and <span id="page_690"></span>(B), it is nonnegotiable unless it constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard,</span> 21 FLRA 24 (1986). As explained in <span class="Italic">Kansas Army National Guard,</span> in order to determine whether the provision constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement, we determine whether the provision is intended to be an arrangement for employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of management's statutory rights. If the provision is so intended, we then determine whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the exercise of management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that this provision is intended to be an arrangement for employees who may be adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights to assign work and direct employees. Based on the Union's undisputed explanation, the provision is intended to protect employees from the adverse impact of assignment to, and direction to perform, duties which will seriously endanger their health and safety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding whether the intended arrangement is appropriate, we must determine whether its negative impact on management's rights to assign work and direct employees is "excessive" when weighed against the intended benefit to adversely affected employees. By enabling employees who reasonably perceive their work situations to present serious and life-threatening conditions, Provision 1 clearly benefits those employees. Since the provision applies in a narrowly defined set of circumstances and does not prevent management from disciplining employees, we conclude that it does not excessively interfere with management's rights, as explained below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under this proposal if a supervisor instructs an employee to perform work in circumstances which the employee believes is an "imminent danger" situation, the employee has the obligation and the opportunity to explain this to the supervisor. If the supervisor, alone or in conjunction with an Agency safety representative, reasserts the instruction, with or without attempted corrective action, the employee must choose between (1) setting aside his or her concerns and performing the work or (2) disobeying the order and risking disciplinary action, for example, for insubordination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the Agency institutes disciplinary action against the employee, the proposal enables the employee or the Union to dispute the disciplinary action, through the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. The employee's defense against the discipline would be that, because the employee's perception that the work situation constituted an imminent danger was correct, the discipline would not be for just cause. If the grievance is not settled short of arbitration and the matter is submitted to arbitration under the parties' procedures, the arbitrator ultimately would decide that issue based on evidence concerning the work situation presented by the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 1 does not apply to every perceived threat to employee health and safety.&#x2003;Under Provision 1 there must be facts which would support a reasonable belief that the threat (1) is imminent; (2) poses a risk of death or serious physical injury; and (3) cannot be abated through normal procedures. The provision would apply the same standard in circumstances where an employee continued to refuse to work based on disagreement with a decision by Agency officials that there was no immediate danger present or that the condition had been corrected. Provision 1 does not protect employees who feel themselves to be in danger where there is no clear evidence to support that conviction. <span class="Italic">compare American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1770 and Department of the Army, Fort Bragg Dependent Schools, Fort Bragg, North Carolina,</span> 28 FLRA 493, 505-09, (1987) (Provision 3) <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom. Department of the Army, Fort Bragg Dependent Schools, Fort Bragg, North Carolina v. FLRA,</span> No. 87-2661 (4th Cir. September 22, 1987) (provision permitting employees to refuse work where they feel in danger held inconsistent with 29 C.F.R. 1960.46(a)). The threat must also be immediate and pressing rather than merely likely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, under Provision 1 the harm with which employees are threatened must present a risk of serious bodily harm or be life-threatening. A risk of injury of any sort is not sufficient. Finally, the threat must be so pressing and severe that it is not possible to deal with it in time to prevent the harm. Problems which may be resolved before they result in serious physical harm would not justify employees' stopping work. Only in the most limited circumstances, therefore, would the provision restrict the Agency's ability to assign work. <span class="Italic">Compare American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1858 and U.S. Army Missile Command, The U.S. Army Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment Support Group, The U.S. Army Information Systems Command--Redstone Arsenal Commissary,</span> 27 FLRA 69, 77-79 (1987) (Provision 4), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom. U.S. Army Missile Command, U.S. Army Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment Support Group,</span> <span class="Italic">The U.S. Army Information Systems Command--Redstone Arsenal Commissary v. FLRA,</span> No. 87-7445 (11th Cir. July 17, 1987) (provision permitting employees to refuse details which would be beyond their physical capacities held not to be an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) because it would apply to any assignments, for any reason, and to any extent). Thus, while the protection afforded employees by Provision 1 would result in some interference with management's rights, that interference is not excessive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, therefore, while the provision interferes with management's right to assign work, it concerns a matter of great importance to the health and safety of employees. We conclude that the benefit afforded by the provision to employees who may be required to work in situations where their health and safety are seriously threatened outweighs the detriment to management caused by the provision's limited interference with management's right to assign work. Consequently, we find that Provision 1 does not excessively interfere with management's right and constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 29 and Department of Defense, HQ, U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command,</span> 29 FLRA 726 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">Also negotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> was Provision 2:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 37, Over the Road Drivers, Section 8 Employees are not required to, and will not be penalized for failing to, continue a run when a situation arises which would make continuing it an imminent danger.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE</span> explained, 30 FLRA at 915-16:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on its language and the Union's statement of intent, we conclude that Provision 2 is to the same effect as Provision 1. We conclude for the same reasons expressed in conjunction with Provision 1, that Provision 2 interferes with the Agency's right to assign work and direct employees but does not interfere with the right to discipline employees. It is, however, negotiable under section 7106(b)(3) as an appropriate arrangement. In reaching the conclusion that the provision does not interfere with the right to discipline employees we adopt the Union's explanation of the provision, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The driver provision only protects an employee from being penalized (e.g., disciplined) if an imminent danger did exist. Thus, in the context of the disputed provisions taken together, proposing discipline does not constitute a penalty and would not be barred by the driver provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of this statement, we find that the phrase "will not be penalized" in this provision refers only to the outcome of a disciplinary action in which an employee who establishes that an "imminent danger" existed will not be punished. The provision does not prevent the Agency from instituting a disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Compare Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing,</span> 25 FLRA 113, 135-37 (the phrase "shall not be subject to disciplinary action" totally precluded management from instituting discipline against employees).</p>
