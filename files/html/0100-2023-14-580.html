<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-581"><span class="space">2.</span> Reduction of Nonpermanent Personnel</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1547 and Dept. of Air Force, Luke AFB</span>, 65 FLRA 911, 911 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 680 F.3d 826 (D.C. Cir. 2012), <span class="Italic">post</span>), considered Proposal 1, designed to eliminate nonpermanent positions in the event of a RIF, freeing resources to assist in the retention of permanent personnel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the [e]mployer determines that a [c]ompetitive [s]ervice employee will be displaced by RIF, through Mock RIF or otherwise, the [e]mployer will cross-reference all of the displaced [c]ompetitive [s]ervice employees['] experience brief job series with the job series held by the [e]mployer. If a position encumbered by a probationary [e]xcepted [s]ervice employee matches, in accordance with 5 CFR &#x00A7; 6.3, the [e]mployer will change the probationary employee's position to a "[t]erm" that will expire prior to the effective day of the applicable RIF, providing the [c]ompetitive [s]ervice employee has a higher Service Computation Date [(SCD)] than the probationary employee; the final RIF Retention Register [(RIF RR)] will include those vacated positions. These processes do not include temporary student positions identified in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 213.3202 and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 213.3102.</p>
<p class="noindent">The proposal, intended to take the vacated positions and add them to the RIF retention register, was negotiable, 65 FLRA at 912-14:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 1 is not inconsistent with the RIF regulations. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that Proposal 1 is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2) and (c), which concern RIFs generally; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.403 and 404, which provide for the establishment of competitive levels and retention registers; and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.501 and 502, which concern the order of retention in the competitive and excepted service, respectively.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found proposals requiring agencies to take certain personnel actions <span class="Italic">prior </span>to conducting a RIF consistent with the RIF regulations in dispute here. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NAGE, Local R4-45</span>, 54 FLRA 218, 227 (1998) (proposal requiring that employees with lowest retention standing for their competitive level be reassigned thirty days prior to issuance of a RIF notice was not inconsistent with RIF regulations). Proposal 1 requires the conversion of appointments held by probationary VRA excepted service employees to term appointments, but only when the Agency determines--through a mock RIF prior to conducting a RIF--that a competitive service employee in the same job series as the probationary employee will be displaced in the actual RIF. As the actions required by Proposal 1 would occur <span class="Italic">prior </span>to conducting a RIF, we find that Proposal 1 is not inconsistent with the above referenced government-wide RIF regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 1 is not inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 316.301 and 401, or with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 6.3. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also claims that Proposal 1 is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 316.301 and 401, which are government-wide regulations governing term employment. However, the Agency fails to explain the basis for its claim. Other than stating what the regulations provide, the Agency fails to make any claims based on the regulations. Under &#x00A7; 2424.32(b) of the Authority's Regulation, agencies have the burden of "raising and supporting arguments that the proposal...is outside the duty to bargain[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(b). In the absence of any argument in support of its claim that the proposal is contrary to the cited regulations, the Agency's argument constitutes an unsupported assertion that is insufficient to establish that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(b); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3584, Council of Prison Locals C-33</span>, 64 FLRA 316, 317 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Local 3584</span>). Consequently, we dismiss this claim as it is unsupported.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency claims that it cannot convert appointments occupied by VRA excepted service appointees to term appointments under the discretion authorized by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 6.3. The Agency again fails to provide any arguments to support the basis for its claim. For the reasons stated above, the Agency's claim constitutes an unsupported assertion, and therefore it does not demonstrate that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(b); <span class="Italic">Local 3584</span>, 64 FLRA at 317. Consequently, we also dismiss this claim as it is unsupported.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 1 does not affect management's rights to assign and layoff employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</span>[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that Proposal 1 interferes with management's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) because it requires that management reassign probationary excepted service employees to term positions. The Agency also argues that Proposal 1's requirement that the Agency take specific personnel actions prior to conducting a RIF interferes with its management right to layoff employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute includes the right to make initial assignments to positions, to reassign employees to different positions, and to make temporary assignments or details. <span class="Italic">See NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA at 165. Proposal 1 does not affect management's right to assign employees because it does not require the assignment or reassignment of employees to any position. Proposal 1 only requires that when certain conditions are met, management will convert VRA appointments with a two-year probationary term to appointments with a term of less than two years. Proposal 1 does not affect what position the employee occupies. In this regard, under Proposal 1, a converted VRA employee would remain in the same position. Consequently, as Proposal 1 does not require the reassignment of employees, Proposal 1 does not affect management's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's right to layoff employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute includes the right to conduct a RIF and to exercise discretion in determining which positions will be abolished and which retained. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU</span>, 60 FLRA 219, 222 (2004). Proposal 1 does not involve determining which positions will be abolished and which retained in a RIF. The proposal only operates "[w]hen the [e]mployer determines that a [c]ompetitive service employee will be displaced by RIF[.]" Therefore, Proposal 1 does not affect management's right to layoff employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The Agency makes a general claim that, to the extent that any proposal in this case concerns a permissive subject of bargaining under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), it has elected not to bargain. However, the Agency does not explain how any of the proposals constitute a permissive subject of bargaining under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). Accordingly, to the extent the Agency is claiming that any of the Union's proposals concerns a permissive subject of bargaining under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), we reject the Agency's claim as bare assertion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(b); <span class="Italic">Local 3584</span>, 64 FLRA at 317.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The decisions on which the dissent relies do not support a different conclusion. One of the decisions, <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2192</span>, 59 FLRA 868, 871 (2004), did not involve the management rights that are allegedly affected in this case. In the other decision, <span class="Italic">AFGE, National Border Patrol Council</span>, 51 FLRA 1308, 1332-33 (1996), the Authority found that a provision requiring the agency to fill vacant positions that the agency elected to leave vacant affected the right to assign employees. Proposal 1 in the instant case does not impose a similar requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The result in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1547</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 680 F.3d 826, 828-31 (D.C. Cir. 2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2006, the United States Department of the Air Force announced it would conduct a reduction-in-force ("RIF") at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. In response, the union representing employees at the Base--the American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1547 (the "Union")--made several proposals about how the RIF should be conducted and asked the Air Force to enter into negotiations. The Air Force claimed it had no duty to negotiate over three of the Union's proposals, prompting the Union to appeal to the Federal Labor Relations Authority. The Authority determined the Air Force had an obligation to negotiate over two of the three disputed proposals. <span class="Italic">See Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emp., Local 1547 v. U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Luke Air Force Base,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. 911, 917 (2011) ("<span class="Italic">Luke Air Force Base</span>").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force now petitions for review of the Authority's unfavorable rulings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal employees have the right "to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102(2), but that right only extends so far. Federal agencies have no duty to negotiate over a proposal that is "inconsistent with any Federal law or any Government-wide rule or regulation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1). They also have no duty to negotiate over a proposal that interferes with their authority "to hire, assign, direct, layoff, [or] retain employees," <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A), unless the proposal concerns "appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise" of that management authority, <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The two proposals at issue here--Proposals 1 and 2--related to the RIF's effect on veterans recruitment appointments ("VRAs"). Rooted in the Federal policy "to promote the maximum of employment and job advancement opportunities within the Federal Government for qualified covered veterans," 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(a)(1), VRAs are "excepted appointments, made without competition, to positions [at Federal agencies] otherwise in the competitive service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 307.103. These excepted appointments are not permanent; "[u]pon satisfactory completion of 2 years of substantially continuous service, [an] incumbent's VRA must be converted to a career or career conditional appointment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force's planned RIF only eliminated competitive service positions, which meant VRA appointees who had not been converted to competitive service employees would not have been affected. Although <span id="page_1051"></span>the Union represented both VRA appointees and competitive service employees, it did not want to insulate the VRA appointees from the RIF because, in many cases, the appointees had accrued less service time than competitive service employees in comparable positions. To address that issue, the Union offered Proposal 1: if the Air Force determined a competitive service employee would be displaced by the RIF, and a VRA appointee with less seniority occupied a similar position, the Air Force should convert that VRA appointee to a term appointee whose term expired before the RIF took effect. <span class="Italic">Luke Air Force Base,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 911. And to address its related concern that the Air Force would fill "vacant positions with excepted service VRA employees" before the RIF was completed, the Union offered Proposal 2: the Air Force should only fill a new position with a VRA appointee if the position would not be affected by the ongoing RIF. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 914.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force claimed it had no obligation to negotiate over either Proposal because each interfered with its management authority.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 912, 914. It further claimed it had no obligation to negotiate over Proposal 1 because the Proposal conflicted with various federal regulations relating to RIFs and term employment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 912. The Authority disagreed on all counts. It found Proposal 1 did not contravene the RIF and term-employment regulations and did not infringe on the Air Force's authority to assign or layoff employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 912-14. And though it was willing to "assum[e]" that Proposal 2 interfered with the Air Force's right to hire employees, the Authority found the Proposal negotiable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) because it concerned "appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected" by the Air Force's exercise of its hiring authority. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 914.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its petition, the Air Force contends, for the first time, that it had no duty to negotiate over Proposals 1 and 2 because they conflicted with federal statutes and regulations governing VRAs. It also argues the Authority erred when it determined that Proposals 1 and 2 did not improperly infringe on management authority. We find the first claim waived and the second insufficient to overcome our deferential standard of review. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Emps. v. FLRA,</span> 745 F.2d 705, 707-08 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (holding an Authority ruling may only be set aside "if arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force identifies two alleged conflicts between the Proposals and the laws creating the VRA program.&#x2003;It claims Proposal 1 conflicted with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 307.103 because it required the conversion of VRA appointees to career appointees before "completion of 2 years of substantially continuous service." And it claims Proposal 2 conflicted with 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(a)(1) because its restriction on hiring VRA appointees did not "promote the maximum of employment and job advancement opportunities within the Federal Government for qualified covered veterans."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force concedes it did not present either of these objections to the Authority.&#x2003;Accordingly, we may only consider them if the Air Force's failure to raise them before the Authority "is excused because of extraordinary circumstances." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our precedents demonstrate that "extraordinary circumstances" truly are extraordinary. With certain inapplicable exceptions, we have only found they exist when the newly raised arguments implicate constitutional issues like "separation of powers," <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force v. FLRA,</span> 648 F.3d 841, 845 (D.C. Cir. 2011), or "sovereign immunity," <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army v. FLRA,</span> 56 F.3d 273, 275 (D.C. Cir. 1995). And we have consistently found they do <span class="Italic">not</span> exist when, as here, the new argument is based on statutory inconsistency alone. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 648 F.3d at 845; <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Air Force v. FLRA,</span> 949 F.2d 1169, 1174-75 (D.C. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force asserts that this is not a typical case of statutory inconsistency because its new objections protect the "employment rights under the VRA program of third-party veterans who were not participants in the proceedings before the [Authority]." It submits this Court has never held that a "waiver by a government agency deprives the Court of jurisdiction to consider...an abrogation of third-party statutory rights."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That distinction is not dispositive here.&#x2003;The "extraordinary circumstances" requirement "was designed to ensure that the Authority's expertise be used to dispose of all arguments relating to cases within its jurisdiction," and an "agency's legal strategy or, arguably, deficient lawyering by agency counsel cannot provide a waiver from this clear congressional directive." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev. v. FLRA,</span> 964 F.2d 1, 5 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Moreover, strict enforcement of the waiver statute promotes "agency autonomy and judicial efficiency." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 648 F.3d at 846; <span class="Italic">see also Marine Mammal Conservancy, Inc. v. Dep't of Agriculture,</span> 134 F.3d 409, 414 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (observing that the policies underlying similar waiver provisions include "giving agencies the opportunity to correct their own errors,...compiling a record adequate for judicial review, [and] promoting judicial efficiency"). It may be tempting to ignore these abstract principles out of concern for the rights of our veterans, but we cannot selectively enforce the waiver statute based on whose rights are at stake. Nor can we simply decline to enforce the waiver statute whenever third-party rights are implicated, for doing so would make "extraordinary circumstances" quite ordinary. We therefore find the Air Force's claims of conflict waived.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force's alternative argument is that the Authority acted arbitrarily when it found the Proposals did not interfere with management authority. That claim falls short because "we can discern a reasoned path from the facts and considerations before the [agency] to the decision it reached." <span class="Italic">Neighborhood TV Co., Inc. v. FCC,</span> 742 F.2d 629, 639 (D.C. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force objects to the Authority's determination that Proposal 1 did not interfere with its right to "layoff" employees. The Authority has explained that "management's right to layoff employees includes the right to conduct a RIF and to exercise its discretion in determining which <span class="Italic">positions</span> will be abolished and retained in a RIF." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. US. Dep't of Treasury,</span> 60 FLRA 219, 222 (Sept. 3, 2004) (emphasis added). Here, the Authority reasonably found that Proposal 1 did not restrict the Air Force's right to conduct a RIF, nor limit the Air Force's discretion in deciding which positions to cut, because the Proposal only took effect after the Air Force had decided which positions it wished to eliminate. <span class="Italic">See Luke Air Force Base,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 913-14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the Air Force's telling, Proposal 1 was no different than an earlier Union proposal the Authority found nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">See Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps., Local 1547 v. Luke Air Force Base,</span> 64 F.L.R.A. 813 (May 27, 2010). That is not so. The Union's earlier proposal barred the Air Force from conducting a RIF until all VRA appointees had accrued two years of service and had been converted to competitive service employees. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 816. That proposal plainly interfered with the Air Force's right "to conduct a RIF" by dictating when the Air Force could begin implementing its RIF plan. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. United States Dep't of Treasury,</span> 60 FLRA at 222. Proposal 1 had no such effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to Proposal 2, the Authority determined that even if the Proposal interfered with the Air Force's right to hire employees, the Air Force nonetheless had a duty to negotiate because the Proposal concerned "appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected" by the Air Force's exercise of that right. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). The Authority arrived at that conclusion by applying a two-part test, under which a proposal concerns "appropriate arrangements" if it was "intended as an arrangement," and was "appropriate because it d[id] not <span class="Italic">excessively</span> interfere with the exercise of management's rights." <span class="Italic">Luke Air Force Base,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 915 (emphasis added). The Authority found Proposal 2 satisfied the "arrangement" requirement because the RIF would have had "a severe, negative impact" on terminated employees, and the Proposal was sufficiently tailored "because it benefit[ted] employees who could be affected by the RIF." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> And the Authority found the Proposal satisfied the "appropriateness" requirement because the benefits to employees outweighed the burden on the Air Force's hiring authority. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force only challenges the Authority's appropriateness finding. It argues that when the Authority weighed the benefits to employees against the burden on management, it failed to account for "the vital and independent statutory interest in preserving hiring...[of] veterans." While it is true the Authority did not explicitly discuss the interests of veterans in its appropriateness analysis, its decision explained why the RIF's impact on veterans might not be that severe. The Authority observed that the Proposal's "hiring limitation only applie[d] to RIF-affected positions"; that the Air Force could still "fill vacancies during the RIF from other sources," including veterans not on VRAs; and that the "hiring restriction [wa]s only effective until the termination of the RIF," meaning the Air Force could always cut the RIF short if it felt that the effect on veterans was too dramatic. <span class="Italic">Luke Air Force Base,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 915. Taken together, these justifications for the appropriateness finding adequately addressed the Air Force's concerns about veterans--concerns, it is worth noting, that the Air Force never raised explicitly in its submissions to the Authority.</p>
