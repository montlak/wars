<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-133"><span class="space">g.</span> EEO Settlement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Munoz v. Mabus</span>, 630 F.3d 856, 860-64 (9th Cir. 2010), the plaintiff was able to pursue a damages claim for violation of an EEO settlement through Tucker Act jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not raised by the parties, we have an independent obligation to address subject matter jurisdiction before turning to the merits of the case. <span class="Italic">Williams v. United Airlines, Inc.,</span> 500 F.3d 1019, 1021 (9th Cir. 2007). Whether Munoz's claim to enforce a predetermination settlement agreement[2] is one over which the district court had jurisdiction because the claim was "brought under" Title VII remains an open question in this court.[3] <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(f)(3). We now join our sister circuits in holding that Congress' waiver of sovereign immunity under Title VII does not extend to suits to enforce settlement agreements entered into without genuine investigation, reasonable cause determination, and conciliation efforts by the EEOC. <span class="Italic">See Lindstrom v. United States,</span> 510 F.3d 1191, 1195 (10th Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Frahm v. United States,</span> 492 F.3d 258, 262 (4th Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">cf. Hansson v. Norton,</span> 411 F.3d 231, 234-35, 366 U.S. App. D.C. 255 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (holding that a claim for attorney's fees was a contractual claim, not one brought under Title VII). The district court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Count 1, the breach of settlement agreement claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The contract at issue is known as a "predetermination settlement agreement," i.e., an agreement negotiated and entered into prior to formal investigation, determination of reasonable cause, and conciliation attempt by the EEOC. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1601.20(a), 1614.603; <span class="Italic">cf</span>. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(b) (describing the process for arriving at post-determination voluntary settlement, known as "conciliation agreements").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Two of our earlier cases bear on this question but do not directly answer it. In the first, we held that the EEOC could not "leapfrog[&#8197;] " Title VII administrative procedures, which serve as jurisdictional prerequisites, by bringing an action to enforce a predetermination settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Pierce Packing Co.,</span> 669 F.2d 605, 609 (9th Cir. 1982). That case involved an enforcement action brought by the EEOC against a private employer, whereas the instant case involves an individual complainant's suit against a federal employer, implicating sovereign immunity concerns not present in <span class="Italic">Pierce Packing.</span> In the second, we held the district court lacked jurisdiction to enforce a predetermination settlement agreement where the individual complainant had failed to exhaust administrative remedies under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Blank v. Donovan,</span> 780 F.2d 808, 809-10 (9th Cir. 1986). Because the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Blank</span> apparently failed even to file an EEO complaint seeking enforcement of his settlement agreement, as Munoz has done here, we had no opportunity to decide whether Title VII confers jurisdiction to enforce settlement agreements once the procedures of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504 have been met. <span class="Italic">See Webster v. Fall,</span> 266 U.S. 507, 511, 45 S. Ct. 148, 69 L. Ed. 411 (1925) ("Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents").</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 717 of Title VII protects federal employees and provides an express waiver of sovereign immunity in suits against the government for discriminatory employment practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-5(f), 2000e-16. The EEOC is authorized to enforce the provisions of Section 717 and to issue rules and regulations as it deems necessary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (EEOC regulations concerning the federal sector). Title VII and the EEOC's implementing regulations set forth specific administrative procedures that a complainant must first exhaust before gaining access to the federal courts on a discrimination complaint. The employer and employee may, however, choose instead to resolve the discrimination complaint voluntarily with a settlement agreement, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.603, in which case the employee, as Munoz has done here, withdraws his formal complaint and forgoes his right to a civil appeal therefrom. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504 prescribes the procedure for claiming a breach of that agreement, and it is this provision on which the question of jurisdiction hangs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether the district court had jurisdiction over the breach of settlement claim, we look first to the plain meaning of &#x00A7; 1614.504 because, "[a]s a general interpretive principle, 'the plain meaning of a regulation governs.'" <span class="Italic">See Safe Air for Everyone v. EPA,</span> 488 F.3d 1088, 1097 (9th Cir. 2007) (quoting<span class="Italic"> Wards Cove Packing Corp. v. Nat'l Marine Fisheries Serv.,</span> 307 F.3d 1214, 1219 (9th Cir. 2002)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504 allows an employee alleging noncompliance to choose between two exclusive remedies, namely specific performance or reinstatement of the original discrimination complaint.[4] 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504(a). The regulation further provides that the EEOC is limited to awarding one of these two remedies upon determining that a breach has occurred. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1614.504(c). On its face, the regulation is silent as to whether an employee may proceed to federal court after receiving an adverse EEOC determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Section 1614.504 is titled "Compliance with settlement agreements and final action" and states in pertinent part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;...If the complainant believes that the agency has failed to comply with the terms of a settlement agreement or decision, the complainant shall notify the EEO Director, in writing, of the alleged noncompliance.&#8197;...<span class="Italic">The complainant may request that the terms of [the]</span> <span class="Italic"> settlement agreement be specifically implemented or, alternatively, that the complaint be reinstated for further processing from the point processing ceased.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(b)&#x2003;...If...complainant is not satisfied with the agency's attempt to resolve the matter, the complainant may appeal to the Commission for a determination as to whether the agency has complied with the terms of the settlement agreement or decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(c)&#x2003;...If the Commission determines that the agency is not in compliance..., <span class="Italic">it may order such compliance or it may order that the complaint be reinstated for further processing from the point processing ceased.</span> Allegations that subsequent acts of discrimination violate a settlement agreement shall be processed as separate complaints under &#x00A7; 1614.106 or &#x00A7; 1614.204, as appropriate, rather than under this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because any waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed, this silence counsels against a finding of jurisdiction. But the text of &#x00A7; 1614.504(a) does not end the matter. Had Munoz chosen to reinstate his underlying discrimination complaint instead of seeking specific performance, his claim could eventually have been heard in federal court after exhausting administrative procedures, even though &#x00A7; 1614.504 is silent as to that possibility. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-5(f)-(k), 2000e-16(c)-(d). The district court held that other sections of the EEOC's regulations likewise provide an unambiguous path to federal jurisdiction when a complainant elects to seek specific performance. We thus consider whether those surrounding regulations include a waiver of the government's sovereign immunity that allows the exercise of jurisdiction over Munoz's breach of settlement agreement claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Regulatory Context</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No such waiver of sovereign immunity exists in the regulatory or statutory scheme as a whole; rather, reading 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504 in context only reinforces our conclusion that Congress had no intention of providing a cause of action based on an alleged breach of a predetermination settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The district court's conflation of generic "complaints" of noncompliance with formal Title VII "complaints" of prohibited conduct led it to the opposite conclusion. The district court reasoned as follows: (1) 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.401(e) allows a complainant to appeal "an agency's alleged noncompliance with a settlement agreement" to the EEOC; (2) &#x00A7; 1614.405 considers an EEOC decision on appeal a "final decision" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 1614.407; and (3) &#x00A7; 1614.407(c) allows a complainant to file a civil action within 90 days of receiving a final EEOC decision. <span class="Italic">Munoz v. England,</span> 557 F. Supp.2d 1145, 1160 &#x0026; n.12 (D. Haw. 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5365"></span>A closer examination of the regulatory provisions, however, reveals that "complaint," as used throughout 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614, is a term of art as defined by &#x00A7; 1614.103. Section 1614.103, titled "Complaints of discrimination covered by this part," states that "[i]ndividual and class <span class="Italic">complaints of employment discrimination and retaliation prohibited by title VII [and the ADEA]</span> <span class="Italic">...</span>shall be processed in accordance with this part." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.103(a) (emphasis added). Section 1614.407 provides that "[a] complainant who has filed an individual complaint" may file a civil action within 90 days of receiving a final EEOC decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1614.407(c); <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> &#x00A7; 1614.106 (discussing "[i]ndividual complaints"). Accordingly, an employee's right to a civil appeal pursuant to &#x00A7; 1614.407 is limited by the nature of his underlying grievance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The district court reasoned that Munoz has "already filed a complaint" (that is, the underlying complaint resolved by the settlement agreement he now seeks to enforce), and that this serves as a sufficient gateway for judicial review of all subsequent EEOC actions concerning him. <span class="Italic">See Munoz,</span> 557 F. Supp.2d at 1160 n.12. Because Munoz withdrew this complaint in exchange for securing the settlement agreement, it cannot serve as a basis for jurisdiction. This scenario appears to be precisely why &#x00A7; 1614.504 permits an aggrieved employee to request reinstatement of his complaint for further processing. The regulatory context does not support an implied cause of action for the enforcement of predetermination settlement agreements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;The Tucker Act and Sovereign Immunity</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, finally, that our reasoning conforms with the Supreme Court's teaching that a suit to enforce a settlement agreement requires its own basis of jurisdiction independent from the federal source of the underlying claim, <span class="Italic">Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am.</span>, 511 U.S. 375, 378, 381-82, 114 S. Ct. 1673, 128 L. Ed.2d 391 (1994), as well as with the Court of Federal Claims's recent interpretations of its own exclusive jurisdiction over damage actions in contract against the United States worth more than $10,000, pursuant to the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491.[5] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Westover v. United States,</span> 71 Fed. Cl. 635 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Congress has effected a limited waiver of sovereign immunity in such suits pursuant to the Tucker and Little Tucker Acts. Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491 (exclusive Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction in claims for $10,000 or more); Little Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1346(a)(2) (concurrent jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims and district courts in claims for less than $10,000); <span class="Italic">see N. Side Lumber Co. v. Block,</span> 753 F.2d 1482, 1484-85 (9th Cir. 1985). The Court of Federal Claims's &#x00A7; 1491 jurisdiction is preempted, however, "where Congress has enacted a precisely drawn, comprehensive and detailed scheme of review in another forum...." <span class="Italic">St. Vincent's Med. Ctr. v. United States,</span> 32 F.3d 548, 550 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While recognizing that Title VII "provides the exclusive judicial remedy for <span class="Italic">claims of discrimination</span> in federal employment," <span class="Italic">Brown v. Gen. Servs. Admin.,</span> 425 U.S. 820, 835, 96 S. Ct. 1961, 48 L. Ed.2d 402 (1976) (emphasis added),[6] the Court of Federal Claims has recently concluded, in light of <span class="Italic">Kokkonen,</span> that "Title VII's [c]omprehensive [s]cheme of [r]eview [d]oes [n]ot [p]reclude Tucker Act [j]urisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims [o]ver Title VII [s]ettlement [a]greements," <span class="Italic">Taylor v.

In other words, the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over such claims because they are not "brought under" Title VII &#x00A7; 706(f)(3). <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(f)(3); <span class="Italic">cf. Kokkonen,</span> 511 U.S. at 378, 381-82. Because Munoz's breach of settlement agreement claim is essentially a contract action against the federal government whose resolution requires no interpretation of Title VII itself, his claim cannot seek jurisdictional refuge in Title VII and belongs, if anywhere, in the Court of Federal Claims. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491; <span class="Italic">Greenhill v. Spellings,</span> 482 F.3d 569, 575, 375 U.S. App. D.C. 477 (D.C.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Indeed, for a long time, the Court of Federal Claims relied on this principle to find that it therefore lacked jurisdiction over suits to enforce settlement agreements resolving Title VII disputes. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fausto v. United States,</span> 16 Cl. Ct. 750, 752-53 (1989) ("Title VII...is the comprehensive, exclusive, and preemptive remedy <span class="Italic">for federal employees alleging discrimination.</span>") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Griswold v. United States,</span> 61 Fed. Cl. 458, 464-65 (2004) <span class="Italic">(relying on Fausto); Taylor v. United States,</span> 54 Fed. Cl. 423, 425 (2002) (same). This position changed after the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Kokkonen.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress, while encouraging resolution of Title VII complaints through predetermination settlement agreements,[7] <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1601.20(a), 1614.603, has nonetheless not provided for enforcement of such agreements in federal court. The plain meaning of the text, the overarching regulatory framework, and the long-held prudential interest in narrowly construing waivers of sovereign immunity all compel this conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;In fact, several other circuits have relied on the central role of voluntary agreements in Title VII's overall statutory scheme in finding Title VII jurisdiction to enforce such agreements. <span class="Italic">See EEOC v. Liberty Trucking Co.,</span> 695 F.2d 1038, 1040 (7th Cir. 1982) (reasoning from the "important remedial purposes" of Title VII that Congress must have "intended to provide the EEOC with a federal forum to enforce conciliation agreements"); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Safeway Stores, Inc.,</span> 714 F.2d 567, 573 (5th Cir. 1983) (same); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Henry Beck Co.,</span> 729 F.2d 301, 304-05 (4th Cir. 1984) (extending the policy reasons for allowing enforcement of conciliation agreements to predetermination settlement agreements); <span class="Italic">Eatmon v. Bristol Steel &#x0026; Iron Works, Inc.,</span> 769 F.2d 1503, 1513 (11th Cir. 1985) (holding that an individual, not just the EEOC, may bring suit under Title VII to enforce a predetermination settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">Ruedlinger v. Jarrett,</span> 106 F.3d 212, 214-15 (7th Cir. 1997) (same); <span class="Italic">but see Pierce Packing,</span> 669 F.2d at 608-09 (drawing distinction between predetermination settlement and conciliation agreements and finding jurisdiction lacking over suits to enforce the former). None of these cases, however, involved federal employers and the attendant sovereign immunity concerns that we face here, and we do not find their reasoning persuasive in this context.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Directly addressing Tucker Act jurisdiction over a settlement agreement, or a series of agreements (a couple entered during EEO processes and another entered to resolve EEO litigation in a federal district court), between a federal employee and the Navy, the Federal Circuit concluded that, assuming the agreement leading to the lawsuit could be interpreted to mandate monetary damages, the Court of Federal had Tucker Act jurisdiction despite the arguable availability of EEOC administrative enforcement procedure, <span class="Italic">Holmes v. United States</span>, 657 F.3d 1303, 1311-12, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before addressing the money-mandating issue, however, we must resolve the initial jurisdictional question of whether the Court of Federal Claims may exercise its Tucker Act jurisdiction over a claim alleging breach of a Title VII settlement agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our court has not addressed this question, and there is a split of authority on it in the Court of Federal Claims. Some decisions of the Court of Federal Claims have held that the court lacks Tucker Act jurisdiction over claims alleging breach of a Title VII settlement agreement due to the comprehensive statutory scheme established under Title VII, which assigns jurisdiction over discrimination suits to the district courts. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Griswold v. United States,</span> 61 Fed. Cl. 458, 464-65 (2004); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. United States,</span> 54 Fed. Cl. 423, 425-26 (2002); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v.

Ct. 750, 752-54 (1989). However, relying on <span class="Italic">Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America,</span> 511 U.S. 375 (1994), other Court of Federal Claims decisions have found such settlement agreements to fall outside the comprehensive scheme of Title VII and to be within the jurisdiction of the court. <span class="Italic">See Westover v. United States,</span> 71 Fed. Cl. 635, 638-39 (2006); <span class="Italic">see also Taylor v. United States,</span> 73 Fed. Cl. 532, 541-45 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There also appears to be a split of authority among the regional circuits. In <span class="Italic">Frahm v. United States,</span> 492 F.3d 258 (4th Cir. 2007), the Court of Federal Claims had retransferred to the district court the plaintiffs claim alleging breach of a Title VII settlement agreement. It did so because it concluded that Title VII's "comprehensive and exclusive statutory scheme" precluded its exercise of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 261. Subsequently, the district court agreed that it had jurisdiction because the plaintiff's claim arose under Title VII, but ultimately denied a motion by the plaintiff for monetary damages. <span class="Italic">Frahm v. United States,</span> No. 2-CV-00089, 2005 WL 1528421, at *2-3 (W.D. Va. June 23, 2005). The Fourth Circuit affirmed. <span class="Italic">Frahm,</span> 492 F.3d at 262-63. The D.C. Circuit, however, has concluded that the Court of Federal Claims does have Tucker Act jurisdiction over these "straightforward contract dispute[s]." <span class="Italic">See Greenhill v. Spellings,</span> 482 F.3d 569, 575 (D.C. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">see also Hansson v. Norton,</span> 411 F.3d 231, 232, 237 (D.C. Cir. 2005) ("Because Hansson's claim for attorney's fees neither requires an interpretation of Title VII with respect to her discrimination complaint nor seeks equitable relief under Title VII, but rather seeks reasonable attorney's fees defined by well-established standards, it is a contract claim against the United States for more than $10,000...[and] within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act.")).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the D.C. Circuit, as well as Court of Federal Claims cases which have reached a similar conclusion, that Tucker Act jurisdiction may be exercised in a suit alleging breach of a Title VII settlement agreement. We do not view Title VII's comprehensive scheme as a bar to the exercise of such jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Massie v. United States,</span> 166 F.3d 1184, 1188-89 (Fed. Cir. 1999), we held that a claim to enforce a contract resolving a dispute arising under the Military Claims Act fell within the Court of Federal Claims's jurisdiction, even though the agency decision out of which the dispute arose was not subject to judicial review. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Del-Rio Drilling Programs Inc. v. United States,</span> 146 F.3d 1358, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 1998), we stated that the broad jurisdictional grant set forth in 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1) does not exempt contract claims that turn on the construction of statutes. We said: "It is often necessary to interpret or apply statutory or common law principles in order to resolve contract claims, but the fact <span id="Page_5366"></span>that the resolution of a contract claim may turn on the interpretation of a statute does not deprive the Court of Federal Claims of jurisdiction over that claim." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In <span class="Italic">Del-Rio Drilling Programs,</span> we concluded that the plaintiffs, who sought to recover damages from the government for alleged breach of its duties under lease contracts, were entitled to sue in the Court of Federal Claims for enforcement of the contracts, even though the court might have to interpret the Tribal Consent Act or other state and federal law in order to resolve the contract claims. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1367-68. Similarly, although the 1996 and 2001 Agreements arose out of Title VII litigation, Mr. Holmes's suit for breach of contract is just that: a suit to enforce a contract with the government. <span class="Italic">See generally Kokkonen,</span> 511 U.S. 375. In sum, we agree with the parties and hold that settlement agreements resolving Title VII disputes are not <span class="Italic">per se</span> beyond the Tucker Act jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither do we think that the EEOC regulation to which the government points bars the exercise of Tucker Act jurisdiction. Section 1614.504(a) provides that a complainant alleging breach of an EEOC agreement "shall notify the [Equal Employment Opportunity] Director, in writing, of the alleged noncompliance within 30 days of when the complainant knew or should have known of the alleged noncompliance [and] may request that the terms of settlement agreement be specifically implemented or, alternatively, that the complaint be reinstated for further processing..." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504(a). Without diminishing the force of this regulation, we see no reason for &#x00A7; 1614.504(a) to preclude a suit for money damages in the event of breach that is separate from, or in addition to, the relief the regulation provides.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;We acknowledge that at least one other circuit has reached the contrary conclusion. <span class="Italic">See Frahm,</span> 492 F.3d at 262-63 (affirming the district court's denial of a motion for monetary damages and stating that neither the settlement agreement nor a statute allowed a suit for damages and that &#x00A7; 1614.504(a) provided the exclusive remedy for alleged breach of a Title VII settlement agreement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we need not reach the issue of whether the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over consent decrees because we do not agree with the government that the 2001 Agreement is a consent decree. As the First Circuit has explained, the Supreme Court has emphasized three related factors to be used to determine if a court-ordered consent decree exists: (1) the change in legal relationship must be court-ordered, (2) there must be judicial approval of the relief <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> the merits of the case, and (3) there must be "judicial oversight and ability to enforce the obligations imposed on the parties." <span class="Italic">Aronov v. Napolitano,</span> 562 F.3d 84, 90 (1st Cir. 2009) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Bd. &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Res.,</span> 532 U.S. 598, 604 &#x0026; n.7 (2001)). As far as the 2001 Agreement is concerned, the Magistrate Judge retained jurisdiction for one year; yet it is clear that the parties' obligations were meant to continue past one year. The 2001 Agreement provides that "Plaintiff hereby agrees <span class="Italic">never</span> again to apply for employment with Defendant or any agency, activity, or office under the command of Defendant, including but not limited to Military Sealift Command..." (emphasis added). Thus, the district court did not maintain "judicial oversight and ability to enforce the obligations imposed on the parties" because its jurisdiction lasted only for a year, while obligations under the agreement extended well beyond that period. For at least this reason, the 2001 Agreement is not a consent decree.</p>

Without deciding whether the government representative had settlement authority or an agreement existed between the parties, the United States Court of Federal Claims ("Claims Court") held that the EEOC and Army regulations made any agreement unenforceable. We disagree with the Claims Court's interpretation of the two regulations and hold that oral agreements to settle EEOC claims are enforceable.

In support, Ms. Bullock points to the fact that, following negotiations, the mediating administrative judge sent an email to Ms. Bullock's counsel on August 27, 2015, stating that "[t]he agency will agree to pay $70,000." Ms. Bullock's counsel responded to the email, asking "This is settlemt [sic]?" The mediating administrative judge responded, "yes for the parts that were still in dispute," and explained that "[she] could not remember the specific numbers that the agency agreed [on]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next day, the mediating administrative judge sent an email to the parties asking for the "agency's understanding of the provisions of the settlement agreement" and then noting that, "[o]nce we confirm that the parties are in complete agreement, the agency can begin work on the written settlement agreement." No written settlement agreement was ever executed, and in late September, the mediating administrative judge stated she learned from Ms. Lynch that the Army "rescinded its settlement offer from August 27th." The mediating administrative judge then notified the EEOC that the parties had reached an impasse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, we note that the government does not claim that any federal statute requires that the agreement be in writing in this case. There is no generally applicable federal statute of frauds, and the government concedes that 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1501 does not bar the claim. Section 1501, as pertinent here, states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An amount shall be recorded as an obligation of the United States Government only when supported by documentary evidence of...a binding agreement between an agency and another person...that is...in writing, in a way and form, and for a purpose authorized by law....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1501(a)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">United States v. American Renaissance Lines, Inc</span>., 494 F.2d 1059 (D.C. Cir. 1974), the District of Columbia Circuit interpreted the statute's predecessor, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 200. That court held that the statute "establish[ed] a requirement that government contracts...be in writing, and that contracts which are merely oral are not enforceable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1062. We have not adopted this view, and we have never interpreted &#x00A7; 1501 to ban the enforcement of oral agreements against the government. <span class="Italic">See Narva Harris Constr. Corp. v. United States</span>, 574 F.2d 508, 510 (Ct. Cl. 1978) (discussing the District of Columbia Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">American Renaissance</span>). In prior cases enforcing oral agreements, we have assumed that &#x00A7; 1501 does not bar such a claim. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Tiburzi v. Dep't of Just</span>., 269 F.3d 1346, 1351-55 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (analyzing the enforcement of oral agreements with the government without discussing &#x00A7; 1501).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1501 does not bar the enforcement of oral agreements. Rather, the provision deals with budget accounting, i.e., the circumstances in which obligations can be recorded in an agency's budget. <span class="Italic">Lublin Corp. v. United States</span>, 84 Fed. Cl. 678, 684-90 (2008) (rejecting the "remarkable claim" that &#x00A7; 1501, "a statute designed to control internal government budgeting, precludes the court from enforcing oral contracts under the Tucker Act" (internal citation omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Tiburzi</span>, we explained that "our cases make clear that where the parties intend to enter into an oral agreement, it is binding on the parties even if its terms are not embodied in a subsequent written instrument," including where one of the parties is the government, "in the absence of a statute requiring it." 269 F.3d at 1352-53 (quoting 1 Samuel Williston, <span class="Italic">Williston on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 4.8, at 300-02 (4th ed. 1990)); <span class="Italic">see also United States v. Purcell Envelope Co</span>., 249 U.S. 313, 319 (1919) (explaining that "formal execution" of a written agreement "[is] not essential to the consummation of [a] contract" with the government). The government nonetheless argues that two regulations make oral EEO settlement agreements unenforceable. We conclude that the two regulations cannot be interpreted as directed to enforceability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first regulation relied on by the government is an EEOC regulation <span id="Page_5367"></span>directing agencies to put settlement agreements in writing. The EEOC's regulation is titled "Voluntary settlement attempts" and states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Each agency shall make reasonable efforts to voluntarily settle complaints of discrimination as early as possible in, and throughout, the administrative processing of complaints, including the precomplaint counseling stage. Any settlement reached shall be in writing and signed by both parties and shall identify the claims resolved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.603 (2021).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Army followed that instruction in its own regulations. The Army's regulation--the other regulation at issue here--states: "Any settlement agreement that includes payment of compensatory damages must be in writing." Army Reg. 690-600 &#x00B6; 7-11(g). And the agreement must set forth "[t]he specific actions to be taken by the Army and the complainant constituting the terms for settlement and time frames for completion." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6; 5-13(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither regulation states that it renders oral agreements unenforceable.[1] Rather, the regulations appear to be housekeeping provisions directing agencies (including the Army) to put agreements in writing as a matter of good practice. In similar situations, the Supreme Court and we have held that housekeeping provisions in statutes and regulations do not render invalid actions taken in violation of the provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We have no occasion to answer the question whether the government's interpretation of the regulations should be awarded deference under <span class="Italic">Kisor v. Wilkie</span>, 139 S. Ct. 2400 (2019), and <span class="Italic">Auer v. Robbins</span>, 519 U.S. 452 (1997), because the government does not argue that its interpretation should be awarded such deference and because we conclude that the meaning of the regulation can be determined without addressing the question of deference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The general principle is that courts should be "most reluctant to conclude that every failure of an agency to observe a procedural requirement voids subsequent agency action." <span class="Italic">Brock v. Pierce Cnty</span>., 476 U.S. 253, 260 (1986); <span class="Italic">see also Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co</span>., 537 U.S. 149, 158 (2003) (stating the same); <span class="Italic">Brock</span>, 476 U.S. at 260 (explaining that this principle is "especially" true "when important public rights are at stake"). The Court has applied this general principle to a variety of procedural requirements present in statutes and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, in <span class="Italic">Brock</span>, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act required that the Secretary of Labor issue a final determination concerning whether a grant recipient misused funds within a 120-day period. 476 U.S. at 255-56. The Court concluded that the agency did not lose jurisdiction to act after the 120-day period because the statute did not "specif[y] a consequence for fail[ing] to comply with the provision" and explained that the deadline in the statute was meant "to spur the Secretary to action, not to limit the scope of his authority." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 259, 265. It also rejected an argument that the agency lost the ability to act because the Act's implementing regulation imposed the same 120-day deadline. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 265. The Court held that the regulations similarly "d[id] not specify any consequences of a failure to meet that deadline." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Barnhart</span>, the statute generally required that the Commissioner of Social Security "shall, before October 1, 1993," make retiree benefit assignments to certain coal industry employees; however, the Commissioner made several assignments after that date. 537 U.S. at 152. The Court held that the Commissioner's untimely assignments were not invalid, explaining that, "if a statute does not specify a consequence for noncompliance with statutory timing provisions, the federal courts will not in the ordinary course impose their own coercive sanction." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 159 (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. James Daniel Good Real Prop</span>., 510 U.S. 43, 63 (1993)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have applied this principle in our cases. In <span class="Italic">Timken U.S. Corp. v. United States</span>, 421 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2005), for example, we concluded that, even assuming that a statutory directive existed requiring that the U.S. International Trade Commission was "required to address...the main arguments of the parties in its opinions," the directive was "best read as a housekeeping requirement that is not judicially enforceable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1355, 1357. In reaching this conclusion, we explained that the requirement did not render noncompliant opinions invalid because the statute did not specify any consequence for the agency's noncompliance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1357.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Muller v. Government Printing Office</span>, 809 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2016), we determined that a contractual provision in a collective bargaining agreement that established a four-month deadline to hold an arbitration hearing was "merely a nonbinding housekeeping rule to encourage timely arbitration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377. We explained that the four-month hearing deadline was a provision "to encourage prompt handling of the grievance" and did not "stipulate[ ] any consequences...in the event of noncompliance." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1380. With no consequence for failing to observe the four-month deadline, the deadline, we concluded, was "a goal, not a requirement" and was "thus merely a housekeeping rule." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1382.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also Kimra Fibres Oy v. United States</span>, 61 F.3d 866, 871-73 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (concluding that Commerce's failure to timely comply with a regulatory notice requirement concerning the proposed revocation of antidumping orders did not bar Commerce from issuing a notice of proposed revocation past the regulatory deadline); <span class="Italic">Stevens v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 395 F. App'x 679, 682 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (holding that a collective bargaining agreement's forty-five-day decision deadline merely "articulated a goal, rather than a mandatory time limit" and was "best read as a housekeeping requirement that [was] not judicially enforceable" (quoting <span class="Italic">Timken</span>, 421 F.3d at 1357)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is also no indication in the regulatory language or the regulatory history that the EEOC or the Army regulations were designed to invalidate oral agreements. Indeed, the EEOC's proposed rule and the final rule are completely silent as to the EEOC's reasoning for the inclusion of the rule. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 57 Fed. Reg. 12,634 (Apr. 10, 1992) (final rule); 54 Fed. Reg. 45,747 (proposed Oct. 31, 1989). The Army's regulations are similarly silent as to the Army's reasoning.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Contrary to the Claims Court's decision, <span class="Italic">Tiburzi</span> and the cases that followed it are not limited to oral agreements that are read into the record at a proceeding. Indeed, the cases emphasize that an oral agreement is binding on parties when they so intended to be bound, not that the oral agreement being read into the record made it somehow enforceable. <span class="Italic">See Tiburzi</span>, 269 F.3d at 1352 ("[W]here the parties intend to enter into an oral agreement, it is binding on the parties even if its terms are not embodied in a subsequent written instrument."); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 157 F. App'x 295, 297 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("Here the proceedings before the administrative judge leave no doubt that the parties intended, and the administrative judge understood, the oral settlement to be binding."); <span class="Italic">Gray v. Dep't of Def</span>., 91 F. App'x 137, 140 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("Here, Mr. Gray entered into an oral agreement that was entered into the record....The dismissal was on the basis of the oral settlement."). The government does not contend otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government relies on government contract cases that it argues require a different result. The cases hold that, in the government procurement contract context, where a preexisting written contract is governed by regulations that require a writing to modify the agreement, oral modifications in the form of contract dispute settlements are unenforceable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, in <span class="Italic">SCM Corp. v. United States</span>, 595 F.2d 595 (Ct. Cl. 1979), the then-existing Armed Services Procurement Regulations "require[d] that settlements [be] written contracts...executed on standard form 30." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 597-98. There, a contracting officer and a contractor orally agreed to settle a procurement contract dispute pursuant to the contract's changes clause by modifying the preexisting procurement contract. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 596. Because "[t]he parties were well aware of the fact that only the written contract modification could finalize their agreement," the court held that "neither party was bound by its negotiat[ed oral agreement] until standard form 30 was executed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 598. The court noted that the case "d[id] not squarely present the question of the enforceability of oral contracts with the Government" but explained that it "deal[t] with the problem of what effect the parties' clear understanding of the procedures and regulations governing settlements had on their intent to consummate a binding contract." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court "simply h[eld] that the understanding between the parties was not a contract and cannot sustain a breach of contract action in this court." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Mil-Spec Contractors, Inc. v. United States</span>, 835 F.2d 865 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the parties to a government contract orally agreed to modify a preexisting procurement contract pursuant to the contract's changes clause to resolve a dispute stemming from the contract. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 866. The court explained that "[t]he Federal Acquisition Regulations [FAR] applicable to the contract...require[d] that a modification of a contract be in writing and executed by both parties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 867-68; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 868 (explaining that, under the applicable FAR, "any bilateral modification of a contract is a 'supplemental agreement,' which require[d] the execution of a written standard form 30"). Thus, the court concluded that the oral settlement agreement "was not an effective modification of the contract until both parties had signed a written modification agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 869 (relying on <span class="Italic">SCM</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These holdings do not suggest that the regulations here render oral agreements unenforceable. As we have previously explained, <span class="Italic">SCM</span> and <span class="Italic">Mil-Spec</span> are cases controlled by the regulations governing <span class="Italic">modifications</span> of existing contracts, which follow the "longstanding proposition," also present in Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, "that an integrated executory contract excludes modification except by a signed writing." <span class="Italic">Tex. Instruments Inc. v. United States</span>, 922 F.2d 810, 814 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (citing U.C.C. &#x00A7; 2-209(2)). The principles of <span class="Italic">SCM</span> and <span class="Italic">Mil-Spec</span> "simply are inapplicable" to cases in which there is not a provision of an existing procurement contract that is being renegotiated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. That is the same situation here. The EEOC and Army regulations do not concern <span id="Page_5368"></span>modifications to existing contracts but rather new agreements settling EEO disputes. They are housekeeping regulations that impose no limitations on the enforceability of agreements.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We also note that the parties during settlement negotiations may indicate that parties will not be bound until a written agreement is executed. E.g., <span class="Italic">Tiburzi</span>, 269 F.3d at 1353 ("Under existing law, an oral agreement is binding absent a showing that the parties 'did not intend to be bound until a written contract was signed.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Sargent v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Hum. Servs</span>., 229 F.3d 1088, 1090 (Fed. Cir. 2000)). That is not the situation here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government finally argues that, "because Army and EEOC regulations require exhaustion, Ms. Bullock's failure to do so provides an additional basis to affirm the judgment in favor of the United States." We disagree. These regulations provide a remedy before the EEOC for breach of a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504(a) ("The complainant may request that the terms of settlement agreement be specifically implemented or, alternatively, that the complaint be reinstated for further processing from the point processing ceased."); Army Reg. 690-600 &#x00B6; 5-14(a) (providing the same). We have previously explained that the requirement for Tucker Act jurisdiction before the Claims Court "normally is satisfied by the presumption that money damages are available for breach of contract, with no further inquiry being necessary." <span class="Italic">Holmes v. United States</span>, 657 F.3d 1303, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2011). And we went on to emphasize that "we s[aw] no reason for [29 C.F.R.] &#x00A7; 1614.504(a) [the EEOC regulation] to preclude a suit for money damages in the event of breach that is separate from, or in addition to, the relief the regulation provides." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1316; <span class="Italic">see also VanDesande v. United States</span>, 673 F.3d 1342, 1346 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (concluding that "the [EEOC] regulations clearly do not confine enforcement actions to the EEOC, as the Government contends").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having concluded that the Claims Court erroneously held that oral settlement agreements are unenforceable, we reverse and remand to the Claims Court to decide the two factual issues it did not address in its summary judgment order: first, whether Ms. Lynch, the attorney representing the Army, had authority to enter into the purported agreement and, second, whether there was in fact an agreement between the parties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Oliva v. United States</span>, 961 F.3d 1359, 1362-65 (Fed. Cir. 2020), considered the element of causation as to damages resulting from alleged violations of an EEO settlement precluding disclosures that prevented the plaintiff from obtaining employment and a relocation allowance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Claims Court may dismiss a complaint if it fails "to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Ct. Fed. Cl. R. 12(b)(6). We review the Claims Court's dismissal for failure to state a claim <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Jones v. United States</span>, 846 F.3d 1343, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2017). To survive a motion to dismiss, the complaint must provide "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief," <span class="Italic">Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly</span>, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007), with "sufficient factual matter...to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face," <span class="Italic">Ashcroft v. Iqbal</span>, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). We take all plausible factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 846 F.3d at 1351.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To recover for a breach of contract, "a party must allege and establish: (1) a valid contract between the parties, (2) an obligation or duty arising out of the contract, (3) a breach of that duty, and (4) damages caused by the breach." <span class="Italic">San Carlos Irrigation &#x0026; Drainage Dist. v. United States</span>, 877 F.2d 957, 959 (Fed. Cir. 1989). "Contract remedies are designed to make the nonbreaching party whole." <span class="Italic">Cal. Fed. Bank v. United States</span>, 395 F.3d 1263, 1267 (Fed. Cir. 2005). "One way to achieve that end is to give the nonbreaching party 'expectancy damages,' i.e., the benefits the nonbreaching party expected to receive in the absence of a breach." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. For expectancy damages, the party must "show that the claimed damages...would not have occurred but for the breach." <span class="Italic">Fifth Third Bank v. United States</span>, 518 F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2008). But-for or proximate causation requires "that the causal connection between the breach and the loss...be definitively established." <span class="Italic">Cal. Fed. Bank</span>, 395 F.3d at 1267-68 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Oliva argues that the Claims Court erred when it held that Mr. Oliva had failed to state a plausible claim to recover lost salary based on a finding that "the termination of [Mr. Oliva]'s employment [for performance reasons] in April 2016," rather than the VA's alleged breaches of the Settlement Agreement was "the proximate cause of [Mr. Oliva]'s lost salary." We agree with Mr. Oliva.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Oliva plausibly claimed that the alleged breaches were the cause of his lost salary. "'[D]amages for breach of contract require a showing of causation,' which in turn necessitates a 'comparison between the breach and nonbreach worlds.'" <span class="Italic">Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Entergy Nuclear Vt. Yankee, LLC</span>, 683 F.3d 1330, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting <span class="Italic">Yankee Atomic Elec. Co. v. United States</span>, 536 F.3d 1268, 1273 (Fed. Cir. 2008)). With respect to the 2015 breach, the amended complaint alleged that "[a]s a result of the [VA]'s non-conforming reference [disclosing the existence of the reprimand letter], [Mr. Oliva] did not receive an offer of employment for the El Paso, Texas position." Similarly, with respect to the 2016 breach, the amended complaint alleged that "[a]s a result of the [VA]'s non-conforming reference [disclosing that Mr. Oliva was on a Temporary Duty Assignment and the identity of Mr. Oliva's supervisor], [Mr. Oliva] did not receive an offer of employment for the Greenville, North Carolina position." Here, the amended complaint pleaded a non-breach world in which Mr. Oliva would have been employed at either El Paso or Greenville and, therefore, would not have been terminated by the VA from his existing position. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. City of Shelby</span>, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014) (holding that the plaintiffs' had pleaded a substantively plausible claim when they "stated simply, concisely, and directly events that, [the plaintiffs] alleged, entitled them to damages"). We conclude that Mr. Oliva has alleged facts sufficient to support his lost salary claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not see how Mr. Oliva's termination in April 2016 from his Waco job undercuts the plausibility of these allegations. "To analyze expectancy damages one looks at what would have happened had the contract been performed." <span class="Italic">Stockton East Water District v. United States</span>, 761 F.3d 1344, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that because "the amended complaint dates the lost salary claim from the moment of termination," Mr. Oliva has effectively claimed that "the cause of the alleged lost salary was Mr. Oliva's termination, not the alleged breach[es]." The government's position is unpersuasive. As outlined above, Mr. Oliva alleged that, had he been offered employment at El Paso or Greenville, he would have left his employment at Waco before he was terminated. <span class="Italic">Energy Nw. v. United States</span>, 641 F.3d 1300, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2011) ("[A] plaintiff seeking damages must submit a hypothetical model establishing what its costs would have been in the absence of breach." (citation omitted)). On a motion to dismiss, we are obligated to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Mr. Oliva and accept as true his plausible factual allegation that he would have received an offer of employment at either El Paso or Greenville but for the alleged breaches. <span class="Italic">See Amoco Oil Co. v. United States</span>, 234 F.3d 1374, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("On a motion to dismiss for failure state a claim, any factual allegations in the complaint are assumed to be true and all inferences are drawn in favor of the plaintiff."). There is no requirement that Mr. Oliva "prove [his] case at the pleading stage." <span class="Italic">In re Bill of Lading Transmission &#x0026; Processing Sys. Patent Litig</span>., 681 F.3d 1323, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing <span class="Italic">Skinner v. Switzer</span>, 562 U.S. 521, 529-30 (2011)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the Claims Court erred when it held that Mr. Oliva had failed to state a plausible claim to recover for lost salary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Oliva argues that the Claims Court erred when it dismissed his claim for relocation incentive pay as an additional demand of damages. We agree with Mr. Oliva.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Oliva plausibly alleged entitlement to lost relocation incentive pay. As we noted in <span class="Italic">Crow Creek Sioux Tribe v. United States</span>, 900 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2018), "there is no need to allege details of the damages calculation in the complaint." <span class="Italic">See also In re Johnson &#x0026; Johnson Talcum Powder Prods. Mktg., Sales Practices &#x0026; Liab. Litig</span>., 903 F.3d 278, 287 (3d Cir. 2018) (holding that "a plaintiff need not develop detailed economic models at the pleading stage" and only needs to allege facts "that, if proven true, would permit a factfinder to determine that [&#8197;]he suffered at least <span class="Italic">some</span> economic injury"); 5A C.

("With respect to...[pleading] general damages, no allegation describing the elements of those damages ordinarily need be made.").[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;There is no suggestion that Mr. Oliva's allegation of lost relocation incentive pay is a request for special damages, nor did the Claims Court invoke the heightened pleading standard for special damages under Court of Federal Claims Rule 9(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Claims Court noted that although Mr. Oliva had "plausibly alleged that the VA determined that a relocation incentive would be provided for [the Greenville] position, [Mr. Oliva] fail[ed] to sufficiently allege facts in the amended complaint to show that he would have been eligible to receive this [relocation] pay."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government relies on OPM regulations providing that relocation pay is only available to "an employee who...[i]s an employee of the Federal Government immediately before the relocation." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 575.205(a)(2). Furthermore, "[a] relocation incentive may be paid only when the employee's rating of record...for the position held immediately before the move is at least 'Fully Successful' or equivalent." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 575.205(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Claims Court adopted this position and held that Mr. Oliva was required to allege the date "when he learned that the VA would not offer him the Greenville Position" and that "he was a federal employee" with a "Fully Successful, or equivalent, rating of record" "when he learned this <span id="Page_5369"></span>information" because the OPM regulations state that the employee must have the requisite status for relocation "immediately before relocation." Mr. Oliva's amended complaint stated that "[b]ut for the VA's breach of the Settlement Agreement, [he] would have received relocation incentive pay."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Claims Court also held that Mr. Oliva had alleged "no facts in the amended complaint to show that the VA determined the amount of relocation pay that he would have received to accept the Greenville Position." The Claims Court held that Mr. Oliva's claim was also not supported because he had "not explain[ed] how he calculated the $87,312.00 in relocation incentive pay that he seeks in the amended complaint." However, such detailed allegations as to the damages calculation were not required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The amended complaint set forth sufficient factual allegations to plausibly claim that Mr. Oliva was entitled to receive relocation incentive pay. Accordingly, we conclude that the Claims Court erred when it dismissed his claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that Mr. Oliva has also filed a complaint with the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board"), which we address in a contemporaneously issued decision. <span class="Italic">See Oliva v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, No. 19-1990. During oral argument, the government suggested that Mr. Oliva was attempting to obtain double recovery by simultaneously filing complaints before the Claims Court and the Board. "The purpose of damages for breach of contract is generally to put the wronged party in as good a position as he would have been had the contract been fully performed." <span class="Italic">S. Cal. Fed. Sav. &#x0026; Loan Ass'n v. United States</span>, 422 F.3d 1319, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2005). "[D]ouble recovery for the same injury is inappropriate" when the two causes of action arise from the "same operative facts." <span class="Italic">Tex. Advanced Optoelectronic Sols., Inc. v. Renesas Elecs. Am., Inc</span>., 895 F.3d 1304, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (alteration in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">Aero Prods. Int'l, Inc. v. Intex Recreation Corp</span>., 466 F.3d 1000, 1017, 1019 (Fed. Cir. 2006)). Mr. Oliva admits that he cannot recover twice for the same injury. There is no possibility of double recovery because we hold in <span class="Italic">Oliva</span>, No. 191990, that Mr. Oliva cannot recover on his Whistleblower Protection Act theory for damages for loss of the El Paso job.</p>
