<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-318"><span class="space">l.</span> Remedial Discipline of Supervisor; Apologies; Public Statements</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Penitentiary, Lewisburg and AFGE Local 148 C-33</span>, 39 FLRA 1288, 1295-1305 (1991), addressed an award that arose after a supervisor apparently failed to respond to a subordinate's request for relief to attend to his immediate medical problems. When the subordinate was not released, he became seriously ill on the job. Reviewing the resulting grievance, the arbitrator directed that the agency issue a reprimand to the supervisor, that a letter of apology be issued to the employee, that the supervisor be scheduled for sensitivity training, and that the employee receive a copy of the supervisor's reprimand. FLRA rejected all exceptions of the agency other than as to the last element of the remedy:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we find that the award is deficient to the extent that it requires the Agency to provide the grievant with a copy of the letter of reprimand issued to the second-line supervisor. Accordingly, we will modify that portion of the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the portion of the award requiring it to apologize to the grievant in writing is deficient because the Arbitrator: (1) issued a remedy that is inconsistent with another arbitrator's decision; (2) exceeded his authority by issuing a "punitive" remedy; and (3) rendered an award that does not derive its essence from the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's reliance on the award of another arbitrator. Arbitration awards are not precedential and, therefore, a contention that an award conflicts with other arbitration awards provides no basis for finding an award deficient under the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's argument that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by issuing a "punitive" remedy. The Agency does not define what it means by a "punitive" remedy. It is well-settled that an arbitrator exceeds his or her authority by resolving an issue not submitted to arbitration or awarding relief to persons not encompassed within the grievance....&#8197;Moreover, an arbitrator is precluded from awarding punitive damages against the Federal Government....&#8197;As arbitrators have great latitude in fashioning remedies,...we find that characterizing a remedy as "punitive" does not establish an independent basis for finding an award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the portion of the remedy requiring the Agency to issue a written apology to the grievant was responsive to the issues framed by the Arbitrator and was within the Arbitrator's authority to award to the grievant. Two of the issues before the Arbitrator were: (1) whether the grievant was "harassed, intimidated, restrained, coerced, threat[e]ned, and/or [whether there] were acts of reprisal demonstrated against him by [the second-line supervisor]?'; and (2) whether "the [Agency] violate[d] Article 18, [s]pecifically Section B-Assignment and Hours Of Work?" As the conduct of the Agency and its officials was directly at issue in this case, we find that the Arbitrator did not exceed his authority when he ordered the Agency to issue a written apology to the grievant based on his finding of improper conduct....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the Agency's assertion that this portion of the remedy fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has failed to demonstrate that the portion of the remedy requiring a written apology from the Agency is deficient under any of the tests set forth above.&#x2003;As we noted above, arbitrators have great latitude in fashioning remedies,...and the Authority has previously permitted an arbitrator to order a party to apologize as part of the remedy, <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Jersey City, New Jersey and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2369</span>, 27 FLRA 104 (1987)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As part of the remedy, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to "prepare a 'Letter of Reprimand' to [the second line supervisor] citing [h]im with a failure to look after the medical concerns of [the grievant], on the evening of January 6, 1989" and give a copy of the letter of reprimand to the grievant "for his personal file."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that ordering the Agency to issue a letter of reprimand to a supervisor is improper because it: (1) violates 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 735.107 [now 735.102]; (2) is inconsistent with management's general disciplinary authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7503 and 7512-13, where the discipline concerned exceeds a written reprimand; (3) is inconsistent with management's right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the statute; and (4) is contrary to other provisions of the Statute. The Agency also argues that the Arbitrator: (1) exceeded his authority by issuing a "punitive" award; (2) exceeded his authority because the issues he framed and the remedies requested by the Union did not empower him to order management to discipline the second-line supervisor; and (3) rendered an award that does not derive its essence from the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's claim that ordering it to issue a letter of reprimand to a supervisor violates 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 735.107 [now 735.102]. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 735.107, an agency has the right to discipline its employees, including supervisors, for violations of agency regulations. There has been no showing that the second-line supervisor violated Agency regulations. Therefore, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 735.107 does not apply, and we reject the Agency's claim that this remedy is contrary to that regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's argument that the remedy is inconsistent with management's general disciplinary authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7503 and 7512-13. We note that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7503, 7512, and 7513 specify the disciplinary actions that an agency may take against its employees, including supervisors, such as suspending them for 14 days or less, suspending them for more than 14 days, removing them, reducing their grades or pay, and instituting furloughs of 30 days or less. However, those sections do not apply to written reprimands and, therefore, the Agency's reliance on them is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in our view, requiring the Agency to issue a letter of reprimand to a supervisor does not directly interfere with management's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute because, as acknowledged by the Agency, that right applies only to "employees" and section 7103(a)(2) of the Statute expressly excludes supervisors from the definition of "employee."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we reject the Agency's argument that the remedy is inconsistent with the Statute because the Statute precludes: (1) arbitrators from <span id="page_2300"></span>awarding remedies that adversely affect nonunit employees; or (2) parties from contractually empowering agencies to agree to discipline any supervisor found to have violated another agreement provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency argues that under section 7103(a)(9)(C) and (a)(12) of the Statute,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">arbitrators who find that employers have violated the terms of a[&#8197;] negotiated agreement so as to adversely affect the conditions of employment of unit employees are empowered under section 7121 of the Statute to do no more than construct remedies which correct the effects of such violations on <span class="Italic">those</span> conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, a matter may concern the conditions of employment of unit employees even though it also affects nonunit employees or positions....&#8197;The Arbitrator found, in part, that the Agency violated "Article 6, Rights of the Employee-Section b, of the Master Agreement" by threatening and harassing the grievant. We find that the Arbitrator's remedy in this case was designed to correct the effects of the Agency's violation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement on the grievant's conditions of employment. Having found that the grievant was harmed by the Agency's violation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the Arbitrator properly fashioned a remedy designed to correct the effects of that violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that in arguing that the Statute prohibits the Arbitrator from awarding this remedy, the Agency improperly relied on negotiability cases that focused only on the effects proposals had on the conditions of employment of nonunit employees. We have reexamined the issues raised in those cases. Now, in determining the negotiability of a proposal that affects both unit and non-unit employees or positions, we do not consider the effect of the proposal on nonunit employees or positions. Rather, we look at whether the matter vitally affects the working conditions of unit employees....&#8197;In short, the fact that a proposal affects persons outside the unit does not in and of itself render that proposal nonnegotiable. Accordingly, we reject the Agency's argument that the Statute precludes arbitrators from awarding remedies that benefit or adversely affect nonunit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have already noted that the conduct of the second-line supervisor was expressly at issue in this case and that the remedies addressed the effects of the supervisor's conduct on the grievant's conditions of employment. As the Arbitrator is authorized by section 7121 of the statute to award remedies affecting unit employees' conditions of employment and as the Agency has failed to establish that this remedy is unlawful, we reject the Agency's argument that the Statute prohibits this remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note the Agency's argument that even if the parties' agreement gave arbitrators the remedial authority to require that management take personnel actions against specific supervisors, "the Statute must be read as precluding parties from contractually empowering arbitrators to do so." The Agency appears to be addressing whether a provision of the parties' agreement that provided for the remedy in this case could lawfully have been negotiated. We note at the outset that the Agency has provided no support for the conclusion that an arbitration remedy must be based on a specific provision of the contract. Moreover, even if an arbitration remedy did have to be based on a specific contract provision, nothing in the Agency's argument indicates that the Arbitrator was precluded by the Statute from granting this remedy in the circumstances before him or that such a provision would not be within the range of matters that can be bargained. Even if a contractual provision requiring management to take personnel actions against specific supervisors would be found, in a negotiability context, to directly or excessively interfere with a management right, that fact would not necessarily preclude the same type of provision from being found to be an enforceable arrangement in an arbitration context. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>). The Agency has cited no section of the Statute precluding parties from negotiating such a provision, and none is apparent to us. Accordingly, in the context of this arbitration case, we reject the Agency's argument in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7122(a) of the Statute provides that the Authority may find an arbitration award deficient if it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation. The Agency has cited no law, rule, or regulation prohibiting an arbitrator from requiring an agency to issue a letter of reprimand to a supervisor, and none is otherwise apparent to us. Accordingly, we conclude that the Agency has failed to establish that requiring it to issue a letter of reprimand to the second-line supervisor is contrary to law, rule, or regulation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's argument that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by issuing a "punitive" remedy that applies to a nonunit employee. We note that the Agency cites <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> and <span class="Italic">EPA</span> to support its assertion that the Arbitrator's remedies are improper because "nowhere in the description of the issues is there any claim that any provision of the parties' agreement calls for, or authorizes an arbitrator to order, disciplinary action be taken against...the supervisor who is found to have violated the agreement." Those cases are distinguishable because they involved orders that provided remedies for matters or personnel beyond the scope of the issues submitted to arbitration. In this case, however, the Arbitrator had before him the conduct of the nonunit employee. As noted previously, two of the issues before the Arbitrator in this case were: (1) whether the grievant was "harassed, intimidated, restrained, coerced, threat[e]ned, and/or [whether there] were acts of reprisal demonstrated against him by [the second-line supervisor]?"; and (2) whether "the [Agency] violate[d] Article 18, [s]pecifically Section B--Assignment and Hours Of Work?" The remedy requiring that the second-line supervisor be issued a letter of reprimand directly addresses the harm that the supervisor's improper conduct caused the grievant. Moreover, as stated previously, the Agency's characterization of the award as "punitive" provides no independent basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Further, as arbitrators have great latitude in fashioning remedies, the fact that this remedy was not requested by the Union provides no basis for setting it aside.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As part of the remedy, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to give a copy of the letter of reprimand to the grievant for his personal files. The Agency claims that by requiring that a copy of the second-line supervisor's letter of reprimand "be personally given to" the grievant, the remedy is contrary to law because it violates provisions of the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a, states, in part, that no agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records without the prior written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. Exemption (b)(2) to the Privacy Act provides that such information may be disclosed when disclosure would be required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In this case, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to give the grievant a copy of the second-line supervisor's letter of reprimand. As there is no indication that the supervisor has consented to this disclosure of his personnel record, we must determine whether its disclosure would be required under FOIA. Exemption (b)(6) to FOIA authorizes withholding information in "personnel and medical files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy."...&#8197;Therefore, if releasing the letter of reprimand to the grievant would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy, FOIA does not require it to be released....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A letter of reprimand is information contained in an employee's personnel record and an employee has a privacy interest in not having such a disciplinary action disclosed....&#8197;We note that the Union in this case did not file an opposition to the Agency's exceptions and, thus, did not indicate what, if any, interest it, the grievant, or the public had in the disclosure of the letter of reprimand. While there is an interest in having the Agency comply with the remedy to reprimand the second-line supervisor, we find that there is no asserted or apparent interest in the grievant possessing a copy of the reprimand itself. We conclude, therefore, that in the circumstances of this case, releasing the second-line supervisor's letter of reprimand to the grievant would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. Accordingly, we will set aside that portion of the award requiring the Agency to provide the grievant with a copy of the letter of reprimand issued to the second-line supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As part of the remedy, the Arbitrator required the Agency to ensure that within 1 year from the date of the award, the second-line supervisor is given or will take a class in "'Sensitivity Training' concerning Human Relations." The Agency argues that this portion of the award is deficient because: (1) it interferes with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute; (2) the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by issuing a "punitive" remedy that applies to a nonunit employee; (3) the Arbitrator issued an award which does not draw its essence from the parties' agreement; or (4) such a remedy violates the Statute and could never have been contractually authorized.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an agency contends that an arbitrator's award enforcing a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement is contrary to section 7106(a), we will examine the provision enforced by the arbitrator to determine: (1) if it constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights; and (2) if, as interpreted by the arbitrator, it abrogates the exercise of a management right....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the Agency, through the actions of the second-line supervisor, violated Article 6, Rights of the Employee-Section b of the parties' agreement by failing to give proper attention to the grievant's medical concern. In this regard, the Arbitrator noted that the grievant endeavored to bring his medical concern to the attention of the second-line supervisor, stating that he "just wanted to get his medication and eat a diet meal."...&#8197;Further, the Arbitrator found that the supervisor: (1) "did indeed by his actions harass, intimidate, restrain...[the grievant] because of his medical concern," and (2) was not sensitive to a [s]ubordinate's medical concern....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 6, Section b preserves an employee's right to bring "matters of <span id="page_2301"></span>personal concern" to management's attention. As interpreted by the Arbitrator, such matters include matters relating to an employee's health. This case illustrates the adverse effects on an employee when the matter of personal concern is a potentially life-threatening condition arising at the workplace. The provision attempts to ameliorate the adverse effects and to bring employees' concerns to management's attention so that management may take appropriate action. Therefore, we find that the provision constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected when management exercises its rights without considering "matters of personal concern" to an employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, it appears from the Arbitrator's award that the required sensitivity training is intended to teach the supervisor how to better interact with employees and better understand their needs and concerns. As the Arbitrator is ordering the second-line supervisor to take a class that will teach him to pay more attention to "matters of personal concern" to employees, the Arbitrator's award clearly constitutes an enforcement of Article 6, Section b of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Arbitrator's enforcement of Article 6, Section b does not abrogate the Agency's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. In this regard, we note that the requirement of sensitivity training does not prevent the Agency from making training determinations as to other employees and preserves the Agency's ability to determine matters including when and where the supervisor's sensitivity training is to take place, as well as its specific content and duration.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Department of Justice, parent organization to the Bureau of Prisons, sought review of the <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 148</span> result in the D.C. Circuit, but the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review FLRA's decision on exceptions to the award. FLRA's decision did not involve a ULP issue (that would have made the decision judicially reviewable), and FLRA's decision did not fall into that narrow class of cases establishing a right to judicial review of an agency determination beyond its statutory jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 981 F.2d 1339, 1342-44 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (discussed in <a href="0100-2023-18-001.html#sec10-1">Chapter 10</a> on Judicial Review). Another "apology" remedy was sustained, over exceptions, in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Midwest Region and NTEU</span>, 42 FLRA 1098, 1101-04 (1991). [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-11-064.html#sec3-65">Information Concerning Managers, Supervisors</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-11-051.html#sec3-52">Right to Information</a>," as to union statutory information requests to obtain material concerning discipline of supervisors.]</p>
<p class="noindent">In the <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> litigation, the agency argued to the court that the supervisor might find it impossible to defend an action an arbitrator instructed an agency to impose. Although the court's discussion concerned judicial review jurisdiction and not the practicalities of civil service law, the court replied to the government's argument in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 981 F.2d at 1344:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]t oral argument, the agency expressed concern that the FLRA's decision on the merits of the arbitral award is a final determination that will have a binding effect on the agency and the supervisor in future proceedings. Counsel for the DOJ speculated that the supervisor might be foreclosed from contesting the discipline under applicable agency grievance procedures. In other words, the DOJ voiced concern that the supervisor might be bound by a determination made in an arbitral proceeding to which he was not a party. The DOJ's counsel also expressed concern that, if the agency permits the supervisor to contest the disciplinary action, and the action is found unwarranted, then the agency would be in the awkward position of having to defy the FLRA by refusing to carry out the arbitral award. Thus, the DOJ posited that agencies will be subjected to "Conflicting decrees and obligations" if we allow arbitrators to order agencies to discipline their supervisors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is a simple answer to both of the agency's concerns: the FLRA has no authority to decide whether sanctions taken against a supervisor are meritorious. The supervisor is free to challenge the disciplinary action through any applicable grievance system. Thus, the decision of the FLRA in upholding an arbitral award in which an employer is instructed to reprimand a supervisor has no preclusive effect in any subsequent action that may be brought by the supervisor to challenge that discipline. A supervisor disciplined pursuant to an arbitral award has the same right to challenge the discipline taken against him as if the agency had imposed that discipline absent arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC Kansas City and AFGE Local 910</span>, 65 FLRA 809, 814-15 (2011), considered unobjectionable the portion of an award, requiring management to cancel a reassignment of an employee, that called on the parties to agree on an appropriate public announcement acknowledging that the grievant was vindicated at arbitration and to publicly inform officials at an affiliated medical school that the employee, a VA physician, was vindicated at arbitration:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority for two reasons.&#x2003;First, it claims that the Arbitrator impermissibly delegated his authority to award appropriate remedies to the Union by allowing it to approve or disapprove the Agency's public acknowledgment of the arbitration's outcome. Second, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator does not have the authority to order the Agency to provide such public notification to the University of Kansas Medical Center.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator exceeds his or her authority when the arbitrator fails to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolves an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregards specific limitations on his or her authority, or awards relief to persons who are not encompassed within the grievance. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def., Army &#x0026; Air Force Exch. Serv., </span>51 FLRA 1371, 1378 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority when he ordered the parties to agree on an appropriate public announcement acknowledging that the grievant had been vindicated at arbitration and to publicly inform the officials at the University of Kansas Medical Center of the grievant's vindication. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., Airways Facility Serv., Nat'l Airway Sys. Eng'g Div., Okla. City, Okla., </span>60 FLRA 565, 569 (2005) (exception claiming arbitrator exceeded authority denied where there was no violation of express limitation on authority). The Arbitrator found that the grievant's damages as a result of the Agency's breach of contract were largely to his reputation. Thus, a public announcement of the arbitration's outcome at the grievant's longtime place of employment is directly responsive to any damage that may have occurred to the grievant's reputation as a result of the unsubstantiated accusations regarding the grievant's clinical research.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator failed to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolved an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregarded specific limitations on his authority, or awarded relief to persons who are not encompassed within the grievance, we deny the Agency's exception that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The award is not too ambiguous to implement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will find an award deficient when it is incomplete, ambiguous, or so contradictory as to make implementation of the award impossible. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Labor, Mine Safety &#x0026; Health Admin. Se. Dist., </span>40 FLRA 937, 943 (1991). For an award to be found deficient on this ground, the appealing party must show that implementation of the award is impossible because the meaning and effect of the award are too unclear or uncertain. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Tex., </span>56 FLRA 1057, 1074 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is ambiguous because, in directing the Agency to publicly acknowledge the grievant's vindication at arbitration, the Arbitrator did not provide any guidelines regarding what constitutes an appropriate "public acknowledgment." However, the Agency does not demonstrate that making such a public acknowledgment is impossible simply because it must issue the acknowledgment "in an appropriate public manner, as agreed to by the Union[.]" Accordingly, as there is no basis for finding that the award is impossible to implement, we find that the award is not deficient in this regard, and deny the exception. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., </span>65 FLRA 373, 377 (2010).</p>
