<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-241"><span class="space">N.</span> PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE; MITIGATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">Proposals were nonnegotiable that required the employer to follow principles of progressive discipline and that required an arbitrator to determine whether those principles had been followed in the course of disciplinary action. The proposals impinged on management's right to choose the particular disciplinary action to be imposed and were not an appropriate arrangement because the burden to the employer outweighed the benefit to the employees. But very general standards were negotiable: the proposal was that the agency consider "all factors involved, including the gravity and frequency of the offense, the existence of mitigating circumstances and the employees' previous disciplinary record." <span class="Italic">Int'l Plate Printers Local 2 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 25 FLRA 113, 130, 134 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 46 FLRA 696, 767-68 (1992) (Provisions 35 and 38, requiring progressive discipline, were nonnegotiable because they infringed on management's right to discipline employees); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1426 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Sheridan</span>, 45 FLRA 867, 872 (1992) (Proposal 2, mandating progressive discipline, excessively interfered with management's right to discipline, despite the existence of an agency regulation suggesting progressive discipline; the proposal, if adopted, would continue the requirement absent a regulation); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point and IAM Local 2297</span>, 36 FLRA 28, 32 (1990) (Provision 2, requiring that the penalty imposed shall be the minimum that can reasonably be expected to correct the employee, and penalties shall be applied consistent with the offense through the unit, interfered with agency's right to impose discipline and did not qualify as arrangement because of excessive interference with that management right); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1931 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Weapons Station, Concord</span>, 32 <span id="page_787"></span>FLRA 1023, 1045-46 (1988) (Provision 19, requiring that "all disciplinary action taken against the union employee shall be the minimum necessary to correct the offending employee," excessively interfered with management's right to take disciplinary action).</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable were proposals that limited discipline to instances where closer supervision or on-the-job training would not achieve the corrective action sought, determined the first disciplinary step and who would take it, required the minimum discipline that could reasonably be expected to attain the purpose sought from the disciplinary action, and required the use of a guide when administering discipline. FLRA concluded, on the strength of <span class="Italic">Int'l Plate Printers Local 2 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 25 FLRA 113 (1987) [discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-14-210.html#sec6-211">Definitions, Limitations of Offenses; Unlawful or Unsafe Work Orders</a>"], that the proposals were not appropriate arrangements because they excessively interfered with management's right to discipline employees. <span class="Italic">West Point Elem. Sch. Teachers Ass'n and U.S. Military Academy Elem. Sch., West Point</span>, 29 FLRA 1531, 1539 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 88 (1993) (same as to Provision 46: a performance-based disciplinary action under Chapter 75); <span class="Italic">IAM Lodge 39 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Norfolk</span>, 41 FLRA 1452, 1456 (1991) (proposal excessively interfered with management's right to discipline that required suspension or disciplinary downgrading could be counted as prior offense if effective date of action was not more than three years before date of adverse action it supported).</p>
<p class="noindent">A provision restricted management's right to discipline because it required that, if remedial action for unacceptable performance was necessary, management would attempt (where possible) to apply that action progressively, i.e., reassignment, demotion, termination. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2786 and DMA</span>, 20 FLRA 193, 193-94 (1985). Another nonnegotiable proposal required two prior counselings before an employee could be placed on leave restriction. The proposal did not delay the exercise of a management right; it prevented, it absent the counseling, regardless of the circumstances warranting imposition of leave restriction. <span class="Italic">NFFE and Dept. of Interior, BLM</span>, 29 FLRA 1491, 1510 (1987). A similar proposal was nonnegotiable, for the same reasons, that required management to inform employees of suspected leave abuse 90 days before taking any action and that precluded management from taking action against the employee if the leave problems were corrected. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3884 and VA Med. and Reg'l Office Ctr., Fargo, N.D.</span>, 30 FLRA 10, 12 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3732 and Dept. of Transp., Merchant Marine Acad., Kings Point, N.Y.</span>, 39 FLRA 187, 194 (1991), rejected progressive discipline requirements as appropriate arrangements (Provision 2) through reasoning that ignored a long tradition of progressive and constructive discipline in industrial relations. The proposal was:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Article 22. Disciplinary and Adverse Actions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Section 2. General</span>: An employee shall be subject to disciplinary/adverse actions whenever it is warranted by the employee's conduct or unsatisfactory performance. Such actions shall be taken only for just and sufficient cause as shall promote the efficiency of the service and will be administered in a constructive, progressive, consistent, reasonable and timely manner. Nothing in this Article is meant to infringe upon management's statutory right to remove an employee as a result of an egregious offense for which removal is provided.</p>
<p class="noindent">The proposal was too much for federal-sector bargaining to bear, 39 FLRA at 199:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note first that Provision 2 concerns employees who are removed or otherwise disciplined based on conduct or unsatisfactory performance warranting such actions.&#x2003;By requiring the Agency to impose discipline in a constructive, progressive, consistent, reasonable and timely manner and by restricting the Agency's right to remove employees, Provision 2 limits the Agency's discretion to determine the penalty it deems appropriate in each individual circumstance giving rise to a disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 2's restrictions on the Agency's ability to remove employees or otherwise determine appropriate disciplinary penalties for employee misconduct constitute a benefit to employees. However, these employee benefits are obtained only through significant restrictions on the Agency's right to remove or take other disciplinary actions. In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the limitations Provision 2 places on the penalties the Agency may impose for misconduct outweigh the benefits to employees and, thereby, excessively interfere with management's rights to remove or take other disciplinary action....</p>
<p class="noindent">Variations on progressive discipline proposals have not fared well. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army Hq., XVII Airborne Corps and Ft. Bragg</span>, 34 FLRA 903, 904, 908 (1990), declared nonnegotiable a proposal requiring the agency to consider only like prior offenses when determining appropriate disciplinary action for subsequent offenses. The proposal directly interfered with management's right to discipline and was not an appropriate arrangement because:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...By preventing management from considering all offenses when determining appropriate disciplinary action for subsequent offenses, the proposal would limit management's ability to determine the appropriate penalty for employees who commit offenses of different types. Therefore, the proposal restricts the Agency's discretion to impose the discipline it deems appropriate in each individual case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although this restriction of the Agency's ability to determine a penalty constitutes a benefit because employees would have lesser penalties imposed, the excessive interference with management's right to discipline outweighs this benefit. Consequently, this proposal is not an appropriate arrangement....</p>
<p class="noindent">The occasional proposal that attempts to instill some moderation in the disciplinary process survives scrutiny. A negotiable proposal called on management to consider certain factors prior to deciding what corrective action would be a proper response to an incident or an act. Those factors included the degree of harm or interference caused; the seriousness of the act relative to the employee's position; whether the penalty is fair, equitable, and no more severe than reasonably required to correct the problem; past corrective action; and mitigating circumstances. <span class="Italic">New York State Nurses Ass'n and VA Bronx Med. Ctr.</span>, 30 FLRA 706, 733, 764 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that perpetuated management's ability to follow "established office policy" in the selection of a penalty while it required that disciplinary and adverse actions "shall generally be progressive in nature and fairly related to the offense" was negotiable to the extent it required management to consider the mitigating factors established by the MSPB in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280 (1981). <span class="Italic">NTEU and PTO</span>, 53 FLRA 539, 557-59 (1997), said of Proposals 5 and 6:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both parties acknowledge that the Authority previously has found nonnegotiable proposals requiring the use of progressive discipline.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., Merchant Marine Academy</span>, 39 FLRA at 198-99; <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, North Carolina and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local 2297</span>, 36 FLRA 28, 32-36 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span> <span class="Italic">Air Station</span>). In those cases, the Authority held that restrictions on an agency's ability to choose the specific penalty to impose in disciplinary actions directly interfere with the right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. The same conclusion applies here. Although Proposals 5 and 6 are not written in mandatory terms and would permit management to deviate from the use of progressive discipline, as we have explained above, they would nonetheless require the use of progressive discipline in some circumstances. Accordingly, they affect the exercise of management's right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously has recognized that, as a general matter, a provision that requires an agency to administer discipline in a fair or consistent manner is intended to ameliorate the adverse effects on employees who are subject to the exercise of management's right to take disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Fort Jackson</span>, 51 FLRA at 1365. Proposals 5 and 6, under which disciplinary actions are "generally" to be progressive and fairly relate to the offense, similarly are intended to address the adverse effects on employees flowing from the exercise of management's right to discipline. Inasmuch as the proposals would apply to those employees against whom disciplinary and adverse actions have been taken, they are also sufficiently tailored to administer "balm" "only to hurts arising from" the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">Minerals Management Service</span>, 969 F.2d at 1162. Accordingly, we find that the proposals constitute arrangements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the proposals are appropriate because they would not excessively interfere with the right to discipline.&#x2003;The proposals would ameliorate the adverse effects on employees by insulating them from more severe discipline than that which is progressive and proportional to the infraction. At the same time, management's ability to determine an appropriate penalty would not be seriously circumscribed for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the proposals explicitly provide for the use of progressive discipline unless doing so would be inconsistent with "established office policy." As explained above, the Agency retains the right to change its policy of progressive discipline and to apply the policy in effect at the time disciplinary and adverse actions are taken. Thus, the Agency would not, in fact, be required to use progressive discipline in all instances unless its own policies so dictate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the proposals incorporate Section 3 of Articles 35 and 36, which were not disapproved and which each set forth a non-exhaustive list of "mitigating and/or aggravating circumstances" that the Agency will apply in deciding what discipline or adverse actions are appropriate. Thus, the Agency has already agreed to apply factors that may affect the exercise of its right to discipline. We do not view the requirement that the Agency "generally" use progressive discipline as a more severe restriction on the exercise of management's right than management has already agreed to impose on itself. In our view, the intrusion on the exercise of management's right to discipline that is engendered by the proposals has less weight in view of other restrictions the Agency has agreed to apply. <span class="Italic">Cf. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management v. FLRA</span>, <span id="page_788"></span>873 F.2d 1505, 1510-11 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (court rejected agency argument that provision authorizing 10-day delay in employee suspensions substantively diminished agency's right to suspend immediately disruptive employees; court found that agency had already agreed to negotiate over procedures that would have had the effect of retaining disruptive employees for more than 10 days).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the proposals do not mandate that progressive discipline be used in all instances, they are distinguishable from proposals and provisions in other cases, including those cited by the Agency, that were deemed to excessively interfere with the right to discipline. In such cases, the agencies would have been required to either use progressive discipline or impose a minimum penalty in disciplinary actions. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Merchant Marine Academy</span>, 39 FLRA at 198-99; <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Air</span> <span class="Italic">Station</span>, 36 FLRA at 32-36; <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1931 and Department of the Navy, Naval Weapons Station, Concord, California</span>, 32 FLRA 1023, 1044-47 (1988), <span class="Italic">rev'd as other matters sub nom. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy, Naval Weapons Station, Concord, California v. FLRA</span>, Nos. 88-7408/7470 (9th Cir. Feb. 7, 1989) (Order); <span class="Italic">International Plate Printers, Die Stampers and Engravers Union</span> <span class="Italic">of North America, AFL-CIO, Local 2 and Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C.</span>, 25 FLRA 113, 133-34 (1987). Here, there are no such absolute requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the proposals are similar, in effect, to the provision at issue in <span class="Italic">Fort Jackson</span>. The provision there stated that "discipline and adverse actions will be based on just cause and be consistently applied equitably and promote the efficiency of the Federal Service." 51 FLRA at 1363. The Authority found that the provision did not excessively interfere with the right to discipline because, as relevant here, the provision did not require the agency to apply the same penalties under all circumstances and it preserved the agency's ability to take into account all the circumstances surrounding the disciplinary or adverse action. Although Proposals 5 and 6 are different in that they focus on the use of progressive discipline, they are similar in that they preserve management's ability to determine appropriate discipline in a manner comparable to <span class="Italic">Fort Jackson</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, and on balance, we find that the benefits afforded to employees under Proposals 5 and 6, outweigh the intrusion on the exercise of management's right to discipline. Accordingly, the proposals are within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Executive Branch affirmed it was not wedded to progressive discipline in the now-revoked Executive Order 13,839 of May 25, 2018 ("Executive Order Promoting Accountability and Streamlining Removal Procedures Consistent with Merit System Principles"), at <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11939/promoting-accountability-and-streamlining-removal-procedures-consistent-with-merit-system-principles">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11939/promoting-accountability-and-streamlining-removal-procedures-consistent-with-merit-system-principles</a>, issued by President Trump:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 2. <span class="Italic">Principles for Accountability in the Federal Workforce.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Supervisors and deciding officials should not be required to use progressive discipline. The penalty for an instance of misconduct should be tailored to the facts and circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;Each employee's work performance and disciplinary history is unique, and disciplinary action should be calibrated to the specific facts and circumstances of each individual employee's situation. Conduct that justifies discipline of one employee at one time does not necessarily justify similar discipline of a different employee at a different time--particularly where the employees are in different work units or chains of supervision--and agencies are not prohibited from removing an employee simply because they did not remove a different employee for comparable conduct. Nonetheless, employees should be treated equitably, so agencies should consider appropriate comparators as they evaluate potential disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;Suspension should not be a substitute for removal in circumstances in which removal would be appropriate. Agencies should not require suspension of an employee before proposing to remove that employee, except as may be appropriate under applicable facts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;When taking disciplinary action, agencies should have discretion to take into account an employee's disciplinary record and past work record, including all past misconduct--not only similar past misconduct. Agencies should provide an employee with appropriate notice when taking a disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="noindent">OPM followed suit with "Guidance on the Use of Progressive Discipline and Tables of Penalties," accompanied by a memorandum to agency heads from the OPM Director of October 19, 2019, summarizing the Guidance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A number of agencies have established policies that require progressive discipline when determining penalties for employee misconduct.&#x2003;Progressive discipline is the imposition of the least serious disciplinary or adverse action applicable to correct misconduct with penalties imposed at an escalating level of subsequent offenses. Many agencies have also implemented a table of penalties which provides a list of common infractions along with a suggested range of penalties for each infraction. Finally, agencies often receive collective bargaining proposals from labor unions seeking to impose t he use of progressive discipline and tables of penalties and have adopted related provisions in collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies should be mindful that neither the use of progressive discipline nor the adoption of a table of penalties is required by statute, case law or U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations. Further, the use of these approaches presents challenges that agencies should consider prior to adoption. In enacting current law, Congress provided managers with maximum flexibility to pursue adverse actions, whether the underlying impetus is a conduct issue, a failure to perform, or any other reasons related to Federal employment, as needed for the efficiency of the service. Moreover, E.O. 13839 itself, as discussed in the annexed memorandum, provides that supervisors and deciding officials should not be required to use progressive discipline and should calibrate penalties to the specific facts of the particular situation. OPM is aware that agencies have argued to arbitrators that it is inconceivable that the conduct at issue could have resulted in any penalty less than removal. Arbitrators have pointed to the existence of tables of penalties for that type of misconduct as a basis for mitigating the penalty. The attachment to this memorandum provides guidance on progressive discipline and tables of penalties for agencies to consider when updating disciplinary policies or engaging in collective bargaining.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Affected agencies shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law and the policy articulated in EO 14003, and as soon as practicable, suspend, revise or rescind the actions covered in any agency policies implementing requirements pursuant to section 7(b) of EO 13839. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">Affected agencies must withdraw any collective bargaining proposals in on-going collective bargaining that are intended to implement requirements of section 7(b) of EO 13839 and, as necessary, draft proposals consistent with law and taking into account agency-specific circumstances, as appropriate. This includes any related matter currently pending before the FMCS and the FSIP. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent affected agencies successfully renegotiated any collective bargaining agreement (CBA) provisions intended to implement requirements of 7(b) of EO 13839, agencies must identify these provisions and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law and the policy articulated in EO 14003, engage impacted unions, as soon as practicable, to suspend, revise or rescind the actions covered in these CBA provisions.[6] In carrying out this task, agencies should take a hard look at the degree to which, if any, EO 13839 influenced bargaining-table strategy and decision making.

<p class="noindent-1">Agency actions to implement any other requirements of EO 13839 must cease immediately. This includes the requirement to submit certain data required by Section 6 of EO 13839.
