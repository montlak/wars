<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-79"><span class="space">a.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Lovshin</span></span>; Combined Action Under Chapters 75 and 43</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1984 <span class="Italic">Gende</span> decision proved short-lived, reexamined in <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 840 (Fed. Cir. 1985), a decision issued <span class="Italic">en banc</span> after initial review by a panel of three judges. Circuit Judge Nies wrote the court's opinion, essentially adopting the result the Board earlier reached in <span class="Italic">Wells</span>, permitting agencies to use either Chapter 43 or Chapter 75 at any time for performance-related actions. Mr. Lovshin was discharged under Chapter 75. By the time his case reached the court, <span class="Italic">Gende</span> was decided although not applied to the appeal by the Board. The Board asked that the case be remanded for consideration under <span class="Italic">Gende</span>, but the court took up the issue on its own initiative. The court abandoned its usual deference to the Board because the Board's position was not consistent. The court concluded that Chapter 75 was used for performance-related removals long before the Reform Act, that there was no conflict between Chapters 43 and 75, and that there was no congressional intent to repeal the use of Chapter 75. In an opinion examining the history of the Reform Act and the evolution of <span class="Italic">Wells</span> and <span class="Italic">Gende</span>, <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gende</span>, the laudable objective of the MSPB was to interpret the statute in a manner which would give effect to merit principles, an objective clearly intended by Congress. In order to tie merit principles to performance-based actions, the MSPB believed it was necessary to eliminate use of Chapter 75 totally in connection with performance-based actions against employees. Thus, the MSPB read into Chapter 75 a limitation which Congress expressed nowhere in the statute itself or in the legislative history. It is a limitation of sweeping proportions, given the judicial interpretations of the prior statute holding that Chapter 75 applied to performance-based actions and was not affected by the procedures of Chapter 43. If Congress intended such a major change, one would expect a clear statutory provision or at least a single specific statement by Congress to the effect that Chapter 75, henceforth, could not be used for performance-based adverse actions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Regardless of the worthiness of its devised procedures, the MSPB is without authority to change the statutory design....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court's reluctance to accept Chapter 43 as an exclusive procedure for performance problems was expressed in its recognition of the limitations of Chapter 43, 767 F.2d at 842:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The methods and criteria of performance evaluation are a developing science or art. A reading of Chapter 430 of the Federal Personnel Manual, which provides guidance to agencies, discloses that performance evaluation by pre-set standards is in its infancy of development. Some agencies no doubt are better at it than others--particularly in this early stage of implementation. Some systems are better than others. Some positions are extremely difficult to fit into a standards pattern at all, e.g., a research scientist. Exceptions may have to be permitted to coverage of such positions. Some agencies may detail many critical elements in each position. Others few. Evaluation may be by one manager or several managers, with or without input by peer groups.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The performance appraisal systems being utilized by agencies have not approached the level of perfection, either in defining performance standards or in the critical elements of individual positions or in evaluation techniques. Mistakes are made in setting criteria. Aspects of performance which are important to the job may not appear in the written statement of standards; others may be denominated "critical" which should not be. When such mistakes are made by the agency, the "easy" route of Chapter 43 must be denied. An employee sought to be removed under Chapter 43 is entitled to be rated on reasonable standards and to have specific procedures of Chapter 43 applied in connection with these standards. This protection is the <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> for the lesser burdens on the agency under that chapter. However, nothing in the statute or legislative history indicates that an employee should thereby be entitled to his position despite serious performance deficiencies where an agency can meet the heavy burdens of Chapter 75 and can show substantive compliance with merit principles.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although Chapter 75 was an alternative to Chapter 43 removals, <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> expressed some limitations to prevent agencies from imposing, through misconduct actions, standards of performance higher those imposed on an employee subjected to a comparable Chapter 43 action, 767 F.2d at 842:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...They function well as alternative procedures. The significant change affecting Chapter 75 cases is not found in Chapter 43, but rather in Chapters 23 and 77, under which violations of merit principles are made a <span class="Italic">defense</span>. It would, for example, be inconsistent with the merit principles set out in 2301(b)(6) and (7) for an agency to bring an action "for cause" under Chapter 75 based solely on performance that is governed by and meets the critical elements set forth for the employee's position. An agency may not circumvent Chapter 43 by charging that an employee should have performed better than the standards communicated to him in accordance with Chapter 43.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court went beyond suggesting the propriety of Chapter 75 as an alternative to Chapter 43; it determined (without discussion of the different burdens of proof) that the two could be used together, 767 F.2d at 843:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also see nothing in the statute to prevent the agency from bringing a mixed case, for example, relying on Chapter 43 for "unacceptable performance" in a critical element with an alternative, or additional charge, under Chapter 75 for "such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." In such cases, the appropriate standard of review by MSPB should be applied according to the basis for each specific charge. Adjudicative bodies routinely deal with more than one standard in cases brought before them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> provoked a dissent by Judge Skelton, joined by four other members of the Circuit bench. The dissent argued that the clear intent of Congress was to require performance appraisal systems and to require the use of these systems in performance-based cases. The problem was one of statutory construction. The majority could find no intent to repeal use of Chapter 75 for performance cases; the statute was not drafted precisely enough to support the exclusivity of Chapter 43 advanced by the dissent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of a combined Chapter 43 and Chapter 75 action, <span class="Italic">Harris v. SEC</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200825162">972 F.3d 1307</a>, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2020), suggested:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal agencies that wish to remove an employee for poor performance <span id="Page_2951"></span>have two procedural routes available to them: one under chapter 43, and another under chapter 75.[3] <span class="Italic">See Sayers v. Dep't of Veterans Affs</span>., 954 F.3d 1370, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (explaining differences between chapter 43 and chapter 75 adverse actions); <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span>, 769 F.2d at 1566 (same). Removal or demotion by an agency under chapter 43 is "subject to a more limited review" by the Board than actions under chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Eibel v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 857 F.2d 1439, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(A) (agency decision based on chapter 43 sustained if supported by substantial evidence), <span class="Italic">with id</span>. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B) (agency decision in any other case sustained if supported by a preponderance of the evidence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;These options are not mutually exclusive. <span class="Italic">See Lovshin v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 843 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (noting that an agency might charge an employee under "Chapter 43 for 'unacceptable performance' in a critical element with an alternative, or additional charge, under Chapter 75 for 'such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service'" (first quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(a); and then quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a))). Although chapter 75 is typically invoked for misconduct-based actions, it also authorizes performance-based actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether an agency may proceed against an employee under both Chapters 43 and 75 was considered but not answered, in <span class="italic">Combs v. DHS</span>, DC-0432-18-0552-I-2, n.7 (NP 2/16/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is questionable whether the administrative judge should have adjudicated the performance-based charge under both chapter 43 and chapter 75 standards. It is well established that an agency may take a performance-based action under <span class="italic">either</span> chapter 43 or chapter 75, <span class="italic">Lovshin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 843 (Fed. Cir. 1985), and may convert the action from chapter 43 to chapter 75 if a hearing has not yet occurred, <span class="italic">Ortiz v. U.S. Marine Corps</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 359, 363 (1988). It is also permissible for an agency to bring a hybrid action, charging an employee with unacceptable performance under chapter 43 procedures while bringing an additional or alternative charge, such as conduct unbecoming, under chapter 75 procedures. <span class="italic">Lovshin</span>, 767 F.2d at 843. However, we are unaware of any case in which the Board has considered allegations of unacceptable performance under <span class="italic">both</span> standards. Moreover, the Board has suggested in <span class="italic">dicta</span> that chapter 43 and chapter 75 procedures are, by statute, mutually exclusive with respect to the same charge. <span class="italic">See Aguzie v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 276, &#x00B6; 4 n.2 (2009) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(D)), <span class="italic">reconsidered on other grounds</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64 (2011)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reviewed the impact of <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> in <span class="Italic">Fairall v. VA</span>, 33 MSPR 33, 40-47 (1987). Accepting the result in <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> that agencies have the choice of Chapters 75 or 43 for performance actions, <span class="Italic">Fairall</span> determined that if a misconduct case becomes the vehicle to discipline an employee for substandard performance, the lack of a performance improvement period may be considered in mitigation of the penalty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]t is clear that agencies have the option of utilizing either Chapter 43 procedures or Chapter 75 procedures to effect performance-based removals....&#8197;The only limitation that the court identified on an agency's use of Chapter 75 for performance-based actions was a prohibition on an agency's use of Chapter 75 to circumvent Chapter 43 by charging that an employee should have performed better than the standards communicated to him in accordance with Chapter 43 required him to perform....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question that remains, however, is whether employees subjected to performance-based Chapter 75 actions have a right to an improvement period in such actions independent of any analogy to Chapter 43 requirements. Unlike Chapter 43, Chapter 75 contains no express provision that requires an agency to afford an employee an opportunity to improve his performance before the agency effects a performance-based action....&#8197;The appellant has not identified, nor have we been able to locate, any law, rule, regulation, or case precedent that grants employees a right to an improvement period in Chapter 75 actions. Therefore, we decline to provide a right not enacted by Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he merit system principle at 5 USC 2301(b)(6)...provides that "[e]mployees should be retained on the basis of the adequacy of their performance, inadequate performance should be corrected, and employees should be separated who cannot or will not improve their performance to meet required standards."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span>...the court did state, without any qualifications, that "[u]nder sec. 2302(b)(11)" it was a prohibited personnel practice "to violate the merit principles set out in sec. 2301(a)."...&#8197;The court then specifically identified the two merit principles set out in secs. 2301(b)(6) and 2302(b)(7) and found that: (1) These principles were broadly stated in terms of "inadequate performance" rather than the more narrowly defined language of "unacceptable performance" in Chapter 43; (2) an agency that elected to proceed under Chapter 75 would be tied to the same merit principles that were stated with more specificity in Chapter 43....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the court's analysis in <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> concerning Chapter 23 can be interpreted as a finding that violations of the merit principles constitute prohibited personnel practices <span class="Italic">per se</span>, this finding does not compel the conclusion that the merit principles establish a right to an improvement period in performance-based Chapter 75 actions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Given the court's express finding that Chapter 43 does not provide the exclusive procedure for performance-based actions, it would be incongruous if not <span class="Italic">ultra vires</span> for the Board to "read into the Chapter 75 procedure the distinguishing features of Chapter 43 'unacceptable performance' removal procedures."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[O]ne relevant factor in determining the appropriateness of a penalty is "the clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense or had been warned about the conduct in question...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]nagency's failure to afford an improvement period does not require mitigation of the removal penalty in every case. The lack of an improvement period is not a mitigating factor <span class="Italic">per se</span> but is relevant to a mitigating factor identified in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> that addresses the extent to which the employee was on notice that his deficient performance or misconduct might be the basis for an adverse action. Where the employee's position description, performance standards, or other relevant documentation give sufficient notice of the kind of performance that is considered deficient, the fact that an improvement period was not afforded is not, standing alone, sufficient basis for mitigating the penalty....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent any statutory provision, interpretive rule, or regulation that mandates that an employee be given an opportunity to improve in Chapter 75 actions, the extent and timing of the improvement period to be afforded in Chapter 43 actions cannot be engrafted onto Chapter 75 actions. Thus, if an agency elects to afford the appellant an improvement period in a Chapter 75 performance-based action, the fact that the improvement period occurred during the notice period of the action or that the appellant was warned of minimally acceptable performance, as opposed to unsatisfactory performance, does not, standing alone, render the agency's notice of performance deficiencies insufficient. In addition...when certain special circumstances are present, it is not appropriate for the Board to mitigate the penalty solely on the basis of the lack of an improvement period. Thus, if an appellant challenges the action by asserting that the agency failed to provide notice of performance deficiencies or an improvement period, the agency may rebut this challenge to the penalty by showing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that: (1) The appellant's performance deficiencies were willful or intentional...or (2) affording an improvement period would have resulted in unreasonable costs, or placed the health and safety of others at risk.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that this standard is not the same standard that the Board articulated in <span class="Italic">Gende</span>, 23 MSPR at 615-16, where the Board held that it would excuse the agency's failure to afford an improvement period if the agency could establish, by preponderant evidence, that there was "a substantial likelihood that providing the employee with an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance before proposing the action will result in injury, death, breach of security, or great monetary loss." The <span class="Italic">Gende</span> standard was based on factors that the Board addressed in reference to absolute performance standards in Chapter 43 actions....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fairall</span> involved a medical technologist charged with making two errors in recording lab results of blood tests. The Board concluded that a performance improvement period could have risked the health of patients because of the serious nature of the appellant's errors. <span class="Italic">Fairall</span> was affirmed on review. <span class="Italic">Fairall v. VA</span>, 844 F.2d 775, 776 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">per curiam)</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where the record, as here, clearly indicates levels of negligence, whether gross or otherwise, it is not a case of performance deficiency <span class="Italic">simpliciter</span> but rather is one also of misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. The dicta of <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> do not saddle the agency with the fulfillment of all procedures appropriate to a Chapter 43 removal, but only those such as refraining from "Prohibited Personnel Practices" which ought to bind agencies regardless of the form selected if merit principles are to survive. The record in this case...unequivocally supports the determinations that petitioner's actions were proven negligent, and that the penalty received was appropriate. It is not appropriate to require notice of deficiencies, counseling, or an opportunity to improve, when a penchant for negligence is shown which would destroy the confidence of doctors and staff in the reliability of laboratory reports.</p>
