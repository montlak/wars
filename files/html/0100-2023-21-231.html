<p class="Body-Text">For the fully recovered employee, restoration, if all conditions are met, is to be upon cessation of compensation. For partially recovered employees, restoration depends upon priority consideration and assumes a continuation of OWCP benefits, <span class="Italic">Drews v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 344, 346-47 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Office of Personnel Management regulations, "fully recovered" means that compensation payments have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to perform all of the duties of the position he left or an equivalent one.[4] Before the field office, the parties stipulated that compensation ceased on June 10, 1980. The record also contained evidence presented by the agency, i.e., copies of forms entitled Official Superior's Notice of Compensation Payment, which documents the period of payment. There is no evidence, however, of the basis upon which the original period of compensation was terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice of an award of compensation which the agency submitted with its petition reflects that it is an award for permanent partial loss of use of the right leg. The Board finds that this is unrebutted evidence that the original period of compensation did not cease on the basis of a finding that the appellant had fully recovered. An agency obligation to restore an employee immediately does not arise unless the employee has fully recovered.[5] In the case of a partially recovered employee, an agency must make every effort to restore him to duty.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.302(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.306.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board finds that the agency's efforts to restore the appellant, culminating in his actual restoration approximately one month after his request, were appropriate in the case of a partially recovered employee. Because the record does not indicate that appellant's benefits were terminated on the basis that he was fully recovered and because the record contains unrebutted evidence that appellant continued to receive benefits as a partially disabled employee, the Board finds that the agency properly treated the appellant as a partially recovered employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"A claim that the employee did not fully recover within 1 year of the beginning of compensation, or the injury's recurrence, is a defense to be raised by the agency as part of its burden to show that it complied with the applicable regulations. Similarly, a claim that the employee did not request restoration within 30 days of the cessation of compensation is also an agency defense." <span class="Italic">Denny v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 123, 128 (1990). A conflict between OPM and OWCP regulations bearing upon the date of full recovery, tied by OPM to the cessation of compensation, was addressed in <span class="Italic">Nixon v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 104 MSPR 189, 191-96 &#x00B6; 2-13, 2006 MSPB 346 (2006), with a preference stated by the Board for the application of the OPM regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a February 23, 2005 appeal alleging that the agency did not afford him priority consideration and erroneously hired him back after a compensable injury to a GS-7 Tax Examining Assistant position, rather than the GS-12 Revenue Officer position he had previously held. The appellant requested that the Board restore him to the GS-12 level retroactive to December 18, 2000, which he alleged was his return-to-work date as a GS-7, Step 10, or June 17, 2001, when he was promoted to a Revenue Officer position at the GS-9, Step 10 level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge (AJ) ordered the appellant to file evidence and argument showing that his appeal was timely filed or that good cause existed for the delay. The AJ also ordered the appellant to clarify the agency actions he was challenging, explain how they fell under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304 (restoration after recovery from compensable injury), and submit evidence and argument concerning the timeliness and jurisdictional issues. Due to the appellant's apparent confusion, the AJ sent the appellant a copy of the applicable restoration regulations. The appellant responded to the AJ's orders, and the agency moved to dismiss the appeal as untimely filed and for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the written record, the AJ dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction without reaching the timeliness question. The AJ found that the appellant's subjective opinion that he had fully recovered from his compensable injury, though supported by some medical evidence, was not entitled to deference because the determination of whether an individual is fully recovered from a compensable injury is made by OWCP. The AJ found that when the appellant first sought restoration as an allegedly fully recovered employee in 2000 or 2001, he was still receiving OWCP benefits, and therefore OWCP considered him to be a partially recovered employee. Because the agency restored the appellant, as a partially recovered employee, to a position in December 2000, the AJ concluded that the appellant did not nonfrivolously allege that he was arbitrarily and capriciously denied restoration, and that the Board therefore lacked jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the AJ should have found that he was a fully recovered employee because his compensation payments were terminated, he continued to receive from OWCP only periodic medical payments for doctor visits, and he was performing GS-9 Revenue Officer duties. The appellant also contends that OWCP does not issue letters indicating that an employee has fully or partially recovered; rather, the appellant claims that OWCP only determines whether an employee has been restored to earning capacity. Therefore, the question in this case is whether the AJ correctly found that the appellant was a partially recovered employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b), an employee who separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began is entitled to priority <span id="Page_4508"></span>consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. "Fully recovered" means "compensation payments have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to perform all the duties of the position he or she left or an equivalent one." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OWCP's regulations, however, provide that once OWCP has advised the employee that it has accepted a claim and has either approved continuation of pay or paid medical benefits or compensation, benefits will not be terminated or reduced unless the weight of the evidence establishes that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;The disability for which compensation was paid has ceased;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;The disabling condition is no longer causally related to the employment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;The employee is only partially disabled;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003;The employee has returned to work;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(e)&#x2003;The beneficiary was convicted of fraud in connection with a claim under the Federal Employees Compensation Act, or the beneficiary was incarcerated based on any felony conviction; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(f)&#x2003;OWCP's initial decision was in error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.503.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notably, the bases to terminate OWCP benefits do not include the language set forth in OPM's regulation at section 353.102. Thus, there is a lack of equivalence between OWCP's regulation, which sets forth when it will terminate benefits, and OPM's regulations defining "fully recovered." Nonetheless, in order to be eligible for priority consideration, an employee must meet OPM's regulation. Thus, the question is how to determine whether an employee meets the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102 when OWCP terminates periodic benefits without reference to the language of section 353.102.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found in some cases that an employee is deemed fully recovered under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102 when OWCP terminates benefits on the basis that an individual has regained his earning capacity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Brumley v. Department of Transportation,</span> 40 M.S.P.R. 1, 3 (1989). It is the cessation of periodic support payments the injured employee received while temporarily totally or partially disabled, not the termination of payment of scheduled compensation or medical benefits, that triggers a finding that the appellant is fully recovered and entitled to restoration rights. <span class="Italic">See Carter v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 27 M.S.P.R. 252, 255 (1985). In no case, however, has the Board examined whether OWCP ever terminates benefits on the basis stated in section 353.102. Because OWCP's regulations do not provide that it will terminate benefits on a basis that is identical to the basis included in OPM's definition of fully recovered, the Board will not look for the exact wording of section 353.102 in OWCP's termination of benefits notice, but will extrapolate from the language actually used by OWCP to terminate benefits to determine whether an appellant meets the "fully recovered" definition of section 353.102.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the basis upon which OWCP terminated the appellant's benefits is included in a November 16, 2001 preliminary determination informing the appellant that he had been overpaid compensation. In that notice, OWCP terminated compensation benefits, which were based on a June 15, 1984 injury, because the appellant, effective June 17, 2001, began working again as a Revenue Officer, the job he held at the time of injury, and his actual earnings in the GS-9, Step 10 Revenue Officer position were higher than what he would have earned had he remained a GS-11, Step 2 Revenue Officer. OWCP's February 15, 2002 formal decision regarding the overpayment states that the appellant was selected for the position of Revenue Officer, which was "the same job you held at the time of injury, but at the GS-9/Step-10 level." The formal decision also determined that there were no limitations noted in the position description for the GS-9 Revenue Officer position, and that the appellant has "self-rehabilitated and [is] now working in a position which entails greater responsibilities and requires greater skills, obtained through training and experience." We find that the language used by OWCP in terminating the appellant's benefits shows that it terminated those benefits because the appellant was able to perform all of the duties of the position he left. Thus, OWCP terminated compensation payments under circumstances such that the appellant meets section 353.102's definition of "fully recovered."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, an employee who fully recovers more than 1 year after compensation begins is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or "an equivalent one" provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. An agency affords priority consideration to the recovered employee by entering his or her name on the agency's reemployment priority list for the competitive service or the excepted service, as applicable. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). For purposes of section 353.301(b), an equivalent position is one of like seniority, status, and pay. <span class="Italic">Smith v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 92, &#x00B6; 6 (1999). Status refers to the particular attributes of a specific position, including the rank or responsibility of the position, its duties, working conditions, pay, tenure, and seniority. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. For purposes of restoration rights, a position with the same seniority, status, and pay means a position that is equivalent to the former one in terms of pay, grade, type of appointment, tenure, work schedule, and seniority, if applicable; standing within the organization, such as first or second supervisory level, is not a factor. <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Department of the Interior,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6; 7 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant was working in the GS-9 Revenue Officer position when OWCP terminated his periodic support payments, and nothing contradicts his assertion that he sought reappointment to the position he encumbered at the time of his compensable injury before and after he became a GS-9 Revenue Officer. Because the GS-9 position the appellant now encumbers is a lower graded position than the position he encumbered at the time of his injury, his current position is not "equivalent" to his former position under section 353.301(b). Thus, we find that the appellant fully recovered more than 1 year after he suffered a compensable injury that was the cause of his separation, that, despite his request, the agency has not restored him to a position that is equivalent to the one he encumbered at the time of his injury, and that the agency has violated the appellant's reemployment priority rights by failing to place him on the agency's reemployment priority list from the date that his periodic support payments from OWCP ceased. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant established Board jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Welby v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 16 (2006), the Board held that, if an appellant establishes Board jurisdiction over his reemployment priority claim under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209, the agency has the burden, on the merits, of proving by preponderant evidence that it did not violate the appellant's reemployment priority rights, including proof that it did not appoint another person who could not have been appointed properly. We therefore remand this appeal for the parties to present evidence and argument on the issue of whether the agency denied the appellant an appointment to a position for which the appellant was qualified and to which another person was not appointed properly if the agency had timely provided the appellant with his reemployment priority rights after the cessation of his OWCP benefits. <span class="Italic">Welby,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 20. If there was no denial of the appellant's appointment to a position to which he should have been appointed but for a violation of his reemployment priority rights, the agency must extend the appellant's reemployment priority list eligibility for the period of time that the agency did not properly enroll the appellant on the reemployment priority list. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
