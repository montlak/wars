<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-84"><span class="space">1.</span> Jurisdictional Analysis; Burden of Proof</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Abbott v. USPS</span>,121 MSPR 294, 2014 MSPB 47 (2014) (discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-13-083.html#sec6-83">Enforced Leave; Constructive Suspension</a>"), should be reviewed for the Board's clearest, recent definition of enforced leave. The decisions that follow tend to jurisdictionally intertwine enforced leave initiated by the agency and a constructive suspension resulting from the employer's action in barring the return to work of an employee who voluntarily went into leave status, e.g., because of a health problem. Whatever the jurisdictional facts, if the appeal appears to raise an issue concerning enforced leave or a constructive suspension, the AJ must inform the appellant of what must be shown or alleged to establish jurisdiction if that type of notice is not provided by an agency's motion to dismiss. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clavin v. USPS</span>, 99 MSPR 619, 625 &#x00B6; 9 (2005). The dispositive issue is generally whether the employee or the agency initiated the disputed leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tedesco v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 90 MSPR 367, 371 &#x00B6; 8 (2001). <span class="italic">Under Bruce v. DHHS</span>, DC-0752-21-0022-I-2 (NP 4/14/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "suspension" is the temporary placement of an employee in a nonpay, nonduty status. <span class="italic">Engler v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6; 6 (2014). It is well settled that a constructive suspension may encompass not only unpaid absences but periods of paid leave that an employee was forced to take due to an improper agency action. <span class="italic">E.g., Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 14 (2013); <span class="italic">Kaminsky v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. 397, 398-99 (1982)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To establish Board jurisdiction over a constructive suspension appeal, an appellant must show that (1) he lacked any meaningful choice but to absent himself from work, and (2) it was the agency's wrongful actions that deprived him of that choice. <span class="italic">Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 13. The appellant must also meet the other requirements of chapter 75 jurisdiction which, as relevant here, are that he was an "employee" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), and his suspension was for more than 14 days. <span class="italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 8; see 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kee v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 109 MSPR 353, 355-56 &#x00B6; 6, 2008 MSPB 168 (2008), provided the jurisdictional analysis concerning enforced leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "suspension" is the temporary placement of an employee in a non-pay, non-duty status. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2). This definition covers not just unpaid absences, but also an agency's placement of an employee on sick or annual leave against his will. <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Dixon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 171, 175 (1995). For jurisdictional purposes, whether the employee was able to perform his regular duties is immaterial. Rather, the only question is whether the employee's placement in a leave status was voluntary or involuntary; only the latter is appealable. <span class="Italic">Alston v. Social Security Administration</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 252, &#x00B6; 11 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 134 Fed. Appx. 440 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Baker v.

We agree with the administrative judge's conclusion in this case that the appellant's placement on leave was involuntary. Further, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant has the right to appeal to the Board his involuntary placement on leave because it exceeded 14 days. <span class="Italic">[S]ee Bennett</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 634, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 8.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The dispositive inquiry in determining whether there has been a suspension within the Board's jurisdiction is whether the employee's absence from the agency was voluntary or involuntary. <span class="Italic">Holloway v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 993 F.2d 219, 221 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Where an employee has voluntarily absented himself from work, placement in a non-pay or AWOL status, even for longer than 14 days, is not a constructive suspension appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Perez v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991). When an employee requests work within his medical restrictions, and the agency is bound by policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available work to the employee, but fails to do so, his continued absence constitutes a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 680, 692 (1996). Here, the appellant contends that he first requested to return to work, with sedentary duties only, on February 10, 2009. The administrative judge found, however, that the appellant's testimony was not credible on this point, and that he did not request light duty until April 6, 2009. We discern no error in that finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, from April 13, 2009, until May 7, 2009, the appellant <span id="Page_2057"></span>worked light duty for part of each scheduled working day, and was placed on leave without pay for the remaining hours. The Board has yet to combine non-consecutive suspensions of 14 days or less for purposes of finding Board jurisdiction. Our case law suggests the possibility that non-consecutive suspensions of 14 days or less may be combined when (1) the suspensions are based on the same reason and (2) there is evidence that the agency attempted to circumvent Board jurisdiction by imposing multiple suspensions of 14 days or less. <span class="Italic">See Palmer v. Department of Transportation</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 438, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2008). Here, the appellant's absences during this period were based on the same reason, i.e., lack of light duty work within his medical restrictions. However, there is no evidence that the agency imposed multiple partial-day suspensions in order to circumvent Board jurisdiction. Indeed, it does not appear that the agency regarded the absences as suspensions of any length. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.<span class="Italic"></span> The appellant suggests that the agency's previous imposition of a 14-day suspension in November 2008 reflects an intent to deny him Board appeal rights, but that decision has no apparent bearing on the availability of light duty in April and May 2009. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge properly dismissed the appellant's constructive suspension appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If nonduty status is voluntary, the placement in leave status is not an adverse action.

If a supervisor tells an employee who is being investigated for misconduct that he should not report for work pending review of his actions, with no written notice and no explanation of his ensuing pay status (ameliorated by the employee by taking sick leave or annual leave to maintain his income), a constructive suspension is sufficiently established that a hearing is required. <span class="italic">See Epperly v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-17-0606-I-1 (NP 2/13/2023). At times, it can be difficult to determine exactly what constitutes a voluntary absence from work, and the circumstances must be examined.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Enforced leave disputes may develop from unusual situations. One appeal involved a forced evacuation of employees from a Naval Base in Cuba. <span class="Italic">Lowmack v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 80 MSPR 491, 496-97 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15 (1999), was remanded for a hearing on a theory of either enforced leave or furlough of the employee whose employment was suspended as a result of the evacuation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...If an agency bars an employee from duty for more than 14 days, the employee's absence is considered a constructive suspension appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Dize v. Department of the Army,</span> 73 MSPR 635, 638 (1997). In addition, "certain personnel actions, though not termed 'suspensions,' may remove an employee's duties and cause a loss of pay, thus producing the same effects as actual suspensions" of more than 14 days, and are therefore within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Perez v. Merit</span> <span class="Italic">Systems Protection Board,</span> 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant's placement on LWOP could not be considered "disciplinary" either in the ordinary sense of the word or in the broader sense of maintaining the orderly working of the government against possible disruption by the suspended employee. However, as the administrative judge also recognized, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has considered "disciplinary" to include a suspension imposed because the agency was concerned that the employee's retention on active duty could result in damage to federal property, be detrimental to government interests, or result in injury to the employee, her fellow workers, or the public. <span class="Italic">See Mercer,</span> 772 F.2d at 858; <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 756 F.2d at 89. Furthermore, the court has reiterated that "disciplinary" should be construed in the broad sense and not limited to specific factual situations. <span class="Italic">See Engdahl v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency admitted that it placed the appellant on LWOP for more than 14 days because it evacuated all military and civilian family members due to "a surge of migrant Cuban civilians (48,000) and 5,000 Joint Task Force personnel," the "subsequent tax on base support capabilities" and "concerns for the safety, security and quality of life for family members." Moreover, the appellant averred that she was placed in the status without her consent. Thus, we find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that she was involuntarily placed in a nonduty, nonpay status for "disciplinary" reasons, within the broader sense of that word. Therefore, we find that she is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dize,</span> 73 MSPR at 638-40.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, even if the appellant's placement on LWOP could not be considered "disciplinary" in any sense of the word, and thus is not a constructive suspension, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that she suffered a furlough of more than 30 days. Each agency must follow the provisions of 5 CFR part 351, e.g., "when it releases a competing employee from his or her competitive level by furlough for more than 30 days,...when the release is required because of lack of work...." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Horner v.

A "furlough" under part 351 is "the placement of an employee in a temporary nonduty and nonpay status for more than 30 consecutive calendar days, or more than 22 workdays if done on a discontinuous basis, but not more than 1 year." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.203.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that she was placed in a nonduty and nonpay status for more than 30 consecutive calendar days, in effect, because of lack of work due to her evacuation from Guantanamo Bay.

Therefore, we find that she is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board provides some guidance on enforced leave cases in its Information Sheet 11, available on its website, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/infosheets/Enforced_Leave.htm">https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/infosheets/Enforced_Leave.htm</a>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Information Sheet No. 11</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Enforced Leave</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Purpose</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of this information sheet is to provide general guidance and background information. It does not represent an official statement approved by the Board itself, and is not intended to provide legal counsel or to be cited as legal authority. Instead, it is intended only to help the public become familiar with the MSPB and its procedures. In all instances, however, the MSPB's regulations and current case law control with respect to the matters discussed here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What is enforced leave?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Enforced leave occurs when, against an employee's will, an agency places him or her in a non-duty and non-pay status. The determinative factor is who initiated the absence? If an employee voluntarily chooses not to come to work, that person is not considered to be in an enforced leave status. If, however, it is the agency that prevents the employee from coming to work, the employee is in an enforced leave status. Thus, enforced leave is a type of constructive suspension. For purposes of this discussion, it does not include situations in which an employee is receiving benefits for a work-related injury from the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">If an agency places me in an enforced leave status, may I appeal to the Board?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an agency places an employee in an enforced leave status for more than 14 days, the employee may appeal the agency's action to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Under what circumstances might an agency place me in an enforced leave status?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The placement of an employee in an enforced leave status usually occurs in one of two ways:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022; When an agency places an employee in a non-duty non-pay status pending an inquiry into his/her medical ability to perform, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022; When an employee who is absent form work for medical reasons asks to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies the request</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What if the agency places me on sick or annual leave instead of allowing me to come to work?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an agency forces an employee to use sick leave, annual leave, or leave without pay for a period exceeding 14 days, that employee may have been subjected to a constructive suspension appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2058"></span><span class="Italic">What if I am voluntarily absent from work because of illness or an injury, then I recover, but my agency will not let me return to work?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an agency refuses to let an employee, who has not been removed, come back to work after recovering from a medical condition, and the employee's absence after requesting to return to duty exceeds 14 days, then the employee may have been subjected to a constructive suspension appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What if I voluntarily absent myself from work due to a medical condition, then I request to come back to work with altered duties so that I can work?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the Board has jurisdiction over such a situation depends upon the agency's own rules and regulations or its contractual or legal obligations. If the agency is obligated by its own policy, regulation, or contract to offer light duty work to an employee and fails to do so, the employee's continued absence may constitute a constructive suspension triggering an appeal right to the Board. Additionally, an agency may have a duty under the Rehabilitation Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act to modify an employee's non-essential job duties so that the employee can return to work. If an agency fails to return an employee to work under these circumstances, an employee's continued absence could constitute a constructive suspension appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What if I have a medical condition which makes my job too difficult to perform, but because the agency refuses to modify my duties, I can't come to work anymore?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In certain situations, including cases where an agency has a legal obligation to accommodate an employee, where an employee has put an agency on notice of objectionable working conditions and requested assistance or remediation from the agency, and the agency fails to offer assistance, that employee may be able to establish that absence from the work place was involuntary, and therefore, equivalent to a constructive suspension, over which the Board has jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What if my agency places me on administrative leave while it conducts an investigation of me, and refuses to let me come to work? Is that enforced leave that can be appealed to the Board?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has consistently held that the placement of an employee in an administrative leave status, without loss of basic pay, even for a period longer than 14 days, is not a suspension within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What if my work situation is so unpleasant because of harassment or illegal discrimination that I can't come to work? Is that enforced leave that I can appeal to the Board?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Proof of intolerable working conditions compelling an employee to be absent may support a finding of a constructive suspension, over which the Board has jurisdiction. It is the employee's burden, however, to establish that working conditions are intolerable. Intolerable working conditions cannot be established by providing evidence of usual, run-of-the-mill work annoyances or slights. An employee must convince an administrative judge and/or the Board that working conditions were so severe or unpleasant that any reasonable person subjected to the same conditions would not have come to work. It is a fairly high standard to meet.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What if the agency places me in a non-pay, non-duty status, but did not mention any appeal rights I might have? Does this mean that I don't have appeal rights to the Board?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not necessarily. If you have been involuntarily placed in a non-pay non-duty status for more than days, you may very well have appeal rights to the Board, even though your agency neglected to inform you of such. If you are unsure, you may file an appeal with the Board for a definitive answer. The Board has held that in cases involving constructive suspensions, the time in which an appellant may file a timely appeal begins to run once the absence reaches 15 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What if I have other procedural questions?</span></p>
