<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-88"><span class="space">5.</span> Agreement to Serve Probationary Period; Waiver of Preexisting Appeal Right</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming the agreement is voluntary, informed, specific, supported by contractual consideration, and entered before the entry on duty in the position, there is no absolute impediment to acceptance of a position conditioned on service of a period of probation that would otherwise not be required. Essential is clear notice to, and acceptance by, the appellant of an agreement to serve a period of probation not otherwise required by law or regulation: if an agreement calling for a new period of probation is to be effective, that agreement will need to specifically reference the statutory and regulatory appeal rights that are being waived. <span class="Italic">Stoute v. Dept. of Navy,</span> 98 MSPR 409, 414-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13 (2005), emphasized the need for knowing and voluntary waiver of appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency next relies on the Board's recent decision in <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Department of Justice</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 623 (2003), for the proposition that an individual who meets the definition of an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) may waive his chapter 75 appeal rights. Mr. Ramos, like the appellant, had more than 1 year of current continuous service with the same agency. <span class="Italic">Ramos</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. at 627 &#x00B6; 8. He began his service in March 1998 as a Border Patrol Agent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 626 &#x00B6; 4. On March 11, 2001, Mr. Ramos was appointed from a register to the competitive service position of Deportation Officer. The SF-50 memorializing his appointment stated that it was subject to the completion of a 1-year initial probationary period. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Mr. Ramos was terminated effective June 29, 2001. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 625 &#x00B6; 2. Thus, Mr. Ramos was an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the Board concluded that Mr. Ramos waived his appeal rights based on a Probationary Period Agreement. The agreement stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I, James Ramos, understand that upon entrance on duty to the position of Deportation Officer, GS-5, I will be required to begin a new probationary period in accordance with Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization policy and Office of Personnel Management regulations as put forth in the code of Federal Regulations part 315--Career and Career-Conditional Employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">My rights and entitlements for adverse and disciplinary actions will be processed in accordance with the provisions of the code of Federal Regulations part 315.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 629 &#x00B6; 11. The Board found that Mr. Ramos entered into the agreement voluntarily and that he understood its terms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency contends that the appellant received sufficient notice that his appointment was conditioned on a 1-year probationary period from a conversation with the agency's human resources specialist and a notation on the appointment SF-50. The agency's argument fails to distinguish <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>. Ms. McCormick also received an SF-50 stating that her appointment was subject to a 1-year probationary period, <span class="Italic">see McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1340, but that document did not alter her statutory status as an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). It is well established that "the SF-50 is not a legally operative document controlling on its face an employee's status and rights." <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Department of Commerce</span>, 729 F.2d 772, 776 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Moreover, even assuming, for sake of argument, that the appellant agreed to serve a probationary period, it does not follow that he agreed to forfeit his Board appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). In short, the record in the instant case does not reveal any evidence that the appellant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The matter of waiver of preexisting appeal rights and the effectiveness of an agreement to accept a new probationary period received extensive discussion in <span class="Italic">Chavies v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CHAVIES_VINCENT_N_DC_315H_06_0054_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_CONCURRING_OPINION_247264.pdf">104 MSPR 81</a>, 84-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-14, 2006 MSPB 336 (2006), squarely placing on the agency the burden of proving that the waiver was for valuable consideration and that it was the product of informed judgment, i.e., that the appellant was made aware of the rights surrendered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant had not waived his appeal rights by signing the SOU, the administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Social Security Administration</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 67, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). In <span class="Italic">Hughes</span>, the employee transferred from one agency to another without a break in service. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6. Less than 1 year later, the agency to which she had transferred separated her involuntarily. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00B6; 2. The administrative judge dismissed the employee's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the employee had waived her appeal rights by signing a notice informing her, in effect, that she would be required to serve a new probationary period despite her previous service with another agency. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 7. The Board reversed that decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 7. It noted that the employee had not signed the notice until more than 2 months after starting her new job; it found that she had received no consideration from the agency in exchange for her signature; and it therefore concluded that there could be no enforceable waiver of the employee's appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the present case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Hughes</span> in that the appellant in this case signed the SOU before starting work in the position from which he was involuntarily separated. It also argues that the appellant received consideration for signing the document, i.e., that, in exchange for waiving his appeal rights, he received a promotion and additional police officer training.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated above, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 provides that a competitive service employee with at least 1 year of current continuous service generally may appeal his involuntary separation to the Board. An employee covered by this provision also is entitled to advance written notice of a proposal to separate him, and to a reasonable time in which to respond orally and in writing to the proposal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(b)(1), (2). While these rights are provided by statute, they serve to ensure that employees are given the minimum due process to which a tenured public employee is entitled under the U.S. Constitution. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985) (an agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond); <span class="Italic">King v. Erickson</span>, 89 F.3d 1575, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (an agency's compliance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 provides the minimum due process to which the employee is entitled), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom. LaChance v. Erickson</span>, 522 U.S. 262 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under some circumstances, an employee may be found to have waived his rights under the provisions cited above. The circumstances that must be present in order to find an effective, enforceable waiver include, as the agency has suggested, the employee's receipt of consideration in exchange for the waiver. <span class="Italic">Hughes</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 67, &#x00B6; 7. Other circumstances, however, must also be present. If the employee did not know of the rights he was waiving, or if the waiver did not reflect an "intentional relinquishment or abandonment of" those rights, the waiver is not effective and cannot be enforced. <span class="Italic">See Brewer v. Williams</span>, 430 U.S. 387, 404 (1977) (waiver of an employee's right to counsel requires both comprehension and relinquishment);<span class="Italic"> Johnson v. Zerbst</span>, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938) ("A waiver is ordinarily an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege."); <span class="Italic">Roberson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 173, 176 (1987) (remanding appeal for, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, determination of whether the employee's alleged waiver of his appeal rights constituted "an informed relinquishment of a known right"); <span class="Italic">cf. Crawford v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 102, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6-7 (2005) (the appellant's statement that she did not wish to appeal the disallowance of her application for a survivor annuity did not preclude her from pursuing that matter, since she had not been aware when she made that statement that the relief she sought could be obtained only if she obtained a survivor annuity).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not indicate that the appellant in this case knew of the rights he allegedly was waiving at the time he signed the SOU. Certainly, nothing in the SOU itself could have informed him of those rights; the document includes no mention of them. Moreover, even if the appellant were aware through other sources of his rights under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, the SOU does not provide for their waiver. While it indicates that <span id="Page_129"></span>the person signing it understands that, "in accordance with 5 C.F.R. [&#x00A7;] 315.801, [he] must serve a new probationary period," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, the fact that an employee is serving a probationary period under that regulatory section does not establish that the employee is not entitled to the appeal rights and other protections of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1341-43 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">see Stoute v. Department of the Navy</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 409, &#x00B6; 13 (2005) (the employee's written acknowledgment that he would be required to serve a new probationary period was not inconsistent with his coverage under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 and did not serve as an effective waiver of his rights under chapter 75). In addition, while the SOU includes a statement that the person signing it "may be terminated if [he fails] to demonstrate fully [his] qualifications for continued employment," such a failure may serve as a basis for terminating an employee's employment under 5 U.S.C. chapters 43 and 75 as well. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303, 7512(1). Finally, the SOU indicates that the appellant "will have limited appeal rights in accordance with the provisions of 5 CFR 315" in the event of such a termination. It does not provide, however, that he was waiving any other right that might be available to him, such as his right to file a removal appeal under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, to file an individual right of action appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221, or to file a discrimination complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, and based on our review of the SOU as a whole, we find that that document does not constitute or include a waiver of the appellant's rights under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. It is instead simply a notice in which the agency advised the appellant of the rights it believed he would have in the event of his involuntary separation during the first year following his appointment, and in which the appellant acknowledged that he understood the information in the notice. <span class="Italic">Compare Bloch v. Powell</span>, 348 F.3d 1060, 1064, 1070-71 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (individual waived right to annuity by signing refund application advising him that he might be entitled to an annuity if he had 5 or more years of service, and that he would forfeit any such right by receiving the refund for which he was applying), <span class="Italic">with Payano v. Department of Justice</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 74, &#x00B6; 7 (2005) (a document that did not state that the employee waived appeal rights he otherwise possessed, and that did not specify the regulations that would be applicable to actions taken against the employee during his first year of service did not constitute a waiver of the right to appeal under chapter 75)[4] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The SOU is headed "STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING EMPLOYEES APPOINTED TO POSITIONS FROM AN OPM/DEU LIST OF ELIGIBLES," and it appears to be a standard document provided on a routine basis to employees meeting the description in this heading. Because we have found that the statements in the SOU are not sufficient to waive the appellant's chapter 75 rights, we need not determine whether such a standard notice, routinely presented to employees receiving job offers, could serve as an effective waiver of those rights if the language were modified to include an express waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have indicated above that the appellant, as a competitive service employee with a year of current continuous service at the time of his removal, is among those employees who have been given the statutory right to appeal their removals under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. Because he has not waived that right, we agree with the administrative judge that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal. We also concur in her finding that the agency's failure to provide the appellant with advance notice of the proposal to remove him, and with the opportunity to respond to that proposal, constitutes a denial of the appellant's constitutional right to due process. <span class="Italic">See Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546; <span class="Italic">Schibik v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 591, &#x00B6; 10 (2005). Finally, we concur in her conclusion that the appellant's removal therefore cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Schibik</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 591, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A waiver of appeal rights entered well after the date of appointment and unsupported by consideration was ineffective to avoid an appeal by an employee whose tenure was based, in part, on prior service with a predecessor agency, <span class="Italic">Hughes v. SSA</span>, 99 MSPR 67, 68-70 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6-7 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to working for the Social Security Administration (SSA), the appellant worked for the Department of the Navy as a File Clerk, GS-04. The appellant applied for a GS-04 Mail and File Clerk position at the SSA after that agency posted a vacancy announcement for the position. The agency selected the appellant from a certificate of eligibles. The appellant left her position with the Department of the Navy on May 4, 2002, and started her new position with the SSA on May 5, 2002. On July 31, 2002, the appellant signed a "New Appointment Probationary Period Advisory Notice" (probationary period agreement) informing her that she would be required to serve a one-year probationary period even if she was coming from another government position where she already completed a probationary period; the notice further stated that, during the required probationary period, she would relinquish her adverse action appeal rights. On February 24, 2003, the agency issued a memorandum indicating its intention to remove the appellant for physical inability to perform the duties of her position, effective March 10, 2003. The agency gave the appellant the opportunity to submit medical documentation, and considered the evidence that the appellant submitted in making its decision. The agency ultimately removed the appellant on April 9, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant waived her Board appeal rights and agreed to a one-year probationary period when she signed the probationary period agreement. The administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Department of Justice</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 623 (2003), in making this determination. However, after the administrative judge issued the initial decision in the instant case, the Federal Circuit reversed the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Ramos</span>. <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Department of Justice</span> (Fed. Cir. May 18, 2005). Further, the instant case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Ramos</span> in that the appellant in <span class="Italic">Ramos</span> signed a probationary period agreement before he accepted his new position with the agency. <span class="Italic">Ramos</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 623 &#x00B6; 12. In the instant case, the record does not support a finding that the appellant knowingly and intentionally waived her appeal rights before she assumed her position at the SSA. Instead, the agency waited more than 2 months after her start date to present her with the probationary period agreement. An enforceable contract does not exist unless it is based on bargained-for consideration, <span class="Italic">see Pappas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 152, 158 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 155 F.3d 565 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table), and, in the instant case, the appellant already occupied her position with the agency when she signed the probationary period agreement. Thus, at the time she signed the probationary period agreement, the appellant received no consideration from the agency in exchange for her waiver of her appeal rights. Since no consideration flowed from the agency to the appellant, the probationary period agreement was unsupported by consideration and, thus, did not constitute an enforceable waiver of the appellant's appeal rights. Therefore, we find that the agency's termination of the appellant constituted an appealable adverse action taken against a competitive service employee with appeal rights to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), 7512(1), 7513(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Relying on Huges, <span class="Italic">Thompson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant had completed 18 years of service with the Department of Agriculture (former agency) when she accepted a career appointment as a Revenue Officer for the Internal Revenue Service (agency). On the first day of her employment with the agency, the appellant signed a "Notification of Probationary Period Document," which stated that she understood she was serving a probationary period, she relinquished her appeal rights during the probationary period, and she did not waive any appeal rights to which she was entitled by signing the document. The agency removed the appellant from her position during her probationary period for failing critical elements of her position, failing to pay the balance on her government credit card in a timely manner, and for being absent without leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit has held that, to be considered a competitive service employee with appeal rights to the Board, an individual must meet the requirements of either 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i) or (ii). <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1341-42. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), an "employee" is an individual in the competitive service who has completed one year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less. Office of Personnel Management regulations define "current continuous employment" as a "period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action in the same or similar positions without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b).[1] The appellant in the instant case had worked for her former agency from October 15, 1985, until October 18, 2003, when she resigned from her position. She began her new position in the competitive service with the agency on October 20, 2003.[2] Thus, the appellant had no break in service between her employment with her former agency and the agency, and she had more than one year of current, continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less when the agency terminated her. Accordingly, the appellant meets the definition of an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) and has Board appeal rights pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The "same or similar positions" requirement does not apply to competitive service employees. <span class="Italic">Schibik v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 591, &#x00B6; 7 n.1 (2005).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ, relying on <span class="Italic">Ramos</span>, found that the appellant had waived her Board appeal rights because she signed the "Notification of Probationary Period Document," stating her understanding that she was required to serve a probationary period and would waive her appeal rights during her probation. After the AJ issued her initial decision, however, the Federal Circuit reversed the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Ramos</span>. <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Department of <span id="Page_130"></span>Justice</span>, 2005 WL 1316981 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (non-precedential). Moreover, we note that the instant case is distinguishable from the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Ramos</span>. In <span class="Italic">Ramos</span>, the appellant signed a probationary agreement before he accepted his new position with the agency; he received the agreement after he had been provisionally selected for the new position and about six months before his actual appointment. <span class="Italic">Ramos</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 623, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12. In the instant case, although the AJ found that the appellant was offered a position with the agency "on the condition that she agreed to serve a probationary period," the record shows that the appellant was not presented with the probationary agreement until October 20, 2003, after she started her position with the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The distinction that we draw rests on our recent decision in <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Social Security Administration</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 67 (2005). In <span class="Italic">Hughes</span>, we held that an appellant was an employee within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) with Board appeal rights and did not waive those rights by signing a probationary agreement two months after starting a position with a new agency because she received no consideration from the agency in exchange for the waiver of those rights. <span class="Italic">Hughes</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 67, &#x00B6; 7<span class="Italic">.</span> We based our finding on the principle that an enforceable contract does not exist unless it is based on bargained-for consideration and the fact that the appellant in <span class="Italic">Hughes</span> was already employed with the agency when she signed the probationary agreement and had not knowingly and intentionally waived appeal rights before starting her position with the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the instant case, the appellant already occupied a position with the agency when she signed the "Notification of Probationary Period Document" waiving her Board appeal rights and there is no evidence that she knew prior to starting her position with the agency that she was waiving those rights. Thus, we find here, that the appellant received no consideration for the waiver of her Board appeal rights and that the waiver provision in the Notification of Probationary Period Document is unenforceable as to her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, the agency's removal of the appellant was an appealable adverse action taken against a competitive service employee with appeal rights to the Board. <span class="Italic">Hughes</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 67, &#x00B6; 7. Further, because the appellant was an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), she had a constitutional right to minimum due process of law. An agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives her of her property right in her employment constitutes an abridgement of her constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed.2d 494 (1985). As noted earlier, the appellant argued below that her due process rights were violated because she did not receive prior written notice of her proposed removal and an opportunity to respond; she submitted a statement from her union representative in support of this assertion. The record does not contain a removal proposal letter and the agency's removal letter did not give the appellant an opportunity to respond. The agency has provided no evidence and argument on this issue and the AJ did not reach this issue because the appeal was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. Accordingly, we find that a remand is required for a determination of whether the agency provided the appellant with minimum due process in effecting her removal and, if necessary, the hearing the appellant requested.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ramos v. DOJ</span>, 94 MSPR 623, 629-30 &#x00B6; 12 (2003), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">Ramos v. DOJ</span>, 240 Fed. Appx. 409 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), <span class="Italic">post,</span> determined that an employee moving into a position through selection from a register was required to serve another probationary period when he signed a probationary period agreement stating he understood that the job required a new period of probation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that this Probationary Period Agreement is significant for another reason. In <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 307 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit determined that an appellant meets the definition of "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) for purposes of appeal rights before the Board if the appellant is "an individual in the competitive service (i) who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or (ii) who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to I year or less...." <span class="Italic">McCormick,</span> 307 F.3d at 1340-41. Notwithstanding the potential impact of the holding in <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> on this appellant's appeal rights, we find that, under the circumstances of this appeal, the Board lacks jurisdiction. The appellant voluntarily signed the Probationary Period Agreement, which included a statement that he understood that he was required to serve a new probationary period and that his "rights and entitlements for adverse and disciplinary actions [would] be processed in accordance with the provisions of the code of Federal Regulations part 315." Just as the court has held that an employee may waive his statutory right to appeal an action in a last-chance settlement agreement, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McCall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 839 F.2d 664 (Fed. Cir. 1988), likewise, an individual in the appellant's circumstances may waive any right to appeal when he accepts a position subject to a probationary period. As the administrative judge noted in this case, it appears that the appellant decided to accept the new position and submit to a new probationary period because the Deportation Officer position had the potential of promotion to a higher grade level than his previous Border Patrol Agent position. Thus, his decision to sign the agreement appears to be a rational judgment on his part because he obtained a benefit in exchange for agreeing to a new probationary period. <span class="Italic">See McCall,</span> 839 F.2d at 667. The appellant has not alleged that he misunderstood the language of the agreement, that he was coerced into agreeing to the probationary period, or that the agency misrepresented the terms of his appointment. We conclude therefore that the agency conditioned its offer and the appellant conditioned his acceptance of the appointment to the Deportation Officer position on his successful completion of a new probationary period. Thus, the appellant is bound by the terms of the employment contract he signed, which was the basis for his appointment to the new position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit and the Justice Department lawyers representing the government in the Federal Circuit found the Board's approach somewhat unrealistic, as the court explained in <span class="Italic">Ramos v. DOJ</span>, 240 Fed. Appx. 409, 409-10 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), reversing the Board but not explaining the reasons for the government's confession of error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board reasoned that by signing a Probationary Period Agreement, which stated that "rights...for adverse and disciplinary actions will be processed in accordance with...the code of Federal Regulations Part 315--Career and Career-Conditional Employment," Mr. Ramos waived any rights to appeal from adverse actions taken during the one-year probationary period. In essence, the Board held that Mr. Ramos had signed a contract that intentionally waived whatever appeal rights he otherwise may have had.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the contract waiver ground, the Board distinguished <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 307 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002). <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> held that even though a person serves in a probationary position, that person still has Board appeal rights under section 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) if the person also has completed one year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1342-43. The Board recognized that Mr. Ramos satisfies the requirements of section 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), but reasoned that he had waived those rights by signing the Probationary Period Agreement. Consequently, the Board dismissed Mr. Ramos' appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ramos timely sought review in this court. We must overturn any final decision of the Board that misapplies the law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c). Mr. Ramos argues that the Board erred as a matter of law in dismissing his appeal because he must be deemed an employee entitled to Board appeal rights under <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>. The government on appeal flatly rejects the contract waiver theory of the Board, and instead confesses error on behalf of the Board. The government concedes that Mr. Ramos, under the holding of <span class="Italic">McCormick,</span> qualifies as an employee with "the full panoply of rights afforded to tenured employees." Additionally, the government concedes that Mr. Ramos did not make a knowing, intentional waiver of those rights when he signed the Probationary Period Agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that the Board erred as a matter of law in failing to apply <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> to the facts of this case. Mr. Ramos has established that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal of his removal.</p>
