<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-121"><span class="space">3.</span> Pleading to OSC</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Once arguably protected disclosures are made, and reprisal occurs, suitably specific allegations must be presented in an IRA complaint to OSC. Those allegations, generally contained in the Form OSC-14 [formerly OSC-11] or attachments to that form (or in the electronically filed version), should specifically describe the whistleblowing and the resulting reprisal. The actions or events disclosed to OSC must be described to OSC in sufficient detail for OSC to investigate the alleged reprisal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ablestein v. USDA</span> (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP No. 02-3302) ("These 'disclosures' provide no event or information for the OSC to investigate[.]"); <span class="Italic">Ashmore v. DOD</span>, SF-1221-21-0549-W-1 (NP 8/8/2022) ("The substantive requirements of exhaustion are met when an appellant has provided OSC with sufficient basis to pursue an investigation."). The OSC-14 [formerly OSC-11] form is submitted to OSC through its Complaints Examining Unit. "Unlike OSC's Complaints Examining Unit, its Disclosure Unit does not review allegations of prohibited personnel practices, and disclosures to it do not satisfy the exhaustion requirement for an individual right of action (IRA) appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)." <span class="Italic">Krugman v. VA</span>, DA-1221-13-0288-W-1 (NP 6/12/2014) (citing <span class="Italic">Mason v. DHS</span>, 116 MSPR 135 &#x00B6; 16, 2011 MSPB 39 (2011)), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Krugman v. VA,</span> DA-1221-13-0288-B-1 (NP 4/2/2015) (finding against the appellant).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At times MSPB cannot discern whether what are described as disclosures have gone to OSC as prohibited personnel practice allegations, to OSC's disclosure unit, or to both. <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-11-0263-B-3, n.9 (NP 4/15/2022), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If OSC received allegations about the falsification of a complainant's personnel documents, whether as part of an initial complaint or in the course of a PPP investigation, OSC could possibly have made a separate referral to its Disclosure Unit (which receives disclosures under different authority (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1213) than OSC's authority to receive and investigate PPPs (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1212(a)(2), 1214(a)(1)(A))) or simply considered the allegations as part of the PPP investigation. Given the evidence the appellant has provided, it seems more likely that the allegations were simply considered as part of the PPP investigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may determine that it lacks jurisdiction over the IRA appeal for failure of exhaust remedies through provision of insufficient information to OSC, <span class="Italic">Becker v. VA,</span> NY-1221-10-0280-W-1 (NP 3/25/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over an individual right of action (IRA) appeal if the appellant has exhausted his administrative remedies before the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and makes nonfrivolous allegations that: (1) he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure, and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Rusin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298, &#x00B6; 12 (2002). To meet the exhaustion requirement, the appellant must provide OSC with a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation which might have led to corrective action. <span class="Italic">Briley v. National Archives and Records Administration</span>, 236 F.3d 1373, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2001). That is, the appellant must articulate with reasonable clarity and detail the basis for his complaint of whistleblowing reprisal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Coufal v. Department of Justice</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 4 (2004). In showing that the exhaustion requirement has been met, an appellant is not limited by the issues raised in the initial complaint, but may also show that he amended his complaint through subsequent correspondence with OSC. <span class="Italic">Pasley v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 105, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-15 (2008). Where, as here, an agency's action is not directly appealable to the Board, and the appellant has sought corrective action from OSC, the appellant must file his IRA appeal: (1) no later than 65 days after the date of issuance of OSC's written notification that it is terminating its investigation into his complaint, or within 60 days of the date he received the notification if he received it more than 5 days after the date of issuance; or (2) at any time after the expiration of 120 days of the date of filing of his complaint if OSC has not notified him that it will seek corrective action on his behalf. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that 120 days have now passed since the appellant filed his complaint, and it does not appear that OSC has issued a termination letter. Nevertheless, the appellant has not satisfied the exhaustion requirement, because his July 1, 2010 complaint and July 31, 2010 follow-up letter did not provide OSC with a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation that might have led to corrective action. To the extent the submissions are at all legible, they fail to set forth with reasonable clarity and precision even the core of a retaliation claim, which would include at least such rudimentary details as the content of the protected disclosures, the individuals to whom they were made, and, if known, the individuals responsible for the appellant's non-selection. <span class="Italic">See Swanson v.

Without such information, OSC could not have known what to investigate. Because the appellant has not exhausted his remedies with OSC, the Board still lacks jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">At the Office of Special Counsel, Mintzmyer argued that the agency had taken the following personnel actions against her in reprisal for whistleblowing: (1) reassigned her; (2) denied her a salary step increase; (3) denied her a bonus; and (4) constructively discharged her through a course of "harassing and retaliatory behavior." Before the board, Mintzmyer alleged that the agency also had taken the following "retaliatory actions": (1) threatened to reprimand her; (2) continuously threatened her with "prosecution"; (3) made several false and slanderous <span id="Page_3859"></span>statements "With regard to actions taken against and by" her; and (4) declared that she was a threat to President George Bush just prior to a visit he made to the Mid-Atlantic Region.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mintzmyer, who has the burden of establishing the board's jurisdiction over her IRA appeal, <span class="Italic">see Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1244 (Fed.

Rather, she points to the allegation in her complaint filed with the Office of Special Counsel that she was "subjected to constructive discharge by harassing and retaliatory behavior" in arguing that she had raised these claims previously. But she did not raise these four alleged agency actions as independent personnel actions taken against her before the Office of Special Counsel.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCarthy v. MSPB</span>, 809 F.3d 1365, 1374-75 (Fed. Cir. 2016), reaffirmed the necessity for presenting specific allegations to OSC before they are presented to the Board in an IRA appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McCarthy's case is an individual right of action ("IRA") appeal, which the Board has jurisdiction to hear under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214. However, before an aggrieved employee can file an IRA appeal, he must first seek corrective action from the OSC. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3) ("Except in a case in which an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has the right to appeal directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board under any law, rule, or regulation, any such employee, former employee, or applicant shall seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before seeking corrective action from the Board.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In assessing whether an employee has exhausted his OSC remedies, we look to his OSC complaint, as well as written correspondence concerning his allegations. <span class="Italic">Serrao</span>, 95 F.3d at 1577; <span class="Italic">Benton-Flores v. Dep't of Def.</span>, No. DC-1221-13-0522-W-1, 2014 WL 3748419 (M.S.P.B. July 31, 2014). "We require that the employee 'articulate with reasonable clarity and precision [before the OSC] the basis for his request for corrective action under the WPA' to allow OSC to effectively pursue an investigation." <span class="Italic">Miller v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, No. 2015-3054, 2015 WL 4681015, at *6 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 6, 2015) (quoting <span class="Italic">Serrao</span>, 95 F.3d at 1577); <span class="Italic">see also Knollenberg v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 953 F.2d 623, 626 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (requiring a "sufficient basis to pursue an investigation which might have led to corrective action"). "The Board's jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, assuming the employee does not have an independent right to appeal directly to the Board, is thus limited to those issues that have been previously raised with OSC." <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 2015 WL 4681015, at *6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these principles here, we find that McCarthy has not sufficiently exhausted his OSC remedies with respect to the legal memoranda. McCarthy's OSC complaint only identifies his July 28 report to the OIG and a July 29 disclosure to Congressman Reyes. It makes no mention of his legal memoranda. Given this, the OSC's "basis to pursue an investigation" was only these two disclosures and the circumstances surrounding them, such as whom these disclosures were made to, the Commission's awareness of these disclosures, and how they related to the events that led to McCarthy's termination. This did not provide the OSC with a "sufficient basis to pursue an investigation" with respect to McCarthy's legal memoranda--these were different disclosures, made to different people, at different times.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the case that McCarthy presented to the OSC in 2009 substantially differs from the case he presents now. In 2009, McCarthy's legal memoranda were not considered protected disclosures under the WPA; thus, the OSC would have had no basis to investigate the legal memoranda and develop findings related to these disclosures. What McCarthy presents now is in essence a different case, and the OSC has not had an opportunity to "effectively pursue an investigation" with respect to these circumstances. Thus, McCarthy has failed to satisfy &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)'s exhaustion requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McCarthy nonetheless argues that he has exhausted his OSC remedies because his August 21 statement discussed the substance of his legal memoranda. We disagree. As discussed, this submission was provided and subsequently evaluated against the backdrop of the WPA: the legal memoranda were not protected disclosures and the OSC would have had no basis to "effectively pursue an investigation" with respect to them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, McCarthy argues that "the Board and this court have already considered the import of the legal memoranda." It is not clear to us that McCarthy's selective excerpts show that the Board or this court has done so. Regardless, the consideration that the Board or this court would give to the legal memoranda on appellate review is not necessarily the same consideration that the OSC would give in the first instance, and cannot be substituted for it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McCarthy also argues that the exhaustion requirement only applies to the content of whistleblowing disclosures, and that existing case law does not require that he correctly affix legal labels to these facts. We agree that the focus of the exhaustion requirement is on substance; however, McCarthy has not satisfied this requirement here. Neither his OSC complaint nor his August 21 statement identifies the legal memoranda with sufficient specificity or context to allow the OSC to effectively investigate his claims. Unlike <span class="Italic">Briley v. National Archives &#x0026; Records Administration</span>, 236 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001), cited by McCarthy, this is not simply a case where McCarthy is presenting a "more detailed account of [his] whistleblowing activities" to the Board than he did to the OSC, but otherwise made submissions to the OSC that "contain[ed] the core of [his] retaliation claim" and "gave the OSC sufficient basis to pursue an investigation." Instead, the core substance of McCarthy's complaint has shifted from a single disclosure to the OIG (which, at best, was at least in part cumulative of a nebulous collection of previous disclosures) to four distinct legal memoranda provided to specific individuals at specific times.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, then, that McCarthy has not exhausted his OSC remedies with respect to the legal memoranda. This rendered the Board without jurisdiction to hear his case under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board did not err in dismissing McCarthy's appeal and we affirm the Board's decision. We note that McCarthy remains free to pursue a complaint with the OSC with respect to his four legal memoranda, as there is no statutory time limit for filing a request for corrective action with the OSC. <span class="Italic">Augustine v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 648, 652 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The complainant must supply OSC with the facts needed for an investigation, but the facts need not be labeled with a statutory term describing the type of disclosure. <span class="Italic">See McAlpine v. SSA</span>, AT-1221-16-0301-W-1 (NP 2/21/2023) ("key to determining whether an appellant has satisfied the exhaustion requirement in an IRA appeal is whether she provided OSC with a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation, not whether she correctly labeled the category of wrongdoing; OSC can be expected to know which category of wrongdoing might be implicated by a particular set of factual allegations. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 224, 236-37 (1998), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Ganski v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 32, 37 (2000).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a questionable decision concerning an evidentiary burden of proof rather than assertions to OSC of facts constituting reprisal, <span class="Italic">Boyd v. DHS,</span> AT-1221-15-0008-W-1 (NP 6/25/2015), determined that the IRA exhaustion requirement calls for the appellant to first explain to OSC the elements of knowledge by agency officials of protected disclosures, although the Board considered other evidence concerning causation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The most common way of proving the contributing factor element is the knowledge-timing test. <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 120 M.S.P.R. 285, &#x00B6; 27 (2013). Under that test, an appellant can prove that her disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the whistleblowing disclosure and took the personnel action within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Once an appellant has satisfied the knowledge-timing test, she has demonstrated that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Department of Transportation,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 250, &#x00B6; 20 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her OSC complaint, the appellant alleged that she made protected disclosures in 2010 and 2011. However, she did not provide any description of how agency officials would have known about these disclosures that she made regarding another agency. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has not nonfrivolously alleged, through the knowledge-timing test, that her disclosures were a contributing factor in her nonselection. <span class="Italic">See Reed,</span> 122 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 17 (the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that her disclosure was a contributing factor in her suspension because she did not allege that the agency officials who were responsible for the alleged personnel actions knew about the disclosure). However, even if the appellant fails to satisfy this test, the Board considers other evidence, such as that pertaining to the strength or weakness of the agency's reasons for taking the personnel action, whether the whistleblowing was personally directed at the relevant officials, and whether those individuals had a desire or motive to retaliate against the appellant. <span class="Italic">Stiles v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 263, &#x00B6; 24 (2011). There is no evidence showing that any of the agency officials had a motive to retaliate against the appellant, whose disclosures were made about a different agency. We therefore also find, based upon our consideration of other evidence, that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that her disclosures were a contributing factor in her nonselection. <span class="Italic">Id</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Acha v. USDA</span>, 841 F.3d 878, 884 (10th Cir. 2016) ("Even though Petitioner's complaint to the OSC undoubtedly included his April email to the Inspector General (which, in turn, discussed his January disclosure to his supervisor), this is not enough. Instead, the fact that he did not even attempt to allege in the complaint itself that he was terminated for making the January disclosure was fatal to the MSPB's jurisdiction.").</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Miller did not raise his communication with the Internal Ombudsman or Acting Chairman Gruenberg in his complaint to OSC. The statute does not require that OSC affirmatively inform Miller that he must include any disclosures made, even those made outside the grievance process, in his OSC complaint in order to exhaust remedies. <span class="Italic">Cf. Willis v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (explaining that OSC is merely required to 'investigate the allegation to the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken'" (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)). Our precedent makes clear that &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3) requires, at a minimum, that the complaint before the OSC include some claim, "articulate[d] with reasonable clarity and precision," that identifies the basis for the employee's whistleblowing allegations. <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1037. Miller failed to raise these two disclosures before OSC in any capacity, and it is mere speculation for Miller to claim that raising the disclosures would have been irrelevant to OSC's decision to close his file. We therefore affirm the Board's conclusion that Miller failed to exhaust his remedies before OSC for his disclosures to the Internal Ombudsman and Acting Chairman Gruenberg.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board ruled that two of the allegations contained in Ms. Tuten's letter to the Office of Special Counsel satisfied the exhaustion requirement--the allegation that the agency falsified medical records and the allegation that the agency illegally transferred sick inmates out of the institution to pass program review. The Board concluded, however, that neither allegation was sufficiently specific to constitute a non-frivolous allegation of a protected disclosure. That decision is correct. "Substantive details establishing jurisdiction must be alleged in the complaint." <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1036 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Livingston v. Derwinski</span>, 959 F.2d 224, 225 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). Ms. Tuten has provided nothing more than bare assertions of wrongdoing by the agency, even after being given an opportunity to provide more detail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Tuten argues that the proper standard to evaluate jurisdiction in this case is whether, after discovery and a hearing, she could prove her claim by a preponderance of the evidence. She argues that we should remand the case to the Board with orders that she be allowed to conduct discovery. The flaw in that argument is that, for individual right of action appeals, the jurisdictional predicate is whether the appellant has made allegations that, if proved, would entitle the appellant to relief. <span class="Italic">Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 474 F.3d 1377, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed.

Because Ms. Tuten failed to make the required allegations, the Board has no jurisdiction over this case and therefore has no authority to order discovery on the merits of the claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3861"></span>Ms. Tuten also contends that we should reverse the Board's decision because the Board failed to "alert" her to the fact that she was required to make more than summary allegations. Even assuming there is such a requirement, the facts demonstrate that Ms. Tuten was on notice. In response to the Board's jurisdictional orders, she noted that she was required to make non-frivolous allegations that she had engaged in whistleblowing activity. In addition, the Board ordered Ms. Tuten to detail, among other things, the "date, substance, and recipients of the protected disclosure." Given her understanding and the specificity of the Board's order, Ms. Tuten cannot now complain that she lacked sufficient knowledge of what was required of her to establish jurisdiction. We therefore affirm the Board's decision dismissing Ms. Tuten's appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">To satisfy the exhaustion requirement in an IRA appeal, an appellant must inform OSC of the precise bases for her claim of reprisal, giving OSC a sufficient basis on which to pursue an investigation that might lead to corrective action. <span class="Italic">Redschlag v.

Office of Personnel Management,</span> 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980).

MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20180129086">880 F.3d 913</a>, 923-27 (7th Cir. 2018) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Delgado v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Delgado's appeal also failed before the Board for a third reason, which was also based on an arbitrary requirement imposed by the Board's treatment of the exhaustion requirement. The Board relied on a series of Federal Circuit decisions interpreting the Whistleblower Protection Act's command to "seek corrective action from the Special Counsel" to mean that "the employee must inform the Special Counsel of the <span class="Italic">precise ground</span> of his charge." E.g., <span class="Italic">Ward v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 981 F.2d 521, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Mintzmyer v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 84 F.3d 419, 422 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (affirming Board determination that employee failed to exhaust four specific claims of agency retaliation that were not included in charge to OSC); <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1036-37 (agreeing that Board lacked jurisdiction because petitioner failed to inform OSC that claim of reprisal was based on protected disclosure to Inspector General; employee told OSC only of unprotected agency grievance). In <span class="Italic">Ward</span> itself, the court affirmed the Board's refusal to consider additional episodes of allegedly wasted funds on travel by different person that were not presented in the OSC complaint: "An allegation of a specific alleged travel impropriety--here Dr. Kamely's authorization of Dr. DeFrank's trip to Portugal--was not sufficient notice to the Special Counsel that Dr. Ward also was challenging other travel related activities of Dr. Kamely." 981 F.2d at 526.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have no disagreement with that general point, at least as stated by our colleagues on the Federal Circuit. But as applied by the Board in Delgado's case and others, exhaustion seems to be determined separately for <span class="Italic">each fact</span> an employee alleges rather than for each claim of protected disclosure or retaliation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Daniels v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 248, 253-54 (MSPB 2007) (concluding that Board lacked jurisdiction to review agency's proposed removal of whistleblower because it occurred three weeks after OSC closed her complaint and thus was not specifically presented, even though removal was consistent with complaint, which alleged campaign of retaliation including threat of "removal of all duties"); <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 337, 341-42 (MSPB 2005) (dismissing for failure to exhaust soldier's claim that disclosure of gross waste of training funds resulted in poor performance evaluation because he neglected to tell OSC "the precise actions he reported" and how he "reasoned that the managers' actions constituted gross waste"). As the Board applies this framework, a whistleblower effectively forfeits reliance on any factual detail not presented first to the OSC, and if the facts the employee presents do not establish a conclusive case, there is no need for the OSC to investigate. As the Board explained in Delgado's case, it agreed with the administrative judge that "nothing [Delgado] had provided indicated that he gave OSC a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation that might lead to corrective action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The source of this unusually stringent approach is not clear to us. The exhaustion language in the statute is simple and brief. The employee must "seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before seeking corrective action from the Board." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). We do not see why this directive should be read to require a federal employee (who typically is not trained in the law) to present to the OSC a perfectly packaged case ready for litigation. The directive surely cannot mean that an agency whose mission is to investigate must be given upfront all the information necessary to prove a complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another recent case, <span class="Italic">Clarke v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, illustrates this problem in practice. 121 M.S.P.R. 154, 160-68 (MSPB 2014). Clarke, a physician, filed an OSC complaint containing eight specific disclosures of wrongdoing at the Veterans Administration. The OSC responded with an email seeking "more detailed information" within 10 days. (What exactly the agency wanted is unclear.) Dr. Clarke responded with a detailed narrative, but it covered only two of the eight disclosures due to "the time constraints imposed by OSC." OSC then declined to investigate--at all.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Clarke appealed, and the Board affirmed dismissal. The Board decided that Dr. Clarke had failed to exhaust the six disclosures not included in his response to the OSC's email--over the dissent of the Vice Chairman, who thought that Dr. Clarke's initial complaint contained plenty of detail, regardless of whether the agency had later requested even more information. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 165-68. Remarkably, however, the majority grounded its finding of failure to exhaust on the OSC's "determination that it might need further information in order to pursue an investigation," a conclusion that the Board thought should be entitled to deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). <span class="Italic">Clarke</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. at 160 n.8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This novel determination prompted the OSC to file its own brief as <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> asking the Federal Circuit to overturn the Board's conclusion that Dr. Clarke had failed to exhaust. The OSC contended that the Board had disregarded the unambiguous statutory language of the exhaustion requirement without understanding "all of the relevant factors that OSC considers in marshaling its limited resources" when deciding whether to investigate a particular complaint among the thousands it receives annually. Brief for U.S. Office of Special Counsel as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> Supporting Petitioner, <span class="Italic">Clarke v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 623 F. App'x 1016 (Fed. Cir. 2015).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OSC also argued that the Board's reliance on its decision not to investigate was untenable for two reasons. First, the Whistleblower Protection Act itself forbids the Board from considering such determinations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1221(f), 1214(b)(2)(E). Second, Congress specified during passage of the Act "that whistleblowers who seek the OSC's help not be penalized by any OSC decision not to pursue their cases." <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 100-413, at 10 (1988). Notwithstanding the agency's opposition, the Federal Circuit summarily affirmed the Board's decision that Dr. Clarke had failed to exhaust his remedies before the OSC, but it did so in a non-precedential order. <span class="Italic">Clarke v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 623 F. App'x 1016 (Fed. Cir. 2015).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As <span class="Italic">Clarke</span> illustrates, the Board's stringent application of the Whistleblower Protection Act's exhaustion requirement can effectively prevent all but the savviest federal whistleblowers from receiving a hearing on the merits. We think Congress intended the exhaustion requirement simply to give the OSC and the employing agency a chance to resolve issues without litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The correct approach, we conclude, is to interpret the Act's requirement more consistently with other statutory exhaustion schemes. The Federal Tort Claims Act, for example, bars suit against the United States for money damages "unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal Agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2675(a); <span class="Italic">see</span> 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 14.2(a) (confirming that "claim shall be deemed...presented when a Federal agency receives from a claimant" notice of the incident and a sum certain for damages on Standard Form 95).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To satisfy that important requirement, a claimant is not required to submit evidence or to include every detail that might be necessary to prove at trial. Instead, courts construe <span class="Italic">pro se</span> administrative complaints generously and deem exhausted any claim fairly implicit in the facts that would be clear to a legally sophisticated reader. <span class="Italic">Buechel v. United States</span>, 746 F.3d 753, 760 (7th Cir. 2014); <span class="Italic">accord, e.g., Lopez v. United States</span>, 823 F.3d 970, 975-76 (10th Cir. 2016); <span class="Italic">Goodman v. United States</span>, 298 F.3d 1048, 1055-57 (9th Cir. 2002) (describing FTCA notice requirement as "minimal" and confirming that a "skeletal" description of the alleged harm will suffice). "All that is required is sufficient notice to enable the agency to investigate," <span class="Italic">Palay v. United States</span>, 349 F.3d 418, 426 (7th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). A plaintiff is not prohibited from later buttressing the exhausted claim with additional details or evidence. After the claimant provides enough information to put a legally sophisticated reader on notice, it is up to the agency "to fill in the gaps, to the extent possible." <span class="Italic">Buechel</span>, 746 F.3d at 761.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perhaps even closer to the whistleblower issue is the standard used <span id="Page_3862"></span>to determine whether a particular claim asserted in court under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, has been exhausted before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Like the Whistleblower Protection Act's exhaustion scheme, Title VII requires a plaintiff to exhaust a discrimination claim through an agency that is charged with investigating but that will not be a defendant in a later civil suit on the merits of the claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court held long ago that although Title VII requires the filing of a timely charge with the EEOC before filing suit, exhaustion is not a jurisdictional requirement and may thus be waived or subject to estoppel and equitable tolling. <span class="Italic">Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc</span>., 455 U.S. 385, 392-98 (1982). The Court also has instructed that "technicalities are particularly inappropriate in a statutory scheme in which laymen, unassisted by trained lawyers initiate the process." <span class="Italic">Lego v. Twomey</span>, 404 U.S. 522, 527 (1972).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With these principles in mind we have held that, because most complaints "are completed by laypersons rather than by lawyers, a Title VII plaintiff need not allege in an EEOC charge each and every fact that combines to form the basis of each claim in her complaint." <span class="Italic">Cheek v. Western &#x0026; Southern Life Ins. Co</span>., 31 F.3d 497, 500 (7th Cir. 1994). We regard "a theory raised in court to fall within the scope of an administrative complaint if it is reasonably related to the charges actually set forth in the administrative filing." <span class="Italic">Dear v. Shinseki</span>, 578 F.3d 605, 609 (7th Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">accord, e.g., Sydnor v. Fairfax County</span>, 681 F.3d 591, 595-96 (4th Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">Williams v. New York City Housing Auth</span>., 458 F.3d 67, 70-71 (2d Cir. 2006). Even a charge that is not explicit in an employee's complaint will be deemed exhausted if "the current claim reasonably could have developed from the EEOC's investigation of the charges before it,"meaning that "the EEOC charge and the complaint must describe the same conduct and implicate the same individuals." <span class="Italic">Ezell v. Potter</span>, 400 F.3d 1041, 1046 (7th Cir. 2005). Federal employees alleging discrimination are subject to additional preconditions within the employing agency, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c), but since the scope of the exhaustion requirement is the same, federal employees' complaints receive the same generous construction. <span class="Italic">Reynolds v. Tangherlini</span>, 737 F.3d 1093, 1099-1100 (7th Cir. 2013). We see no statutory or other reason it should be substantially more difficult for a federal employee to exhaust a claim of retaliation under the Whistleblower Protection Act than a charge of discrimination under Title VII.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OSC examiner also faulted Delgado for not providing evidence showing "a causal connection between the disclosures you identified and the ATF's decisions" because "there is no indication that either [disclosure] resulted in any investigation, or that any official suffered adverse impact because of the report." This conclusion seems to have been worded as if Delgado were required to allege that Labno suffered adverse impact. That could not be correct. The issue is retaliation against the alleged whistleblower, not against the target of his disclosures. "Congress passed the whistleblower statute precisely because it did not trust agencies to regulate whistleblowers within their ranks." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Homeland Security v. Mac-Lean</span>, 135 S. Ct. 913, 920 (2015).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pertinent inquiry is of course whether Delgado himself suffered adverse action as a result of his disclosures of Labno's possible perjury and reckless firing of his weapon. Delgado's complaint specifies adverse actions he suffered because of his disclosures, including denied promotions, a threat of an unwelcome transfer, and a hostile work environment. Neither OSC nor the Board has identified any particular problem with Delgado's allegations on this score. He provided enough specifics for the OSC to investigate if it had chosen to do so, including identifying specific adverse actions and specific responsible supervisors. Delgado's complaint does not prove that the relevant decisions were motivated by a desire to retaliate against him for his disclosures, but he needed only to provide a sufficient basis for investigation. He did so.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Dabner v. EPA</span>, CH-1221-17-0112-W-1, n.2 (NP 5/3/2023) ("While this case was pending on review, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued Delgado v. Merit Systems Protection Board, 880 F.3d 913 (7th Cir. 2018), rejecting what it viewed as the 'unusually stringent approach' of determining exhaustion 'separately for <span class="Italic">each fact</span> that an employee alleges rather than for each claim of protected disclosure or retaliation.' <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 923 (emphasis in original). Rather, the court concluded, the exhaustion requirement is satisfied if the appellant has provided OSC 'sufficient information to permit a legally sophisticated reader to understand [the] charge of retaliation and to investigate further.' <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 927. We find that, to enable a legally sophisticated reader to understand a charge of retaliation for disclosing information to an Inspector General, an employee must at least inform the reader that she made such a disclosure.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Delgado</span> is on the mark. It is an unsettling phenomenon that without even a murmur of protest from OSC about the level of detail of allegations it receives, and without apparent recognition that OSC is supposed to be an investigatory organization that can develop its own information, the Board feels compelled to set high standards for pleading by employees who file IRA complaints with OSC. OSC is capable of requesting additional information through its Complaints Examining Unit or through its investigative or legal staff. The Board's standards of pleading to OSC may at times amount to a requirement that employees provide OSC not only with allegations but with proof of their allegations for MSPB to later permit them to prove before the Board that the employees suffered reprisal. <span class="Italic">Schaeffer v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the AJ's acknowledgment order, the appellant summarized his contention of gross mismanagement as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">My first days of orientation to IMSD...resulted in lengthy discussions with my co-director, Commander Mike Donch.... Specifically, we discussed the lack of internal and external operation procedures or standardized processes for ordnance operation, personnel matters, financial matters, training and security. I recognized there were significant personnel issues which were not being addressed and a great concern that the entire, worldwide Naval ordnance inventory was beyond accurate reconciliation using existing procedures. The lack of sound inventory management caused additional concerns such as security of explosives, safety issues, transportation and an inability to accurately identify requirements (quantity, type, location) for ordnance....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I had similar conversations with Bob Smith, the Technical Director. He confirmed my concerns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I had the same discussions with the Officer in Charge, Captain Vinson. I believe our concerns and observations were essentially the same. Early on, Vinson wanted to attack the problems. My concerns about ordnance operations and personnel were shared and well known.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his letter to Senators Specter and Santorum, Mr. Klein characterized NOC's reengineering process as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Naval Ordnance Center started...[a] reengineering effort [that] has cost millions of dollars and has not achieved anything.... The plan provided is not worth the paper it is written on...[and] is fatally flawed, used no accepted methodologies for development and if viewed by a wholly independent evaluator will be determined to be an outstanding case study of waste, fraud and abuse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This same letter reported that knowledge of the mismanagement of Navy ordnance was so widespread that it was commonplace within IMSD to hear employees say that it was only a matter of time before 60 Minutes showed up to ask why IMSD was unable to account for billions of dollars in conventional ordnance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem with the appellant's alleged disclosures, as related in his submissions to both OSC and the Board is that they consist, as illustrated by the foregoing quotations, of conclusory allegations that are unsupported by specific factual information. The appellant did not give any examples of inventory processes or accounting controls that were lacking, or of particular types or amounts of Naval ordnance that could not be accounted for. Nor did he describe any of the "fatal flaws" in the NOC reengineering plan, or in what ways it fostered "waste, fraud, and abuse."</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Exhaustion of the OSC remedy requires more than a general allegation of reprisal. The appellant should bring to the attention of OSC specific matters, e.g., the level of specificity should extend to a clear statement of the actions forming the basis of the complaint and the claim for relief.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Mitskog also argues that the Board erred by failing to consider her status as a "perceived whistleblower" and that the nature of her disclosures--protected or not--are irrelevant under this doctrine. <span class="Italic">See Montgomery v.

But this theory was not mentioned in Mitskog's submission to OSC. The record of her OSC submission reflects only her statement to FEC officials that she had "federal whistleblower status." This unilateral assertion is insufficient to demonstrate that agency officials <span class="Italic">perceived</span> her to be a whistleblower.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Although the OSC complaint should be specific, an IRA case will not be dismissed because allegations in the appeal are more specific.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that in her hearing before the administrative judge, Briley gave a more detailed account of her whistleblowing activities than she did in her letters to the OSC.

<p class="Body-Text">The degree of specificity required by the Board in pleadings submitted by employees to OSC sparked a well-founded dissent by Chairman Erdreich in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 355, 356-58 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Mr. Brown has claimed whistleblower status based on his disclosed allegation that two agency supervisors were claiming overtime pay for themselves and others for work that was not actually being performed. In addition to establishing that a protected disclosure was made, the other elements of a whistleblower's claim to jurisdiction in an Individual Right of Action appeal are the identification of a personnel action allegedly based in reprisal, and evidence that the personnel action at issue was first raised to the Special Counsel for investigation. The administrative judge and the majority have found these two elements lacking in this case. I believe that finding is based on an overly strict interpretation of the evidence presented by Mr. Brown.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Block 12 of Mr. Brown's appeal form dated April 30, 1994, he identifies the personnel action of which he is complaining as a "Forced Resignation/Constructive Removal." In Block 41.a) when asked if he had sought corrective action from the Special Counsel regarding the personnel action being appealed, Mr. Brown responded "Yes" and attached a copy of his right to appeal letter from the Office of Special Counsel (OSC). In his May 1, 1994 Declaration made in response to the administrative judge's order regarding establishing IRA jurisdiction, the appellant stated that once he received evidence that his "removal" was the result of retaliatory motives, he filed a complaint with OSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear from Mr. Brown's choice of language in Block 12 that he sees his alleged coerced resignation to be a form of "removal." In his declaration in support of his claim to jurisdiction, the appellant specifically attests that he complained about his "removal" to OSC. Although it may be possible to interpret the appellant's declaration to mean that the "removal" he was complaining about did not include the constructive removal/coerced resignation that is the subject of the appeal, it is more likely that he is describing a chain of events composed of what to him is a series of improper agency actions <span class="Italic">including</span> his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act is a remedial statute. As such it should be broadly construed "in favor of those whom it was intended to protect."[1] What I stated in my recent dissent in <span class="Italic">Costin v. HHS</span>, 64 MSPR 517 (1994) holds equally true here:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">The level of specificity that the majority here requires in a pro se complaint to OSC flies in the face of this principle. In so restrictively interpreting the requirement that employees exhaust their OSC remedy before seeking corrective action before the Board, the majority effectively places an obstacle in the path of those who seek relief from reprisal for revealing wrongdoing by government <span id="Page_3864"></span>officials. I do not believe Congress intended to erect such an obstacle</span>...</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The last portion of my dissent quoted above became more prophetic than I might have intended. On October 7, 1994, the House adopted the reauthorization bill for OSC. While that bill was being considered, Congressman McClosky gave a supporting statement from the floor, part of which was very critical of the majority opinion in <span class="Italic">Costin</span>. Of all the examples of Board and court decisions that are clearly contrary to the mandate of the Whistleblower Protection Act, Mr. McClosky chose to mention <span class="Italic">Costin</span> for discussion in the Congressional Record:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">A new example [of rulings contrary to the Act]</span> <span class="Italic">, Costin v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, (No. AT-12221-93-0670-W-1) [sic], may be the most significant, by requiring whistleblowers to identify the precise personnel actions at issue in their initial complaint to the Office of Special Counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">First this burden forces employees without counsel to fashion their complaints in legally technical language. Second, it is unrealistic, because often the full scope of reprisals is not exposed until the complaint is investigated or otherwise pursued. This burden would eliminate the guaranteed right of all whistleblowers to a due process hearing before the board</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">There should not be any confusion. To exhaust the OSC administrative remedy and qualify for an individual right of action, an employee or applicant only must allege a violation of section 2302(b)(8). The examples of alleged reprisals listed in the OSC complaint and the scope of the evidence that a whistleblower presents to the OSC, are completely irrelevant to establish jurisdiction for an IRA</span>.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Congressional Record-House</span>, October 7, 1994, H11422.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although statements such as this are not controlling of the Board's decision in this case, these comments on the record are certainly an indicator of Congressional intent as to an appellant's jurisdictional burden in an IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A whistleblower's right to due process should not be defeated by an overly strict application of the Board's jurisdictional requirements. The days of code pleading are gone. Mr. Brown's appeal form and declaration establish that he complained about whistleblower reprisal to OSC before filing with the Board. The agency has not challenged this aspect of his claim. His pleadings should be construed liberally as intended by the Act, and the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant failed to establish jurisdiction should be reversed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit joined forces with the Board to impose on those seeking IRA remedies the burden of particularized pleading to OSC before they can invoke assistance from the Board, <span class="Italic">Ward v. MSPB</span>, 981 F.2d 521, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only issue the administrative judge decided with respect to travel was whether Dr. Kamely's authorization of Dr. DeFrank's trip to address a meeting in Portugal constituted gross waste of funds. The administrative judge refused to consider Dr. Ward's additional charge that "Dr. Kamely herself was taking excessive and unnecessary overseas trips," because under 5 USC 1214(a)(3), Dr. Ward's failure to raise that issue in his complaint to the Special Counsel precluded the Board from considering it and the charge "therefore cannot serve as a basis for Board jurisdiction over appellant's appeal." That section states that, with an exception here inapplicable, an employee "shall seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before seeking corrective action from the Board." 5 USC 1214(a)(3) (Supp. III 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Ward, relying primarily on his certifications filed with the Board, contends that the administrative judge construed his complaint to the Special Counsel too narrowly, and should have viewed it as also challenging Dr. Kamely's own allegedly unnecessary travel. As we have indicated...however, Dr. Ward's subsequent certifications to the Board concerning what he stated in his complaint to the Special Counsel are not a proper basis for interpreting his complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, the administrative judge justifiably refused to consider an issue that Dr. Ward had not properly raised before the Special Counsel<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Knollenberg v. Department of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 92, 97 (1991) ("[S]ince the appellant failed to first raise the [whistleblowing] allegation to OSC which he now seeks to appeal to the Board, his appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction."), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Knollenberg v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 953 F.2d 623 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Shillinger v. Department of Labor</span>, 47 MSPR 145, 151 (1991). The purpose of the requirement that an employee exhaust his or her remedies before the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board is to give the Special Counsel the opportunity to take corrective action before involving the Board in the case. The Whistleblower Protection Act provides that, if the Special Counsel determines that there is a substantial likelihood that the information he has received discloses a violation of the Act, he shall transmit the information to the head of the agency involved for investigation and report by the latter. 5 USC 1213(c) (Supp. III 1991). Such inquiries by the Special Counsel and transmittal to the agency for remedial action constitute a major portion of the work of the Special Counsel. <span class="Italic">A Report to Congress from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel Fiscal Year 1991</span>, Office of Special Counsel, at 16-17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the exhaustion remedy to serve its intended purpose, however, the employee must inform the Special Counsel of the precise ground of his charge of whistleblowing. He must "give the Office of Special Counsel sufficient basis to pursue an investigation which might have led to corrective action." <span class="Italic">Knollenberg</span>, 953 F.2d at 626. An allegation of a specific alleged travel impropriety--here Dr. Kamely's authorization of Dr. DeFrank's trip to Portugal--was not sufficient notice to the Special Counsel that Dr. Ward also was challenging other travel related activities of Dr. Kamely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lloyd v. EPA</span>, 71 MSPR 671, 675 (1996), interpreted <span class="Italic">Ward</span> to mean that "[a]s a jurisdictional prerequisite to an IRA appeal regarding a personnel action that was allegedly taken because of whistleblowing, where the action complained of is not directly appealable to the Board, the appellant is first required to seek corrective action from OSC." <span class="Italic">Lloyd</span> also follows <span class="Italic">Ward</span> by requiring appellant to inform OSC "of the precise charge of whistleblowing." To determine the nature of the appellant's allegations to OSC, the Board will consider the text of the appellant's complaint as well as how OSC construed the complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gaugh v. SSA</span>, 87 MSPR 245, 248 &#x00B6; 8 (2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit followed <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> concluding in <span class="Italic">Serrao v. MSPB</span>, 95 F.3d 1569, 1577-78 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Judge Newman dissenting), that "[t]he test of the sufficiency of an employee's charge of whistleblowing to OSC is the statement that the employee makes in the complaint to OSC requesting corrective action under 5 USC 1214(a)(3), not the employee's subsequent characterization of that statement in his appeal to the Board." IRA protections did not follow the presentation to OSC of whistleblowing allegations previously made in an agency administrative grievance that also vaguely referenced a prior complaint by the employee to the agency Inspector General. The Federal Circuit did not discount the jurisdictional significance of a whistleblower's IG complaint; instead, the court decided that when Serrao presented his complaint to OSC, he presented only a grievance containing insufficiently specific allegations concerning his prior IG contact:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), an employee is required to "seek corrective action from the Office of Special Counsel before seeking corrective action from the Board." Based upon <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, and <span class="Italic">Mintzmyer</span>, we are not prepared to hold that this requirement is met when, as in Serrao's case, an employee expressly seeks corrective action from OSC for reprisal for the exercise of grievance rights (a matter not within the Board's jurisdiction) and, in so doing, includes a statement that his supervisor believes him to be the anonymous source of allegations that led to an investigation that took place more than two years before the OSC complaint was filed. For us to so hold, we would have to ignore the requirement stated in <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> that an employee's request for corrective action be articulated "with reasonable clarity and precision." This requirement is particularly important in a case such as this, where reading the OSC complaint as seeking corrective action for a section 2302(b)(8) prohibited personnel practice would have the effect of blurring the distinction between section 2302(b)(8) and section 2302(b)(9)(A) prohibited personnel practices articulated in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reemphasized in <span class="Italic">Ellison v. MSPB</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1037 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Willis v. USDA</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1144 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Willis finally argues that he made protected pre-retirement disclosures to coemployees and members of the general public. Even if Willis's alleged pre-retirement statements to his colleagues and others had <span id="Page_3865"></span>been protected disclosures, Willis nonetheless could not prevail. In reviewing Willis's claim, the Board is limited to review of only those materials submitted to the OSC. The rationale behind submitting the claim first to the OSC is to enable the OSC to remedy any wrongdoing it finds without involving the Board. <span class="Italic">See Ward,</span> 981 F.2d at 526. The exhaustion requirement would be rendered meaningless if a claimant were permitted to submit evidence of protected disclosures to the Board that was not submitted to the OSC. In <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, we stated that a failure to explicitly raise disclosures a claimant believes are protected with the OSC precludes consideration of these issues by the Board<span class="Italic">. See Ellison,</span> 7 F.3d at 1037. In that case, the claimant failed to raise certain allegedly protected disclosures with the OSC and raised them clearly only in his appeal to the Board<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. We held there, as we do here, that the Board was correct in declining to consider allegations of disclosures not clearly raised before the OSC. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. On appeal, Willis alleges that prior to his retirement he disclosed the reversals of his compliance findings to anyone who was in a position to take action. Willis claims that these actions were protected disclosures under the WPA. However, Willis does not explicitly mention these disclosures in his complaint to the OSC and therefore he has failed to meet the requirement that he exhaust his administrative remedies under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). As a result, the Board's decision to refuse to consider these alleged disclosures to the general public is supported by substantial evidence.</p>

Prior to his removal, Escandon sent a letter in November 1994 to the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs ("OWCP") in which he related six incidents, in addition to his own workplace injury, which he claimed resulted from the improper management actions of Fred Garcia, the laundry manager at the VAMC. He did not, however, appeal his removal. After his removal, Escandon repeatedly made disclosures regarding the hostile working environment allegedly created by Fred Garcia in the VAMC laundry to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General, a federal grand jury, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Senator Dianne Feinstein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 5, 1997, almost two years after his removal, Escandon sought corrective action from the OSC, alleging his removal was in reprisal for whistleblowing activities. In his letter, he related five incidents, including the incident leading to his own injury, that, he said, typified the hostile work environment at the laundry at the VAMC. Of the five incidents related in his letter to OSC, only four were included in the letter Escandon sent, before his removal, to the OWCP. The incidents alleged in both the letter to the OWCP and the letter to the OSC were: 1) a laundry employee "died from the baiting, goading, taunting and harassment by the foreman"; 2) another employee "nearly had his arm ripped out" in an industrial accident, as he was hurrying to meet unreasonable production quotas set by the manager; 3) another employee was bullied, i.e., "grabbed from the back" by the manager and in her struggle to get free "fell violently and hurt her knees"; and 4) due to the unreasonable production goals, Escandon suffered a knee injury while hurriedly pushing a delivery cart. The OSC did not take corrective action and closed its files on June 23, 1998. Escandon then appealed to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 30, 1998, the CAJ ordered Escandon to show cause--by filing evidence and argument--to establish that his IRA appeal was within the Board's jurisdiction. The order specifically informed Escandon that he must show that he made a disclosure protected under the WPA and that he had exhausted his remedies with the OSC. In response, Escandon reiterated his allegations concerning the conduct of manager Garcia at the VAMC, made a new and non-specific reference to the alleged reuse of soiled, infected laundry bags and submitted the affidavit of Martin Garcia in support of his allegations of wrongdoing by manager Garcia.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CAJ dismissed Escandon's IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction, reasoning that Escandon failed to make allegations which, if proven, would establish that he made disclosures protected under the WPA and had exhausted his remedies with the OSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over otherwise unreviewable personnel actions if a petitioner can demonstrate jurisdiction under the WPA by properly alleging that an adverse personnel action was taken against him in retaliation for activities that are protected under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See Willis v. Department of Agric.</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In order for such a personnel action to constitute retaliation for activities protected under the WPA, the personnel action must occur after the employee makes a protected "disclosure" under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before one may pursue an IRA appeal before the Board, the WPA requires that the employee first seek corrective relief from the OSC. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3) (1994), We explained the rationale for this OSC "exhaustion" requirement in <span class="Italic">Ward v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd</span>., 981 F.2d 521 (Fed. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The purpose of the requirement that an employee exhaust his or her remedies before the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board is to give the Special Counsel the opportunity to take corrective action before involving the Board in the case.... For the exhaustion remedy to serve its intended purpose, however, the employee must inform the Special Counsel of the <span class="Italic">precise ground of</span> <span class="Italic">his charge</span> of whistleblowing. He must give the Office of Special Counsel sufficient basis to pursue an investigation which might have led to corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 526 (emphasis added and citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board determined that only four disclosures made by Escandon to the OWCP satisfied this exhaustion requirement because he subsequently raised only them with the OSC. However, the Board held that these four disclosures did not qualify as protected disclosures under the WPA because they did not meet the criteria set forth in the relevant provisions of the WPA, 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To qualify a disclosure as protected, petitioner must show by a preponderance of evidence that the disclosure contains information which he <span class="Italic">reasonably</span> believes evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1034 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Furthermore, an employee must articulate with reasonable clarity and precision to the OSC the basis for his request for corrective action under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1037.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that the four 1994 OWCP disclosures did not meet the criteria for protected disclosures in that they were merely conclusory statements of opinion, rather than statements of fact, and that his OSC allegations were similarly lacking in specificity, or what the <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> court termed, "reasonable clarity and precision." This finding is supported by substantial evidence. Clearly, none of Escandon's OSC assertions allege with reasonable clarity and precision the basis for his request for corrective action. Nor were his OWCP allegations specific enough to constitute protected disclosures. In both letters, he failed to describe the production quotas in question, explain how the quotas or the manager specifically caused injury, provide the names of the injured employees, describe where, when, or how the incidents occurred, or provide any other details that would normally be necessary to investigate such serious accusations. Even assuming the OWCP disclosures were protected, none of the like disclosures to the OSC provided sufficient basis for the OSC to pursue an investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the alternative, the Board determined that Escandon's allegation of assault, elsewhere described as "bullying" by manager Garcia, that allegedly resulted in injury to an employee's knees did not rise to the level of serious, government wrongdoing of the sort the WPA was intended to root out. Assuming the Board erred, we find the Board's error harmless.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is true that the WPA was enacted to encourage employees to report serious wrongdoing, not "arguably minor and inadvertent miscues occurring in the conscientious carrying out of one's assigned duties," <span class="Italic">Frederick v. Department of Justice</span>, 73 F.3d 349, 353 (Fed. Cir. 1996), an allegation of assault by a government employee clearly can constitute more than a minor or inadvertent miscue and can indeed imply a serious violation of law. It depends on the detailed facts. Insofar as the Board determined that this allegation did not rise to a violation of law, the Board's determination might, depending on the facts which are not clear in the record on appeal, be contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See generally</span>, <span class="Italic">Frederick v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 63 MSPR 563, 570 (1994) (allegation that an official permitted time and attendance abuse could possibly evidence a violation of law, i.e., fraud).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, because the Board found Escandon's "assault allegation" was not alleged with sufficient precision and clarity to qualify as a protected disclosure and this finding is supported by substantial evidence, the Board's alternative determination that this disclosure did not concern serious enough misconduct to be protected, if indeed error, is harmless.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To us, Escandon argues that his 1994 disclosures to OWCP, four of which were repeated to OSC in 1997, meet the criteria set forth in section 2302(b)(8) because he submitted an "eyewitness account" of the laundry manager's conduct, presumably through the 1998 affidavit of Martin Garcia, and through his correspondence with JCAHO, which he did not submit to the Board until March 9, 1999. Escandon's reliance on his correspondence with JCAHO and Martin Garcia's affidavit is misplaced. Escandon's 1997 OSC allegations did not provide sufficient basis for the OSC to conduct an investigation and neither the 1998 affidavit nor the 1999 correspondence provided to the Board can retroactively correct the <span id="Page_3866"></span>deficiencies inherent in those earlier allegations to the OSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Escandon argues that he was entitled to a Board hearing, given the seriousness of his claim of whistleblowing disclosures and retaliation. However, the Board is not required to conduct a hearing where the IRA appeal does not allege facts which, if proven, would establish that a protected disclosure occurred and thus prove the Board has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 981 F.2d at 525.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board did not come right out and say that filing the wrong form with the OSC would always preclude an IRA appeal before the Board, it concluded that an employee's use of the OSC-12 form [now OSC-14], used for "disclosures" and involving an investigative and remedial process different than what is used in an IRA complaint, the OSC-11 [now OSC-14] form, precluded an IRA complaint for lack of exhaustion of administrative remedies with OSC when the form used by the appellant did not include a clearly-stated request for relief from OSC for whistleblower reprisal, <span class="Italic">Sabbagh v. Dept. of Army</span>, 110 MSPR 13, 16-20 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-16, 2008 MSPB 208 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 13, 2007, the appellant filed this IRA appeal with the Board, alleging that, in retaliation for making protected disclosures to the Inspector General at the Department of Defense (DOD), the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Army, the Department of the Army terminated her from her position, and DOD: (1) inserted negative comments into her Joint Personnel Adjudication System record, precluding her from obtaining employment; (2) refused to provide prospective employers with information regarding her security clearance; and (3) tapped her phones and monitored her electronic communications. The appellant alleges that each of these actions was taken against her in reprisal for making protected disclosures under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted her administrative remedies before OSC and makes non-frivolous allegations that: (1) She engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure; and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Therefore, before filing with the Board an IRA appeal of an action that is not an "otherwise appealable action," the individual must first seek corrective action from OSC. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(b)(1). To satisfy the exhaustion requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), an appellant must inform OSC of the precise ground of her charge of whistleblowing, giving OSC a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation which might lead to corrective action. <span class="Italic">Ward v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 981 F.2d 521, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1992). In the March 6, 2008 Order on Whistleblowing Allegations, the administrative judge notified the appellant of her burden to establish Board jurisdiction over her IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC has several powers and functions, including protecting employees, former employees, and applicants for employment from prohibited personnel practices in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214; receiving and investigating allegations of prohibited personnel practices, and "receiv[ing], review[ing], and where appropriate, forward[ing] to the Attorney General or an agency head under section 1213, disclosures of violations of any law, rule, or regulation, or gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1212(a). A "prohibited personnel practice" is defined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b), and includes under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) taking or failing to take, or threatening to take or fail to take, a personnel action because of a disclosure of information of wrongdoing as described above. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sections 1213 and 1214 of Title 5, United States Code, are respectively entitled, "Provisions relating to disclosures of violations of law, gross mismanagement, and certain other matters," and "Investigation of prohibited personnel practices; corrective action." Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1213(b), whenever OSC receives a disclosure of information from an employee which the employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, OSC shall review such information and determine whether there is a substantial likelihood that the information discloses such wrongdoing. If OSC makes a positive determination, it shall transmit the information to the appropriate agency head and generally require that the agency head conduct an investigation and submit a written report. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1213(c). Any such report shall include a description of any action taken or planned as a result of the investigation, such as restoration of any aggrieved employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1213(d). OSC shall transmit a copy of the report to the complainant, and the complainant may submit comments. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1213(e)(1). OSC shall then transmit the report, the complainant's comments, and any comments or recommendations by OSC, to the President and the congressional committees with jurisdiction over the agency which the disclosure involves. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1213(e)(3). If OSC does not transmit the information to the agency head, OSC shall inform the individual of the reasons why the disclosure may not be further acted upon and other offices available for receiving disclosures, should the individual wish to pursue the matter further. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1213(g)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, OSC shall receive any allegation of a prohibited personnel practice and investigate the allegation to the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(1)(A). An employee, like the appellant, may seek corrective action from the Board by filing an IRA appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 if the employee "seeks corrective action for a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8)" from OSC; OSC notifies the employee that an investigation concerning such employee has been terminated; and either no more than 60 days have elapsed since notification was provided to such employee that the investigation was terminated, or 120 days after seeking corrective action from OSC the employee has not been notified by OSC that OSC shall seek corrective action on behalf of the employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge erred in dismissing this appeal as untimely filed. In dismissing the appeal as untimely filed, the administrative judge mistakenly relied on the Form OSC-12 that the appellant submitted to OSC to find that the appellant sought corrective action from OSC regarding the agency's alleged improper actions and thus exhausted her administrative remedies. Additionally, the administrative judge mistakenly relied on a January 24, 2005 letter received by the appellant as evidence that OSC terminated its investigation. However, the Form OSC-12, entitled "Disclosure of Information," does not constitute a request for corrective action and the January 24, 2005 letter is not correspondence from OSC terminating an investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Form OSC-12 includes a section for whistleblowers to provide details regarding their disclosures, it does not include a corresponding space for setting forth personnel actions, or otherwise solicit information relating to prohibited personnel practices. The appellant's narrative on the Form OSC-12 simply states that "[I]nformation is sensitive and cannot be disclosed on this page. I would like to request a meeting to discuss the violations." The appellant does not allege any prohibited personnel practices on the Form OSC-12. Additionally, the facsimile cover sheet prepared by the appellant for Form OSC-12 is addressed to "OSC/Disclosure Unit." Moreover, the January 24, 2005 letter described by the AJ as "a closure letter" from OSC was actually sent to the appellant from the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment Practices, and notified the appellant that the office did not have jurisdiction over her discrimination complaint against DOD, which was filed on December 28, 2004. The letter, therefore, did not constitute notification from OSC that an investigation had terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has not exhausted her administrative remedy because she did not allege whistleblower reprisal before OSC with respect to the claims she raises in this appeal, thereby giving OSC a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation that might have led to corrective action. <span class="Italic">See Langer v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 265 F.3d 1259, 1268 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (the appellant failed to exhaust his OSC remedy with respect to a particular disclosure because he did not specify to OSC that the disclosure was a "WPA action," rather than simply a wrongful personnel action); <span class="Italic">Clemente v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 519, &#x00B6; 13 (2006); <span class="Italic">Finston v. Health Care Financing Administration</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10 (1999) (a complaint to OSC alleging a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(4) did not constitute exhaustion of OSC proceedings regarding whistleblower allegations). OSC's regulations provide that, with an exception not applicable here, "Form OSC-11 ('Complaint of Possible Prohibited Personnel Practice or Other Prohibited Activity') must be used to file all such complaints." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1800.1(c)(1). Individuals who file disclosures of information, by contrast, are encouraged to use Form OSC-12. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1800.2(b)(1). There is no indication that the appellant ever filed an OSC Form-11 or otherwise sought corrective action from OSC for a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because OSC did not, therefore, notify the appellant that an investigation concerning a prohibited personnel practice was terminated, the 60-day time limit set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A)(ii) never started, and this appeal should not have been dismissed as untimely filed under that time limit. Similarly, because the appellant has not shown that her June 29, 2005 Form OSC-12 constituted a request for corrective action, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(B), which permits the filing of an IRA appeal with the Board 120 days after seeking corrective action from OSC, does not apply in this case.</p>
