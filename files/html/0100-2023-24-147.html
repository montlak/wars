<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-143"><span class="space">a.</span> Property Interest</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Constitutionally protected property rights may establish the right to a notice of charges and a pretermination hearing for employees who otherwise lack civil service protection, but beyond these procedural protections, <span class="Italic">Paige v. Cisneros</span>, 91 F.3d 40, 43, 44-45 (7th Cir. 1996), declared as to the claim of a terminated DHUD attorney:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...He thinks that because he does not qualify for MSPB review he can jump straight into district court. Unfortunately for him, however, the effect is quite the opposite. <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 108 S. Ct. 668, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988), holds that by creating a comprehensive review system the CSRA implicitly repealed the jurisdiction of federal district courts over personnel actions of a type appealable to the MSPB, <span class="Italic">even</span> when the action is against a member of the excepted service who has no right to MSPB review. The result: Many personnel actions are unreviewable in any court or administrative tribunal. Any other interpretation of the Act, the Court held, would invert the CSRA's system of preferences for certain employees, making competitive service and preference eligible employees worse off than others. Many plaintiffs would prefer to begin their campaigns against federal agencies in district court rather than trudge their way through administrative proceedings--many of which are controlled by the agency being sued. The CSRA accordingly forbids this jump for all classes of federal employees whether or not they are entitled to administrative review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The due process clause of the Constitution required HUD to give Paige notice and the opportunity for a hearing to contest the charges against him. He received a pretermination hearing, at which he pleaded confession and avoidance. Paige admitted the factual charges and presented a justification that simply fortified HUD's tentative conclusion that he was not a suitable employee. His admissions before the agency ended any further need for a hearing on the truthfulness of HUD's submissions about his performance on the job. All that remained was attaching a consequence to admitted facts. Agencies no less than courts can grant summary judgment, and the due process clause does not require a hearing where there is no disputed issue of material fact to resolve. <span class="Italic">Codd v. Velger</span>, 429 U.S. 624, 97 S. Ct. 882, 51 L. Ed.2d 92 (1977); <span class="Italic">Greene v. Finley</span>, 749 F.2d 467 (7th Cir. 1984). Sometimes the Constitution extends an opportunity to tell one's side of the story and thereby inform the decisionmaker's discretion in assigning the appropriate penalty, even when the essential facts are uncontested. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 543 &#x0026; n.8, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 1493-94 &#x0026; n.8, 84 L. Ed.2d 494 (1985); <span class="Italic">Goss v. Lopez</span>, 419 U.S. 565, 583-84, 95 S. Ct. 729, 740-41, 42 L. Ed.2d 725 (1975). HUD gave Paige that chance and then decided to fire him. We are left scratching our heads over how this fell short of the constitutional minimum. And of course by the time the case arrived here, Paige had gone through another hearing and an administrative appeal. His constitutional claim is so feeble that he would not be entitled to relief on any court's understanding of the relation between &#x00A7; 702 and the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit discerned no infringement of property rights through the dismissal of an excepted service attorney who lacked the years of service needed to establish the right to a Board appeal, <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. IBWC</span>, 497 Fed. Appx. 4, 9-11 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McCarthy's first argument is that the Commission violated his Fifth Amendment right to procedural due process when it terminated his employment without notice or an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have recognized that "[i]f the government gives a public employee assurances of continued employment or conditions dismissal only for specific reasons, the public employee has a property interest in continued employment." <span class="Italic">Stone v. FDIC,</span> 179 F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1999). "Property interests are not created by the Constitution; 'they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source [such as a statute] ...."' <span class="Italic">Id. (</span>quoting<span class="Italic"> Bd. of Regents v. Roth,</span> 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)). For example, an individual whom Congress has defined as "[a] federal employee, as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501 (1994), 'has a property right in [her] continued employment.'" <span class="Italic">Delong v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 264 F.3d 1334, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001) <span class="Italic">(</span>quoting <span class="Italic">King v. Alston,</span> 75 F.3d 657, 661 (Fed. Cir. 1996)). "That property right entitles the employee to procedural due process protections under the Fifth Amendment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citation omitted). "On the other hand, if the public employee is hired for a limited appointment or is at will, then the employee does not have a property interest in continued employment." <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> 179 F.3d at 1375.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To qualify as an "employee" in the excepted service under Chapter 75, and thereby gain due process protections in one's federal employment, a non-preference-eligible individual not serving in an appointment pending conversion to the competitive service must have "completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions...under <span class="Italic">other than a temporary appointment</span> limited to 2 years or less." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that Mr. McCarthy was a member of the excepted service and served in his position at the Commission for less than two years. And while Mr. McCarthy admits that he does not qualify as an employee under Chapter 75, he asserts that Chapter 75 is not the only source of property rights in federal employment. Rather, Mr. McCarthy contends that a property right in employment may be found when, "though not secured by a formal contractual tenure provision, [i]t was secured by a no less binding understanding fostered by the [Commission]." <span class="Italic">Perry v. Sindermann,</span> 408 U.S. 593, 599 (1972). Mr. McCarthy notes that his corrected SF-50 describes him as a permanent, non-probationary, excepted service employee. Based solely on his designation as "permanent," Mr. McCarthy argues that he is entitled to due process protections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McCarthy's argument misinterprets the statutory framework behind the civil service system. More precisely, Mr. McCarthy seeks to bypass <span id="Page_5382"></span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) and create a property interest in employment for all members of the excepted service working under permanent appointments, regardless of the length of their service (i.e., regardless of whether they are "employees" under the statute). But it is not enough that McCarthy's SF-50 says "permanent"--&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) still requires two years of concurrent or continuous service before he can become an "employee" as defined by Chapter 75. This requirement is entirely consistent with Mr. McCarthy's permanent appointment. Indeed, "[b]y the plain terms of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), the two years of current continuous service must be served 'under other than a temporary appointment,' i.e., <span class="Italic">under a permanent appointment." Forest v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 47 F.3d 409, 411 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (emphasis added). That is to say, Congress has expressly conditioned the Chapter 75 protections afforded to members of the excepted service, including those serving under permanent appointments, upon two years of current continuous service. Moreover, Mr. McCarthy has failed to identify any action or communication on the part of the Commission (other than his SF-50 designation discussed above) that might establish a property interest in his employment. Accordingly, we conclude that Mr. McCarthy has failed to identify a property interest in his employment that would require cause to be shown or other procedures to be afforded with respect to his discharge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to excepted service attorneys, the existence of the anti-discrimination provisions of the civil rights laws and the prohibited personnel practice provisions of the Reform Act did not establish property interests under the Constitution. Because those statutes do not affirmatively establish conditions of tenure, alleged violations of those statutes did not create a constitutional cause of action against an agency or its officers. <span class="Italic">Garrow v. Gramm</span>, 856 F.2d 203, 208 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (distinguishing as <span class="Italic">dictum</span> the implication in <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Bowen</span>, 815 F.2d 1505 (D.C. Cir. 1987), that Chapter 43 may establish property rights for excepted service through procedural protections contained in the statute or implementing regulations); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Theard v. U.S. Army</span>, 653 F. Supp. 536 (M.D. N.C. 1987) (no property right in employment of excepted service employee who could be terminated at any time without a statement of reasons for discharge or adverse action appeal rights). A property interest does not arise from appointment of an individual who does not meet statutory or regulatory qualification requirements, an appointment that was "void from the day [appellant] received it." <span class="Italic">Hannon v. Turnage</span>, 892 F.2d 653, 656-57 (7th Cir. 1990) (distinguishing case of employee who falsifies an application by omitting or misstating information that would not operate as a statutory or regulatory bar to employment); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. EPA</span>, 982 F.2d 531, 538 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (discussion of remedial implications as to back pay in Hubbard's successful constitutional/APA action for placement in federal position).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Property and liberty interests were not infringed by confiscation of a security badge and access to restricted work areas, <span class="Italic">Fuller v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 465 Fed. Appx. 949, 952 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject Mr. Fuller's argument that the Navy violated his rights under section 7513(b) or his constitutional rights when it confiscated his badge. Mr. Fuller remained on administrative leave with pay for approximately six weeks following the confiscation of his badge, so the confiscation itself did not have the effect of suspending him. By statute, a suspension results in "a temporary status without duties <span class="Italic">and pay</span>," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2) (emphasis added), so he was not suspended until his pay status was revoked on December 17, 2010. Moreover, Mr. Fuller has no liberty or property interest in access to classified information or to restricted government premises. Government credentials and access badges are not the personal property of the credentialed individual, but are government-issued documents indicating that the holder is entitled to special access to restricted government premises or materials. Because individual employees have no vested right to such access, the confiscation of Mr. Fuller's badge, and the resulting termination of his right of access to restricted premises did not implicate any due process concerns. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 498 F.3d 1361, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Hesse</span>, 217 F.3d at 1381; <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223, 1225 (Fed. Cir. 1992). His statutory and constitutional claims based on the confiscation of his badge therefore lack merit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A property interest was not implicated by a VA physician's involvement in an agency research program, <span class="Italic">Yu v. VA</span>, 528 Fed. Appx. 181, 185-86 (3rd Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Yu argues that the defendants violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights because they destroyed samples submitted to the Lab and refused to release money he had raised for the Lab. These claims fail because Yu cannot establish that he had a property interest in the samples or the funds. <span class="Italic">See Bd. of Regents of State Coll. v. Roth</span>, 408 U.S. 564, 570-71, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972) (explaining that a property interest is a prerequisite for a successful due process claim). To have a property interest, a person "must have more than a unilateral expectation to it" but "must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it." <span class="Italic">Baraka v. McGreevey</span>, 481 F.3d 187, 205 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting <span class="Italic">Roth</span>, 408 U.S. at 577). Yu has not established a claim of entitlement to either the samples or the funds. The samples were submitted to the Lab, which operated as a part of the VA. And despite Yu's claim that there was a binding agreement to transfer the samples to him, there is no evidence of any such agreement--the e-mails he relies on show only that the transfer was requested and the requirements were explained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Yu also cannot establish a claim of entitlement to the funds donated by outside groups for the Lab. These funds were donated to Veterans Research Fund, which Congress set up as a nonprofit corporation to provide the VA with flexible funding sources for its research. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7362(a). Yu argues that he is entitled to money contributed to this fund for his research because at least one contributing organization, Binax, Inc., submitted a letter explaining that its contribution was to be used by Yu "at his discretion." This letter cannot, however, alter the federal law relating to funds donated to the Veterans Research Fund--specifically, that the funds are to be used by the nonprofit corporation only to further the caring for and treatment of veterans, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7303, 7364, and the absence of any right by researchers to control the funds that they solicit. Absent this right, Yu lacks a property interest in the funds solicited for the Lab.</p>
