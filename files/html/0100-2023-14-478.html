<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-479"><span class="space">2.</span> Onset of Substantive Negotiability</h4>
<p class="noindent">The courts interceded, causing FLRA to rethink and revise its position on the negotiability of incentive pay, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 371, 374-75 (D.C. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to reward for superior performance of assigned work is surely a good deal less implicit in the right to assign work than is the right to <span class="Italic">sanction</span> for <span class="Italic">inferior</span> performance. Yet the statute sets forth the latter right explicitly, including, as a separate, nonnegotiable management power, the right to "suspend, remove, reduce in grade or pay, or take other disciplinary action."... This demonstrates, we think, that the terms "assign work" and "direct employees" were not meant to be so expansive as to include whatever is useful for getting the agency's work done in a particular manner of priority, but were rather descriptions of a precise, defined management activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's reasoning--that level of incentive pay "directly relate[s] to the potential success of the incentive in motivating the performance of particular job tasks," and thus "to some extent determine[s] the priorities for accomplishing the agency's work," which is the very objective of the reserved management right to assign work--is an example of a familiar defect of statutory construction that might be called substituting the ends for the means. It may well be that the rights to assign work and to reward superior performance of assigned work are both means to the objective of enabling the agency to determine its work priorities, just as the carrot and the stick are both means of getting a donkey to move. But the similarity of purpose does not establish that when Congress says carrot it means stick as well. It is for Congress, and not for the Authority or the courts, to determine what means it is willing to employ to achieve particular ends, and it usurps that prerogative to say that if Congress has rendered work assignment nonbargainable, then also nonbargainable is any activity that has the same effect as work assignment. If the latter principle were applied consistently, it is difficult to imagine <span class="Italic">any</span> agency prescriptions regarding terms and conditions of work for particular classes of employees that would remain bargainable, since (unless the agency is squandering its resources) they all have the same ultimate objective as assignment and direction, <span class="Italic">viz</span>. increased production by those employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to Authority counsel's argument, affirmance of the decision in <span id="page_963"></span>this case is not compelled by our opinions in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 691 F.2d 553 (D.C. Cir. 1982), and <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 1968 v. FLRA</span>, 691 F.2d 565 (D.C. Cir. 1982), which upheld Authority determinations that performance standards (and certain matters related to performance standards) were nonbargainable because they came within the management rights to assign work and direct employees. The performance standards sought to be negotiated in both of those interrelated cases included standards which established minimum levels of effort to avoid "remedial action."... We view those opinions as establishing that while the assignment of work includes...designation of the category of duties an employee is to perform, it also includes (if the agency chooses to be so specific) designation of the precise quantity and quality of those duties--which is unquestionably achieved by performance standards that must be met to avoid disciplinary action. This is a far cry from saying, as the Authority contends here, that it includes establishment of the rates of incentive pay. The latter can be brought within the concept only by the sort of analysis ("the means includes the end, which includes all other means to the same end") that we have rejected above.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand in <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS</span>, 27 FLRA 132, 133, 135-39 (1987), FLRA reversed position; the proposal was negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On review, the D.C. Circuit rejected the Authority's reasoning that the management right to assign work to employees includes the right to reward superior performance of the work which has been assigned. <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 371 (D.C. Cir. 1986). The court held that "the level of incentive pay awarded for the performance of agency work, even work that has been 'assigned' or 'directed,' [did] not come within the nonbargainable management rights to assign work and direct employees."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We adopt the court's holding...that a proposal such as the disputed proposal determining the level of incentive pay awarded for the performance of Agency work does not constitute an exercise of management's rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the statute.... [W]e turn our attention to whether Proposal 5 is rendered nonnegotiable by sections 7103(a)(14)(C) and 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. The issues presented here are limited solely to the rate of incentive award money to be paid to employees and do not in our view concern management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute to set levels of performance for employees to receive a particular rating.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The issue on remand...is whether the proposal concerns a condition of employment which is specifically provided for by federal statute so as to be excluded from the scope of the duty to bargain.... We find [it] is not a condition of employment which is specifically provided for by federal statute so as to be excluded....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The incentive award money...is not paid to employees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5301 <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq</span>. It is not wages or salary authorized by these provisions, in particular 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5332. Rather...the incentive award money payable to employees here is authorized pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4503....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he rates at which incentive award money is to be paid to employees under the incentive system established by the Agency are not matters specifically provided for under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4503 so as to be excluded from conditions of employment concerning which the Agency has an obligation to bargain. Section 4503 provides the Agency with authority to award employee performance, but it does not specify the amount to be paid as an award. It is clear from the legislative history of section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute that only those matters specifically provided for by other federal statutes are excepted from the obligation to negotiate under that provision. As the Agency acknowledges, the amount to be awarded as incentive money is left to the Agency's discretion pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4503.... Thus, the rate at which incentive award money will be paid to employees under the Agency's incentive program is not specifically provided for by statute and is within the duty to bargain....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, Proposal 5 would not prevent the Agency from eliminating the program. The proposal only addresses the rate of incentive pay....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency contends that certain portions of the legislative history of the Statute support its position that Congress did not intend to include the subject of pay or money-related fringe benefits in the scope of conditions of employment. However...the proposal does not concern wages or salaries. Further, the Agency has not shown nor do we find that incentive awards are the kinds of matters which are referred to in statements relied on by the Agency, for example, wages and salaries, retirement, life and health insurance, and leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has not demonstrated that implementation of the Union's proposal would directly interfere with management's right to determine its budget under the test set forth in <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO and Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 2 FLRA 604 (1980).... In that case, the Authority stated generally that it would find a proposal inconsistent with an agency's right to determine its budget if the proposal by its terms prescribed a particular program or an amount of funds to be included in the agency's budget or if the agency made a substantial demonstration that the proposal would result in a significant and unavoidable increase in costs which could not be offset by compensating benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency projected the cost of hiring a certain number of persons as data entry operators and argued that the Union's proposal would infringe on its right to determine a certain percentage of its budget related to data operators.... The figures provided by the Agency are speculative at best, because it is impossible to determine at this point the number of employees the Agency will actually hire or how many employees will participate in the incentive awards program, and if so at what level. Moreover, Proposal 5 does not specify a dollar amount to be budgeted for the program, but simply addresses the rate at which incentive award money will be paid to employees who qualify for an award under the program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency has not demonstrated that implementation of Proposal 5 would result in a significant and unavoidable increase in costs which would not be offset by compensating benefits. In fact, the proposal specifically links the amount of incentive money to be awarded to increases in an employee's productivity, which would directly benefit the Agency's "objective of greater efficiency in Government."</p>
<p class="noindent">Decisions followed suit. An incentive pay system declared nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3477 and CFTC</span>, 21 FLRA 90 (1986), was reviewed on reconsideration following remand from the D.C. Circuit. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3477 and CFTC</span>, 27 FLRA 440 (1987). Relying on the court's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 793 F.2d 371, 372-74 (D.C. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">on remand</span>, <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS</span>, 27 FLRA 132 (1987), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, FLRA reversed its earlier determination, making the proposals negotiable. FLRA reaffirmed its position that incentive pay proposals are negotiable in <span class="Italic">Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots and Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 36 FLRA 555 (1990), noting the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Ft. Stewart Sch. v. FLRA</span>, 110 S. Ct. 2043 (1990), determining that proposals involving the wages and fringe benefits of federal employees not covered by the General Schedule concern conditions of employment of those employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA set aside an arbitrator's award based on a determination that a proposal concerning an incentive pay adjustment was a nonnegotiable attempt to establish or modify performance standards, <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 65 FLRA 69, 72 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5) of the Statute, which states that it is an unfair labor practice for an agency "to refuse to consult or negotiate in good faith with a labor organization...." In this regard, the Union contends that the Agency terminated the MOU without giving the Union the opportunity to negotiate over the substance of the proposed change. Thus, the Union argues, the award is contrary to <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 371 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>), which, in vacating an Authority decision, held that a proposal determining the level of incentive pay for the performance of work was negotiable and was not an exercise of management's right to assign work. While acknowledging this precedent, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had no statutory duty to bargain over the substance of the Union's proposed MOU, explaining that the Agency's authority to reward performance was, in essence, authority to establish performance standards, which "touches upon the right to direct employees and assign work[,]" and, as such, is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Union that its proposed MOU involves the level of incentive pay for the performance of agency work, rather than the content of a performance standard. In this regard, the proposed MOU would provide a time-off incentive award based on the number of errors without regard to an employee's performance rating or appraisal. Exceptions at 12, Jt. Ex. 5 at 1 (stating that controllers "who have been both operation error-/deviation-free throughout the year will receive an award of 16 hours' time off"). Thus, like the proposal at issue in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the proposed MOU would reward the superior performance of assigned work, not establish a minimum standard of performance. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 793 F.2d at 374-75 (finding proposal that would provide additional compensation to employees who exceed certain requirements negotiable because it would reward superior performance of work, rather than establish "minimum levels of effort to avoid remedial action"). As a result, the proposal does not affect management's right to assign work and is negotiable. Accordingly, we grant this exception</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-144, FUSE and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 38 FLRA 456, 481-82 (1990), rejected the notion that proposals concerning performance awards were nonnegotiable because they concerned pay established by statute:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e reject the Agency's claim that performance awards are a "pay issue." An agency's authority under 5 USC 4502-03 to grant awards encompasses performance awards.... In <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS</span>, 27 FLRA 132, 135-38 (1987), the Authority concluded that incentive awards payable to employees under 5 USC 4502 and 4503 do not constitute wages or salaries and are distinguishable from those "money-related fringe benefits" referred to in the legislative history of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_964"></span>Additionally, we reject the Agency's argument that pay and fringe benefits, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, do not concern "conditions of employment."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>...the Court rejected contentions that (1) the term "conditions of employment," which is contained in the Statute, does not encompass pay and (2) the statements in legislative history of the Statute, on which the Agency in this case relies, warrant a conclusion that pay and fringe benefit proposals are not "conditions of employment" under the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent">With some restrictions, unions could negotiate proposals requiring that employees be given cash awards if they received ratings of outstanding, superior, or fully successful if the employees exceed at least one critical element of their performance plans. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-26 and Dept. of Air Force, Langley AFB</span>, 32 FLRA 607, 609 (1988) (relying on <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 245 and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 30 FLRA 1219 (1988)). <span class="Italic">Langley AFB</span> was reversed by the Fourth Circuit in an unpublished order, <span class="Italic">sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Langley AFB v. FLRA</span>, 878 F.2d 1430 (4th Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent">OPM regulations did not proscribe mandatory performance awards based on an employee's performance rating. As a result of regulatory changes, proposals mandating awards expressed as percentages of salary at various levels of performance were negotiable in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 245 and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 30 FLRA 1219 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-144, FUSE and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 38 FLRA 456 (1990) (Proposals 11 and 12, negotiable: management to consider awards for employees as specified fractions of their salaries for various levels of their performance), <span class="Italic">aff'd on remand</span>, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-144, FUSE and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 43 FLRA 47 (1991) (considering OPM 1991 regulatory revisions); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ft. Worth and AFGE Council of Prison Locals Union 1298</span>, 32 FLRA 128, 132 (1988) (reviewing arbitration award: "The Authority has held that proposal which establish mandatory performance awards are negotiable. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union, Chap. 245 and Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 30 FLRA 1219 (1988). Accordingly, if a collective bargaining agreement provisions mandates that an award be given in certain situations and that provision is violated, an arbitrator may order an appropriate monetary remedy consistent with law.").</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that called on the agency to allocate for the bargaining unit an amount of its overall performance awards budget not less than the amount the agency allocated to any other pay pool. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3836 and FEMA</span>, 31 FLRA 921, 926-931 (1988). The proposal established a proportion and did not mandate a specific figure for the agency's budget.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-144, FUSE and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 38 FLRA 456, 457-58, 478-80 (1990), considered Proposals 7 and 10 concerning incentive awards. First evaluated was a requirement that budget allocations for awards extend to 1.5% of aggregate payroll for the activity. The second requirement was that money for awards be split into two pools: one for GS-13 and above; the other for GS-12 and below. The first objective was nonnegotiable; the second objective was negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The effect of <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> [2 FLRA 603 (1980)] was the establishment of a two-part test for determining whether proposals directly interfere with management's right to determine the agency's budget.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the first part of the test, a proposal that prescribes the particular programs or operations an agency will include in its budget or prescribes the amount to be allocated in the budget for them is found to violate the agency's right to determine its budget. The first part of the budget test is narrow. It makes nonnegotiable only those proposals addressed to the budget <span class="Italic">per se</span>, not those that would result in expenditures by an agency and, consequently, have an impact on the budget process.... Proposals that simply have cost ramifications cannot be said to inject a union directly into the budget formulation process that is protected from bargaining under the first part of the budget test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the second part of the test, a proposal that does not, by its terms, prescribe the particular programs or amounts to be included in the agency's budget but would result in an increase in costs that is significant and unavoidable and not offset by compensating benefits is found to violate the right to determine the budget....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Insofar as Proposal 7 and 10 prescribe that, in circumstances where awards are given...1.5 percent of base aggregate payroll be allocated in the budget for that grouping, they prescribe an amount to be allocated in the Agency's budget for a particular program or operation. Accordingly, we find that the...[p]roposal[s]...directly interfere with the Agency's right to determine its budget.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the pool arrangement described in the proposals of <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-144</span>, FLRA was more charitable, 38 FLRA at 480-81:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These two sentences, standing by themselves, prescribe neither a particular program or operation nor an amount of funds to be included in the Agency's budget.... [T]he Agency retains the right to determine the amount of money to be applied to each pool. There is no showing, and it is not otherwise apparent to us, that these two sentences would result in any increase in costs. Consequently, these two sentences do not meet either part of the Authority's test for establishing that a proposal directly interferes with an agency's right to determine its budget.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he two sentences merely outline a procedure for the Agency to follow in implementing its decision concerning the amount of funds budgeted for performance awards....</p>
<p class="noindent">There were limits. In <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-26 and Dept. of Air Force, Langley AFB</span>, 40 FLRA 118, 151-52 (1991) (Proposal 5), <span class="Italic">modified</span>, <span class="Italic">IAM Lodge 2135 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 50 FLRA 677 (1995), a provision was nonnegotiable that required increased compensation of employees who worked at "special functions," because the pay premium was tied to a "service charge" by the agency for people attending the functions. There was no connection between the prices the agency charged for its services and the work situation or employment relationship of unit employees. The proposal was not considered to affect employment conditions.</p>
