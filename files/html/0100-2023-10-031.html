<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-33"><span class="space">b.</span> Management Secretaries, Assistants</h5>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Army Communications Sys. Agency, Ft. Monmouth, N.J. and NFFE Local 476</span>, 4 FLRA 627, 636-37 (1980), personal secretaries to an activity's policymakers were confidential employees, as were secretaries to individuals who effectuated the policies, procedures, and dictates of the activity policymakers. The secretary to a chief management negotiator who formed and effected activity management policy for labor-management relations was a confidential employee. A secretary was in a confidential position when he worked for the executive officer of the installation. That official served as the civilian personnel coordinator for the activity and as the official contact between the activity and the servicing civilian personnel office. He was privy to all personnel management actions and some labor relations actions involving reductions in force, removals, grievances, transfers, lateral appointments, promotions, and awards.</p>
<p class="noindent">A management secretary was a confidential employee, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Material Command, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 66 FLRA 852, 853-55 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that review is warranted because the RD "committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter" in finding that the incumbent is a confidential employee. As noted previously, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.31(c)(3)(iii), the Authority may grant an application for review when the application demonstrates that there is a genuine issue over whether the RD has committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee is a confidential employee within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute if: (1) there is evidence of a confidential working relationship between an employee and the employee's supervisor; and (2) the supervisor is significantly involved in labor-management relations. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C.,</span> 59 FLRA 853, 855 (2004) (<span class="Italic">DOL</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting, in part); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Projects Office, Yuma, Ariz.</span>, 37 FLRA 239, 244 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Yuma</span>). Among the factors that the Authority considers when assessing whether an individual serves in a confidential capacity are whether the individual: (1) obtains advance information of management's position with regard to contract negotiations, the disposition of grievances, and other labor relations matters; (2) because of physical proximity to their supervisor, overhears discussions of labor-management matters; and (3) has access to, prepares, or types materials related to labor-management relations, such as bargaining proposals and grievance responses. <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, 59 FLRA at 855.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the evidence established that the Executive Director formulates and effectuates management policies in the field of labor relations and that the incumbent acts in a confidential capacity with respect to the Executive Director. In this regard, the RD found that the incumbent's duties include administrative support and coordination of the Executive Director's schedule, as well as handling and keeping confidential files, including grievance reports. The RD further found that, although the incumbent "does not attend all of the labor&#8209;management meetings, she discusses [such] meetings with [the Executive Director] and...handles [his] correspondence, which includes notes regarding meetings, investigations, disciplinary actions, personnel matters and grievances." These findings support the RD's conclusion that the incumbent is a confidential employee within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Yuma</span>, 37 FLRA at 247-48; <span class="Italic">see also DOL</span>, 59 FLRA at 855.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has not provided any basis to conclude that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error with respect to these findings. In this regard, the Union asserts that the RD was clearly in error in finding that the Executive Director supervises six SES employees. But the organizational chart submitted by the Union actually supports the RD's finding. Further, even if such finding was erroneous, the Union has failed to show how this fact prejudiced the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also asserts that the RD erred in finding that the incumbent was temporarily promoted to the position on November 23, 2008 to run through January 17, 2010, and that she rotated to the position on a temporary basis in 2009. The Union has failed to explain how, even assuming these factual findings were erroneous, it was prejudiced by them, particularly given eligibility determinations are based on an employee's actual duties at the time of the hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Yuma</span>, 37 FLRA at 245.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union next disputes the RD's finding that the incumbent, while not actually attending the labor-management meetings, "sits outside of [the Executive Director's] office during [such] meetings and takes notes." According to the Union, the location of the incumbent's office makes it "impossible to hear what is being said clearly enough to take notes." Similarly, the Union disputes the RD's finding that the Executive Director's "'door is not shut during the labor meetings and he is aware that [the incumbent] listens and takes notes of the meeting.'" The Union contends that a different employee testified that "conversations that took place in [the Executive Director's] office [could not] be heard well enough to take notes." The record shows that relevant employees were all interviewed during the RD's investigation of the petition, and the RD considered any conflicting statements with respect to this issue. The Union's assertions thus challenge the weight that the RD attributed to this evidence. As a result, they do not provide a basis for concluding that the RD committed clear errors in making factual findings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, N. Cal. Health Care Sys., Martinez, Cal.</span>, 66 FLRA 522, 525 (2012) (Member Beck dissenting on other grounds) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union further contends that the RD's findings--that the incumbent has a "'locked file, a key to [the Executive Director's] office and...the combination to the safe that [is] locked in a room in the office suite'" and that she "'hold[s classified information] for [the Executive Director] or puts the information in the safe'"--give the appearance that the incumbent is the only one with keys to the Executive Director's office, safe, and file. According to the Union, all secretaries in the Executive Director's "front office have access to the locked file cabinets, classified material, the key to [the Executive Director's] office" and the combination to the safe. The Union has not pointed to any information in the record that supports this claim. Moreover, the Union has failed to show that the RD's findings with respect to the incumbent are erroneous. Accordingly, this contention also provides no basis for finding that the RD committed a prejudicial error.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Union asserts that the incumbent: (1) "does not perform personnel work in other than a clerical capacity"; (2) "is not engaged in contract negotiations or disposition of grievances"; (3) "does not participate in meetings involving labor&#8209;management matters"; and (4) is "not privy to pre&#8209;decisional, confidential information concerning labor&#8209;management...matters." The Union further states that it "[has] reason to believe that she is not an employee within the meaning of [&#x00A7;] 7103(a)(13)" of the Statute. To the extent that these claims are separate from the Union's overall argument that the incumbent is not a confidential employee, we reject such claims as bare assertions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Land Mgmt., Nev. State Office, Reno, Nev.</span>, 66 FLRA 435, 436 (2012); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Facilities Eng'g Command Mid&#8209;Atlantic, Norfolk, Va.</span>, 65 FLRA 272, 280 n.4 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent">But secretaries to deputy project managers who may have access to employee records concerning disciplinary actions, grievances, and employee appraisals were not confidential employees; access to and typing of occasional labor-management materials did not warrant their unit exclusion. Under <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 476</span>, 35 FLRA 1249, 1255-56 (1990), the unit properly included a secretary who worked for a deputy director of an office and occasionally sat in for his boss at management meetings when labor-relations issues were discussed. The secretary typed correspondence but and saw no personnel actions. She was not a confidential employee. The same result was reached in <span class="Italic">DHUD</span> as to the secretary to the agency's associate general counsel who, despite an agency claim that he served as legal advisor on all aspects of administrative law including labor relations, participated only once in negotiations with the union. He was unfamiliar with the negotiated agreement, was involved in the <span id="Page_37"></span>grievance process to a minor extent, and did not formulate personnel policy. His principal work involved advice on budget, contracting and procurement, ADP, and personnel matters. The employee had not attended meetings with the associate general counsel who dealt with grievances or negotiations. She spent almost all of her time answering the telephone and processing mail. Under <span class="Italic">DHUD</span>, a secretary was not confidential who worked for the Director, Public Employment Division, reviewing documents concerning negotiations and grievances so as to advise management whether proposals or grievances were consistent with EEO laws and regulations. The secretary typed materials involving EEO matters and processed other administrative paperwork. She did not process or type materials concerning contract proposals, minutes of meetings involving grievances or labor relations matters, and she did not have access to labor relations files or materials. Because her supervisor's work dealt with the EEO program and because her supervisor did not establish or effectuate management policy in the field of labor-management relations, the secretary was not a confidential employee. A executive secretary, whose secretarial duties included occasional review of correspondence on personnel matters, was not in a confidential position; access to those materials was not determinative if there was no other work in a confidential capacity for a person who formed or effected management labor relations policies. <span class="Italic">FMCS and NAGE Local R3-118</span>, 5 FLRA 28, 31 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VARO, Waco and AFGE Local 2571, AFL-CIO</span>, 50 FLRA 109, 111 (1995) (confidential employees did not include GS-4 office automation clerk who worked for a center manager with duties that involved personnel actions, establishment of work priorities, and approval of employees' leave and work schedules, but whose responsibilities did not include advising management or developing negotiating positions and proposals, preparing arbitration hearings, or consulting with management regarding ULP cases).</p>
<p class="noindent">The secretary to a manager responsible for collective bargaining negotiations was a confidential employee. The secretary performed extensive clerical work involving those negotiations. <span class="Italic">FMCS and NAGE Local R3-118</span>, 5 FLRA 28, 32 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma and NFFE Local 1487</span>, 37 FLRA 239, 248 (1990) (secretary to assistant project director involved in labor relations was confidential employee when secretary served as confidante to management in sensitive matters ranging from personnel problems to policy matters that could not be prematurely disclosed to other personnel; another secretary was confidential when she compiled and interpreted wage comparisons, was present at management caucuses where management established its bargaining position as to pay rates, when she attended meetings where labor relations and union activities are discussed). Confidential employees included secretaries to division directors and branch chiefs with broad general responsibilities involving grievance processing, hiring, performance appraisals, awards, disciplinary actions, promotions, and training. The secretaries participated in grievance processing and significant personnel actions on a regular basis through clerical preparation of formal requests and backup material. They were expected to keep their advance knowledge of those matters in confidence and not divulge that information to others before formal action was taken. The group also included some principal clerical assistants. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations, Oak Ridge, Tenn. and NAGE Local R5-181</span>, 4 FLRA 644, 650-51 (1980) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">Secretaries were confidential employees who: served as personal secretaries to group leaders who attended labor-management meetings; met with the union on changes in working conditions; and handled grievances, adverse actions, and other labor relations matters. Their secretarial duties included typing correspondence concerning adverse actions, internal management memos on labor relations problems, employee evaluations, responses to grievances, answers to ULP charges; filing confidential paperwork; maintaining employee personnel files. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Portsmouth Dist. Office and NTEU Chap. 11</span>, 13 FLRA 388, 389 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">EPA, Region VII and NFFE Local 1205</span>, 14 FLRA 25, 26 (1984) (excluding GS-5 secretary in personnel and organization branch based on limited amount of current work that would likely expand to include planned duties of typing contract proposals, RIF notices, internal labor relations memos, answers to employee grievances). Excluded from a unit was a GS-5 Personnel Clerk who typed and maintained materials concerning ULP cases, grievances, and contract negotiations, and who served as the principal clerical assistant to the labor relations officer; she was a confidential employee. Other personnel clerks, who did not have a close working relationship with the individual involved in forming and effectuating labor relations policies, were not excluded. They were not confidential employees; they were not excluded as employees engaged in federal personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity. Their work consisted of handling paperwork relating to personnel actions. <span class="Italic">EPA, Region III and AFGE</span>, 11 FLRA 354, 355 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">A secretary and office assistant to a service chief was not a confidential employee. The service chief, although in theory vested with personnel authority, exercised it so infrequently that his labor-relations work was insignificant, <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE</span>, 60 FLRA 887, 888-89 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated by the RD, an employee is a confidential employee within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute if: (1) there is evidence of a confidential working relationship between an employee and the employee's supervisor; and (2) the supervisor is significantly involved in labor-management relations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DOI, Yuma</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>37 FLRA at 244. An employee is not confidential in the absence of either of these requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority precedent supports the RD's finding that the Director is not significantly involved in labor-management relations. In this regard, the Authority has previously identified responsibilities that are aspects of the formulation or effectuation of management policies in labor relations. These responsibilities include advising management on or developing negotiating positions and proposals, preparing arbitration cases for hearing, and consulting with management regarding the handling of unfair labor practice (ULP) cases. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Army, U.S. Army Aviation Ctr., Fort Rucker, Ala.,</span> 60 FLRA 771, 772 (2005); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Reg'l Office, Waco, Tex.</span>, 50 FLRA 109, 111 (1995) (<span class="Italic">VA, Waco</span>); <span class="Italic">Yuma</span>, 37 FLRA at 240-41.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth by the RD, the Director is responsible for personnel matters, including hiring, performance appraisals, awards, disciplinary actions, promotions, and work assignments. As such, the record supports the Agency's assertion that the Director "has duties in labor management relations" insofar as he has responsibility for grievance processing and disciplinary actions. However, the Agency also acknowledges that, in the two years he has held the position, the Director has not been involved in any disciplinary actions, grievances, negotiations, or management discussions regarding proposals or management's position with regard to labor relations issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Director is not engaged in the types of responsibilities that the Authority has found are aspects of the formulation or effectuation of management policies in labor relations. Accordingly, consistent with Authority precedent, the Director is not significantly involved in formulating or effectuating management policies in the field of labor relations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., U.S. Food &#x0026; Drug Admin., Northeast &#x0026; Mid-Atlantic Regions</span>, 48 FLRA 1008, 1019 (1993) (<span class="Italic">FDA</span>) (secretaries not confidential where their supervisors' involvement in personnel matters, such as employee appraisals, disciplinary actions, promotions, grievances, and commenting on matters involving contract negotiations, does not constitute significant involvement in the formulation or effectuation of labor-management policy); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev., Headquarters</span>, 41 FLRA 1226, 1234 (1991) (public affairs specialists not confidential where there is no evidence that their supervisor had been involved with any grievances, ULPs, or other labor-management relations issues).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span> is misplaced insofar as the present case is factually distinguishable. The division directors and branch chiefs in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge </span>had "broad general responsibilities in such areas as grievance processing, hiring, performance appraisals, awards, disciplinary actions, promotions, and training." <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA<span class="Italic"> </span>at 650. In addition, they were expected to participate "in the formulation of management bargaining proposals and the analysis of union proposals[,]" <span class="Italic">id.</span>, activities that the Authority has "generally found to constitute the effectuation or formulation of management policies." <span class="Italic">VA, Waco</span>, 50 FLRA at 111.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Director is involved in personnel matters. However, his involvement in labor-management relations is not significant. In this regard, unlike the managers in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, the Director has never been involved in initiating disciplinary action, processing grievances, or any negotiations with the Union or any management discussions regarding proposals or management's positions related to negotiations. Nor has the Agency established that the Director is otherwise engaged in the types of activities that the Authority has previously found to constitute the effectuation or formulation of management policies. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">VA, Waco</span>, 50 FLRA at 111 (manager involved in personnel matters not significantly involved in labor-management relations where case is factually distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, the Director is not significantly involved in labor-management relations. As such, the employee is not a confidential employee within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">An aerospace engineering technician was a confidential employee who provided administrative support to the director of a test support center. The director assisted in union negotiations, implemented and influenced agency policies, and decided grievances and EEO matters. The employee edited the manager's response to grievances, signed for correspondence from the union, had access to and prior knowledge of responses to grievances, proposed disciplinary actions, promotions and awards, and could overhear the manager's conversations concerning grievances and other personnel matters. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft.
