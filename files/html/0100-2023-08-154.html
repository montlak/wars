<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nigg v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 164, 168 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2002), <span class="Italic">aff'd on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Nigg v. MSPB</span>, 321 F.3d 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2003), considered the anomalous status of the Postal Service within the government:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105, "Executive agency" is defined as "an Executive department, a government corporation, and an independent establishment." The Postal Service is not an "Executive department" because it is not included in the list of Executive departments provided in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101. Nor is it a government corporation, which is defined as a "corporation owned or controlled by the Government of the United States," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 103, because it has been defined by statute as an "independent establishment of the executive branch," 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 201. For purposes of title 5, however, Congress specifically excluded the Postal Service from the definition of "independent establishment," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 104 ("For purposes of this title, 'independent establishment' means an establishment in the executive branch...other than the United States Postal Service"), and it is therefore not an "Executive agency." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bacashihua v. Merit Systems Protection</span> <span class="Italic">Board,</span> 811 F.2d 1498, 1501 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (for purposes of the federal-sector labor relations statute, the Postal Service is not an Executive agency); <span class="Italic">Manriquez v. United States Postal Service,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 540, 542 (1985) (same).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Postal Service is not an executive agency, the competitive service, as defined by 5 USC 2102, includes all civil service positions in the Executive Branch except those specifically excepted from the competitive service by statute. Under 5 USC 2105(e), Postal Service employees are not considered to be employees for the purpose of Title 5, USC. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mays v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1316) (although employees of the Postal Service are part of the Civil Service, 39 USC 1001(b), they are not part of the competitive service. 39 USC 410(a)); <span class="Italic">Daisy v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 15, 19 (1995). [Refer to earlier in this chapter: "<a href="0100-2023-08-064.html#sec1-65">Preference Eligible Status</a>"; "<a href="0100-2023-08-155.html#sec1-154">One Year of Qualifying Service; Current Continuous Service in The Same or Similar Position</a>"; "<a href="0100-2023-08-052.html#sec1-53">Break in Service</a>"; "<a href="0100-2023-08-071.html#sec1-72">Appointment Pending Conversion to Competitive Service</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Relating this to MSPB, 5 USC 7511 provides Board appeal rights to some Postal Service employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this subchapter--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;"employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;in the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;This subchapter does not apply to an employee--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(8)&#x2003;whose position is within the United States Postal Service, the Postal Regulatory Commission...unless subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section or section 1005(a) of title 39 is the basis for this subchapter's applicability;....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That statute brings to the Board appeals of Postal Service preference eligibles with a year of covered service.

<p class="Body-Text">Setting aside for later discussion Postal Service supervisors, managers, and personnelists who lack preference eligible status, as to adverse actions, 5 USC 7511 gives the Board appellate jurisdiction over Postal Service preference eligibles (those with veterans preference) with one year of continuous service in the same or a similar position, essentially making the jurisdictional determination dependent on whether the individual is a preference eligible employee with sufficient defined service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B), 7512(3) and (4); <span class="Italic">Horner v.

<p class="Body-Text">Jurisdictional analysis of the Board's adverse action jurisdiction over nonpreference-eligible Postal Service employees became more complex following enactment of the 1990 Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1989, a statute extending Board jurisdiction to nonpreference eligible excepted service personnel. That statute, P.L. 101-376 (Aug. 17, 1990), amended 5 USC 7511(a)(1) to add to the definition of an employee for purposes of Board jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less;...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The amendments did not expand coverage for Postal Service employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The result of the confluence of statutes is that postal preference eligibles generally have adverse action appeal rights (subject to constraints resulting from the collective bargaining process); managers, supervisors and employees engaged in personnel work in other than clerical capacity generally have appeal rights; and postal nonpreference-eligible employees do not have Board appeal rights and are relegated to grievance procedures of labor contracts or internal organizational procedures "guaranteeing them an opportunity for a fair hearing on adverse actions" under 39 USC 1001(b). [For discussion of the interaction of Board appeal rights and collective bargaining agreement grievance and arbitration rights for some Postal Service employees, refer subsequent in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-241.html#sec1-237">Effect Of Collective Bargaining Contract Grievance or Related Procedures; 5 USC 7121</a>"; and the subsection "<a href="0100-2023-08-242.html#sec1-238">Postal Service Employees</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's jurisdiction over Postal Service employees is broader as to restoration rights than other appeals. "While only particular groups of Postal Service employees have the right to appeal an adverse action to the Board, the Board may exercise jurisdiction over a Postal Service employee's claim that the agency violated her restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. part 353, subpart C, regardless of whether the employee is preference eligible or a supervisory or managerial employee." <span class="Italic">Chen v. USPS</span>, 97 MSPR 527, 532 &#x00B6; 12 (2004); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hardy v. USPS</span>, 250 Fed. Appx. 332, 336-337 (Fed.

USPS</span>, 110 MSPR 126, 129-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-21, 2008 MSPB 225 (2008), explained that even though a Postal Service employee may not be defined as an "employee" for purposes of MSPB adverse action jurisdiction, the employee may have an appeal within the Board's jurisdiction to consider a claim to restoration rights for compensably injured individuals under 5 USC 8151(a)-(b)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The restoration rights to which compensably injured individuals are entitled are set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a)-(b), which provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;In the event the individual resumes employment with the Federal Government, the entire time during which the employee was receiving compensation under this chapter shall be credited to the employee for the purposes of within-grade step increases, retention purposes, and other rights and benefits based on length of service.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;the department or agency which was the last employer shall immediately and unconditionally accord the employee, if the injury or disability has been overcome within one year after the date of commencement of compensation or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States, the right to resume his former or an equivalent position, as well as all other attendant rights which the employee would have had, or acquired, in his former position had he not been injured or disabled, including the rights to tenure, promotion, and safeguards in reductions-in-force procedures, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;the department or agency which was the last employer shall, if the injury or disability is overcome within a period of more than one year after the date of commencement of compensation, make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee in his former or equivalent position within such department or agency, or within any other department or agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Welter v. Department of Transportation,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 414, 419-21 (1997), the Board found that it does not have jurisdiction over a claim of improper restoration under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2) where the employee's recovery took more than 1 year from the date that he first became eligible for OWCP compensation. In <span class="Italic">Gallo v. United States,</span> 529 F.3d 1345, 1348-52 (Fed. Cir. 2008), our reviewing court recently found the application of that analysis to a restoration claim brought pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) to be inappropriate because the restoration rights set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) are separate and independent of the rights set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b) and, unlike the restoration rights set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b), the restoration rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) are not contingent upon the amount of time it takes an employee to recover.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reopen this appeal to further consider our jurisdiction over this case because the AJ relied on <span class="Italic">Welter</span> in finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's claim that the agency failed to properly restore him. For the reasons set forth below, we find that <span class="Italic">Gallo</span> has no effect on our <span id="Page_243"></span>analysis of our jurisdictional authority regarding the appellant's claim for violation of his restoration rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may have jurisdiction over a Postal Service employee's claim that the agency violated his restoration rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b), following his full or partial recovery from a compensable injury, regardless of whether the employee would satisfy the definition of "employee" for the purposes of the Board's adverse action jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Wright v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 425, &#x00B6; 7 (2007); <span class="Italic">Rumph v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 243, &#x00B6; 9 (2006); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.102-.103, 353.304. However, the statute itself does not provide a right to appeal; rather, Congress provided that the restoration rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b) would be set forth under the regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and OPM's regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304, provides the scope of the right to appeal an alleged denial of restoration. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument and evidence asserting that the agency failed to restore him to his former position because the agency had previously determined to abolish that position before he was restored to duty, as a result of a reorganization plan, fails to assert a basis for jurisdiction over his appeal because his claim exceeds the restoration rights to which he is entitled. An individual's rights to restoration following a compensable injury are set forth at 5 C.F.R. part 353, subpart C. The specific obligation of an agency under that subpart and the extent of the Board's jurisdiction over restoration claims depend upon the extent of the individual's recovery and the amount of time that recovery took.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the appellant was "fully recovered" more than 1 year after he first became eligible to receive OWCP benefits. OPM's restoration regulation implementing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2) provides, in pertinent part, the following rights for compensably injured employees who recover more than 1 year after they first became eligible to receive OWCP benefits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Fully recovered after 1 year.</span> An employee who separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began...is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency's reemployment priority list for the competitive service or reemployment list for the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). "Fully recovered" means "compensation payments have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to perform all the duties of the position he or she left or an equivalent one." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102(2). OWCP's determination that an individual is fully recovered is "final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law and fact." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8128(b)(1). Accordingly, it is binding on the Board. <span class="Italic">As'Salaam v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 76, &#x00B6; 15 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Positions in the Postal Service are excepted service positions. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 16. As an employee in the excepted service, the appellant may appeal an alleged denial of restoration rights to the Board under 5 C.F.R. part 302. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(b). Under that part, an individual in the excepted service who is entitled to priority consideration may appeal a violation of his restoration rights to the Board by presenting factual information that he was denied restoration rights because of the employment of another person. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.501. Thus, to establish the Board's jurisdiction under the instant circumstances, the appellant had to raise nonfrivolous allegations that: (1) He was separated because of a compensable injury; (2) he has fully recovered more than 1 year after the date he became eligible for OWCP benefits; (3) he requested restoration within 30 days after the cessation of OWCP compensation; and (4) he believes that the agency violated his reemployment priority rights; i.e., he was denied restoration because of the employment of another person. <span class="Italic">See DeBlock v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 90, &#x00B6; 8 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ correctly found, the appellant was restored to his former position and he has not asserted that he was not placed in his former position because of the employment of another person, or even that his position continued to exist after the position was abolished and another person was placed in his position. Thus, the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency had violated his reemployment priority rights as required by the fourth jurisdictional criterion. <span class="Italic">See DeBlock,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 90, &#x00B6; 8. Additionally, we see no error in the AJ's finding that the appellant's claims that the agency had failed to restore him to duty in May 2006, November 2006, and January 2007, subsequent to his January 2006 return to duty, also failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of the Board's restoration jurisdiction, because OWCP had denied the appellant's claim of recurrence and, thus, the appellant did not have a compensable injury that would entitle him to restoration upon full or partial recovery from a compensable injury. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that <span class="Italic">Gallo</span> could appeal the agency's failure to fully provide him with the restoration rights set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a), the court noted that the rights set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) are separate and independent of the rights set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b), and that the two sections are intended to accomplish two distinct goals. <span class="Italic">Gallo,</span> 529 F.3d at 1348-50. The court then noted that, as reflected in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a) of the Board's regulations, the Board has jurisdiction over appeals from agency actions when the appeals are authorized by law, rule, or regulation, including the:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Failure to restore, improper restoration of, or failure to return following a leave of absence an employee or former employee of an agency in the executive branch (including the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission) following partial or full recovery from a compensable injury (5 CFR 353.304).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(12);[*] <span class="Italic">Gallo,</span> 529 F.3d at 1350-52. The court found that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(a) provides the Board with the following restoration rights jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an injured employee or former employee of an agency in the executive branch (including the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission) may appeal to the MSPB an agency's failure to restore, improper restoration, or failure to return an employee following a leave of absence. All appeals must be submitted in accordance with MSPB's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Gallo,</span> 529 F.3d at 1351. Thus, the court found that the Board has the jurisdiction to review whether an agency has fully provided a restored employee with the independent restoration rights to which he is entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1351-52. Again, those rights are to have the entire time the employee was receiving OWCP compensation credited for the purposes of within-grade step increases, retention purposes, and other rights and benefits based on length of service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] Both the Board and its reviewing court have found that the regulation describing the Board's appellate jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3 is not an independent source of jurisdiction, but is merely descriptive of the jurisdiction found in other laws, rules, and regulations. <span class="Italic">See Carell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, however, the appellant does not assert a claim for violation of rights conferred by &#x00A7; 8151(a). Moreover, the appellant's claim for violation of rights conferred by &#x00A7; 8151(b) is governed by one of the two exceptions to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(a). Section 353.304(b) provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual who fully recovers from a compensable injury more than 1 year after compensation begins may appeal to MSPB as provided for in parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for excepted and competitive service employees, respectively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, as an excepted service employee who fully recovered more than 1 year after he first became eligible to receive OWCP compensation, the appellant's restoration appeal right is set forth under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.501 (a denial of priority reemployment consideration), and his present restoration claim that the agency improperly restored him exceeds that right. As the Board's reviewing court found in a decision issued subsequent to <span class="Italic">Gallo:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee who recovers from injury or disability within one year is entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1) to resume his former position or an equivalent position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Merit Systems Protection Board has limited jurisdiction over appeals by employees of the Postal Service. In order to be entitled to review <span id="Page_244"></span>of adverse agency actions, a Postal Service employee must be either (1) a preference eligible employee (normally, a military veteran), (2) a supervisory or management employee, or (3) a confidential employee engaged in personnel work. 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A). It is undisputed that Ms. Gregory was not a preference eligible employee or a confidential employee engaged in personnel work, so in order to establish Board jurisdiction, she had to demonstrate that her position was that of a supervisor or manager.</p>

Specifically, she was responsible for analyzing transport equipment and making recommendations regarding its deployment; monitoring equipment supply chains; reviewing equipment inventory and recommending corrective action where necessary; providing guidance to employees in the proper handling, storage, and shipping of transport equipment; initiating requests for warehouse facilities of suitable size and location; and formulating and implementing procedures relating to empty equipment to respond to changes in processing and transportation networks. She argues that those duties rendered her a management employee and that her responsibilities with respect to other employees made her a supervisor. The administrative judge, after considering all the evidence offered regarding Ms. Gregory's position, concluded otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Supervisor.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question whether an employee is a supervisor for purposes of Board jurisdiction is guided by the definition of "supervisor" in the National Labor Relations Act. <span class="Italic">McCandless v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 996 F.2d 1193, 1198-99 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The National Labor Relations Act defines "supervisor" as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The term "supervisor" means any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 152(11). In applying that standard to cases involving appeals by Postal Service employees to the Merit Systems Protection Board, this court has stated that the two activities most determinative of supervisory authority are: (1) the authority to discharge or discipline another employee (or to effectively do so through recommendation), and (2) the authority to direct the actions of other employees<span class="Italic">. Bolton v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 154 F.3d 1313, 1317-18 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Gregory argues that she was a supervisor at the time she was demoted, because her duties were to provide program oversight and technical guidance to other employees in the proper handling, storage, and shipping of mail transport equipment, to conduct evaluations of equipment handling, and to make recommendations for correcting problems in equipment allocation. In addition, she argues that she analyzed the duties of at least one other employee and approved leave requests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the evidentiary hearing on jurisdiction, the administrative judge found that Ms. Gregory was not a supervisor. The administrative judge noted that she did not have authority to discipline or terminate employees and that she was not responsible for other employees' performance. With respect to several issues on which the evidence was in dispute, the administrative judge found the testimony of the agency witnesses more credible than Ms. Gregory's evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Ms. Gregory contended that she was responsible for approving and disapproving other employees' leave requests, the administrative judge found that she had never disapproved a leave request and that her approvals of leave requests were routine clerical tasks that did not involve the exercise of independent discretion. Moreover, although Ms. Gregory argued that she occupied a supervisory position with respect to at least one other employee, the administrative judge concluded from the evidence that she did not direct the activities of, or assign duties to, any other employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the administrative judge's finding that none of the functions that Ms. Gregory relied on made her position supervisory in nature. While it is clear that Ms. Gregory was responsible for the management of equipment, and while her work and recommendations often affected the way other employees performed their tasks, the administrative judge permissibly concluded that the evidence showed that what she oversaw was equipment, not personnel. Furthermore, the evidence showed that her role was more advisory than supervisory; she made recommendations and evaluations, but she had no independent authority to direct the activities of employees. As such, the administrative judge did not err in finding that Ms. Gregory was not a supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Management Employee</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the National Labor Relations Act does not define the terms "manager" or "management employee," it excludes managers from its coverage, and the Board has looked to decisions under the National Labor Relations Act to define the term "management employee" in determining the Board's jurisdiction over Postal Service employees under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Waldau v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 19 F.3d 1395, 1398 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Under the National Labor Relations Act, management employees are those who formulate and effectuate management policies by expressing and making operative decisions of their employer. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co.</span>, 416 U.S. 267, 288, 94 S. Ct. 1757, 40 L. Ed.2d 134 (1974). Ms. Gregory argues that she implemented agency policy in the management of mail transport equipment; determined where and when to deviate from that policy, when to supply equipment when it was in shortage, and when and how to pay for it; provided input to the Postal Service in developing policy; and was responsible for transportation equipment contracts. She argues that "[i]t is clear that anyone with such a vast responsibility" is a manager. It is "very difficult to believe," she argues, "the handling of millions of dollars of mail transport equipment...would not require [her] to effectuate Agency policy."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence on which Ms. Gregory relies does not support her contention that she was a manager. While it is clear that she was responsible for a large amount of valuable equipment, the evidence did not show that she formulated agency policy. Her evidence showed that she coordinated carriers, arranged to obtain equipment for employees who needed it, balanced costs and inventory, and decided where to deploy equipment. In addition, she participated as a team leader on two special projects--to establish a standard operating procedure for missent mail, and to redesign the Area Mail Transport Service Center. The administrative judge, however, concluded that none of her various job responsibilities rendered her position managerial, because she was simply implementing policy and did not have the authority to formulate policy for the agency. With respect to the two special projects on which she served as a team leader, the administrative judge concluded that the teams collectively made recommendations to management and thus did not fashion policy, but rather merely made suggestions as to steps that management could take to increase agency effectiveness. The administrative judge therefore concluded that in her role in the two special projects. Ms. Gregory was not making policy decisions, but was merely providing information on which such policy decisions would be made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's conclusions with respect to the "management employee" issue were supported by substantial evidence. The administrative judge permissibly concluded that although Ms. Gregory made the decisions she described as to the disposition and allocation of equipment, there is no indication that she had discretion to change any agency policy in so doing. Making day-to-day decisions about the disposition and allocation of equipment is not the same as making policy decisions that affect the agency beyond the particular circumstances of the decision. The administrative judge therefore did not err in holding that Ms. Gregory's position was not that of a management employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Eligibility to Join a Collective Bargaining Unit</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Gregory next contends that she must be regarded as a management employee because her job rendered her ineligible to join a collective bargaining unit. In <span class="Italic">McCandless v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 996 F.2d 1193, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 1993), this court held that employees who were excluded from collective bargaining units because they were legally barred from membership in such units would have appeal rights to the Board. This court has held, however, that the Postal Service's designation of an employee's position as "nonbargaining" does not establish that the employee is a supervisor or manager; instead, that determination must be based on an examination of the actual job duties of the position. <span class="Italic">Coursen v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 256 F.3d 1353, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Carrier v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 183 F.3d 1376, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Because the evidence showed that Ms. Gregory was not a manager or supervisor, the Postal Service's designation of her position as nonbargaining, although it may have been legally incorrect, does not change her status for purposes of Board jurisdiction. Moreover, the fact that there may have been no collective bargaining unit that Ms. Gregory could join at the time of her demotion does not mean that she was entitled to a Board appeal. A Postal Service employee such as Ms. Gregory has access to the Board only if the employee is barred as a matter of law from joining a union because of the employee's status as a manager or supervisor. Thus, Ms. Gregory's contention that several Postal Service unions had stated that she would not be accepted for membership and that her position was not covered by any collective bargaining agreement does not establish that she was legally barred from joining a union if one were established for a position such as hers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Paralleling portions of the statutes defining coverage of postal employees by Title 5 is 39 USC 1202, defining the extent of collective bargaining rights in <span id="Page_245"></span>the Postal Service. Section 1202 requires the National Labor Relations Board to determine appropriate units for collective bargaining, but no bargaining unit may include (1) any management official or supervisor; or (2) any employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity. The ensuring debate centered upon what constitutes a "management employee," and, to a lesser extent who is "engaged in personnel work." As to those employees left unprotected by the statutory scheme, 5 USC 1001(b) requires the Postal Service to establish procedures ensuring employees "full protection of their employment rights by guaranteeing them an opportunity for a fair hearing on adverse actions, with representatives of their own choosing."

<p class="Body-Text">If the Postal Service employee is not a preference eligible or a covered manager or confidential employee, there is no Board adverse action appeal. Executive Order 11787 does not grant a Board appeal right to an individual who does not have that status. <span class="Italic">Royals v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 184, 185 (1986), <span class="Italic">distinguishing</span> <span class="Italic">Del Gizzo v. USPS</span>, 575 F. Supp. 822 (D.N.J. 1983) (employee's appeal was through Board, not directly to federal district court; Exec. Order 11787 (June 11, 1974) abolished agency appeals systems and placed appeals in Civil Service Commission [MSPB] ); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cyr v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3217) (Board lacked jurisdiction over an appeal from the termination of a Postal Service employee who was not a preference eligible and who was not a supervisor or manager); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 455, 457 (1995) ("[T]he Board has no jurisdiction over appeals brought by nonsupervisory Postal Service employees who are not preference-eligibles, i.e., who are not veterans or in a special relationship with a veteran."). A postal employee is not an employee under 5 USC 4303(e), and for that reason cannot appeal to the Board a removal or reduction in grade for unacceptable performance under that section. <span class="Italic">Wenz v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1983 NP No. 83-1099); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Maisto v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 496 (1985) (Table) (slip opinion states at note 1 that the Postal Service does not fall within the coverage of Chapter 43). As to cases involving restoration to employment following recovery from a compensable injury, the definition of "employee" for chapter 75 purposes does not apply to 5 CFR part 353. The jurisdictional analysis may be different for postal employees who are removed for cause and for those who claim the agency improperly failed to restore employees to duty following a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. USPS</span>, 89 MSPR 210, 212 n.* (2001). [Refer to Chapter 14, "<a href="0100-2023-21-201.html#sec14-201">Restoration Rights Under Recovery of Occupational Injury or Illness</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-21-229.html#sec14-229">Postal Service</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Postal managers, supervisors, and confidential employees aside, the basic distinctions between those postal employees who have appeal rights and those who do not were summed up in <span class="Italic">Abbruzzese v. Berzak</span>, 601 F.2d 107, 108-09 (3d Cir. 1979):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Congress adopted the Postal Reorganization Act, it provided two types of procedures for resolving labor disputes between the United States Postal Service (USPS) and its employees. Veterans, also known as preference eligible employees, were given the choice of appealing an adverse decision to the Civil Service Commission or invoking those procedures found in the applicable collective bargaining agreement.[3] Non-preference eligible employees, on the other hand, were given recourse only to the process found in their contract.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;39 USCA 1005(a)(2) and 1206(b) (1979 Supp.). These sections also provide that under no circumstances may access to the Commission be blocked by such agreements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">MSPB jurisdiction over appeals by nonmanagerial, nonconfidential postal employees was also summarized, <span class="Italic">Raymond v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 16, 18-19 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 39 USC 201, the Postal Service is "an independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States." Except as otherwise provided by law, Postal Service employees are deemed not to be employees under title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2105(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1005 of title 39 pertaining to the Postal Service provides, however, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)(2) The provisions of title 5 relating to a preference eligible (as that term is defined under section 2108(3) of such title) shall apply to an applicant for appointment and any officers or employee of the Postal Service in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the applicant, officer, or employee were subject to the competitive service under such title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, Postal Service employees who are preference eligibles have the same rights as competitive service employees under title 5. Employees, such as the appellant, however, who are not veterans preference eligible employees have not been afforded the rights of competitive service employees and have no rights under title 5 unless specifically granted by some other provision. We find no statutory provision granting non-preference eligible employees of the Postal Service RIF appeal rights.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;As a non-preference eligible employee in the Postal Service, the appellant also has no right of appeal to the Board under Chapter 75 procedures. Such right is afforded only to preference eligible employees of the Postal Service, <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B), or to non-preference eligibles who are supervisors, management employees, or employees "engaged in personnel work in other than a purely confidential clerical capacity" and who have "completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar position." <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 3502, OPM is authorized to prescribe regulations for the release of competing employees in a RIF which give due effect to "military preference."

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has issued regulations and guidance implementing its statutory mandate, which, with respect to the Postal Service, afford retention preference and appeal rights to the Board only for preference eligible employees affected by RIFs. Postal Service employees who are preference eligible employees are covered under OPM's regulations at 5 CFR part 351. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.202(a)(1).
