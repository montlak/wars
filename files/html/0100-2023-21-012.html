<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-12"><span class="space">5.</span> Personal Service Contract</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">In re Kaltakji</span>, 1 MSPR 61, 62 (1979), informs us that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Title 5 CFR 831(a)(l) excludes from retirement coverage all employees serving under appointments limited to one year or less. Since all of the appellant's service was under personal service contracts limited to one year or less it follows that he is not entitled to a Civil Service retirement annuity because he has never served in a position that was covered by the retirement law or subject to retirement deductions. The fact that his contract service is creditable for retirement purposes as was Mr. Jankovic's does not in the absence of one year or more of covered service give him entitlement to a Civil Service annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Acosta v. OPM</span>, 19 MSPR 101, 107-11 (1984), <span class="Italic">reversed,</span> <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">post,</span> considering whether individuals working for the Navy under contract were entitled to service credit toward retirement during the period of their work, determined that the appellants' contracts were of the nature that service credit would be granted, but they were not appointed to regular civil service positions (leaving open the question of whether their contract service would not alone support an annuity entitlement):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As consistently stated by OPM and its predecessor, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) and recognized by this Board, all federal service, with limited exceptions not applicable here, is entitled to service credit for retirement and other purposes even though such service is not in a position which is covered by the civil service retirement system or other civil service laws, rules and regulations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Federal Personnel Manual,</span> Supplement 831-1, Subchapter S3 (September 21, 1981) and <span class="Italic">In re Sirri Kaltakji,</span> 1 MSPB 59 (1979) (denying a request for reopening of the decision of the Appeals Review Board in <span class="Italic">In re Sirri Kaltakji,</span> published at 1 MSPB 60).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such federal service can take the form of service, among others, in a <span id="Page_4086"></span>position covered by the civil service retirement system, service under another contributory retirement system for federal government employees, or service, usually, under special contracts if the contract contemplates full-time or specified part-time personal service of the person obligated by the contract under the daily supervision and control of a federal official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the parties have stipulated that the appellants performed their services pursuant to contracts between either the Department of the Navy or one or more of a number of proprietary corporations established, controlled and funded by the Navy, we will first consider whether appellants are entitled to service credit for such service as "contract employees"[12] of the Navy or its proprietary corporations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;Both the Comptroller General of the United States and the U.S. Supreme Court have recognized that the United States does retain employees by contract as well as by appointment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 23 Comp. Gen. 425 (1943) and <span class="Italic">U.S. v. Hopkins,</span> 426 U.S. 830 (1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Questions concerning the status and entitlements of individuals whose services are retained by the federal government pursuant to contracts have recurred under numerous factual circumstances. These questions generally involve the nature of the relationship between the government and the individual and whether the individual is serving under a personal services contract or a non-personal services contract. If the contract does not require the individual to personally perform the services contracted for under the supervision and control of a government officer or official, the contract is a non-personal services contract. The individual does not have an employer-employee relationship with the government, but rather is a true independent contractor.[13] If, however, the contractor is selected or employed by a government officer acting within his or her official capacity and the contract does require the personal service of the contractor which is performed under the supervision and control of a government officer or official, the contract is a personal services contract and an employer-employee relationship is created. If such a relationship does exist, the individual is entitled to service credit for the periods of such contract service. <span class="Italic">See Jankovic v. U.S. supra; In re Sirri Kaltakji, supra; Brown v. OPM, supra; Federal Personnel Manual,</span> Supplement 831-1, Subchapter S3-3 (September 21, 1981). The creation of such a relationship does not, however, necessarily constitute an appointment to a covered position in the civil service or create a right to a retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">In re Sirri Kaltakji, supra.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;The determination of whether an individual is a true independent contractor engaged pursuant to a non-personal services contract is dependent upon the nature of the relationship created, not merely whether a document denotes an individual as an independent contractor. <span class="Italic">See, e.g, Lodge 1858, AFGE v. Webb,</span> 580 F.2d 196, 504, <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 439 U.S. 927 (1978); <span class="Italic">Jankovic v. U.S.,</span> 384 F.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, to be entitled to receive service credit for service pursuant to a special contract, the appellants must prove that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;he or she was engaged or employed on a full-time, defined part-time or other determinable basis pursuant to a contract by a government official who was authorized to enter into such a contract and was acting within his or her official capacity;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;such contract required the personal services of the appellants, who in rendering such service were subject to the direct supervision and control of a government official; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;the contract involved the performance of a federal function.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Proof of appointment to a position covered by the civil service system is not a required element of appellants' case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the evidence before us discloses that appellants have clearly established, by more than a preponderance of the evidence, that each was engaged or employed pursuant to a contract entered into by a government official acting in his authorized official capacity. Indeed, OPM and Navy specifically state that the individuals who executed the documents retaining appellants' services had the authority to enter into contracts for appellants' services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear beyond any reasonable dispute and we find that although some of appellants' contracts described appellants as independent contractors, appellants' personal services were required, that their performance and actions were under very tight control and that they did not perform their services independently. Accordingly, the appellants have shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, and we find that the contracts required appellants' personal services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the parties have stipulated that appellants were engaged in a federal function and supervised by a federal officer or official, it is clear and we conclude that appellants have established that their contract service with the unit is creditable service for retirement and other purposes. <span class="Italic">Jankovic v. U.S., supra; In re Sirri Kaltakji, supra, Brown v. OPM, supra,</span> and FPM Supplement 831-1, Subchapter S3-3 (September 21, 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM and Navy, in their joint response to the Board's order of August 15, 1983, assert, in substance, that recent case law indicates that to the extent that FPM Supplement 831-1, Subchapter S3-3c indicates that appellants would be entitled to service credit it is inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) and "the bulk of the evolving body of modern case law...." OPM and Navy also appear to be asserting that the provisions of FPM Supplement 831-1, Subchapter S3, are being reviewed for changes and that the provisions of S3-3(c) constitute a "former administrative interpretation" which is contrary to "the weight of judicial authority interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) itself." OPM and Navy misinterpret both the issue presented in the case and the authority upon which they rely. As noted above, the issue before the Board in this case is not whether the appellants were appointed to positions in the civil service but rather whether appellants are entitled to service credit for the varying periods during which they were contract employees of the Department of the Navy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "recent authorities" relied upon by OPM and Navy are inapposite. In both <span class="Italic">Hemphill v. Devine,</span> No. 79-2043, slip op. (D.D.C. November 3, 1982) and <span class="Italic">Curran, et al. v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 566 F. Supp. 1511 (D.D.C. 1983), the individuals were employed by the contractor pursuant to contracts between the Department of the Army and Georgetown University (<span class="Italic">Curran</span>) or the Department of the Air Force and Philco Corporation (<span class="Italic">Hemphill</span>). Each of the organizations that entered into contracts with the government to provide services was a corporation which existed for reasons other than performance contract services, conducted non-governmental business, and was controlled by individuals who were not government employees. Furthermore, as indicated by the court in <span class="Italic">Hemphill, supra,</span> at 6, the plaintiff in that action did not offer any evidence that his removal from the federal function would have resulted in the termination of his employment with Philco Corporation, the employing entity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In both of those instances, the employing organization, Georgetown University or Philco Corporation, had the ultimate authority to decide whether to terminate the individual's employment. In this case it is undisputed that the ultimate authority with regard to all employment decisions was with an active duty naval officer who was clearly a federal employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that OPM and Navy's allegation that the provisions of FPM Supplement 831-1, Subchapter S3-3(c) are merely a "former administrative interpretation" is rather disingenuous. OPM has merely made a general allegation that this provision is currently under review. No specific information has been provided with regard to this alleged review and it is clear that this interpretation has not been rescinded. We also note that OPM and its predecessor, CSC, have consistently granted service credit for contract service for in excess of fifty years. For example, service credit was granted for service as Army contract surgeons prior to June 3, 1916, as well as for service as contract physicians with the Indian Service. In light of the length of duration of the "former administrative interpretation," it must be presumed that Congress was both fully aware of and approved of this administrative interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Red Lion Broadcasting Company v. F.C.C.,</span> 395 U.S. 367, 381 (1969); <span class="Italic">Zemel v. Rusk,</span> 381 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1965). OPM's somewhat ambiguous current disavowal of this longstanding administrative interpretation is simply not sufficient, in the absence of new legislation, to contradict the lengthy, consistent interpretation followed by both OPM and CSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is not, however, to say that such service constitutes covered Federal service or that each appellant is entitled to an annuity based upon such service. In order to receive service credit for their varying periods of employment with the unit, each appellant must establish that he or she was later appointed to a covered position and met the additional requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 833(b).[16] <span class="Italic">In re Sirri Kaltakji, supra,</span> 1 MSPB at 62.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[16]&#x2003;We also note that the Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 831-1, Subchapter S3-3h provides that service under other contributory retirement systems for government employees may be credited toward annuity eligibility and computation of annuity under the civil service retirement system if certain conditions are met. Since appellants did not address this issue either before the CALJ or this Board, we express no opinion as to whether appellants' service would be creditable under this provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although our conclusion that appellants are entitled to service credit for the varying periods of time they were employed by the unit pursuant to special contract resolves the controlling issue in this case, we will, due to the importance of the issue, now turn to the contention by OPM and Navy that the CALJ erred in concluding that appellants were appointed to positions in the civil service. OPM and the Navy correctly point out that it is undisputed that the appellants clearly understood or should have understood that by accepting their positions with the unit they were not <span id="Page_4087"></span>appointed to "regular civil service" positions. Since appointment requires, at the very least, an intentional, unequivocal exercise of discretion by an appointing official to appoint an individual to a particular position, the CALJ erred in concluding that appellants were appointed to positions in the civil service. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan,</span> 663 F.2d 239, 246 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1981).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant filed a timely petition for appeal from the reconsideration decision of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) affirming its earlier denial of service credit for retirement purposes for appellant's employment as an Attending Physician by the Veterans Administration (VA), VA Hospital, Seattle, Washington, for the period from September 27, 1956 to June 30, 1961. The basis for OPM's decision was its determination that appellant was employed by the VA for the period of time in issue on a fee basis under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4114 (a)(1)(B), and, consequently, was not an "employee" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105 (a), whose service was creditable for civil service retirement purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Acosta v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 19 MSPR 101 at 107 (1984), the Board determined that all Federal service, with limited exceptions not applicable here, "is entitled to service credit for retirement and other purposes even though such service is not in a position which is covered by the civil service retirement system or other civil service laws, rules and regulations." In order to establish the existence of an employer-employee relationship entitling an appellant to receive service credit for personal services rendered pursuant to a special contract, an appellant must prove that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;he or she was engaged or employed on a full-time, defined part-time or other determinable basis pursuant to a contract by a government official who was authorized to enter into such a contract and was acting within his or her official capacity;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;such contract required the personal services of the...[appellant], who in rendering such service...[was] subject to the direct supervision and control of a government official; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;the contract involved the performance of a federal function.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Proof of appointment to a position covered by the civil service system is not a required element of...[appellant's] case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Acosta</span> at 108.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the record discloses that appellant was employed by the VA pursuant to a series of contracts limited to one year or less in duration and entered into by a VA official acting in his authorized official capacity. The contracts required the personal services of appellant at the VA Hospital in Seattle, and in rendering such services appellant was subject to the direct supervision and control of the hospital's chief of surgical services. The contracts involved appellant's attendance at the hospital, performance of surgery and consultation in the care of the hospital's patients. Therefore, the Board finds that appellant has established by a preponderance of the evidence that his personal contract service with the VA is creditable service for retirement purposes. <span class="Italic">See Acosta</span> at 109, 110.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not conclude, however, that appellant's creditable service also constitutes covered Federal service under the civil service retirement system, or that he is entitled to receive an annuity based on such service. In order to receive Federal service credit for the period of employment at issue, appellant must show that he was later appointed to a covered position and met the additional requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b). <span class="Italic">Acosta</span> at 110-11. Appellant's service at issue was under personal service contracts limited to one year or less in duration and, thus, he is excluded from retirement coverage for that service under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See In re Kaltakji,</span> 1 MSPB 59 (1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the Board finds that appellant, by accepting employment with the VA under personal service contracts for one year or less under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4114(a)(1), was not appointed in the civil service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a). "Since appointment requires, at the very least, an intentional, unequivocal exercise of discretion by an appointing official to appoint an individual to a particular position,"<span class="Italic">Acosta</span> at 111, we find that the presiding official did not err in concluding that appellant failed to show that he was appointed by an authorized Federal official to a position in the civil service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Acosta</span> did not fare well in the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687, 689-696 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. In 1968, the Department of the Navy formed a unit to perform intelligence functions. Because of its special requirements, such as nonattribution and ability to hire, fire, transfer and compensate personnel without regard to the civil services laws, the Navy created a personnel system distinct from, but similar in many respects to, the civil service system. The commanding officer of the organization was authorized to engage the services of individuals to carry out its mission. An elaborate system of recruiting and interviewing was established, and the final interview was conducted by a hiring board of three naval officers and two civilians which made recommendations to the commanding officer. Individuals were recruited through direct contact, third party referrals and disguised newspaper advertisements. Prospective candidates were not cognizant of the connection of the job with the government until advised by the hiring board after it had determined to recommend their hire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Individuals selected to participate in the program were required to enter into a contract for personal services with the Navy (designed a "career provisional contract" or "career contract") or with a proprietary corporation. Each proprietary corporation used was incorporated by the Navy, creates solely to provide cover and support for intelligence functions, funded with public funds and controlled by a Navy officer. When the contract was with the Navy, it was signed by a contracting officer, and by the commanding officer as contract approving officer. An official of the proprietary corporation signed the contracts on its behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Civil service documentation and other formalities in connection with the hiring were not utilized. The contracts, whether entered into with the Navy or its proprietary corporation, provided expressly that respondents were independent contractors. They provided for compensation on a regular basis and within-grade promotions, legislative pay adjustments and a post differential in substantial conformance with rules and regulations applicable to government appointed personnel. Other benefits covered by the contracts included living quarters allowances, annual and home leave, health benefits for the individual and dependents for illness or injury incurred in the line of duty while aboard, life insurance and a retirement plan. All benefits, such as health, life and dental insurance and retirement programs, were funded through the proprietary corporations and underwritten by private insurers. The salaries of respondents, which were subject to Social Security withholding taxes, were paid by the proprietary corporations with appropriated funds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After their selection, respondents were trained by other employees of the unit or at government training facilities, issued government identifications, official passports, and other documents. Those documents represented that respondents were federal employees but did not identify their true positions or functions. At all times active duty naval officers, or other unit employees under the supervision of naval officers, supervised respondents and determined their retention in or discharge from the unit. The Board found that the naval officers involved in the hiring process considered the respondents to be federal employees but did not believe they were "being appointed in the civil service" or were "regular civil service employees."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;In 1979, respondents filed claims with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) seeking service credit for retirement and other purposes in respect of their employment in the unit during various periods of time between 1968 and 1976. OPM, both in its initial decision and on reconsideration, denied the claims on the basis that respondents had not been appointed in the civil service.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;OPM did not dispute that respondents were performing a federal function or that they were supervised by federal employees during the time period at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal to the MSPB, the Chief Administrative Law Judge (CALJ) reversed OPM's denial of respondents' claims for service credit, concluding that respondents' contractual arrangement constituted an appointment in the civil service within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105 (1982). By final decision dated January 20, 1984, the Board affirmed on different grounds. It held that respondents had not been appointed in the civil service, but nevertheless found respondents to be entitled to service credit based on a provision of the Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 831-1, Subchapter S3-3 (September 21, 1981) (FPM Supplement) allowing contract service to be credited. OPM has petitioned this court for review of the MSPB decision under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d) (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;In March 1984, respondents submitted petitions for enforcement to the Board contending that OPM had failed to comply with the Board's final decision rendered January 20, 1984. The CALJ dismissed the respondents' petitions for enforcement in August 1984, finding that the documentation which OPM had prepared for inclusion in respondents' retirement records constituted sufficient evidence of full compliance with the Board's final decision. Upon petition for review to the full Board, this decision was affirmed. Respondents have cross-appealed on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;OPM asserts in this appeal that the Board erred in holding <span id="Page_4088"></span>respondents' contract service to be creditable for retirement and other purposes. It contends that the FPM Supplement relied on by the Board is contrary to and conflicts with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondents, on the other hand, argue that the FPM Supplement properly recognized contract service as creditable service and that, in any event, they were appointed in the civil service as that term is used in &#x00A7; 2105(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of our disposition of OPM's appeal, we need not consider the issue raised in the cross appeal of respondents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Section 8332 of Title 5, United States Code (1982), provides that service as an "employee" is creditable for CSRA purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;The total service of an <span class="Italic">employee</span>...is the full years and twelfth parts thereof, excluding from the aggregate the fractional part of a month, if any.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;The service of an <span class="Italic">employee</span> shall be credited from the date of original employment to the date of separation on which title to annuity is based in the civilian service of the Government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "employee" for this purpose is defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(1) (1982) by reference to &#x00A7; 2105(a) of Title 5, United States Code, which, in turn, has the following definition of employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this title, "employee," except as otherwise provided by this section or when specifically modified, means an officer and an individual who is--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;appointed in the civil service by one of the following [federal officials] acting in an official capacity--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;engaged in the performance of a Federal function under authority of law or an Executive act; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;subject to the supervision of an individual named by paragraph (1) of this subsection while engaged in the performance of the duties of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the criteria of &#x00A7; 2105 are applicable to one seeking to claim creditable service for retirement purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All three of these test elements must be met for an individual to be a federal employee. The elements have independent significance and are strictly applied. <span class="Italic">See McCarley v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 757 F.2d 278, 280 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Costner v. United States,</span> 665 F.2d 1016, 1020 (Ct. Cl. 1981); <span class="Italic">Baker v. United States,</span> 614 F.2d 263, 268 (Ct. Cl. 1980); <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan,</span> 663 F.2d 239, 246 (D.C. Cir. 1981). In this case, the parties have stipulated that each of the respondents was engaged in the performance of a federal function and was supervised by a federal official. We need only consider, therefore, whether respondents were "appointed in the civil service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the specific issue of appointment, the Board determined that the CALJ's initial decision had been erroneous:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">OPM and the Navy correctly point out that it is undisputed that the [respondents] clearly understood or should have understood that by accepting their positions with the unit they were not appointed to "regular civil service" positions....&#8197;Since appointment requires, at the very least, an intentional, unequivocal exercise of discretion by an appointing official to appoint an individual to a particular position, the CALJ erred in concluding that [respondents] were appointed to positions in the civil service. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan,</span> 663 F.2d 239, 246 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that an appointment is necessary for a person to hold a government position and be entitled to its benefits. This has been recognized on many occasions by the Supreme Court which, in <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan,</span> 424 U.S. 392, 402 (1976), for example, stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The established rule is that one is not entitled to the benefit of a [government] position until he has been duly appointed to it. <span class="Italic">United States v. McLean,</span> 95 U.S. 750, 24 L. Ed. 579 (1878); <span class="Italic">Ganse v. United States,</span> 370 F.2d 900, 902, 180 Ct. Cl. 183, 186 (1967).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After thoroughly reviewing the relevant authorities, the Court of Claims summarized the requirement as meaning "an individual cannot hold a government position as an officer or employee, nor receive the salary and other benefits pertaining thereto, until he or she has been appointed to that position by a person authorized to make the appointment." <span class="Italic">Baker v. United States,</span> 614 F.2d at 268.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties differ as to the appointment requirement primarily on what actions are necessary to effectuate appointment. Respondents take the position that the decision to "hire" them by an authorized official constituted an "act of appointment" and that the documentation was "window dressing." They also contend that law does not establish the type of appointive act which must be performed, that a contract is a sufficient appointive document for this purpose, and that the Navy had authority to obtain their services by contract. The government counters that appointment has quasi-constitutional significance requiring greater formality than the common law concept of employment and that an official with appointment authority must issue a writing which unconditionally appoints the individual to a position in the civil service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The precedents binding on this court have required that there be a significant degree of formality in the appointment process. In <span class="Italic">Baker,</span> 614 F.2d at 267-268, the Court of Claims set out the Constitutional and statutory foundations for government positions and appointments thereto, and reviewed the Supreme Court cases as well as its own decisions on the necessity of an appointment. The court, in <span class="Italic">Costner,</span> 665 F.2d at 1020, enunciated that the "totality of the circumstances" approach cannot be used to satisfy the statutory requirement, stating that "[a]n abundance of federal function and supervision will not make up for the lack of an appointment." Similarly, common law master-servant relationships do not control in determining federal employment where the statute expressly goes beyond the common law and requires more than just a supervisory relationship. In <span class="Italic">Costner,</span> it was aptly noted that the common law doctrine was to distinguish between an employee and an independent contractor, whereas the federal statute is to determine "not whether plaintiff <span class="Italic">was</span> an employee (he was) but <span class="Italic">whose</span> employee." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1021. Those cases, and the authorities on which they rely, evidence that definite, unconditional action by an authorized federal official designating an individual to a specific civil service position is necessary to fulfill the appointment requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a). In this connection, decisions in the Court of Claims not infrequently have turned on whether the SF 50 or 52 had been executed by an authorized government official. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Costner, supra; Skalafuris v. United States,</span> 683 F.2d 383 (Ct. Cl. 1982); <span class="Italic">Goutos v. United States,</span> 552 F.2d 922 (Ct. Cl. 1976). In fact, in <span class="Italic">Goutos,</span> the court noted that, under the facts of the case, execution of the form was the <span class="Italic">"sine qua non</span> of plaintiff's appointment." 552 F.2d at 924. <span class="Italic">See also Costner,</span> 665 F.2D at 1022.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondents argue that <span class="Italic">Marbury v. Madison,</span> 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803) teachers that such solemnities as the signature on a commission are only evidence of an appointment or of the validity of the instrument. From this they say that the "act of appointment" occurred in this case when the Navy commander made his final decision to hire respondents and that the documentation is unnecessary and mere "window dressing." In support, respondents also cite <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan, supra</span> (NTEU).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find these arguments to be persuasive nor the cases relied on to be helpful to respondents' position. Initially, we note that it is abundantly clear in <span class="Italic">Marbury v. Madison</span> that the formalities and solemnities of the appointive process for the office there involved were fully satisfied, <span class="Italic">viz.,</span> the President nominated, the Senate gave its advice and consent, the commission was signed by the President and the seal was affixed by the Secretary of State. 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 157. At issue was the failure to deliver the commission, which was not a requirement of appointment. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> there was a formality followed in the form of an unequivocal selection letter from, or with the knowledge of, an official having appointive authority, albeit the customary SF 50 or 52 was not employee as the government urged was required. Thus, the cases cited by respondents are not in conflict with decisions that require a formal writing, usually in the form of an executed SF 50 or 52, to effectuate a federal appointment. <span class="Italic">See Goutos v. United States, supra,</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More importantly, these cases, which are principally relied on by respondents, are not supportive of the position that respondents should be treated as appointed <span class="Italic">in the civil service.</span> In <span class="Italic">Marbury,</span> there was an identifiable government position involved requiring both Executive and Legislative Branch action. In <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> there was no question that the individuals who received letters of their selection for employment had been selected for civil service positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we discern no error on the part of the Board in holding that respondents were not appointed in the civil service. The Board's findings, supported by the underlying testimony and documentation, demonstrate the absence of the exercised of appointive authority to select respondents for civil service positions. It found that the contracts executed by respondents, whether entered into directly with the Navy or with a proprietary corporation, expressly stated that respondents were to be "independent contractors." Further, respondents' compensation and benefits, although designed to be comparable to civil service pay and benefits, were paid and funded outside the civil service system, which was obviously inconsistent with civil service status. Thus, private insurance contracts were used to provide health insurance and retirement programs. Social security taxes were withheld from salary. There was also an absence of the usual indicia of civil service status, such as an executed SF 50 or 52 as an appointive document, and a general practice of not administering an oath of office. These findings are strong indications of nonappointment to federal government positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must conclude, as did the Board based on the substantial evidence before it, that respondents were not appointed in the civil service <span id="Page_4089"></span>within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) (1982). Neither the act of the commanding officer in authorizing the engagement of their services nor the execution of agreements by the parties, whether taken separately or together, are sufficiently definitive and unequivocal to constitute an act of appointment to a civil service position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Although finding respondents were not appointed as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) (1982), the full Board nevertheless determined they were entitled to receive service credit for their varying periods of service with the unit. In reaching its decision, reliance was placed primarily on the language of the FPM Supplement, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> note 4. The Board set out the following standard, which is similar to that contained in the FPM Supplement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Thus to be entitled to receive service credit for service pursuant to a special contract, the [respondents] must prove that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;he or she was engaged on a full-time, defined part-time or other determinable basis pursuant to a contract by a government official who was authorized to enter into such a contract and was acting within his or her official capacity;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;such contract required the personal services of [respondents] ....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">___</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">14.&#x2003;The burden of proof in such cases is on the applicant or the [respondents] . [Citations omitted.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Concomitantly, the Board expressly rejected the statutory appointment concept, stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Proof of appointment to a position covered by the civil service system is not a required element of [respondents'] case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that its standard for creditable CSRA service (and the FPM Supplement provision) was satisfied by respondents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To justify this position on contract service in the face of the statutory appointment requirement, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) (1982), the Board first noted that two civil service rulings granted service credit are cited in Appendix C of the FPM Supplement. It drew from them the conclusion that contract service had been regarded by OPM and its predecessor, the Civil Service Commission, as creditable for more than fifty years. These rulings, however, support neither this broad generalization by the Board nor the contract service provisions of the FPM Supplement. If anything, they tend to be contrary to the proposition for which they are cited. The rulings deal with contract surgeons and both indicate clearly that appointment authority had been formally exercised. In one, service credit was granted to contract surgeons when they were by statute brought into the military in 1916. National Defense Act of June 3, 1916, Ch. 134, &#x00A7; 10, 39 Stat. 166. Moreover, statutory authorization existed prior to that time for the Surgeon General of the Army to <span class="Italic">appoint</span> contract surgeons in emergencies. Act of May 12, 1898, Ch. 296, &#x00A7; 2, 30 Stat. 406. The other ruling involved contract surgeons employed by the Department of the Interior for the Indian Health Service who, as noted in the FPM Supplement reference, had also received <span class="Italic">letters of appointment.</span> FPM Supp. 831-1, App. C, n.15. It is apparent in each of these situations there was more than a mere contract relationship involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also presumes that Congress was "fully aware of and approved of" the recognition of contract service in the FPM Supplement when it enacted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) (1982). According to the Board, Congress had this knowledge because of the "length of duration" [sic] of the administrative interpretation, apparently referring to the above-mentioned rulings. It cites <span class="Italic">Red Lion Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission,</span> 395 U.S. 367, 381 (1969), and <span class="Italic">Zemel v. Rusk,</span> 381 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1965), in support.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondents, in seeking to buttress the Board's decision, argue that the FPM Supplement provision should be accorded the status of a regulation because it is part of the Federal Personnel Manual. They point to a description of the Manual as the "official" medium for issuing the "personnel regulations and instructions, policy statements and related material on Government-wide personnel programs, to other agencies."<span class="Italic">See NTEU,</span> 663 F.2d at 243. They argue that the agency's administrative interpretation is entitled to great deference and that this is particularly so under what respondents characterize as the "informed inaction" standard, citing the <span class="Italic">Zemel</span> and <span class="Italic">Red Lion Broadcasting Co.</span> cases. By informed inaction, respondents apparently mean that an existing administration interpretation has remained unchanged through successive reenactments of the underlying statute. Intervenor, the MSPB, argues similarly on the deference to be accorded the FPM Supplement provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find these arguments unpersuasive and the cases relied on inapposite. Both cases involved administrative interpretations that were unchanged, i.e., not dealt with, by subsequently enacted legislation in the particular area. Here, the Congress spoke specifically by enacting a provision expressly covering the matter at issue. If defined employee for purposes of the CSRA in a manner which is inconsistent with the FPM Supplement language on contract service. Thus, even if the FPM Supplement were accorded regulation status, it has been made obsolete by the enactment of the statutory definition of employee. And the broad decision of the Board that appointment is not a required element of respondents' case cannot withstand the express appointment requirement of the statutory definition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Intervenor makes an entirely independent argument in support of the substantive merits of its decision, which must be rejected. Intervenor alleges that there was a version of the FPM Supplement issued on September 1, 1963 which corresponded substantially to the 1981 FPM Supplement provision on contract service and that when Congress enacted Section 2105(a) in 1966, it intended to incorporate the definition contained in the 1963 document. The basis for this assertion is a statement in S. Rep. No. 1380, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 47 (1966) reading:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Subsection (a) is supplied to avoid the necessity of defining "employee" each time it appears in this title. The subsection is based on a definition worked out independently by the Civil Service Commission and the Department of Labor and in use by both for more than a decade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the Intervenor, this is sufficient to conclude that Congress intended to recognize "service rendered under special contract" and did not intend the appointment requirement of &#x00A7; 2105(a) to be literally construed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The argument is totally flawed. There is no indication anywhere in the legislative history that the 1963 document's definition was taken into account or for that matter known to anyone working on the legislation. Moreover, the legislative language defining employee is in direct conflict with the 1963 document's treatment of contract service. Finally, the definition of employee prescribed in &#x00A7; 2105(a), unless otherwise clearly indicated, applies for all purposes of Title 5, whereas the 1963 document definition relates only to a limited part of Title 5. To say that Congress, or the Civil Service Commission and the Department of Labor, in working out a statutory definition to be broadly used throughout Title 5 must have specifically focused on the narrow provision relating to contract service for retirement benefits is simply not credible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statement in the Senate Report, quoted above, is at most ambiguous and it is well that we be concerned about reading too much into a detail of this type in legislative history. As expressed in the concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Herschey v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,</span> 777 F.2d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Scalia, J. concurring):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I frankly doubt that it is ever reasonable to assume that the details, as opposed to the broad outlines of purpose, set forth in a committee report come to the attention of, much less are approved by, the house which enacts the committee bill. [Footnote omitted.] And I think it is time for the courts to become concerned about the fact that routine deference to the detail of committee reports, and the produced, predictable expansion in that detail which routine deference has produced, are converting a system of judicial construction into a system of committee-staff prescription.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the Board's express finding that respondents were not appointed in the civil service when they were engaged to work in the unit, and the substantial evidence to support that finding and the Board's erroneous conclusion that contract service, without appointment, is creditable for CSRA purposes, we must reverse the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After the Federal Circuit decision in <span class="Italic">Acosta,</span> the Board reopened <span class="Italic">Berard</span> and determined that the appellant was not entitled to service credit, <span class="Italic">Berard v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 679, 683-84 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's final decision in <span class="Italic">Acosta</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 101 [(1984)], was reversed by the court, <span class="Italic">Acosta,</span> 803 F.2d 687. The court held that, in order to be considered a Federal employee for retirement credit purposes, an individual must have been: (1) Appointed in the civil service by a Federal official acting in his official capacity; (2) engaged in the performance of a Federal function under authority of law or executive act; and (3) under the supervision of a named Federal official while engaged in the performance of the duties of his position. <span class="Italic">See Acosta,</span> 803 F.2d at 691-93.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have previously determined in this case that the appellant's employment with the VA under personal service contracts did not constitute an appointment in the civil service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a), because he failed to show that he was appointed by an authorized Federal official to a position in the civil service. <span class="Italic">See Berard [v. OPM]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">,</span> 20 M.S.P.R. 278[, 281 (1984)] . We reaffirm our previous determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Watts v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 814 F.2d 1576, 1579 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 108 S. Ct. 258 (1987), the court noted that in <span class="Italic">Acosta,</span> it had examined the indicia of appointment to determine whether an appellant was appointed in the Federal service. These include whether the appellant was paid through the civil service system, given an oath of office, asked to sign a Standard Form (SF) 50 or 52, or subject to social security withholding. The court concluded that absent these indicia or a clear and unequivocal document of appointment, there was no appointment to the civil service within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a). <span id="Page_4090"></span><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1579-80. <span class="Italic">See also Hazlett v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 604, 607-08 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the evidence does not indicate that there was an appointment for the years in question. The record does not indicate that the appellant was given an oath of office or contain an SF-50 or SF-52 documenting his appointment for the years in question. The agreements confirming his employment with the VA, dated September 27, 1956, June 28, 1957, June 30, 1958, June 29, 1959, and June 30, 1960, provided that he would be compensated at a specified lump-sum fee for each period of service rendered. The agreements did not provide that he was paid through the civil service system. The agreements also stated that his pay was not subject to either Social Security withholding or civil service retirement deductions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, because there is no evidence of a clear and unequivocal appointment of the appellant in the civil service by a Federal official acting in his official capacity, and in the absence of other indicia of appointment for the years in question, he is not entitled to have his employment with the VA classified as creditable service for civil service retirement purposes. <span class="Italic">See Watts,</span> 814 F.2d at 1579-81; <span class="Italic">Acosta,</span> 803 F.2d at 691-93; <span class="Italic">Costner v. United States,</span> 665 F.2d 1016, 1019-23 (Ct. Cl. 1981); <span class="Italic">Price v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 159, 161-62 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Recognizing the effect of the Federal Circuit reversal in <span class="Italic">Acosta,</span> <span class="Italic">Price v. OPM,</span> 32 MSPR 159, 159-62 (1987), declined to award service credit for an individual who was a fruit and vegetable inspector that USDA apparently had intended to appoint to the civil service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, a former employee of the United States Department of Agriculture, requested the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") to make a service credit determination with respect to service that appellant had performed as a Fruit and Vegetable Inspector between September 1, 1950 and June 12, 1955. OPM notified appellant on September 12, 1983, that his service between September 1, 1950 and June 12, 1955 was not creditable for civil service retirement purposes because he had not been appointed to a federal position by a federal officer. On March 3, 1984, OPM sustained this decision upon reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant filed a timely petition for appeal with the Washington Regional Office of the Merit Systems Protection Board. The administrative judge sustained OPM's determination in an initial decision dated June 25, 1984. The administrative judge found that although appellant met two of the three requirements necessary to have the status of a federal employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a), he did not meet the third. Specifically, the administrative judge found that while appellant was engaged in the performance of a federal function and was subject to the supervision of an individual appointed to the federal service, he had not been appointed to a position in the civil service by a federal officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge relied upon the decision of the Court of Claims in <span class="Italic">Baker v. United States,</span> 614 F.2d 263 (Ct. Cl. 1980), for the proposition that an individual in a federal-state cooperative program must have been appointed by a federal officer to be entitled to federal retirement credit. She also cited <span class="Italic">Costner v. United States Postal Service,</span> 665 F.2d 1016 (Ct. Cl. 1981), for the propositions that an appellant must meet all three elements of Section 2105(a) in order to establish civil service employee status, and that "an abundance of federal functions and federal supervision" will not make up for the lack of federal appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant relied heavily upon the decision of the Board in <span class="Italic">Acosta v. Office of Personnel Management and Department of the Navy</span> 19 MSPR 101 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Acosta,</span> the Board held that, with respect to certain periods of employment with a federal government agency, a number of individuals were entitled to service credit for retirement purposes, even though they had not been appointed to positions in the civil service. We stated there that "[p]roof of appointment to a position covered by the civil service system is not a required element of appellant's case."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 8, 1986, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit expressly reversed that specific holding in <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta,</span> 803 F.2d 687 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In that decision, the court stated that it was "well established that an appointment is necessary for a person to hold a government position and be entitled to its benefits," and cited with approval the <span class="Italic">Baker</span> and <span class="Italic">Costner</span> Court of Claims decisions, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> relied on by the administrative judge. The appellant's reliance on our <span class="Italic">Acosta</span> decision, then, is of no avail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Much of the appellant's petition for review reiterated the evidence previously advanced which indicated that the appellant was almost exclusively under federal supervision and that nearly all of his functions were federal rather than state. The appellant also referred to evidence that the Department of Agriculture originally intended to appoint the Fruit and Vegetable Inspectors to the civil service, but was deterred from doing so by the objections of the personnel office, which pointed to substantial logistical difficulties if the Inspectors were given Civil Service status. As an alternative means of using the service of the Inspectors, the Department of Agriculture decided to issue licenses to them. The appellant argued that the licensing procedure along with the requirement of yearly renewal was the equivalent of an appointment and should be regarded as such.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit, however, found no error in that portion of our <span class="Italic">Acosta</span> decision ruling that "appointment requires, at the very least, an intentional unequivocal exercise of discretion by an official to appoint an individual to a particular position...."<span class="Italic">Acosta, supra. See Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687 (Fed. Cir. 1986)<span class="Italic">.</span> Similarly, the court in <span class="Italic">Skalafuris v. United States,</span> 683 F.2d 383, 386 (Ct. Cl. 1982), emphasized that appointment was a single discrete act, and that successive acts could not be regarded as the equivalent of an appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since an appointment to the federal service was the prerequisite for the appellant's service as a Fruit and Vegetable Inspector being accepted as creditable service, and, since the appellant was not appointed to a position in the federal civil service, we find that the administrative judge did not err in concluding that the appellant was not entitled to have his employment from September 1, 1950 through June 12, 1955, classified as creditable service for civil service retirement purposes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The degree of control over a contractor employee, to provide service credit for that employee, was also explored in <span class="Italic">Werley v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 361, 363-66 (1984) (rev'd as a result of <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">Werley v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 686 (1989), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision dated July 22, 1983, the presiding official sustained OPM's denial of service credit, finding that (1) appellant was employed by Air International, Inc. (AI) as a pilot to perform duties under a contract between AI and the Department of Commerce's Research Flight Facility (agency), which operated aircraft to conduct weather-related research; (2) each flight crew was composed of individuals hired directly into the Federal government and those employed under the contract between AI and Research Flight Facility; (3) appellant was engaged in the performance of a Federal function and was subject to the supervision of a Federal official; (4) the contract was not between appellant and the agency, but between AI and the agency. The presiding official concluded that no Federal appointment could be implied as a result of the contract between the agency and AI and that appellant, therefore, was not entitled to retirement credit for this period of service. Appellant has now filed a petition for review of the presiding official's initial decision. In his petition, appellant contends that the presiding official erroneously interpreted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a)(1) defining "employee." Specifically, appellant states that an individual who performs services for the government under a personal services contract has been appointed to the Federal service and is entitled to service credit. The Board hereby GRANTS the petition for review under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1) for the reasons set forth below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that appellant, a pilot, was employed pursuant to a contract between AI and the agency from March 1965 through June 1969, in which AI had responsibility for the care, operation and crewing of agency aircraft, while the agency assumed the task of planning flight missions and its objectives. For two years prior to 1965, appellant worked for American Air Motive, which had a similar contract with the agency, also as a pilot on weather research flights for the agency. With regard to the changeover to AI in 1965, appellant testified that he did not complete an employment application, was not interviewed, he did not receive supervision from AI, he was merely informed by the Chief of the Research Flight Facility that there was a new contract with AI, and that he was still working for the agency. Further, appellant testified he had no discussion with AI regarding his salary, benefits, or his job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of the award of the contract in 1965, all personnel employed by the previous contractor were hired as a group by AI, which informally agreed with the agency not to hire or fire any of these individuals without specific recommendation and approval of the agency. Mr. Mason, the chief or director of the flight facility had sole control of hiring and firing, and supervisory responsibility along with agency operation officers and flight directors. In addition Mason testified that he interviewed appellant, and only notified AI of his selection and to put appellant on the payroll.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, Mason set the pay for flight crew members modeled after Civil Service standards for applicable grades, and had a verbal agreement with appellant on the amount of his entitlement to vacation and sick leave similar to that of formal Federal employees. Further, flight crew members were reimbursed by government check for travel expenses, paid for overtime under policy applicable to Federal employees, issued government drivers licenses, and authorized to drive General Services Administration vehicles. In addition, Mason testified that he did not differentiate between contractor or government employees who served as flight crew members.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The basic issue in this case is whether the employment situation of appellant, as outlined above, created a relationship between the agency and the appellant tantamount to that of employer-employee. If appellant is entitled to service credit, the Board must find that appellant performed <span id="Page_4091"></span>strictly personal services under the contract between AI, which ostensibly paid him, and the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A personal service agreement has been defined as an agreement between "[p]ersons authorized to be and who are employed under an instrument designated as a 'contract' and who perform their work under the supervision and control of Government officers...." 23 Comp. Gen. 425, 429 (1943). A nonpersonal service contract is one which does not require the individual personally to perform. <span class="Italic">Id. See also Brown v. OPM,</span> 8 MSPB 471 (1981). The differentiating factor between an "employee" and an independent contractor, i.e., a personal service from a nonpersonal service contract, is the "degree of control and supervision" involved. <span class="Italic">See Lodge 1958, AFGE v. Webb,</span> 580 F.2d 496, 504 (D.C. Cir. 1978), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 439 U.S. 927. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 44 Comp. Gen. 761 (1965) (proof of a personal service contract requires that the government provide detailed instructions and close supervision). Moreover, current Office of Personnel Management instructions and guidance on creditable service state:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Service rendered under special contract may usually be credited if the contract contemplates full-time or specified part-time personal service of the person obligated by the contract under the daily supervision and control of a Federal official, or if the periods of actual service made of record are computable. However, a contractor engaged for special and single transactions, even though paid from appropriated funds, is not considered to be a Federal employee. Neither is a person who enters into a contract for furnishing a particular item, such as a report or plan which does not necessarily require the individual's personal services. Service under a contract under which an organization other than the Federal Government has the power to terminate the service is not Federal employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal Personnel Manual Suppl. 831-1, S3(c). (September 21, 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a recent Board decision, <span class="Italic">Acosta v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 19 MSPR 101 at 107-08 (1984), the Board held that to be entitled to receive service credit for service pursuant to a special contract, as here, the individual must prove that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;he or she was engaged or employed on a full-time, defined part-time or other determinable basis pursuant to a contract by a government official who was authorized to enter into such a contract and was acting within his or her official capacity;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;such contract required the personal services of the appellants, who in rendering such service were subject to the direct supervision and control of a government official; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;the contract involved the performance of a Federal function.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, proof of appointment to a position covered by the civil service is not a required element. <span class="Italic">Id. Cf. Costner v. United States,</span> 665 F.2d 1016 1020 (Ct. Cl. 1981) (federal employment does not exist in the absence of a formal appointment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the sole and extensive degree of supervision exercised by the agency over appellant, the agency's control and regulation of hiring and firing, job tenure, pay and benefits, the particular duties performed by appellant for the agency, and the unique circumstances under which they were performed and accomplished while on federal flight missions, the Board finds that the agency, through usage and implementation under the contract, specifically required appellant's personal services, and that an employer-employee relationship was established since the "ultimate authority with regard to all employment decisions" was with the chief of the research flight facility, a federal employee. <span class="Italic">Acosta</span> at 13. Therefore, appellant's service is creditable service for retirement and other purposes. FPM Suppl. 831-1, S3-3.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following the Federal Circuit decision in <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687 (Fed. Cir. 1986), in <span class="Italic">Werley v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 686, 690 (1989), the Board reversed its earlier position, and determined he was not entitled to retirement service credit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the evidence does not indicate that there was an appointment for the years in question. The record does not indicate that the appellant was given an oath of office or contain an SF-50 or SF-52 documenting his appointment for the years in question. The only SF-50 of record documents his appointment effective July 1, 1969, but it does not cover the period in question. The appellant did not present any evidence showing that he was paid through the civil service system, and there is no evidence in the record showing whether he was subject to Social Security withholding during the years in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, because there is no evidence of a clear and unequivocal appointment of the appellant in the civil service by a Federal official acting in his official capacity, and in the absence of other indicia of appointment for the years in question, he is not entitled to have his employment under contract between his employing company and the Department of Commerce, even if the contract was ultra vires as he contends, classified as creditable service for civil service retirement purposes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 539, 544 (1993) (foreign national employed by the Army in Germany, who later became a citizen and received a civil service appointment, requested service credit for the time she worked prior to the civil service appointment: "The appellant bases her alleged entitlement to retirement service credit on her assertion that she was a direct-hire employee of the Army, and not an indirect-hire employee as found by OPM and the administrative judge. We find, however, that although the appellant presented evidence below that suggested that she was employed by the Army under a contract subject to the terms of an agreement between the German Federal Government and German trade unions, she has not shown by preponderant evidence that an authorized appointing officer took an action with the awareness that he was appointing her to a position in the United States civil service. The fact that the appellant may have been employed by the Army under such a contract does not necessarily imply that she was also appointed to a position in the United States civil service. <span class="Italic">See Watts,</span> 814 F.2d at 1581.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A statute that permitted service credit for defined personal services contracts if applications were submitted by January 8, 1990, established a deadline that could not be waived when OPM provided general notice of the provision in the FPM and Federal Register. No specific notice to individuals potentially affected by the statute was required by law. The Board lacked the authority to waive the deadline. <span class="Italic">Fox v. OPM</span>, 50 MSPR 602, 606 (1991) (discussing 5 USC 1103(b)(2)(A), concerning requirements that OPM post rules or regulations in federal agencies); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Finch v. OPM</span>, 53 MSPR 408, 411-12 (1992) (although the legislative history of the service credit statute criticized OPM's past practice of providing an inconsistent interpretation of the rules governing personal service contract retirement credit, that did not provide a basis for holding OPM to a stricter notice standard than that of 5 USC 1103(b)(2)(A), leading to issuance of a Federal Personnel Manual bulletin, even though the appellant's installation did not receive the bulletin in time to assist appellant).</p>
