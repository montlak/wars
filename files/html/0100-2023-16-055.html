<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-54"><span class="space">16.</span> Unreasonable Standard</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Discussed earlier was the Federal Circuit decision, <span class="Italic">Guillebeau v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 362 F.3d 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2004), discerning nothing inherently unlawful about absolute standards and requiring the Board to conduct a more searching review of standards to assess whether they were unreasonable--a circumstantial, rather than absolute determination. Despite the Federal Circuit's repudiation of the Board's rejection of absolute performance standards, the law that developed concerning absolute standards before <span class="Italic">Guillebeau</span> helps to assess the more complex determination of what makes a standard unreasonable and invalid as a performance determinant under Chapter 43.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A standard was not absolute if it set a very small number of permissible errors, although the standard may be determined to be unreasonable because it was not reasonable to expect that the employee can meet the standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hober v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 129, 131 (1994) (as a general principle that "an employee cannot be removed based on a performance standard that requires him to achieve an unreasonably high level of performance"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Maathur v. Dept. of Army</span>, 868 F.2d 1277 (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP) (performance standard was not absolute when it allowed for one error during a period of three months). Although a standard was not defined in terms of a single error, establishment of a standard that was unduly strict constituted an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DOD</span>, 95 MSPR 123, 125-26, 128-29 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 15-16 (2003) (considering standards governing the amount and number of permissible variances in a store checker's daily cash accountings; the standard was not unreasonably strict and the agency did not apply the standard in an unreasonably strict manner), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DOD</span>, 117 Fed. Appx. 722 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Russi v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 585, 590-91 (1989) (agency failed to prove that comparably situated employees were able to meet the error rate assigned in the appellant's standards); <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 28 MSPR 227, 231 (1985) (a standard for an accounting clerk requiring 99.5% efficiency was unreasonable). [<span class="Italic">Walker</span> is discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-16-024.html#sec9-23">Change in Standard</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Standards allowing but a few errors passed Board scrutiny, but with little analysis of their legitimacy, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0432-13-4620-I-1 (NP 9/8/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the performance standards applicable to critical duty #1 required the appellant to: "accurately prepare[&#8197;] documents in accordance with regulations and policies in the appropriate format"; "normally review[&#8197;] all correspondence thoroughly to ensure correct grammar, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation"; and "routinely finalize[&#8197;] [documents] in a timely manner, meeting prescribed suspense dates or established deadlines." In the March 25, 2013 notice of unacceptable performance, S.P. notified the appellant of the following specific minimum requirements she must meet during the PIP period to perform at a satisfactory level in critical duty #1: complete an "immediate update" of telephone and birthday rosters and monthly updates thereafter; accurately update staff meeting slides prior to every staff meeting with "no more than 2 situations where these items will not be completed"; "review and proofread all correspondence" and ensure that "correspondence handled during this opportunity period...must have no more than 3 errors"; and review and route received documents within 48 hours, return any document reviewed by S.P. within 24 hours, and, in the event of any issues, seek assistance to "ensure no missed deadlines."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board has overturned actions that were based on standards requiring inordinately high rates of accuracy, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Blain v. Veterans Administration</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 322, 325 (1988) (finding that a 99.91% accuracy rate was unreasonable and thus invalid), this is not such a case. Requiring the appellant to update staff meeting slides prior to staff meetings on all but two occasions during the PIP period is reasonable on its face, and the appellant has failed to provide any explanation or evidence to suggest that this requirement was unreasonable or unattainable. Regarding the error limitation on correspondence, substantial evidence shows that the appellant was not held strictly to any particular error rate.[4] Her supervisor and the deciding official ultimately determined that the appellant's performance in critical duty #1 was unacceptable, not because she made over three grammatical, spelling, capitalization, or punctuation errors on correspondence during the PIP period, but because of pervasive inaccuracies and errors in her work product throughout the PIP period, among other deficiencies.[5] Furthermore, the deciding official testified that, while the number of documents with errors was a factor in his consideration, he imposed the removal due mainly to the appellant's failure to demonstrate any improvement during the PIP period. Thus, we find that the requirements to achieve a satisfactory performance rating in critical duty #1 were reasonable and attainable, and we discern no basis to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the performance standards were valid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The three-error limit set forth in S.P.'s specific requirements under critical duty #1 is vague as to whether the appellant was allowed three errors per document or three errors total during the PIP period. We need not resolve this issue, however, as the appellant was not strictly held to either standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The proposal notice cites 14 documents produced by the appellant containing at least 1 error, as well as 5 occasions when she failed to accurately update the meeting slides before the meeting, 2 occasions when she failed to update the birthday roster as requested, 1 instance when she failed to forward information until 2 hours before the suspense time, and 1 occasion when she failed to catch an error on 4 time cards she forwarded to S.P. for his signature before the meeting, 2 occasions when she failed to update the birthday roster as requested, 1 instance when she failed to forward information until 2 hours before the suspense time, and 1 occasion when she failed to catch an error on 4 time cards she forwarded to S.P. for his signature.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A standard permitting very few errors was legitimately applied to assess only errors reasonably considered to be significant, <span class="Italic">Novitsky v. DOJ,</span> 429 Fed. Appx. 977, 979-80 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Novitsky's primary argument is that a one error per month standard is unreasonable, and that the arbitrator's application of this standard was arbitrary and capricious. If the nature of the error standard were based solely on the quantity of errors, it might well be that the standard would have been unreasonably strict. However, the arbitrator here clearly construed the word "error" to mean "sufficiently substantial" errors. In finding that Novitsky could be "removed from service for committing three errors over 90 days," the arbitrator "assum[ed] [that] the errors at issue were sufficiently substantial." The arbitrator did not err in interpreting the standard to require a finding that the error be substantial, nor did he err in finding that many of Novitsky's errors were, in fact, quite significant and resulted in the mishandling of prisoners and a substantial financial loss to the agency. With respect to each error, the arbitrator made a specific determination that the error was substantial enough to justify removal, finding that nine of the errors were substantial and seven were not. The arbitrator did not err in finding that there were sufficient grounds to discharge the petitioner.</p>

Dept. of Navy</span>, 89 MSPR 188, 192 &#x00B6; 9 (2001) (standards interpreted to encompass "relatively significant errors having at least potentially serious effects on the value of the appellant's work").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 82 MSPR 186, 193-94 &#x00B6; 16 (1999), elaborated on how the Board views numerical standards that are challenged as unreasonable. The numbers must be placed in context:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that an employee cannot be removed based on a performance standard that requires the employee to achieve an unreasonably high level of performance<span class="Italic">. Hober v. Department of the Army</span>, 64 MSPR 129, 131 (1994); <span class="Italic">see Blain v. Veterans Administration</span>, 36 MSPR 322, 325 (1988) (a standard that required a file clerk to achieve a 99.91% accuracy rate was unreasonable and thus invalid); <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 28 MSPR 227, 229 (1985) (performance standards must be reasonable, realistic, and attainable). The performance standards involved in this case are not unreasonably high on their face. For example, the fully successful level of performance for processing traumatic injury cases was to adjudicate 80% to 95% within 45 days of receipt. By its very nature, however, the achievability of a timeliness standard such as this depends on how many cases there are to be processed within a given period. While processing 85% of traumatic injury cases within 45 days of receipt might be reasonable and attainable if one receives a small number of such cases within a two-month period, and if one does not have an unusually high number of other types of cases to process, that standard might be unreasonable and unattainable if one receives a multiple of that amount within the same period, or if the demands of other duties severely impinge on the time available for handling traumatic injury cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was entitled to try to establish that her performance standards were not reasonably achievable during the PIP for these sorts of reasons....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Extremely high accuracy levels of typing for a secretary with a high volume of work were unreasonable, <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 91, 93-96 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the performance standard for the first critical element at issue--Time and Work Accomplishment Records--was not reasonable, sufficiently precise to permit an accurate measurement of the appellant's performance, or adequate to inform the appellant what was necessary to achieve a satisfactory rating. She noted that the standard required the appellant to prepare and review time and attendance cards, various reports, and various logs and make no more than four to eight errors and submit no more than one to two reports or time cards late per rating period. The administrative judge noted that it did not disclose the number of cards, reports, logs and other administrative reports the appellant was required to prepare and review, the duration of the rating period, or the error rate allowed for highly successful or minimally acceptable ratings. She found that assuming there were ten cards, reports and logs for each pay period for each of the eight employees in the appellant's section, the appellant conceivably had to prepare 2,080 of these documents a year. The administrative judge further found that the deficiencies in the performance standards had not been corrected by other instructions from the appellant's supervisor, Elmer Bley.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the performance standard for the second critical element at issue--Typing--was similarly defective. She noted that the performance standard for the critical element required the appellant to type between 130 and 200 one-page assignments per month and allowed the appellant to have no more than 24 to 36 errors per rating period. She found that the standard did not define what constituted an error, did not disclose the allowable error rate for highly successful or minimally acceptable performance, and did not identify the length of the rating period. She further found that these deficiencies were not cured by other instructions. She noted that during the nine and a half month period on which the appellant was rated, this standard translated to 1,235 to 1,900 assignments with only 24 to 36 errors allowed, or a required accuracy rate of 98%. She concluded, therefore, that the standard was not reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge further found that the agency did not provide the appellant with a reasonable opportunity to improve. She found that although Mr. Bley met with the appellant once a week during all but two weeks of the performance improvement plan period, during these meetings he continually criticized the appellant's performance and offered her little or no encouragement or assistance. She also noted that Mr. Bley required the appellant to type and retype his summaries of these meetings. She further found that the record did not show that Mr. Bley took into consideration an explanation offered by the appellant for the low number of completed typing assignments during one period. In addition, she noted that Mr. Bley denied the appellant's request for overtime to catch up on her filing and typing. She concluded that Mr. Bley determined in advance that the appellant would fail and therefore that the appellant could have done nothing to correct her performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency asserts that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant's performance standards did not meet the requirements set forth in 5 USC Chapter 43, and that even if they did not, that any deficiencies in the standards were not cured by instructions provided the appellant during her performance improvement plan period. The agency, however, has failed to show error in, or even to address, the administrative judge's correct finding that the standards were invalid because they required near perfect performance to receive a satisfactory rating. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Walker v. Department of Treasury,</span> 28 MSPR 227 (1985). Moreover, the agency has not shown that this deficiency was cured by additional instructions provided during the performance improvement plan period. Although it points out that the administrative judge found that Mr. Bley reduced the number of the appellant's monthly typing assignments during the performance improvement plan period, the record shows that even if he did, these assignments were to be error-free. In addition, although the administrative judge found that the performance standard for the Time and Work Accomplishments Record critical element was less stringent during the performance improvement plan period, we do not find that the change was sufficient to render it reasonable because the appellant still was allowed only one error per month.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The volume of work was also compared to the margin of error permitted by performance standards for a GS-4 Office Automation Clerk, <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 88 MSPR 435, 441-42 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that although the appellant's remaining standards are not absolute, they are invalid because they are unreasonable. When the Board reviews an agency's performance standard, it must determine whether, under the circumstances of the case, the standard accords with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) and the guidelines set forth by the Office of Personnel Management. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 28 MSPR 227, 229 (1985). These sources require the agency to establish standards which, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate appraisal of performance based on objective criteria, and which are reasonable, realistic, attainable and clearly stated in writing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the remaining standards concern correspondence and reports prepared by the appellant and all personal contact she has with patients. The standard for correspondence and written reports provides that an unacceptable rating is achieved if there are more than two occasions of records not prepared accurately and timely, or with more than two spelling errors. The standards also provide that more than one valid customer services complaint during a rating period achieves an unacceptable rating. They do not set forth, however, set performance levels based on the number of contacts that the appellant has with patients during a rating period. For example, the appellant asserted below that, during her 60-day PIP, which started on June 29, 1999, she made approximately 512 appointments, there were approximately 1451 appointments in the clinic during her scheduled hours, she helped 256 walk-ins to the clinic, and she handled roughly 312 telephone consults. The agency did not dispute the appellant's assertion regarding the number of appointments, contacts, and consults that occurred, but merely provided general testimony stating that the appellant's workload was never such that it could not have been done by one person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the AJ relied on agency testimony in finding that the appellant's performance standards were reasonable, he failed to address the appellant's assertions concerning the numerous contacts that her position required, and to make credibility determinations in this regard. We find that, based on the undisputed number of personal contacts the duties of her position demands, requiring performance with not more than two mistakes during a rating period, as required by the remaining standards, was not reasonable. <span class="Italic">Cf. Walker,</span> 28 MSPR at 229 (an accounting clerk's performance standard which involved screening, logging, and distributing correspondence and which allowed an error rate of approximately .5 percent was so strict that it constituted an abuse of discretion). We note that the agency argues in its response to the PFR that the appellant's data is invalid and that her calculations mistakenly assume that she scheduled all of the appointments during that period. However, the agency has provided no evidence to support its assertion. Therefore, because the appellant's position required two or less errors in a position where the duties and personal contacts were numerous, we find that the performance standards are unreasonable and invalid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, if it finds that a performance standard is invalid, it will not rewrite the standard to achieve reasonable results. Instead, the agency action will be reversed and the appellant's performance will not be considered. <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, 28 MSPR at 230-31; <span class="Italic">Callaway</span>, 28 MSPR at 601.</p>
