<p class="Body-Text">AJs are charged with ensuring that appellants are made aware of timeliness problems and that they are informed of how to respond to those problems. "Where an appellant's petition for appeal appears to be untimely filed, he should be told what the timeliness issue is and what he must show to establish either that his appeal is timely, or that there is good cause for waiving the time limit." <span class="Italic">Holmes v. DOJ</span>, 92 MSPR 377, 379 &#x00B6; 5 (2002); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Terrance v. OPM</span>, 94 MSPR 77, 80 &#x00B6; 6 (2003) (acknowledgment order instructed the appellant to show good cause for a delayed filing, but the order did not state when the appeal appeared to have been filed).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mahony v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 432, 434 (1987), listed the AJ's failings on a timeliness issue:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge's order closing the record was not sufficient to apprise the appellant that there was a threshold jurisdictional issue concerning the timeliness of his petition for appeal. Further, the order failed to apprise the appellant that he could show good cause for the untimely filing of his petition for appeal, and that the Board could waive the twenty-day time limitation for good cause shown. Finally, it did not give appellant adequate notice how to respond. Therefore, we find that appellant was not sufficiently apprised that he must show good cause for the untimely filing of his petition for review, and request a waiver of the Board's regulatory time limitation for filing a petition for appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The elements of law and proof that an AJ should explain in a show cause order challenging the timeliness of an appeal were summarized, <span class="Italic">Cordero v. VA</span>, AT-0752-13-0986-I-1 (NP 3/28/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to dismissing an appeal for untimeliness, the administrative judge must clearly inform the appellant of his burden of proof, provide the dates on which the administrative judge intends to rely in support of a dismissal, and explain that failure to establish timeliness may result in dismissal. <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 75 F.3d 639, 646-47 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Drake v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 367, &#x00B6; 5 (2004); <span class="Italic">see Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (noting, among other errors in a jurisdictional order, that it failed to make plain that the production of factual evidence on the jurisdiction issue was necessary to obtain a hearing). The timeliness order advised the appellant of his burden to prove timeliness or good cause for the delay. However, the order failed to include the dates that the administrative judge intended to rely on in support of a dismissal. Further, it did not advise the appellant that his appeal might be dismissed, stating only that the record on timeliness would close by the deadline set forth in the order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge's failure to provide an appellant with proper notice can be cured if other pleadings or the initial decision puts the appellant on notice of what he must do to establish timeliness, thus affording him the opportunity to meet his burden in the petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Easterling v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 11 (2008) (failure to provide proper jurisdictional notice can be cured if sufficient information is contained in the agency's pleadings or the initial decision). <span id="Page_923"></span>Here, the deficiency was cured by the initial decision and the agency's motion to dismiss. Despite receiving the relevant information, the appellant has not challenged the finding that his appeal was untimely in his petition for review. Therefore, we conclude that his appeal was untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cordero</span> added, as to a medical justification offer for an untimely appeal, that the AJ must explain how the appellant demonstrates the existence of the condition and its relation to the delay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will find good cause for waiver of its filing time limits where a party demonstrates that a medical condition affected his ability to file on time. <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 434, 437 (1998). To establish that an untimely filing was the result of a medical condition, the party must: (1) identify the time period during which he suffered from the illness; (2) submit evidence showing that he suffered from the illness during the relevant time period; and (3) explain how the illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal or a request for an extension of time. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Medical evidence is preferable in supporting a claim of good cause for the delay. <span class="Italic">Jerusalem v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 660, &#x00B6; 7, <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Jerusalem v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 280 F. App'x 973 (Fed. Cir. 2008). However, supporting evidence is not limited to medical evidence alone if the appellant explains why medical evidence is unavailable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant included with his appeal a Family and Medical Leave Act certification, which indicated that he was hospitalized on January 20, 2012, for identified mental health conditions, that he remained incapacitated from work as of January 31, 2012 (the date the certification was completed), and that the end date for his incapacity was unknown. He subsequently submitted documents to support his appeal, which included numerous references to his medical condition, including notes from his health care providers during his hospitalization in January and February 2012. Also included was evidence that the appellant remained hospitalized until his arrest on February 9, 2012. The information he provided was sufficient to trigger an obligation on the part of the administrative judge to clarify whether a medical condition was the reason for the filing delay. <span class="Italic">Adams v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 541, &#x00B6; 15 (2005) (in light of the appellant's reference in her appeal to her mental health condition and its effects, the administrative judge should have provided specific notice of what was required to demonstrate that untimely filing was the result of illness). This is particularly true given the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant did not respond to the administrative judge's order regarding timeliness, we do not believe the lack of response ends this inquiry. Because of the lack of guidance in the order concerning what constitutes good cause for an untimely filing, the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, and the failure of the order to state that dismissal might result from a failure to respond, the appellant may have felt that response was either futile or unnecessary. <span class="Italic">See Brackins v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 535, 541-42 (1995) (remanding a case with a timeliness issue where the appellant's delay may have been caused by unclear language in a Board order). We note that, once his appeal was dismissed, the appellant did provide specific argument that he was unable to file his appeal timely due to his mental health condition. <span class="Italic">See Drake</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 367, &#x00B6; 6 (where the administrative judge's order on timeliness was insufficient, the Board considered evidence filed for the first time by the appellant with his petition for review). This response suggests that the appellant was not ignoring the administrative judge's order. However, the response does not provide specific information regarding how the appellant's condition prevented him from timely filing and does not include any supporting documentation. We find that, because the appellant was never specifically informed of the three criteria he was required to meet to establish good cause for waiver of the Board's time limits on the basis of his medical condition, he was denied a fair opportunity to address the timeliness issue. <span class="Italic">See Mechelli v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 283, &#x00B6; 9 (1998). Accordingly, the appeal is remanded to the administrative judge to provide the appellant with proper notice and a meaningful opportunity to file evidence and argument on the timeliness issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board sent <span class="Italic">Pierce v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 26, 28-30 (1993), back to the region after the AJ did not adequately advise the appellant of a timeliness problem and the necessity of a response. It was insufficient to invite a response from the appellant based on a generalized statement in an acknowledgment order that there might be a timeliness issue:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appeal appears to be untimely, the administrative judge has the responsibility of apprising the appellant of the timeliness issue and providing him with an opportunity to show good cause for the untimely filing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mahony v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 432, 434 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In relevant part, the administrative judge's October 27, 1992, Acknowledgment Order notified the appellant that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]f there is a question as to whether your appeal is timely filed or within the Board's jurisdiction, this Order gives you the opportunity to submit evidence to establish timeliness, good cause to waive the time limit, or jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Order does not specify that there was a question as to the timeliness of the appeal, we find that it did not provide the appellant with a fair opportunity to respond to the timeliness issue....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the initial decision, the administrative judge conducted a conference with the parties on November 30, 1992, and at that time informed the appellant of his burden of proof on the issues of timeliness and jurisdiction. The initial decision further states that the administrative judge directed the appellant during the conference to file evidence and argument on these issues within ten days of the conference. The evidence of record does not contain a tape recording or written summary of the November 30, 1992, conference call, nor is there record evidence of a show-cause order being issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record evidence, however, contains a tape recording of a telephone conversation between the administrative judge and Greg McDonald, who had been representing the appellant in this appeal. During the December 1992 call, the administrative judge stated his intention that the call be used to document the status of the appeal and serve as a memorandum of the November 30, 1992, conference call. During the December conversation with Mr. McDonald, the administrative judge stated that the November 30 conference was attended by the appellant, the agency representative, Pat Fortson, and McDonald. According to the administrative judge, the appellant indicated during the November 30 conference that he would designate Ms. Fortson as his new representative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was not a party to the December call, and McDonald explained during that call that he was no longer actively acting as the appellant's representative. We find that the tape recording of the December 1992 call between the administrative judge and a person who was no longer acting as the appellant's representative does not constitute proper record evidence of what was discussed during the November 30, 1992, conference and does not establish that the appellant was made aware of any show-cause order or notice to close the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, although the agency's motion to dismiss may have put the appellant on notice of the timeliness issue, we find that the filing of the motion, standing alone under the facts presented in this case, does not establish that the appellant was provided a fair opportunity to respond to the timeliness issue before the administrative judge dismissed the appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span>, e.g., <span class="Italic">Dotson</span>, 41 MSPR at 415 (in addition to the agency's notion to dismiss, to which the appellant responded, the record evidence showed that the parties discussed the timeliness issue in a conference call, and that the administrative judge issued a close-of-the-record notice giving the appellant a final opportunity to address the issue).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent record evidence to support his finding on the timeliness issue, the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to establish good cause for the untimely filing cannot be based on the appellant's noncompliance with a show-cause order that the administrative judge may have issued or on the appellant's noncompliance with an order or instruction that the administrative judge may have given him during the November 30, 1992, conference. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McGuire v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 48 MSPR 659, 664 (1991). Because the record evidence fails to establish that the administrative judge provided the appellant with a fair opportunity to respond to the timeliness issue, we remand this case to the Dallas Regional Office with instructions to give the appellant that opportunity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mahony</span>, 32 MSPR at 433-34.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ who raises a timeliness issue is supposed to identify the time period that the appellant must address to show timely filing or to explain away the untimely filing, <span class="Italic">Mohammed v. OPM</span>, 108 MSPR 609, 613 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 2008 MSPB 98 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's acknowledgment order informed the appellant that she has the burden of proof on the issue of timeliness and explained how the Board determines the deadline for filing an appeal. The acknowledgment order did not inform the appellant of the dates on which the administrative judge intended to rely in making the timeliness determination, however. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This was error because, before dismissing an appeal as untimely filed, an administrative judge must inform the parties of the dates on which he intends to rely to support the dismissal. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 75 F.3d 639, 646 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("before undertaking the draconian action of dismissing an appeal on a finding of untimeliness, the [administrative judge] must...inform the parties of the dates on which the [administrative judge] intends to rely to support the dismissal" since "[o]nly by knowing those dates before a final order is issued can an appellant make a meaningful response"); <span class="Italic">Searcy v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 598, &#x00B6; 8 (2005) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, under the particular circumstances of this appeal, the Board will consider the appellant's late-filed evidence and argument regarding the timeliness of her appeal of OPM's reconsideration decision. <span class="Italic">See Searcy</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 598, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Drake v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 367, &#x00B6; 6 (2004).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic"><span id="Page_924"></span>Hubbard v. MSPB</span>, 605 F.3d 1363, 1364-66 (Fed. Cir. 2010), explained that general notice of the burden of proof on timeliness was sufficient in a disability retirement appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following her resignation "[f]or health related reasons" as a secretary after more than twenty years of federal service, the appellant Linda S. Hubbard applied to OPM for disability retirement. OPM denied those benefits because Hubbard had "not established that [she had] a disabling medical condition that meets the criteria for entitlement to disability retirement benefits."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM denied Hubbard's request for reconsideration of that decision. It stated that "we have again concluded that documentation presented does not show that you meet the eligibility requirements specified under current law and regulation." OPM's letter to Hubbard informing her of its decision concluded with the following statement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You have the right to appeal this decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). If you wish to exercise this right, please note that an appeal must be filed within 30 calendar days after the date of this decision, or 30 days after receipt of this decision, whichever is later.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's letter to Hubbard was dated November 5, 2008. Her notice of appeal to the Board was dated March 5, 2009, and shows that the Board received it on that date. (She was then acting <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, but is represented by counsel in this appeal.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an order dated April 9, 2009, the Board's administrative judge stated that "the appeal may be untimely."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After noting the factual issues relating to the timeliness issue and describing the governing criteria, the order concluded as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Accordingly, the appellant shall file evidence and argument demonstrating that the appeal was timely filed or that good cause exists for the delay. OPM shall file any evidence in its possession relevant to the issue of timeliness. The parties' submissions shall be filed to be <span class="Italic">received</span> by <span class="Italic">April 20, 2009</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hubbard did not reply to that directive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By order dated April 24, 2009, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal. In his initial decision, which became final when Hubbard did not seek Board review of it, the administrative judge stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I issued an order requiring the appellant to demonstrate that the appeal was timely filed or show good cause for its untimeliness.... She did not file a response to the order. As the appeal appears to have been untimely, and she submitted no evidence demonstrating good cause for the delay, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a footnote, the administrative judge stated that he had "also ordered OPM to file any evidence in its possession relevant to the issue of timeliness," which it still had not done, but "[b]ecause the appellant herself [had] not attempted to demonstrate that the appeal should be considered timely filed, [did] not further pursue the matter with OPM."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hubbard contends that since the record does not show when she received OPM's order denying reconsideration, the administrative judge had no basis for ruling that her appeal was untimely. She relies upon <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 75 F.3d 639 (Fed. Cir. 1996), and <span class="Italic">Williams v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 144 (1997). In <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, this court reversed a Board decision dismissing an appeal as untimely because the administrative judge had failed to tell the employee that he "simply presumed the appealed decision was received by the employee five days after the date it bears." 75 F.3d at 646-47. In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the Board "adopt[ed]" "as standard procedure for all cases" this court's "statement[&#8197;] " in <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span> that "[b]efore dismissing an appeal, an administrative judge should inform an appellant of the date that a document triggering the running of the appeal period will be presumed to have been received, in the absence of direct evidence." 75 M.S.P.R. at 148.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, unlike <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, nothing in the record indicates or even suggests that, in determining the timeliness of the appeal, the administrative judge relied on any presumption that the employee received OPM's decision within a specified time of mailing. To the contrary, it appears that the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as untimely solely because "the appellant herself has not attempted to demonstrate that the appeal should be considered timely filed." As the administrative judge's order told Hubbard, "[t]he appellant has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, on the issue of timeliness. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(ii) (2008)."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's failure to inform the appellant of his "presumption" of five-day delivery was a critical factor in the <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span> decision. As this court there stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The AJ in this case had evidence only of the filing date, not the date of receipt which started the period running. Before dismissal, the AJ could and should have asked both parties for such evidence. Further the AJ must then inform the parties of the dates on which the AJ intends to rely to support the dismissal. Only by knowing those dates before a final order is issued can an appellant make a meaningful response by way of either challenging the dates or showing good cause for the period of delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">75 F.3d at 646. Here, as distinguished from <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span> and <span class="Italic">Williams</span> the administrative judge did not rely on any presumption, and therefore did not fail to inform Hubbard of the time frame upon which he would base his ruling whether the appeal was timely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, even if he had committed such an error, it was harmless. The administrative judge unequivocally instructed Hubbard to "file evidence and argument demonstrating that the appeal was timely filed or that good cause exists for the delay." Hubbard never responded to this order. Indeed, to this day she has not submitted any facts showing either that she filed within thirty days of receiving OPM's reconsideration decision or that there was good cause for her failure to do so. In the circumstances, the administrative judge could justifiably conclude that Hubbard could not factually support either such claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hubbard contends that the administrative judge's order did not give her sufficient time to prepare an adequate response. She did not seek additional time to respond, however, or after the administrative judge had dismissed her appeal, seek rehearing on the basis of facts showing either timely filing or a good cause for her filing delay. This case thus sharply contrasts with <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span> where, after the administrative judge had dismissed the appeal as untimely, Hamilton submitted evidence that her appeal was timely (which the Board refused to consider).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hubbard also contends that her medical problems precluded her from timely responding to the administrative judge's filing directive. This contention, however, appears undermined by the fact that, when shortly before that OPM initially rejected her disability retirement application and told her she could seek reconsideration within thirty days, she did so twenty days later. In any event, this contention should have been raised before the administrative judge, and not for the first time in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has pointed out: "A petitioner who ignores an order of the Administrative Judge does so at his or her peril." <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Hubbard's failure even to respond to the administrative judge's order directing her to "file evidence and argument demonstrating that the appeal was timely filed or that good cause exists for the delay" justified the administrative judge's conclusion that her appeal was untimely and should be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ does not provide the appellant sufficient direction on how to respond to a timeliness issue, the dismissal will not be reversed for the AJ's error if the appellant obtains the necessary information on how to respond through the agency's motion to dismiss, <span class="Italic">Melendez v. DHS</span>, 112 MSPR 51, 55 &#x00B6; 9, 2009 MSPB 138 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the lack of an order addressing the timeliness issue also means that the AJ did not fulfill his responsibility to inform the appellant of his burden to show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence in filing his appeal so as to establish good cause for a waiver of the filing time limit, the Board has held that an AJ's failure to provide an appellant with proper notice regarding an issue can be cured if the agency's pleadings contained the proper notice or if the initial decision itself puts the appellant on notice of what he must do to address the issue, thus affording him with the opportunity to meet his burden regarding the issue in a petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Easterling v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 11 (2008); <span class="Italic">Mapstone v. Department of the Interior</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 691, &#x00B6; 9 (2007). We find that the agency's motion to dismiss and the initial decision placed the appellant on notice of his burden regarding the timeliness issue such that he was able to address that issue in his petition for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If neither the AJ nor an agency motion put the appellant on notice of the burden of proof as to the timeliness of an appeal, the Board may excuse the error if the initial decision provides the analysis and the appellant can address the issue through a petition for review, <span class="Italic">Fraser v. Dept. of Commerce,</span> DC-0752-14-0425-I-1 n.2 (NP 2/9/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we agree with the appellant that the administrative judge erred by not providing notice of his burden to prove timeliness or good cause for untimeliness, we find that the administrative judge corrected this error by providing sufficient notice in the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 75 F.3d 639, 645-47 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (holding that, before dismissing an appeal as untimely, an administrative judge must provide the appellant with notice of the timeliness issue and an opportunity to respond); <span class="Italic">Easterling v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 11 (2008) (failure to provide proper jurisdictional notice can be cured if sufficient information is contained in the agency's pleadings or the initial decision).</p>

Merit Systems <span id="Page_925"></span>Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985). However, an AJ's failure to provide an appellant with proper <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> notice can be cured if the agency's pleadings contain the notice that was lacking in the acknowledgment order or the ID puts the appellant on notice of what he must do to establish jurisdiction, thus affording him the opportunity to meet his jurisdictional burden in the PFR. <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 6 (2007).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. VA</span>, SF-0752-16-0332-I-1 (NP 12/16/2016) ("To the extent that the appellant is arguing on review that he did not receive notice of his burden to prove the timeliness of his appeal below until May 25, 2016, we find that this alleged delay does not affect the outcome of his removal claim. The appellant was on notice of his burden to establish the timeliness of his appeal and the administrative judge's basis for dismissing his appeal when he filed his timely petition for review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Melendez v. Department of Homeland Securit</span>y, 112 M.S.P.R. 51, &#x00B6; 9 (2009) (finding that the agency's motion to dismiss and the initial decision cured the failure to notify the appellant of his burden on timeliness, and thus, he was afforded the opportunity to meet his burden on petition for review).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant is represented, the AJ should ensure that the representative is served with a show cause order on timeliness. If only the appellant, and not his counsel, is served with that order, the Board is inclined to excuse the appellant's failure to respond timely to the order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Channell v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 630, 632-33 (1997). If the appeal is timely but the appellant fails to respond to a show cause order, and the AJ then issues an initial decision dismissing the appeal, the Board will not penalize the appellant for not responding to the order. The Board will, on PFR, remand the case for adjudication. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor v. OPM</span>, 73 MSPR 142, 144 (1997) (single failure to respond to an order does not show the intent to abandon an appeal or bad faith in the prosecution of an appeal). If the appellant had a fair chance to respond to an AJ's show-cause order on timeliness, and if the record is complete with no disputed material facts on that issue, the Board will adjudicate the issue without a remand. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Masdea v.
