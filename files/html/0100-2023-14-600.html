<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-601"><span class="space">J.</span> RETIREMENT OPTIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">A union sought to bargain over the availability of incentive payments for those eligible for retirement based on a future transfer of employees. Two proposals were negotiable, and two were not, <span class="Italic">NAIL, Local 5 and DLA, Red River, Texarkana</span>, 67 FLRA 85, 86-92 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VSIP will be offered again to all NAIL bargaining[-]unit employees who were employed by DDRT in January 2011 who were previously offered a VSIP and who are currently employed by DDRT.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Proposal 1 affects the Agency's right to retain employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that Proposal 1 affects its right to retain employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. According to the Agency, it already has granted VSIP to a certain number of excess employees, and it needs all of its remaining employees in order to accomplish its mission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to retain employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) is "the right to establish policies or practices that encourage or discourage employees from remaining employed by an agency." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office</span>, 60 FLRA 839, 841 (2005) (quoting <span class="Italic">Local 1827</span>, 58 FLRA at 346) (internal quotation marks omitted). Proposal 1 requires the Agency to reoffer VSIP to all current bargaining-unit employees whom the Agency employed in January and to whom the Agency previously offered, but did not grant, VSIP. The offer of VSIP, a lump-sum payment to leave the Agency, discourages at least some employees from remaining employed by the Agency. <span class="Italic">See Local 1827</span>, 58 FLRA at 346. Accordingly, we find that Proposal 1 affects management's right to retain employees.<span class="Italic"> See id. </span>at 345-46 (finding that a proposal, which required the agency to "provide VERA authority with VSIP for positions targeted for outsourcing," affected management's right to retain employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Proposal 1 is not an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that Proposal 1 is an appropriate arrangement.&#x2003;The test for determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) is set out in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under that test, the Authority initially determines whether a proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 31. An arrangement must seek to mitigate adverse effects "flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. Proposals that address speculative or hypothetical concerns do not constitute arrangements. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2015</span>, 53 FLRA 967, 973 (1997). The alleged arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1687</span>, 52 FLRA 521, 523 (1996).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that Proposal 1 is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement.&#x2003;Because the Agency does not contest the Union's contention that Proposal 1 constitutes an arrangement, we find that the proposal is an arrangement. <span class="Italic">See </span>SOP at 8 (arguing merely that, even if the proposal constituted an arrangement, the proposal excessively interfered with management's right to retain employees by requiring it to rerun VSIP); <span class="Italic">NATCA, Local ZHU</span>, 65 FLRA 738, 740, 742 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Local ZHU</span>) (finding that, because the agency did not dispute that two proposals were arrangements, the proposals constituted arrangements).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to whether the arrangement is appropriate, the Agency argues that the proposal burdens its right to retain employees. In this regard, the Agency indicates that, while it initially offered VSIP to more than forty employees, it approved VSIP in January for only forty employees whose positions it determined to be excess. The Agency maintains that, as a result of its decision to approve VSIP for only forty employees, it retained those employees who "were offered...VSIP and elected to remain" employed or "were offered...VSIP, but did not have the seniority necessary" to qualify for VSIP. According to the Agency, the retained employees perform necessary functions. Moreover, the Agency contends that requiring it to offer such employees an incentive to terminate their employment would hamper its ability to retain those employees necessary to perform its core functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not identify any benefits in response to the above arguments.&#x2003;Rather, the Union merely asserts that the proposal does not "unduly interfere" with management's rights. Furthermore, while the Union claims that the Agency could hire additional employees if current employees accept a VSIP offer, the proposal would deprive the Agency of the services of employees who perform specialized work necessary to accomplish the Agency's mission until it could hire new employees, <span class="Italic">see </span>SOP at 8 (arguing that the Agency's remaining employees perform functions necessary to accomplish its mission). The Union also cites <span class="Italic">Local 1827</span>, in which the Authority held that a proposal requiring the agency to offer VSIP to certain employees constituted an appropriate arrangement. Response at 4-5 (citing <span class="Italic">Local 1827</span>, 58 FLRA at 344). But, unlike the union in that case, the Union here has not demonstrated how the burden on the Agency is outweighed by any benefits to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Weighing the burdens placed on the Agency against the absence of demonstrated benefits to employees, we find that Proposal 1 excessively interferes with the Agency's right to retain employees.<span class="Italic"> </span>Accordingly, we conclude that Proposal 1 is not an appropriate arrangement and, therefore, is not within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See Fed. Union of Scientists &#x0026; Eng'rs</span>, 22 FLRA 731, 734 (1986) (finding that, because a proposal excessively interfered with management's right to retain employees, it was not an appropriate arrangement and, thus, was outside the duty to bargain).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Proposal 2 is an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standards for assessing whether a proposal affects management's <span id="page_1062"></span>right to retain employees and whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement are set forth above. For purposes of this decision, we assume, without deciding, that Proposal 2 affects management's right to retain employees and, for the following reasons, conclude that the proposal is within the duty to bargain as an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 65 FLRA 142, 145 (2010) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>) (assuming, without deciding, that the proposal affected a management right because the proposal was an appropriate arrangement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that Proposal 2 is "no different" than a proposal--establishing the order for approving VSIPs--found negotiable as an appropriate arrangement in <span class="Italic">Local 1827</span>. By contrast, the Agency does not contest that Proposal 2 is an appropriate arrangement. Instead, the Agency relies solely on the arguments it made with regard to Proposal 1. Specifically, the Agency contends that, by requiring the Agency to reoffer VSIP to employees who previously were offered, but not approved for, VSIP, the proposal violates the Agency's right to retain employees. However, as the Union correctly argues, the proposal does not require the Agency to offer employees VSIP, but, rather, provides a means to determine which employees should receive VSIP if the number of applications for VSIP exceeds the number of slots authorized for VSIP. Thus, the Agency's contention is misplaced. Further, as noted above, the Agency does not dispute the Union's assertion that Proposal 2 constitutes an appropriate arrangement. Section 2424.32(c)(ii)(2) of the Authority's Regulations provides that a party's "[f]ailure to respond to an argument or assertion raised by the other party will, where appropriate, be deemed a concession to such argument or assertion." Therefore, because the Agency does not respond to or dispute the Union's assertion, based upon Authority precedent, that Proposal 2 constitutes an appropriate arrangement, we find that the proposal is an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Proposal 2 is not inconsistent with an Agency regulation for which there is a compelling need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency maintains that Proposal 2 is inconsistent with the Instruction, an Agency regulation, for which there is a compelling need. In order to show that a proposal is outside the duty to bargain because it conflicts with an agency regulation for which there is a compelling need, an agency must: (1) identify a specific agency-wide or primary-national-subdivision-wide regulation; (2) show that there is a conflict between its regulation and the proposal; and (3) demonstrate that its regulation is supported by a compelling need with reference to the Authority's standards set forth in &#x00A7; 2424.50 of its Regulations. <span class="Italic">E.g., Prof'l Airways Sys. Specialists</span>, 64 FLRA 474, 479 (2010) (<span class="Italic">PASS</span>); <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R4-1</span>, 56 FLRA 214, 215 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first requirement, there is no dispute that the Instruction is an Agency regulation. Similarly, with respect to the second requirement, there is no dispute that the regulation and the proposal conflict.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, with regard to the third requirement, the Agency does not address the criteria for determining compelling need under &#x00A7; 2424.50 of the Authority's Regulations. <span class="Italic">See PASS</span>, 64 FLRA at 479 (taking into account the fact that the agency did not address the criteria for determining compelling need under &#x00A7; 2424.50 in finding that the agency failed to establish that a proposal was contrary to an agency regulation for which there was a compelling need). Because the Agency does not address such criteria, the Agency has failed to show that there is a compelling need for the Instruction. <span class="Italic">See U.S. DOD, Office of Dependents Sch.</span>,40 FLRA 425, 443 (1991) (considering the fact that the agency failed to identify the Authority's compelling need criteria on which it relied and left for the Authority to guess how many of the arguments that the agency made related to any or all of those criteria in finding that the agency failed to establish a compelling need for its regulation);<span class="Italic"> cf. Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Mont. Air Chapter No. 29</span>, 56 FLRA 674, 676 (2000) (concluding that the agency failed to establish a compelling need for its regulation, which based retention standing during a RIF primarily on performance ratings rather than length of service, because, in part, the agency did not assert that its more senior employees were less skilled or that they had received, or were more likely to receive, lower performance appraisals than more junior employees). Consequently, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that Proposal 2 is inconsistent with an Agency regulation for which there is a compelling need.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;Further, the Agency contends that, although the proposal provides priority consideration for VSIP in accordance with RIF regulations, 5 C.F.R. Part 351, the "proposal would contravene the necessary purpose of [those] regulation[s] by...encouraging the departure of employees with higher performance ratings" and by resulting in the retention of employees with lower performance ratings. To the extent the Agency argues that the proposal conflicts with 5 C.F.R. Part 351, we reject the Agency's argument because the proposal does not concern how the Agency retains employees during a RIF. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1923</span>,31 FLRA 789, 790 (1988) (finding that the agency failed to demonstrate that the proposal conflicted with a government-wide regulation because the regulation was inapplicable); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Meat Grading Council of Locals</span>,22 FLRA 496, 498 (1986) (same).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusion: Proposal 4 concerns the conditions of employment of employees who are represented by another union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that Proposal 4 is nonnegotiable because it concerns the conditions of employment of employees who are represented by another union in a different agency.&#x2003;Proposals that directly determine the conditions of employment of employees who are represented by another union are outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-109</span>, 61 FLRA 593, 597 (2006) (<span class="Italic">NAGE</span>) (citation omitted).

FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 1434, 1442 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>) (emphasis added). Applying <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, the Authority has agreed that "[a]n agency is not required under the Statute to bargain with one exclusive representative about conditions of employment in a unit represented by another union because such a requirement would run afoul of the principle of exclusive recognition." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of HUD Locals 222</span>, 54 FLRA 1267, 1276 n.11 (1998) (Member Wassermen dissenting as to other matters) (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion &#x0026; Repair, Newport News, Va.</span>, 65 FLRA 1052, 1054 (2011) (citations omitted), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom</span>.,<span class="Italic"> NAIL v.

<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 4 requires the Agency to offer VSIP to employees who were transferred to the Army.&#x2003;The Union does not dispute the Agency's <span id="page_1063"></span>assertion that these employees are represented by the National Federation of Federal Employees rather than the Union. Proposal 4, therefore, directly determines the conditions of employment of employees who are represented by another union. Proposal 4, therefore, directly determines the conditions of employment of employees who are represented by another union. Because such proposals are outside the duty to bargain, we find that Proposal 4 is similarly outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NAGE</span>, 61 FLRA at 597 (citation omitted) (finding several proposals were outside the duty to bargain because they determined conditions of employment for employees who were represented by another union).</p>

The proposals were appropriate arrangements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority follows the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87, </span>21 FLRA 24 (1986) <span class="Italic">(KANG). </span>Under this analysis, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 31; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dept of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA, </span>960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse<span class="Italic">. See KANG, </span>21 FLRA at 31. The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R1-100</span>, 39 FLRA 762, 766 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the proposal is determined to be an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right(s). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">KANG, </span>21 FLRA at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that management's decision to contract out can have "significant adverse effects on unit employees," as it can result in, among other things, employees being assigned to new duties or being laid off. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2077, </span>43 FLRA 344, 366 (1991); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 405, </span>42 FLRA 1112, 1117 (1991). The Authority has also found that an agency's decision to transfer a function "has serious repercussions for employees whose positions are affected[.]" <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 43 FLRA 1442, 1460 (1992), <span class="Italic">remanded as to other matters, NTEU v. FLRA, </span>30 F.3d 1510 (D.C. Cir. 1994). In a similar vein, the Authority has held that suffering involuntary removal from employment and a corresponding loss of the compensation and benefits that employment provides has a severe and negative impact on any employee. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Defense, Fort</span> <span class="Italic">Bragg Dependents Sch., Fort Bragg, N.C., </span>49 FLRA 333, 352 (1994) <span class="Italic">(Fort Bragg).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency does not anticipate that the exercise of its right to contract out will result in the Agency conducting a RIF, it is undisputed that it will result in employees' functions and positions being eliminated within the Agency. The Agency explains that those employees whose functions and positions are eliminated may either go to work for NJVC or take another position performing different duties within the Agency. With regard to the former option, it is not disputed that, in order to take a position with NJVC, employees would have to terminate their employment with the Agency. With regard to the latter, even though the employee would remain employed with the Agency, it is not disputed that the employee would be displaced from his or her current duties and functions and would be required to perform new duties. Under either option, it is undisputed that employees whose functions and positions are eliminated would be involuntarily displaced from their current positions, suffering adverse affects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that VSIPs compensate employees for the adverse effects of a RIF, and because the Agency does not intend to conduct a RIF, there is no adverse effect on employees. However, contrary to the Agency's claims, the fact that employees may have other employment offers within the Agency or with NJVC does not eliminate the direct and immediate result of the Agency's decision to contract out, which is that employees will lose their current positions. The fact that the employees' positions are eliminated as a result of contracting out, rather than a RIF, does not undermine a finding that employees are adversely affected.[5] Accordingly, consistent with <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local</span> <span class="Italic">2077, NFFE, Local 405, and NTEU, </span>we find that the decision to contract out and the elimination of employees' positions and functions has an adverse effect on employees covered by the proposals. In addition, we find that because, by their terms, the proposals at issue here would provide VSIPs only to those individuals whose functions and positions had been eliminated as a result of the Agency's decision to contract out, the proposals are sufficiently tailored.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;In this connection, we note that in determining whether a proposal is negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the adverse effect need not flow from the management right that a given proposal affects. <span class="Italic">See Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #1F, </span>57 FLRA 373, 381 (2001). Accordingly, although we have found that Proposals 1-1 and 1-4 do not affect management's rights to lay off employees or make determinations with respect to contracting out, that does not preclude a finding that the proposals are intended to address the adverse effects of the Agency's decision to contract out and to eliminate particular positions and functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to whether the proposals are appropriate, as explained by the Union, the benefit of offering VSIPs to employees adversely affected by the decision to contract out is significant. It is clear, in this regard, that providing employees with a lump-sum payment to voluntarily leave the Agency is a substantial financial benefit to employees whose positions have been eliminated. In addition to providing a direct benefit to individual employees whose positions have been eliminated, the proposals offer a meaningful benefit to all employees whose functions and positions the Agency has determined will be contacted out. In particular, by encouraging employees whose jobs have been eliminated to leave the Agency, the possibility of the Agency conducting a RIF may be diminished and the likelihood increases that employees who stay within the Agency will be reassigned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that under the proposals, the Agency would be likely to lose skilled employees and its cost of contracting out would increase. However, this claim is undercut by the fact that the Agency has already eliminated the functions and positions of the employees covered by the proposals. In addition, under the proposals, the Agency retains the ability to take additional steps or institute any policies or programs to encourage particular employees to remain Agency employees. Further, while it is reasonable that offering VSIPs will increase the Agency's costs associated with contracting out, the Agency has not indicated how significant that increase is likely to be. In this regard, there is nothing requiring the Agency to offer a particular number of VSIPs, and there is nothing indicating how many employees could in fact be eligible for VSIPs if offered by the Agency. Moreover, the Agency does not address the costs associated with a RIF if it is unable to adequately voluntarily reduce its workforce.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Weighing the significant benefit to employees whose positions were eliminated against the marginal limitation on management's right to retain employees and the possible cost to the Agency, we find that Proposal 1-1 and 1-4 do not excessively interfere with management's right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A).</p>
