<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-121"><span class="space">c.</span> Summary Judgment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A summary judgment motion requests a favorable decision on part or all of the appellant's appeal prior to the Board hearing. The motion is based on the <span id="Page_1409"></span>record as it stands at the time the motion is filed; the motion may supplement the existing record. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Board regulations do not specifically permit or preclude summary judgment motions. Because the appellant has a statutory right to a hearing, as a practical matter, an agency is precluded from using summary judgment to obtain a favorable decision without going through the hearing. <span class="Italic">Crawford v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 416, 423 (1996) ("An appellant's right to a hearing in a Board appeal, including his right to present evidence on any discrimination claim, is of cardinal importance, and is not contingent on his showing that there is a genuine issue of material facts."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Copeland v. Community Services Admin.</span>, 6 MSPR 280, 282-83, 6 MSPB 239 (1981) (proposal in an adverse action does not constitute evidence for purposes of a decision on the merits). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Simmons</span>, 90 MSPR 83, 86-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2001) (noting the use of a summary adjudication in the Hatch Act case). Summary judgment may be used in a complaint against an ALJ, reviewed under standards of the Administrative Procedure Act. [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-164.html#sec6-163">Administrative Law Judges</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">From 2006 through 2015, there was one exception to the preclusion of summary judgment against an appellant. In <span class="Italic">Redd v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/REDD_FREDERICK_B_PH_0752_05_0162_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249848.pdf">101 MSPR 182</a>, 2006 MSPB 32 (2006), the Board overruled precedent, deciding that summary judgment may be used to dismiss, before hearing, EEO affirmative defenses that do not present a genuine issue of disputed material fact. <span class="Italic">Redd</span> was overruled by <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SAVAGE_TOMMIE_G_AT_0752_11_0634_I_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1217635.pdf">122 MSPR 612</a>, 2015 MSPB 51 (2015), eliminating the use of summary judgment as to EEO affirmative defenses in appeals within the Board's appellate jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Savage</span> essentially concluded that EEO defenses are part of civil service appeals under the Reform Act, and that statute (as informed by its legislative history) precludes the use of summary judgment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Redd</span> was the product of the Board's intent to harmonize MSPB practice with that of EEOC, whose judges routinely adjudicate cases through summary judgment procedures, 101 MSPR at 185-90 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-15:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We interpret the appellant's argument on review to be that the AJ's disallowance of his sole witness in support of his race discrimination claim amounted to a denial of his right to attempt to prove discrimination at a hearing. In <span class="Italic">Currier v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 177, 182 (1998), the Board held that when an appellant who claims discrimination has requested an evidentiary hearing, the AJ may not find against the appellant on the discrimination claim without holding such a hearing. For the following reasons, we overrule <span class="Italic">Currier</span> and hold that an appellant does not have an unconditional right to an evidentiary hearing on discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The<span class="Italic"> Currier</span> decision is based primarily on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), which provides that when an individual who has been affected by an appealable action claims before the Board that the action was based on unlawful discrimination, the Board "shall...decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;] 7701." Section 7701(a)(1) provides that an appellant has "the right to a hearing." In <span class="Italic">Currier</span>, the Board observed that section 7702 "does not distinguish between frivolous and nonfrivolous allegations or between facts sufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and facts insufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination." 79 M.S.P.R. at 180 (citation omitted). Based on this, coupled with a statement in the legislative history of section 7702 describing the merits of the appealable action and the discrimination claim as "two sides of the same question which must be considered together," the Board concluded that an appellant who claims discrimination must be allowed to present evidence in support of his claim at a hearing when one is requested. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The shortcoming in this reasoning is that an appellant does not always have relevant, admissible evidence on a disputed fact to present at a hearing. This case is such an example, at least based on the record developed thus far. In assessing the sufficiency of a discrimination claim that is based on circumstantial evidence,[3] the first step is to determine whether the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination; if a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established, the burden of going forward shifts to the party that took the action under challenge to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action; and if the party that took the action articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, it will prevail unless the individual claiming discrimination can show that this reason was merely a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Poole v. Department of Defense</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 456, &#x00B6; 4 (2001) (relying on<span class="Italic"> St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks,</span> 509 U.S. 502 (1993), and<span class="Italic"> McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973)). To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under this framework, the individual must show that he is a member of a protected group, he was similarly situated to an individual not a member of that group, and he was treated more harshly than the other individual. <span class="Italic">Buckler v. Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 476 (1997).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;"Direct evidence" is a written or oral statement or policy that "both reflect[s] directly the alleged discriminatory attitude and bear[s] directly on the contested employment decision." <span class="Italic">George v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 71, 80 (1997) (citations omitted). The appellant in the present case does not claim to have such evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The step-wise analysis described above should not be employed when both parties have had a full opportunity to present all their evidence on discrimination at a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 714-15 (1983); <span class="Italic">Beam v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 49, 55 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleges that white employee M.K. was AWOL for an extended period and that the agency offered him a last chance agreement under which he would not be removed if he successfully completed treatment for alcoholism. In the present case, it is undisputed that the appellant was AWOL for over two months, during which time he was "getting high." The appellant claims that the agency committed disparate treatment race discrimination by removing him instead of offering him a last chance agreement. While evidence of the terms under which an agency and another employee settled litigation before a neutral body may not be relied upon to support a disparate treatment claim, an appellant may attempt to show disparate treatment with evidence that the agency is willing to negotiate, at the agency level, less severe discipline for members of some groups than members of other groups who have committed similar misconduct and are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See Spahn v. Department of Justice</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 195, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-24 &#x0026; n.7 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On this record, the appellant has not made out a prima face case of discrimination, as he has not proffered evidence that, if credited, would show that he and M.K. worked in the same unit for the same supervisors, that their most recent misconduct and past disciplinary records were comparable, and that they were otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wentz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 176, &#x00B6; 22 (2002); <span class="Italic">Parker v. Department of the Navy</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 343, 350 (1991). Assuming for the moment that the appellant had a full and fair opportunity to develop the record on his disparate treatment claim--below we address his argument that he did not--that claim would fail, and an evidentiary hearing would serve no purpose. There are few things more basic to the employer-employee relationship than the employee's duty to report to work as scheduled or to justify his absence. Here the appellant did neither, for months, and he has a history of attendance-related discipline. Based on the record developed thus far, a reasonable factfinder could not infer that the appellant's removal for AWOL was a pretext for race discrimination; taking the appellant's allegations as true, a factfinder could not conclude that the appellant is similarly situated to M.K.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not only did the <span class="Italic">Currier</span> decision fail to recognize that in some cases the appellant will have no relevant, admissible evidence on a disputed fact to present at a hearing, but it also did not acknowledge that an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) AJ is expressly authorized to render a decision without an evidentiary hearing when the "material facts" are not "in genuine dispute." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(g). This standard mirrors the standard for summary judgment employed in federal court, <span class="Italic">see</span> Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56, and indeed, a discrimination claim in federal court may be disposed of by summary judgment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lawton v. State Mutual Life Assurance Co.,</span> 101 F.3d 218 (1st Cir. 1996);<span class="Italic"> Adams v. West Publishing Co.</span>, 25 F.3d 635 (8th Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Kizer v. Children's Learning Center</span>, 962 F.2d 608 (7th Cir. 1992). The <span class="Italic">Currier</span> decision simply did not explain why the Board should be prohibited from disposing of a discrimination claim without an evidentiary hearing when the EEOC and federal courts are permitted to do so. Furthermore, <span class="Italic">Currier</span> did not explain why Congress would have intended that an evidentiary hearing be held when the AJ could not reasonably find that the agency committed discrimination. We do not believe that Congress so intended. <span class="Italic">Cf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.</span>, 530 U.S. 133, 148 (2000) (a trial court should not treat discrimination differently "from other ultimate questions of fact").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also absent from the <span class="Italic">Currier</span> decision is a discussion of the longstanding doctrine that an AJ has broad discretion to exclude witnesses where the proffered testimony is not shown to be material and non-repetitious. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fulton v. Department of the Army</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 79, &#x00B6; 11 (2003); <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of Defense</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 426, &#x00B6; 7 (2001). When an AJ correctly exercises this discretion to disallow all of the appellant's proposed witnesses, under a literal application of <span class="Italic">Currier</span> the AJ would still be obligated to hold an evidentiary hearing on discrimination. This means that the AJ would have to permit some token amount of irrelevant or repetitious testimony before sustaining an objection and disallowing further testimony, making the hearing an empty ritual. In at least one case, the Board treated the AJ's refusal to engage in this futile ceremony as "error," but declined to remand the case for an evidentiary hearing because the appellant was not prejudiced. <span class="Italic">See Steck v. Department of the Interior</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 105 (1999). The better approach would have been to say that the AJ did not commit error in the first place, as the Board concluded that, under the undisputed facts of that case, the agency could not have committed discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As additional support for the holding in <span class="Italic">Currier</span>, the Board relied on <span class="Italic">Crispin v. Department of Commerce</span>, 732 F.2d 919, 922 (Fed. Cir. 1984), where the Federal Circuit held that the Board may not render "summary judgment." <span id="Page_1410"></span><span class="Italic">See</span> 79 M.S.P.R. at 181. Given that the Federal Circuit has no authority to review the Board's findings on the <span class="Italic">substance</span> of a discrimination claim, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Army</span>, 715 F.2d 1485 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), a fortiori the <span class="Italic">Crispin</span> decision is not an authoritative source for the <span class="Italic">procedures</span> the Board must follow in adjudicating discrimination claims. It is also worth noting that although the Board suggested in <span class="Italic">Currier</span> that the EEOC disfavored Board resolution of a discrimination claim without a hearing, <span class="Italic">see</span> 79 M.S.P.R. at 181-82, <span class="Italic">Currier</span> did not cite a single EEOC decision holding that the Board must consider irrelevant testimony or convene an evidentiary hearing to address undisputed facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, notwithstanding <span class="Italic">Currier</span>, when an appellant's allegations in support of a discrimination claim are deficient as a matter of law, the claim may be disposed of without a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Browder v. Department of the Navy</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 71, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (1999) (taking as true the appellant's allegation that he suffered from a sexual behavior disorder that caused the misconduct for which he was disciplined, his disability discrimination claim failed as a matter of law because his asserted condition was excluded from the definition of "disability" under the Rehabilitation Act), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 250 F.3d 763 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table). We now hold that when the appellant's factual allegations in support of a discrimination claim, taken as true, could not support an inference that the agency's action was a pretext for discrimination, the AJ is not required to permit the appellant to attempt to prove his allegations at an evidentiary hearing. In other words, when there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding discrimination, an evidentiary hearing on discrimination need not be conducted. When a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) does not exclude reduction in force (RIF) actions from its coverage, the CBA's negotiated grievance procedures are the exclusive means for contesting RIF actions that would otherwise be appealable to the Board, except where the appellant claims discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), (g). In <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Department of Defense</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 313 (2005), the Board, relying in part on <span class="Italic">Currier</span>, held that section 7121 does not require an appellant who files a RIF appeal and claims discrimination to make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination for the Board to assert jurisdiction over the appeal and to decide the discrimination claim. Our decision in the present case is not intended to modify <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A factual dispute is "material" if, in light of the governing law, its resolution could affect the outcome. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.</span>, 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A dispute is "genuine" if there is sufficient evidence favoring the party seeking an evidentiary hearing for the AJ to rule in favor of that party should that party's evidence be credited. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 249. We expect AJs to be extremely cautious in applying these standards and exercising their new authority to resolve discrimination claims without evidentiary hearings. In fact, often an AJ will be holding an evidentiary hearing on the merits anyway, and in the interest of having a complete record should either party seek review it will generally be preferable for the AJ to allow the appellant to present whatever evidence he has on discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, based on the record developed thus far, any dispute over how the agency treated M.K. is not genuine because, as explained above, the appellant has not proffered sufficiently probative evidence to allow a finding that the agency committed disparate treatment race discrimination. Rather, on this record, the appellant's disparate treatment claim fails, taking his factual allegations as true. The appellant argues persuasively in his petition for review, however, that he should have been afforded discovery concerning the discipline that the agency imposed on M.K. The appellant made a detailed discovery request that on its face was directed at obtaining information that could have led to admissible evidence, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(a), and he followed up with a motion to compel a response from the agency. It is not clear whether the AJ denied the motion because she erroneously believed that the agency had already provided the information sought or because she believed that evidence concerning M.K. was irrelevant. In any event, as the discussion above should make clear, the appellant is entitled to obtain evidence that could support his claim of disparate treatment race discrimination. <span class="Italic">Cf. Reeves</span>, 530 U.S. at 143 (the factfinder may consider the evidence establishing the employee's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination "and inferences properly drawn therefrom" in making a finding on the ultimate question of whether the agency's action was a pretext for discrimination).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Redd</span> was an interesting result. The Federal Circuit made plain that summary judgment is precluded in Board cases. <span class="Italic">Crispin v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 732 F.2d 919, 923 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ("the Board does not have available to it a summary judgment proceeding"). But the Federal Circuit does not hear discrimination claims. If a mixed-case is taken to the Federal Circuit, the discrimination component must be waived to obtain Federal Circuit review. Board use of summary judgment would not likely have reached the Federal Circuit since a discrimination claim would not ordinarily have reached the Federal Circuit. District courts hear mixed-case appeals and district court frequently employ summary judgment. Having met its demise in <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SAVAGE_TOMMIE_G_AT_0752_11_0634_I_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1217635.pdf">122 MSPR 612</a>, 625-26 &#x00B6; 19, 2015 MSPB 51 (2015), summary judgment will not likely reappear in Board litigation unless placed there through a statutory amendment or through Board rulemaking.

<p class="Body-Text">Through early 2009, summary judgment was permitted in Homeland Security cases. 5 CFR 1210.20 (2008). That regulation was discontinued. On March 4, 2009, MSPB rescinded its rule governing appeals under the DHS Human Resource Management System. That system was statutorily defunded in late 2008.[74 Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board overturned the decision of an AJ who granted an agency motion for judgment at the close of its case, denying the appellant a right to testify. Although an AJ may exclude testimony that is irrelevant or repetitious, the AJ could not dispose of a case on the merits by using a summary procedure that denies the appellant the right to be heard, <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 21 MSPR 11, 13-14 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official's discretion in controlling the course of the hearing...must be balanced with the appellant's right to be heard....&#8197;"The provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1), are perspicuous that in any action appealable to the Board, the appellant shall have the right 'to a hearing for which a transcript shall be kept.'" <span class="Italic">Webb v.

"The right to be heard where one's interests are acutely affected by the actions of an administrative agency is of cardinal importance." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 471.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the presiding official's grant of the agency's motion for judgment denied appellant the opportunity he sought to testify in rebuttal to the merits of the agency's charge, and to prove his affirmative defenses of harmful error by the agency and that his removal constituted a prohibited personnel practice because of the bias and partiality of his supervisor, who was the proposing and deciding official. While the presiding official may exclude evidence or testimony from consideration if it is irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.62(a), the presiding official may not dispose of a case on the merits by utilizing a summary procedure which denies an appellant his right to be heard. In our view, such a limitation on appellant's right to testify and defend against an agency action would render nugatory the right of appellants to a meaningful hearing pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a) and &#x00A7; 1205(a)(1) of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, and our implementing regulations at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.24(c)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 MSPB 343, 349 (1981). Therefore, the Board finds that the presiding official committed error by granting the agency's motion for judgment and denying appellant the opportunity to testify on his own behalf. Such error warrants a remand and a new hearing. <span class="Italic">Accord Powers v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health, Education and Welfare,</span> 3 MSPB 424 (1980) (the presiding official's improper denial of the appellant's witness and failure to adequately develop the issues raised at the hearing warranted a remand and a new hearing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bommer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 543, 546-61 (1987), reiterated the Board's view that summary judgment was statutorily precluded in any Board appeal, even if the particular Board appeal is the product of an OPM regulation. If there is no material issue of fact, the AJ need not hold an evidentiary hearing. However, the AJ must at least provide the appellant a hearing to receive argument on his case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7701(a) of title 5, USC, provides in part that an appellant may appeal any action that is "appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation," and that the "appellant shall have the right...to a hearing for which a transcript will be kept...." This section was enacted as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. As originally passed by the Senate, another part of Section 7701 provided for summary judgment without a hearing, when the Board official hearing a case found "that there were no genuine and material issues of fact in dispute." S.2640, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. &#x00A7; 205 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 2 House Comm. on Post Office and Civil Service, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., Legislative History of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, at 1,759 (1979). That provision was deleted, however, by the conference committee--a fact that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit noted in <span class="Italic">Crispin v. Department of Commerce</span>, 732 F.2d 919, 922 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The court found that, in the absence of summary judgment authority, the Board's presiding official acted improperly in declining to hold a hearing on an issue in a reduction-in-force appeal that she had concluded was an issue of law rather than an issue of fact. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 920-22.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the enacted language of section 7701(a), Congress's deletion of the summary judgment provision, and <span class="Italic">Crispin</span>, it would appear that an administrative judge is mandated by statute to hold a hearing even in a case in which there is no dispute about a factual matter. Nevertheless, OPM argues that there is no such mandate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM first contends that <span class="Italic">Crispin</span> is distinguishable from the instant case <span id="Page_1411"></span>because there the Board's scope of review had not been restricted by OPM regulation. It argues further that, because the Board derives its jurisdiction over reduction-in-force appeals from OPM regulations, OPM has the authority to issue regulations limiting the Board's jurisdiction over those appeals; it asserts that it exercised this authority by promulgating 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901; and it alleges that this regulatory provision is consistent with the spirit of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After OPM filed its brief in this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued its decision in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v.</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management,</span> 821 F.2d 761 (D.C. Cir. 1987). In that decision, the court vacated 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901, the OPM regulatory provision purportedly restricting the right to a hearing in reduction-in-force appeals to the Board, finding that, "if OPM [chose] to use the MSPB for dispute resolutions, it [was required to] take that statutory device as it [found] it." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 769. We therefore find that the regulatory provision does not provide a proper basis on which to deny an appellant's right to a hearing in such an appeal.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Even if the regulatory section had not been vacated, we would find OPM's arguments unpersuasive. As the court in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, AFL-CIO v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 821 F.2d 761 (D.C. Cir. 1987) noted, although OPM has the authority to create a right of appeal to the Board, and to abolish the right it has created, it has no authority to regulate the manner in which the Board adjudicates appeals. Congress, in enacting the Civil Service Reform Act, repeatedly expressed its intention that the Board would be an independent adjudicatory body, and it emphasized the need for separating the adjudicative responsibilities of the Board from the responsibilities of OPM. H.R. Rep. No. 1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1951), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1 Legislative History of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, at 643 (1979); S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 2, 4, 7, 31 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 2 Legislative History of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, at 1,466, 1,468, 1,471, 1,495 (1979); Cong. Rec. S14,267-68, S14,270, S14,279, S14,282, S14,322 (daily ed. Aug. 24, 1978) (remarks of Sen. Ribicoff, Sen. Percy, Sen. Sasser, Sen. Javits, and Sen. Thurmond), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 2 Legislative History of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, at 1,607, 1,608-09, 1,612-13, 1,630-31, 1,636-37, 1,717 (1979). In our view, a finding that OPM has the authority to limit the Board's responsibility to hold hearings would be highly inconsistent with the Board's status as an independent adjudicatory agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also argues that the members of the House of Representatives who served as conferees in connection with the Civil Service Reform Bill, and who succeeded in having the summary judgment provision deleted from the legislation, believed that the inclusion of that provision might cause the legislation to violate the due process clause of the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution. It argues further that the conferees' apprehension was unfounded with respect to reduction-in-force cases, since courts have held that those cases "do not implicate 'property' rights entitled to constitutional protection," and that section 7701(a) therefore may be construed as permitting the Board to decide reduction-in-force appeals without a hearing when no material facts are disputed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not concur in this view. Even if Congress's sole reason for precluding summary judgment by the Board was the apprehension described above, and even if this apprehension was unfounded, Congress's intent was to preclude summary judgment. OPM has not alleged that Congress made any distinction (either in its deliberations or in the statute itself) between the hearing right in reduction-in-force appeals and the hearing right in other appeals, and we do not believe that a showing that Congress could have made such a distinction if it had chosen to do so constitutes a proper basis for the Board's making the distinction itself. In our opinion, reading this distinction into the legislation would be tantamount to disregarding a statutory mandate on the ground that we believe it is unnecessary or inappropriate. We therefore find that the legislative history cited by OPM in this regard does not provide a proper basis for declining to hold a hearing in a reduction-in-force appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also argues that, even when there is a statutory requirement of a hearing, administrative agencies generally are not required to conduct evidentiary hearings on undisputed facts; and it argues that a ruling that the Board is not required to hold a hearing in a case in which material facts are not in dispute therefore would be consistent with the general practice in the field of administrative law. The court decisions it cites in support of this argument, however, do not establish that this "general practice" is applicable to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a). All but one of them concern statutes that do not provide explicitly for a hearing in the traditional sense, before a presiding officer. In addition, the legislative history of the statute at issue in two of these cases, in contrast to the legislative history of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a), showed a congressional intent to reduce the need for hearings. <span class="Italic">Connecticut Bankers</span> <span class="Italic">Association,</span> 627 F.2d at 250; <span class="Italic">Independent Bankers Association,</span> 516 F.2d at 1210 (court identified statutory provision at issue as section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, the same provision as that at issue in <span class="Italic">Connecticut Bankers Association</span>). As we have indicated above, however, the statute at issue in the case now before the Board provides for "a hearing for which a transcript will be kept." In our view, the reference to a transcript shows that Congress did not intend to provide the kind of "paper" hearing envisioned in other provisions for a hearing. Furthermore, Congress's deletion of the summary judgment provision provides even more compelling evidence that section 7701(a) requires the Board to hold an oral hearing before an administrative judge or other presiding officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining case OPM has cited directly concerns, among other matters, the regulatory provision at issue in the case now before the Board. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v.</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management,</span> 618 F. Supp. 1254 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 782 F.2d 278 (D.C. Cir. 1986). In that case, however, the issue before the court was whether to issue a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of that and other regulatory provisions; the court did not make any final decision as to whether any of those provisions was valid. <span class="Italic">id.,</span> 618 F. Supp. at 1263. Furthermore, the merits of the case have now been heard, and the court, as we have stated above, has vacated 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v.</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management,</span> 821 F.2d 761, 768 (D.C. Cir. 1987). This case therefore does not support OPM's argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the administrative treatise OPM has cited in support of this argument does not address the question of whether hearings may be denied when a specific statutory provision requires them and when the legislative history of that provision reflects an intention to deny the adjudicator the right to grant summary judgment. Instead, the specific situations described there appear to concern cases in which no such statutory provision was applicable, and it makes general statements to the effect that trial procedure is not necessary for disputes concerning nonfactual issues. 2 K. Davis, <span class="Italic">Administrative Law Treatise</span> &#x00A7; 12:2 (2d Ed. 1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's last argument, made in conjunction with the other arguments described above, is that interpretation of the statute as requiring a hearing in matters appealable to the Board would lead to "the absurdity of imposing meaningless, burdensome trial-type proceedings on the Board and the parties," and "unnecessarily clogging the Board's already busy docket[.] "</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This argument does not, in our view, justify a conclusion that section 7701(a) does not entitle an appellant to any hearing in the absence of a dispute about a material fact. A legislature, in passing a statute, may be presumed to have acted with knowledge of the effect of that statute. 82 C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Statutes &#x00A7;</span> 316 (1953). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 2A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction &#x00A7; 45.12 ("legislative language will be interpreted on the assumption that...if a change occurs in legislative language a change was intended in legislative result"). We therefore presume that Congress was aware, when it considered the summary judgment provision included in the Civil Service Reform Bill by the Senate, of the effects deletion of the provision would have on the Board and the parties. Its decision with respect to this matter evidently reflects its view that granting a right to a hearing in each matter appealable to the Board was warranted despite those effects. We find that neither the promotion of appeals processing efficiency nor the reduction of burdens on the parties justifies interpreting section 7701(a) as OPM urges.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit rejected summary judgment in Board appeals, <span class="Italic">Crispin v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 732 F.2d 919, 922-23 (Fed. Cir. 1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the presiding official never stated why she denied petitioner a hearing, it is necessary for this court to make certain assumptions about what actually happened in this case. Accepting the government's argument in the most favorable light would mean that the presiding official granted the government summary judgment on the briefs presented. Although she never stated that she was doing so, this is in essence what the presiding official did in this case. The presiding official stated that the parties were to brief the competitive level issue as a legal one and she based her decision on the arguments presented in the parties' briefs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board does not have available to it a summary judgment proceeding. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1), which covers appeals to the MSPB from agency actions, provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An appellant shall have the right to a hearing for which a transcript will be kept.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The conference committee report which accompanied the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 makes clear that this provision was meant to bar summary judgment proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">APPEALS TO THE MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">RIGHT TO A HEARING</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Senate bill provides that an employee is entitled to an evidentiary hearing before the Merit Systems Protection Board unless a motion for summary decision is granted. A motion for summary decision <span id="Page_1412"></span>shall be granted if the presiding officer decides that there are no genuine and material issues of fact in dispute. The presiding officer may provide for discovery and oral representation of views, at the request of either party, in connection with a summary decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">The House amendment contains no provision for summary decision.</span> It provides that an employee has a right to a hearing before the MSPB for which a transcript will be kept and the right to be represented by an attorney or other representative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">The conference substitute in section 7701(a) adopts the House provision so that the employee is entitled to a hearing on appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board</span>. The hearing may be waived by the employee. [Emphasis added.] H.R. Rep. No. 95-1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 137 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, pp. 2723, 2871.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, because the presiding official had no authority to grant summary judgment, the government's arguments that it met its burden and that the presiding official's decision is supported by substantial evidence are simply not relevant to the basic issue in this case; namely, whether petitioner was entitled to introduce evidence at a hearing. Similarly, the government's argument that we should affirm the presiding official's decision because the question of reassignments is entitled to a strong presumption of correctness is also irrelevant. Such arguments address the weight to be given to the evidence presented and the standard of this court's review. They do not address the issue of whether the presiding official's refusal to hold a hearing on the competitive level issue was proper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Implicitly recognizing that petitioner had a right to a hearing under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1), the government also argues that the presiding official's denial of a hearing was a sanction for petitioner's refusal to respond to discovery or to the presiding official's orders. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset we note that under the regulations the presiding official does have authority to impose sanctions for a party's failure to comply with an order. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43. These sanctions include, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> drawing an inference in favor of one party or prohibiting a party from introducing evidence at a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government states that on May 21 and on June 11, 1982, it served requests for interrogatories requesting the employees to identify the specific facts on which they based their allegations of error, and that on June 9, 1982, the presiding official issued an order directing the employees to specify the basis for their general allegations of error. It is from these facts that the government concludes that petitioner was denied a hearing as a sanction for her failure to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in this case the government admits that the presiding official never in fact issued sanctions. The government would have this court uphold what would in effect be an "implicit sanction," something we decline to do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, petitioner did not fail to comply with the presiding official's orders concerning the competitive level issue. On May 17, 1982, the presiding official issued a first prehearing conference order, which petitioner complied with, listing the issues she was requesting for review. On June 21, 1982, the presiding official issued a final order of issue clarification ordering the parties to brief the competitive level issue as one of law. Petitioner and the government complied with this order by submitting briefs by the deadline, July 16, 1982. The only motions by the government that could possibly be construed as motions for sanctions were two motions for dismissals filed by the government on June 29 and on July 2, 1982. However, the competitive level issue was not mentioned in either of these motions. Petitioner also was not named in the first motion and although she was named in the second motion it was on an entirely separate issue. Under these facts it is difficult to perceive how the government can argue that the presiding official's denial of a hearing was a sanction issued for petitioner's failure to respond.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gowan-Clark v. OPM</span>, 84 MSPR 116, 118-19 &#x00B6; 5 (1999), commented unfavorably on denial of a hearing through summary judgment in an appeal indisputably within the Board's jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the appellant's failure, based upon the documentary record in her appeal, to meet the criteria for entitlement to survivor annuity benefits, the Federal Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">Crispin v. Department of Commerce,</span> 732 F.2d 919, 922-24 (Fed. Cir. 1984), compels the Board to remand the appeal for the requested hearing. In <span class="Italic">Crispin,</span> the court found that the Board does not have the power to grant summary judgment, i.e., a party appealing under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701 is entitled to receive a hearing regarding her appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 924. Further, the Board, relying implicitly upon <span class="Italic">Crispin,</span> has specifically found that appellants contesting OPM reconsideration decisions arising under the civil service retirement system, as in the instant case, are entitled to a hearing even where there is no dispute of material facts. <span class="Italic">See Coben v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 48 MSPR 168, 170 (1991) (appellant has a right to a hearing even where there is no dispute of material facts; however, the right to a hearing is subject to the authority of the administrative judge to make evidentiary rulings under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(b), including the authority to exclude evidence determined to be irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious); <span class="Italic">see also Carew v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management,</span> 878 F.2d 366, 367-68 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (question presented in a retirement matter was one of law, and there was no error where the Board denied the appellant a "full evidentiary hearing" and remanded to allow the appellant to present oral argument). Accordingly, this appeal must be remanded for the requested hearing, the extent of which shall be determined by the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Perez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 32, 39-40 (1988), determined that summary judgment disposing of a significant issue against an appellant was error; however, there was no error in making a ruling against an appellant after all evidence was taken, even though the ruling was the equivalent of summary judgment. Nor was there error in a ruling during the hearing barring the admission of further evidence because it was irrelevant or immaterial.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an appellant, who has a statutory right to a hearing, ought to be permitted to request summary judgment in his favor prior to the hearing without waiving the right to a hearing should the motion be denied, the Board suggested a different position in a footnote to <span class="Italic">Cavanaugh v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 670, 673-74 n.2 (1987), concerning the appellant's attempt to obtain summary judgment: "We note that summary judgment is not a sanction available under the Board's regulation, 5 CFR 1201.43. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crispin v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 732 F.2d 919, 923 (Fed. Cir. 1984)." The Board's footnote is a poor substitute for a reasoned discussion of the issue. Did the Board mean that summary judgment cannot be used at all or only that it cannot be used as a sanction for improper conduct during the hearing? The Board summarily decided the issue in <span class="Italic">Greene v. DHHS</span>, 41 MSPR 521, 523-24 (1989). The AJ granted appellant's motion for summary judgment concerning enforced leave and, in the process, apparently decided against the appellant on an issue of discrimination. The Board demurred:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge erred in granting the appellant's motion for summary judgment inasmuch as the Board lacks authority to grant summary judgment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ahlberg v. DHHS</span>, 804 F.2d 1238, 1244 (Fed. Cir. 1986)...; <span class="Italic">Crispin v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 732 F.2d 919, 924 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold here that, when an administrative judge receives a motion for summary judgment, the appellant should be informed that, because the Board lacks authority to grant such a motion, unless it is withdrawn, the administrative judge will consider it to be a request for an adjudication of all issues in the appeal on the basis of the record. Further, to avoid piecemeal adjudication...where a summary judgment motion is conditional or does not address the entire case, the appellant should be required to choose between having the entire case decided on the record or having a hearing on all the issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What apparently occurred in <span class="Italic">Greene</span> was that the AJ resolved summarily disputed issues of fact concerning a discrimination claim, when the only question that should have been decided through summary judgment was the validity of enforced leave. The AJ should have decided the enforced leave question summarily and decided the EEO claim following a hearing. Because of this error in the application of summary judgment, the Board seemed to have eliminated the procedure entirely, tossing out the baby with the bath water. The two Federal Circuit cases cited in <span class="Italic">Greene</span> did not bar an appellant from requesting summary judgment and securing a hearing if the motion was denied. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-10-120.html#sec3-120">Motion to Dismiss Filed During Hearing</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Greene</span> governs kindred motions: because juries do not sit in Board proceedings, an AJ cannot order a directed verdict. <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 192, 203 n.8 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Benson v. OPM</span>, 83 MSPR 549, 551-52 (1999) (appellant could not request a hearing conditioned upon the refusal of the AJ to grant judgment based on the record; that procedure amounted to summary judgment); <span class="Italic">Denney v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 191, 193 n.1 (1995) (Board lacks the authority to grant summary judgment or a directed verdict). [But refer to earlier discussion concerning the use of a motion to dismiss as the conclusion of the agency's case where the agency has the burden of proof.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although <span class="Italic">Greene</span> appears to foreclose any use of summary judgment, the motion could be useful in some cases. An excellent example of the proper use of a summary judgment motion is in a performance case. An agency's performance standards may be inadequate as a matter of law. Or, perhaps, there is inadequate proof in the appeals response of OPM approval of the agency appraisal system. It is a waste of time to spend days examining witnesses about a multitude of instances of unacceptable performance if a basic element of the case--objectivity of standards or OPM approval of the system--is doomed to failure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Can the equivalent of summary judgment be obtained on a particular issue by the appellant by a limited waiver of a hearing, with one dispositive issue being first determined without a hearing and, if that does not end the case in the appellant's favor, the remainder of the case goes to hearing? We were left pondering that possibility, possibly (but by no means clearly) permitted by <span class="Italic">Doe v. DOJ</span>, 121 MSPR 596, 604 n.6, 2014 MSPB 75 (2014):</p>

However, as with his right to a hearing on the merits, an appellant may waive his right to a hearing on the issue of harmful error. <span class="Italic">See Towne v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 239, &#x00B6; 34 (2013) (proceeding to address a harmful error claim after the appellant waived her right to a hearing on the issue).

Department of Defense</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 178, &#x00B6; 5 (2006) (an appellant may only waive his right to a hearing if the waiver is (1) clear, unequivocal, or decisive; and (2) informed); <span class="Italic">Gavette v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Smisson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 85 MSPR 427, 430 &#x00B6; 7 (2000), without explaining the legal nuances of what occurred, the appellant, removed for excessive absences, appealed and requested a hearing. The AJ reversed the action without a hearing after determining from the record that the absences were excused by the agency and that the agency did not demonstrate that the absences were beyond the employee's control and extended beyond a reasonable time. The Board apparently determined that the agency's prehearing statement did not demonstrate that the witnesses identified by the agency would have made out the agency's case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the agency's contention that it would have solicited hearing testimony from the appellant, an agency has no statutory right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">Hulett v.

Moreover, it is the agency's burden to establish the charge, and the agency may not require the appellant to submit evidence to prove its case. <span class="Italic">See Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 54, 71 (1997) (the appellant was not required to submit medical evidence to assist the agency in proving its charge against her).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Greene v.

Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, we find here that the administrative judge erred by ruling on the merits of the appellant's handicap discrimination claim without requiring the appellant to make such an election. Although the administrative judge noted in his status conference memorandum that the parties had agreed that he could make a decision on the record, the record is insufficient to support a finding either that the appellant made the requisite election or that he otherwise unequivocally waived his right to a hearing. Since the administrative judge did not serve the appellant with a copy of the status conference memorandum or give him an opportunity to comment on it, we cannot hold him responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the summary. <span class="Italic">McBurney v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 39 MSPR 126, 131 (1988). We therefore find that another remand is appropriate here.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">At one time the Board considered that because USERRA does not guarantee a hearing before the Board (a position now reversed as a result of a Federal Circuit decision), it was possible that summary judgment could be employed in that class of appeals. The Board reserved judgment on the issue in <span class="Italic">Jordan v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 525, 529 n.2 (2002). There is at least the possibility of summary or partial summary judgment, or judgment on the pleadings, in Hatch Act cases, and complaints against administrative law judges (discussed in <a href="0100-2023-13-001.html#sec6-1">Chapter 6</a>), governed in large part under the Administrative Procedure Act.

If an issue of credibility exists or if the movant fails to establish that there is no genuine issue over any material issue of fact, the motion must be denied.
