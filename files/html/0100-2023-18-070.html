<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-71"><span class="space">2.</span> Not Less Than Seven Days for Reply</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Baracco v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 112, 120 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 735 F.2d 488 (Fed. Cir. 1984), if an individual is given less than seven days to respond to an adverse action, the action is not in accordance with the law under 5 USC 7513(b)(2). The statutory period for notice is violated. 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C). However, the Board decided that it would apply the harmful error standard of &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A), modifying a contrary ruling in <span class="Italic">Ratley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 13 MSPR 316, 321 (1982) (one-day notice period was inherently unreasonable, violated the requirements of the statute, and was therefore not in accordance with the law). <span class="Italic">Baracco</span> reasoned that if all statutory violations made actions "not in accordance with the law" and therefore reversible, the same result would have to be reached as to regulatory violations, rendering meaningless the harmful error provision. To avoid making the "not in accordance with the law" provision meaningless, the Board determined in <span class="Italic">Baracco</span> that it would "read the 'harmful error' provision as applicable to all procedural errors and to read the 'not in accordance with the law' provision as applicable to other unlawful actions." Lacking a demonstration of harm, the Board discerned no reversible error in the shortening of an adverse action notice period. The Board distinguished <span class="Italic">Ratley</span> on the facts: in <span class="Italic">Ratley</span> the employee demonstrated that because the agency failed to allow more than a one-day notice period, it impaired his ability to obtain medical evidence to respond to the proposed suspension. However, the employee's burden to establish the affirmative defense of harmful error under <span class="Italic">Baracco</span> is to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the procedural error likely had a harmful effect on the outcome before the agency, and the employee did not demonstrate harmful error when he did not show that he would have made any arguments or presented evidence in the reply that would have likely affected the agency decision to remove him for striking.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board provided its analysis of the distinction between agency action that was not in accordance with the law and agency action falling within the harmful error analysis in <span class="Italic">Baracco,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 15 MSPR at 119-23:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's argument raises the question of whether in effecting an appealable adverse action, the failure of an agency to comply with a statutory procedure set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, constitutes reversible error <span class="Italic">per se</span> because the action is "not in accordance with law," or whether the effect of the error must be considered under the "harmful error" standard enunciated by the Board in <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 1 MSPB 489, 492-93 (1980). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Devine v. White</span>, 711 F.2d 1082, 1083-1084 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The Board concludes, for the reasons set forth herein, that the "harmful error" standard is applicable in our review of an agency's failure to comply with a statutory procedure provided in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. Insofar as our opinion in <span class="Italic">Ratley</span> is inconsistent with this holding it is modified for the reasons set forth below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978) (Reform Act) is ambiguous as to the standard Congress intended the Board to apply to violations of statutory procedures. In the proposed Senate bill, agency actions were not to be reversed for procedural error unless the employee's rights were "substantially impaired." S. 2640, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. &#x00A7; 205 (1978). The Senate, which also drafted a section in its bill requiring reversal of agency actions which were not in accordance with law, interpreted its procedural error provision to mean that "the Board and the courts should only reverse agency actions under the new procedures where the employee's rights under this title have been substantially prejudiced." S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 51, U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, p. 2723, 2773 (1978). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Parker, supra</span>, 1 MSPB at 492. Since some of the employee rights referred to by the Senate were statutory procedural rights, it is clear that adverse actions were not to be reversed merely because there was a violation of a statutory procedure. The House, however, without explanation, substituted the harmful error standard for the Senate's "substantial impairment" test. H. Rep. No. 95-1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1978). When this language, together with the "not in accordance with law" provision, was adopted by the Conference Committee and enacted into law without explanation, the present uncertainty over the application of harmful error to statutory procedural rights resulted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ambiguity caused by the legislative history of the Reform Act, however, can be resolved by applying the rules of statutory construction.<span class="Italic"> Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe</span>, 401 U.S. 402, 412 n.29, 91 S. Ct. 814, 821 n.29, 28 L. Ed.2d 136 (1971). One of the primary rules of statutory construction is that effect must be given to every word, clause, and sentence of a statute, if at all possible, so that no provision will be superfluous, inoperative, or insignificant. <span class="Italic">American Radio Relay League v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 617 F.2d 875, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1980). This rule cannot be logically complied with if the Board accepts the proposition that statutory procedural errors should be analyzed under the "not in accordance with law" standard. This is true because it is well settled that reasonable and properly promulgated regulations, as well as statutes, have the force and effect of law. <span class="Italic">See Pearce v. Department <span id="Page_3213"></span>of Labor</span>, 647 F.2d 716, 726 (7th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. United States</span>, 573 F.2d 1189, 1194, 216 Ct. Cl. 25 (1978). Consequently, if the Board reviews statutory violations under the "not in accordance with law" standard, logically we also must review regulatory violations under that standard. Such a result would render the harmful error provision meaningless since no procedural violations would then be subject to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our view, the way to give meaning to both of these sections is to read the "harmful error" provision as applicable to all procedural errors and to read the "not in accordance with law" provision as applicable to other unlawful actions. This reading of the statute is consistent with the reviews expressed in the legislative history of the Reform Act, S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 51, U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, p. 2723, 2773 (1978), and is responsive to the numerous expressions of concern during hearings on the Reform Act about the unnecessary procedural reversals of agency actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hearings</span> <span class="Italic">Before</span> <span class="Italic">the</span> <span class="Italic">Senate</span> <span class="Italic">Committee</span> o<span class="Italic">n Governmental Affairs on S. 2640, S. 2707 and S. 2830</span>, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 22, 43, 101, 146 (1978); <span class="Italic">Hearings Before the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service on H.R. 11280</span>, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 31, 122-23 (1978). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 1 MSPB at 492 n.4. The Board concludes, therefore, that agency procedural errors in arriving at decisions in cases appealable to the Board are subject to review under the "harmful error" standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering the effect of the procedural errors under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, the Board has consistently focused on whether the employee's ability to defend against the adverse action was impaired by the error, or whether the error otherwise had a likely effect on the agency's action so as to constitute harmful error under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A).[6] More particularly, we have held that an agency's failure to afford an employee the not less than seven days required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2) to answer the charges is not cause for reversal absent a showing of harmful error by the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 11 MSPB 415, 416-17 (1982) (the agency's shortening of the seven-day reply period provided by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2) to six days was error, but the employee failed to demonstrate that her ability to present her case was prejudiced or that the error would likely have affected the agency's decision to effect the emergency suspension action). Similarly, the Court of Claims held in a case arising before passage of the Reform Act that an agency's issuance of its final decision in an adverse action, after receipt and consideration of the employee's answer, but prior to the expiration of the notice period, does not of itself invalidate the final decision or the notice thereof. <span class="Italic">Palmer v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ratley</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board stated that an agency's allowance to an employee of only twenty-six hours to reply to a proposed suspension during the notice period of a removal action was "not in accordance with law."[7] <span class="Italic">Ratley, supra</span>, 11 MSPB at 566. Our ultimate determination in <span class="Italic">Ratley</span>, however, was based on a finding that a proposed suspension effected after affording the employee only one day to reply constituted harmful error under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 566. The reversal of the suspension in <span class="Italic">Ratley</span> was not based on a finding that the decision was not in accordance with law under section 7701(c)(2)(C), although there is a statement to that effect, but upon a finding of harmful error under section 7701(c)(2)(A) because the mere one-day reply period afforded the employee, who had requested an extension of time to obtain statements from his doctors in response to the proposed suspension, substantially impaired his ability to defend against the agency action.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Similar to the Board's application of the "harmful error" standard to agency procedural violations, the Court of Claims has held, upon examination of the legislative history of the Reform Act, that reversal of agency adverse actions by the Court under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703, for procedural error by an agency, is appropriate "only if the procedures followed substantially impaired the rights of the employees." <span class="Italic">Doyle v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these considerations, the Board holds that the procedural error of an agency in failing to afford an employee with the not less than seven days to respond to a written proposal of an appealable adverse action provided by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2) does not warrant reversal of the action unless the employee shows by a preponderance of the evidence[8] that the procedural error likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome before the agency. <span class="Italic">Parker, supra,</span> 1 MSPB at 493. <span class="Italic">See also Devine, supra,</span> at 1083-1084; <span class="Italic">Johnson, supra,</span> 11 MSPB at 416-17.[9]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The Board has recognized, however, that an agency's complete failure to provide any of the procedural protections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 in effecting an adverse action constitutes harmful error. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts,</span> 5 MSPB 299 (1981); <span class="Italic">Morrow v. Department of the Army,</span> 4 MSPB 494, 497 (1980); <span class="Italic">White v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 4 MSPB 11, 13 (1980). This is because an agency's total failure to follow any of the procedures of section 7513 impairs an employee's ability to defend against an adverse action and otherwise affects the outcome before the agency. <span class="Italic">Cf. Horne v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 684 F.2d 155 (D.C. Cir. 1982); and <span class="Italic">Wright v. Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 11 MSPB 167 (1982) (an agency's reduction-in-force (RIF) action may not be affirmed based on how the agency might have acted had it followed proper RIF procedures, and the agency's actions in demoting the employees without following any formal RIF procedures was improper and reversible).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's <span class="Italic">Baracco</span> analysis of harmful error <span class="Italic">sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 735 F.2d 488, 490 (Fed. Cir. 1984), in note 3 of the majority opinion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Adams, Baracco, and Amici say the removal notice provided for reply <span id="Page_3214"></span>"within 7 calendar days," thus providing effectively for 6 days, in violation of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7513(b)(2) (reply in "not less than 7 days"). The argument is semantic and senseless on this record. The Board held the notice itself inclusive of 7 days, though it found harmless error in a letter denying time enlargement to Baracco. Each petitioner responded to the notice within 7 days. In requesting time enlargements, petitioners said they did not think "seven days is a reasonable time." If there were error, it was harmless, no request for an oral reply time having been made within the seven day period. The burden to show harm is petitioners,' 5 CFR Sec. 1201.56(b)(1) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(1)], <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Postal Service,</span> 697 F.2d 1078, 1080 (Fed. Cir. 1983); yet no effort was made to show that any additional reply was or would have been attempted on the seventh day. The argument might be appropriate if the agency had refused to consider a reply filed on the seventh day because not filed "within 7 calendar days." This court does not sit, however, to decide hypotheticals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A concurring opinion by Judge Nies in <span class="Italic">Adams</span> provided more extensive analysis of the issue (raised by Mr. Baracco in the joined appeal) of what constituted an error of law and when legal error would be treated under the harmful error doctrine:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Baracco's position is that harmful error should not have entered into resolution of the issue of the shortened notice period. Baracco maintains that his right to a minimum 7-day reply period, unquestionably required by 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7513(b)(2), rendered the action "not in accordance with law" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7701(c)(2)(C), set out below, and that, therefore, reversal is required. In essence, Baracco argues that a statutory procedural requirement is not subject to the harmful error provision of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7701(c)(2)(A). Stated another way, violation of a statutory procedural requirement is harmful <span class="Italic">per se</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB carefully reviewed the statutory history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978) (Reform Act) to discern the relationship of these two provisions and found no clear guide to their interpretation. However, it found direction, in favor of the presiding official's ruling, in the numerous expressions of concern during hearings on the Reform Act about unnecessary procedural reversals of agency actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In rejecting Baracco's argument, the board also found guidance in the need to give effect to all parts of the statute. The board reasoned that procedural regulations have the force of law and that, if the harmful error provision could not be applied in connection with procedures established by statute, by the same token, it could not be applied to procedures established by regulations which have the force of law. Therefore, the statutory provision on harmful error would be meaningless.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board then reviewed and reconciled its own decisions with its holding here, and, finally, found support for its interpretation in precedent of this court, particularly, <span class="Italic">Doyle v. Veterans Administration</span>, 667 F.2d 70, 72, 229 Ct. Cl. 261 (1981); <span class="Italic">Brewer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 647 F.2d 1093, 1097, 227 Ct.

<p class="Block-Quote2">In enacting the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Congress declared that this court should reverse agency actions for procedural error "only if the procedures followed substantially impaired the rights of the employees."

<p class="Block-Quote1">647 F.2d at 1097.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of the contrary position, petitioner cites cases, for example <span class="Italic">Ryder v. United States,</span> 585 F.2d 482, 218 Ct.

Ed.2d 19 (1957), which are clearly no longer controlling in view of the addition to the statute of the harmful error provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning again to the precise language of the statute, I conclude that paragraphs (A) and (C) are directed at different evils. Harmful error in procedures (paragraph A) raises the question: Did the wrongful procedure harm the employee in the presentation of his defense so that a different result might have been reached? Petitioner here has not asserted such harm. He asks simply for a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule. That is not a "showing" of harm as the statute requires. Paragraph (C), on the other hand, is directed to the decision itself. Was the decision in its entirety in accordance with law? Since the harmful error rule is part of the law, the question becomes: Is the decision in accordance with the law including the harmful error provision? Tested against this standard, the <span class="Italic">Baracco</span> decision cannot be reversed since no harmful error has been shown.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The same result was reached in <span class="Italic">Mack v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 28 MSPR 288 (1985), involving application of a shortened notice period for an employee suspected of criminal activity. The Board ruled in <span class="Italic">Mack</span>, 28 MSPR at 290-91:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant further contends that the agency denied him a reasonable opportunity to respond to the charges. In support of this contention, appellant argues that in response to the notice of proposed removal, he requested an extension of time to prepare a response to the charges. The agency did not rule on his request, and rendered a final decision. However, we do not find that the time period for reply was unreasonable. Further, even assuming appellant's allegations are true, he has failed to show any harmful error under <span class="Italic">Parker</span>...since he has not shown what he would have presented to the agency or that his ability to present his case was otherwise prejudiced....</p>

"It is insufficient simply to show that a statutory procedure was not followed at the agency level. Harmful error must be shown." Smith, 789 F.2d at 1546. "Thus, though an agency commits a procedural error, reversal by the [B]oard is unwarranted unless that error casts sufficient doubt on the reliability of the agency's factfinding or decision." <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1545.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3215"></span>The agency's decision notice provided that the 30-day suspension was not to take effect until April 6, 2002, and advised the appellant that she could obtain information about appeal rights and procedures from Labor Relations Specialist Stephanie Calister. Thus, when the appellant received the decision notice on April 4, 2002, she had two days in which she could have contacted the deciding official, Area Director Jeffrey Stetina, who was also the appellant's third-level supervisor, informed him that she had just received notice of the agency's suspension action and, based on that fact, requested an opportunity to respond or an extension of time to respond to the charges. The only indication in the record that the appellant attempted to respond to her impending suspension is her statement in her April 5, 2002 memorandum to agency EEO Counselor Peggy Wiseman that, upon the appellant's receipt of the suspension decision notice on April 4, 2002, she contacted Calister that same day and informed her that she had not received the suspension proposal notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant had the full opportunity below to present evidence and argument regarding the agency's charges and her defenses that she asserts she was unable to present to the deciding official prior to his issuance of the suspension decision because the agency had failed to provide her with a copy of the notice of proposed suspension. The appellant did not present any evidence or elicit testimony from either the proposing or deciding officials showing that they would not likely have proposed or effected the appellant's suspension based on the evidence and arguments that she presented in her appeal. Further, the evidence in this case supports the AJ's findings that the agency proved its charges by preponderant evidence, that the action promotes the efficiency of the service, that the appellant did not prove her other asserted defenses, and that the penalty of a 30-day suspension is reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, although we expressly disapprove of the agency's failure to comply fully with the procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b), we find under the circumstances of this case that the appellant failed to show that the agency's procedural error likely caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)]; <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 789 F.2d at 1545-46.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant is allowed at least seven days for a reply but the employee claims that the reply period was still insufficient, the Board examines the agency's treatment of the reply process to determine if it was unreasonable, <span class="Italic">Land v. FAA</span>, 12 MSPR 535, 538 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1182 (1978), the then governing statute, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7501(b)(3) only provided for a reasonable time to reply to the agency's charges. It placed no qualifying phrase on this time frame as does the new provision. Thus, prior to the enactment of the Reform Act, the courts, rather than set a time frame which would always be reasonable, have examined the amount of time given to the employee and determined whether it was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b), as amended, provides that an employee must have at least 7 days to respond to an agency charge, any lesser amount of response time would be in violation of the statute and thus not in accordance with law. However, in those cases where the employee is given at least 7 days but the employee still challenges the time period on the basis it is unreasonable, we believe that the logical course for the Board to follow is to examine the underlying circumstances to determine the reasonableness of the time period just as the courts did before the passage of the Civil Service Reform Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, appellant was able to obtain legal counsel and present evidence in the form of documents and testimony and to challenge the proposed removal within the 7 day time period. Moreover, the agency gave him three work days to review the evidence in his case. Although his counsel argues that his defense would have been more complete given more time, counsel has not demonstrated what more could have been presented to the agency, if there had been additional time. Therefore, we find that appellant was afforded a reasonable time to respond.</p>

VA</span>, 12 MSPR 336, 338 (1982) (no harmful error an employee had seven days, rather than ten, as allowed by an agency regulation to review the agency evidence filed before his reply; he had three weeks before receiving the evidence file to assemble his own evidence and otherwise prepare his reply); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Darnell v.
