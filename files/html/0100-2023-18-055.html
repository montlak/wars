<h5 class="h5" id="sec11-56"><span class="space">a.</span> General Charge; Charge Label; Detailed Narrative; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Otero</span></span> and <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Cross</span></span></h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Otero v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 198, 200, 202-04 (1997), suggested that agencies may avoid alleging specific charges by proposing adverse action on the basis of a narrative description of conduct coupled with a general charge, e.g., "conduct unbecoming." If portions of the conduct described are not proved, the result may be mitigation of the penalty, but the case will not fail for lack of a proper specification characterizing the appellant's conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from his PS-5 Window Distribution Clerk position, based on a charge of "improper conduct" due to his making threatening remarks toward a supervisor....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in law or regulation requires that an agency affix a label to a charge of misconduct. If it so chooses, it may simply describe actions that constitute misbehavior in a narrative form, and have its discipline sustained if the efficiency of the service suffers because of the misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Boykin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 56, 58-59 (1991). If an agency chooses to label an act of misconduct, then it is bound to prove the elements that make up the legal definition of that charge, if there are any. Much of the relevant case law regarding an agency's labeling of its charge discusses the analysis of those elements, and the Board's responsibility regarding that analysis<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Chauvin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 38 F.3d 563, 565-66 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 171-72. There is no requirement, though, that the Board impose on the agency <span class="Italic">an obligation</span> to label specifically the misconduct, if it chooses not to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's case law reflects the requirements of due process and fundamental fairness in this area. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., O'Connor v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 653, 656-58 (1993); <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 680-81 (1991). But, while an agency is required to state the reasons for a proposed adverse action in sufficient detail to allow the employee to make an informed reply, <span class="Italic">see Spearman v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 135, 139 (1990), the charge must be viewed in light of the accompanying specifications and circumstances, and should not be technically construed, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Pflanz v. Department of Transportation,</span> 21 M.S.P.R. 71, 73 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 776 F.2d 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). The agency's two-page narrative description of the incident that is the basis for this appeal is very specific and easily satisfies the requirements of notice and fairness. <span class="Italic">See Friese v. Department of Justice,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 210, 214-15 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 932 F.2d 980 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). The narrative contains dates, times, names of participants, exact quotes of the offensive language the appellant purportedly used, and a detailed description of the alleged events of that morning. To defend against such specifics, the appellant can refute the agency's evidence that he engaged in the misconduct, that the agency's action promoted the efficiency of the service, or that the agency considered the appropriate mitigating factors. Additionally, the appellant must prove any affirmative defenses. The appellant has not been harmed in the least because the agency used a broad label such as "improper misconduct" rather than using a label more "specific" in the eyes of the administrative judge.<span class="Italic"> See Spearman,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. at 139. Hypertechnical common law pleading is not Board <span id="Page_3187"></span>practice, and so an agency is not required to narrowly label its charge with magic words for it to be sustained by the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., King v. Nazelrod,</span> 43 F.3d 663, 665 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Lockett v. U.S. Marine Corps,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 427, 429 (1988). Similarly, an appellant is not held to strict rules of pleading when making his claims in pursuit of his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Hill v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 796 F.2d 1469, 1472 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Much of the quandary in distinguishing this case from <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> stems from the confusion as to what constitutes a "charge." A charge usually has two parts: (1) A name or label that generally characterizes the misconduct; and (2) a narrative description of the actions that constitute the misconduct. In <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, the court used the term "charge" to apply to the charge's label, holding that when an agency names a charge so that the label has more than one element, then the agency must prove all of the elements for the overall charge to be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172; <span class="Italic">see also Boykin</span>, 51 MSPR at 59. In <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, the charge label was "directing the unauthorized use of Government materials, manpower and equipment for other than official purposes." <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172. The court held that the charge could not be sustained because, although the agency proved the use was "unauthorized," it did not prove that it was "for other than official purposes." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court's conclusion there made sense because Burroughs could easily have been misled by the label of the charge since it was a characterization of the entire act of misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That is not the situation in the instant case, however. Here, the agency broadly named the charge "improper misconduct." There are no separate elements to this label, and there is no confusion caused by the use of this broad term. The agency sufficiently put the appellant on notice of what he allegedly did and on what formed the basis for the discipline in its detailed narrative portion of the charge. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Department of Justice</span>, 65 MSPR 46, 50 (1994), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 48 F.3d 1236 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 MSPR 92, 103 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 735 F.2d 497 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 469 U.S. 881, 105 S. Ct. 247, 83 L. Ed.2d 185 (1984). <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> stands for the proposition that an agency must not label its charge with terms that are not supported by the proven misconduct. <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172. However, it does not therefore stand for the proposition that an agency <span class="Italic">must</span> label a charge using narrow terms with legal elements of definition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, although the court in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> held that a charge must fall if any element of the charge label is not proven, that does not thereby mean that a charge must fall if any portion of the narrative description of the charge is not proven. For example, if an agency named a charge "theft of government property," and then in the narrative description stated that on a single occasion, the employee stole a hammer, a wrench, and a screwdriver, the charge would not fall under <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> if on appeal the agency could prove only that a hammer and a wrench were taken. The employee still would be found to have committed theft of government property, and the agency's decision to impose discipline would be sustained, although there might be cause to mitigate the penalty. As the court stated in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, "[w]here more than one event or factual specification is set out to support a charge...proof of one or more, but not all, of the supporting specifications is sufficient to sustain the charge. <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above, we find that it would be most fair to the parties if the case were remanded to allow the appellant to defend against the charge that was originally brought against him. The administrative judge's improper recharacterization of the charge into one of "threat" no doubt caused confusion and did not properly put the parties on notice as to what they would need to show in order to prove, or to defend against, the charge as the agency framed it originally.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency contends that the AJ erred in requiring it to prove the specific intent required for a falsification charge. The Board faced an analogous situation in <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 198 (1997). The agency charged Otero with "improper conduct." In a lengthy narrative supporting this charge, the agency made a number of specific allegations as to what Otero said and did, including the characterization that the appellant threatened his supervisor by these statements and actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 200. The AJ required the agency to prove the elements of a threat under <span class="Italic">Metz v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 780 F.2d 1001, 1004 (Fed. Cir. 1986)<span class="Italic">. Otero</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 201-02. The Board reversed this ruling, stating that: an agency need not affix any label to its charges, but can instead describe actions that constitute misbehavior in narrative form and have its discipline sustained if the efficiency of the service suffers because of the misconduct; if an agency instead chooses to label an act of misconduct, it is bound to prove the elements that make up the legal definition of the charge, if any; and there was nothing inappropriate about the agency using a broad label such as "improper conduct" as long as the reasons for the proposed action were described in sufficient detail to allow the employee to make an informed reply. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 202-03.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these principles to this case, the agency was entitled to use a general charge such as conduct unbecoming a federal employee, which contains no specific intent element, rather than a charge of falsification, which contains a specific intent element. The fact that the agency used the words "falsified" and "falsely" in the narrative account of specifications 3 and 4 does not mean that it was required to prove falsification under the <span class="Italic">Naekel</span> test, just as the agency in <span class="Italic">Otero</span> was not required to prove a "threat" under the <span class="Italic">Metz</span> test even though it used this word in its supporting narrative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion that the agency was not required to prove the specific intent element required for a falsification charge does not mean that the question of intent is irrelevant to the "conduct unbecoming" charge.

The appellant was charged with improper conduct. The factual basis of the charge consisted of an incorrect report of inspection work by a compliance officer. The narrative of the charge stated that the appellant submitted "inaccurate and fictitious information" in an activity report. Based on the reference to "fictitious" in the narrative, the AJ required the agency to provide that the appellant knowingly supplied incorrect information with the intent of defrauding, deceiving, or misleading the agency. The Board concluded, contrary to the AJ, that the agency was not required to prove intent as to the charge of improper conduct despite the language contained in the narrative:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that because the agency stated in the narrative of the charge that the appellant had submitted "inaccurate and fictitious information" in an Activity Report, the agency was required to prove the elements of a falsification charge--that the appellant knowingly supplied incorrect information with the intention of defrauding, deceiving, or misleading the agency. The AJ found further that the appellant failed to prove the requisite intent with respect to the charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its PFR, the agency contends that the AJ erred in requiring it to prove the specific intent required for a falsification charge.

Here, the specifications were sufficiently detailed to allow the appellant to make an informed reply to the charge of improper conduct based on his actions in dealing with the investigation of Kin Yick Trading Company and in submitting inaccurate information in his report on that company. The agency did not charge or specify that the appellant had falsified documents. Thus, the AJ erred in technically construing the specifications so as to require a showing of intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion that the agency was not required to prove the specific intent element required for a falsification charge does not mean that the question of intent is irrelevant to the "improper conduct" charge.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Yinat v. Dept. of Army</span>, 101 MSPR 328, 333-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (2005), provides another example of a narrative of misconduct sufficient to state an adverse charge, without a label other than the characterization of the employee's actions as misconduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the AJ mislabeled as a due-process violation her actual finding that the agency did not prove the charge on the merits--or, possibly, that it did not prove that its action promoted the efficiency of the service--because the underlying narrative did not specify that <span class="Italic">the agency</span> found the appellant's conduct unacceptable. In that regard, she concluded, "[T]he agency simply decided to remove the appellant because complaints were made about him. The removal action must be overturned."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A review of the notice of proposed removal, however, does not support the AJ's apparent conclusion that the notice was insufficient to charge actionable misconduct. If an agency chooses to affix a label to a charge of misconduct, as the agency did here, it may simply describe actions that constitute misbehavior in a narrative form and have its discipline sustained if the efficiency of the service suffers because of the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 202 (1997). Here, the notice described numerous actions, identified by date and cross-referenced by tabbed evidence, that Giovino believed constituted "Conduct Unbecoming a Federal Employee." For example, the notice stated that the "first of the truly serious instance[s] of misconduct" was "the 'TDY Incident.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see infra</span>, &#x00B6; 11 (setting forth other incidents described in the notice). Giovino's conclusion clarified that the agency found the appellant's conduct improper. He stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Review of all these documents demonstrates that you have engaged in conduct unbecoming of a federal employee. Your methods of leading and influencing others are not based upon sound supervisor practices, but are instead grounded in the tactics of harassment and intimidation--tactics which are especially acute when directed toward female employees--or against those with whom you feel the need to settle old scores. Moreover, you have used your position and seniority in an attempt to polarize the organization. This conduct is in opposition to the legitimate goals and objectives of the organization and its previous commanders.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the removal letter showed that Chen found the appellant's conduct improper based on those incidents. Thus, we find that the notice was sufficient to inform the appellant of the charge against him and that the agency's decision was based on that charge. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Crouse v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 57, 63 (1997) (setting forth the essential elements of the charges of unacceptable supervisory conduct and conduct unbecoming a federal employee), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds and remanded sub nom.

<p class="Body-Text">If an employee is charged with unbecoming conduct, the agency need not prove specific intent, despite references in the supporting narrative to intentional falsification of information. Although the agency need not prove intent to prove the general charge, whether or not the offense was intentional is a factor to be considered relative to the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cross v.

Cir. 2005 NP)), the agency's proposal was to remove the appellant for failing to maintain a valid driver's license, a condition of employment. The proposal notice stated that without the license the appellant could not effectively function in his position. The AJ reversed the agency's removal action because it did not establish that the appellant could not function effectively in his position without the license, and the agency challenged that decision through a PFR contending that it was not required to show that the appellant could not function effectively in his position in order to prove the charge of failing to maintain a condition of employment. The Board's construction of the charge favored the agency; whether the appellant could adequately function without a license was a matter of nexus and the appropriateness of the penalty rather than an essential element of the charge, and the removal was sustained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 11, 2003, the agency proposed to remove the appellant from his Supply Technician position for failing to maintain his valid driver's license, a condition of employment. The proposal notice specified that the appellant had indicated that his driver's license had been revoked until April 2004, due to his driving under the influence. It further noted that his position required him to have a valid driver's license as a condition of employment and that, without one, he could not effectively function in his position. The agency then effected the appellant's removal for failing to have a valid driver's license. The decision notice further stated that the appellant had not provided documentation regarding the status of his driver's license and did not meet a condition of employment without one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following a hearing, the administrative judge reversed the appellant's removal. The administrative judge found that the agency was required to prove that the appellant failed to maintain a condition of employment, a valid driver's license, and that he could not effectively function in his position without one. He then found that the agency failed to establish that the appellant could not effectively function in his position without his driver's license. The administrative judge also ordered the agency to provide interim relief in the event that either party filed a petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's petition for review establishes that it has provided the ordered interim relief and asserts, among other things, that it was not required to show that the appellant could not function effectively in his position in order to prove its charge of failing to maintain a condition of employment. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board interprets agency charges in light of the accompanying specifications and circumstances, and it will avoid technical constructions. <span class="Italic">See Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 202 (1997). When an agency labels a charge and the charge has more than one element, it must prove all the elements of the charge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A charge, however, does not fail merely because the agency fails to prove part of the narrative description of the circumstances supporting the charge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 204.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the notice of proposed removal included as an element of the charge that the appellant could not function effectively in his position without maintaining a valid driver's license. Thus, he concluded that the agency was required to prove this element of the charge, and he reversed the action based upon <span id="Page_3189"></span>the agency's failure of proof. We disagree with this construction of the proposal and removal notices.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph one of the agency's proposal notice states that the agency proposed to remove the appellant "based on [his] failure to have a valid driver's license, which is a condition of employment for [his] position." That paragraph does not state that the failure prevented the appellant from effectively performing his duties. Paragraph two then sets forth the details surrounding the charge in three subparagraphs. Those paragraphs describe the circumstances of the driver's license revocation and conclude that the appellant no longer had a driver's license and did not meet a condition of employment. Again, that narrative did not allege that the failure to maintain a condition of employment rendered the appellant unable to perform his duties effectively. The proposal notice's third paragraph discusses nexus and the appropriate penalty, and states that, because the appellant no longer had a valid driver's license, he could not function effectively in his position. Because this reference to the appellant's inability to function effectively pertains to the agency's nexus and penalty determination, it is not part of the agency's charge. <span class="Italic">See Lambert v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 501, 505 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's decision notice is consistent with the interpretation that the charge does not include an element that the appellant could not function effectively in his position. The decision notice specifically states that the agency based the proposed removal on the appellant's "failure to have a valid driver's license, which is a condition of employment." It adds that the failure to maintain this condition of employment warrants the appellant's removal. It does not state that the charge included an element that the failure rendered the appellant unable to perform his duties effectively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, contrary to the administrative judge's finding, the agency's charge did not include an element that the appellant's failure to maintain a driver's license rendered him unable to perform his duties effectively, and the agency was only required to prove that the appellant failed to meet a condition of employment in order to sustain its charge. <span class="Italic">See Otero</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 202; <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 53, 55-57 (1997). Further, because the administrative judge recognized that maintaining a valid driver's license was a condition of employment, we find that the agency has proven its charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next find that a nexus exists between the sustained misconduct and the efficiency of the service. The nexus requirement, for purposes of whether an agency has shown that its action promotes the efficiency of the service, means there must be a clear and direct relationship between the articulated grounds for an adverse action and either the employee's ability to accomplish his or her duties satisfactorily or some other legitimate government interest. <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Department of Justice</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 585, 596 (1981), <span class="Italic">modified</span>, <span class="Italic">Kruger v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 71, 75 n.2 (1987). As discussed below with respect to the penalty determination, the deciding official explained how the appellant's failure to maintain the condition of employment prevented him from performing some of his duties to the detriment of the agency's ability to accomplish its mission. Thus, a nexus exists between the appellant's failure to maintain the condition of employment and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Coates v. Department of the Navy</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 362, 371 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if a charge is not specific, intent may still be a required element of the case, depending on the structure or language of the specification. In <span class="Italic">Schultz v. USPS</span>, 323 Fed. Appx. 912, 916 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), the appellant was removed for charges that included "improper conduct" based on use of a false document concerning federal health insurance benefits coverage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that Schultz's removal was reasonable. Schultz conceded that the divorce decree that she submitted was false. Although a charge of improper conduct does not inherently require a finding of intent, when the agency's charge is "entirely unspecific," as is a charge of improper conduct, the Board may require the agency to prove intent. <span class="Italic">See LaChance v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 147 F.3d 1367, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In this case, substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Schultz intended to deceive the Postal Service. As the Board found, Schultz's act of keeping Britten and his daughters on her health plan demonstrates that she knew that she and Britten were not divorced when she submitted the false divorce decree.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Berman v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 447 Fed. Appx. 186, 191 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), involving a specification that asserted a violation of a statute prohibiting supplementation of a federal salary from outside sources for purposes of compensation an employee, the court determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, general charging language is used, i.e., "misconduct," due process requires the Board to "look to the specification to determine what conduct the agency is relying on as the basis for its proposed disciplinary action." <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 147 F.3d 1367, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (citing <span class="Italic">Huisman v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 378, 380-81 (1987)). Thus, "where the specification contains the only meaningful description of the charge...the agency must prove what it has alleged in the specification." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Consistent with that requirement, the Board reviewed the Notice of Proposal to Remove and concluded that the sole specification underlying the charge was "[u]sing public office for private gain in accepting $383,600 from a private organization in violation of 18 U.S.C. 209(a) for performing your official duties." The Board then analyzed the violation of Section 209(a) as an element of the charged misconduct. We agree with the Board that violation of Section 209(a) is an element of the charged misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a narrative charge contains particular terms that could suggest independent elements of proof, the Board considers the nature of the narrative and charged conduct to determine whether the terminology imposes a higher burden of proof on the agency,<span class="Italic">Yates v. Dept. of Army,</span> DA-0752-10-0667-I-1 (NP 7/13/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim that the agency failed to prove that he committed "gross" misconduct, as charged, is also without merit. The agency did not name or label its charge. Instead, it merely stated that it was basing the removal on the conduct "described below." The description of the misconduct that followed explained the various instances of the appellant's improper conduct during training. It included the statement that, "[d]uring your enrollment numerous complaints of gross misconduct were reported by Course Instructors." This isolated use of the term gross misconduct, which might have been the instructors' description of the appellant's behavior, rather than the agency's characterization, is not sufficient to require the agency to prove that the appellant's misconduct was "gross," and, instead, the agency was only required to prove the stated incidents of misconduct. <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Brott v. General Services Administration</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 410, &#x00B6; 10 (2011); <span class="Italic">cf.

Appx. 923 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP)), noted, as the Board determined the narration of facts by the agency denoted a charge of insubordination rather than the labeled charge of failure to follow instructions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In resolving the issue of how a charge should be construed, the structure and language in the proposal notice and the decision notice will be examined. <span class="Italic">E.g., George v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">...</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the wording of the specification shows that the agency charged the appellant with insubordination. The agency noted that, when Simpson told the appellant that she needed him to power the LMLM back up, "[he] stated that [he was] going to do [his] maintenance route"; "[he] then stated that she couldn't tell [him] what to do"; and "[he wasn't] going to do it." The agency noted that Simpson gave the appellant "a direct order" and told him that, if he "disobeyed this direct order," he would be put off the clock. The agency stated that the appellant then told Simpson to "talk to the back of [his] hand," and "that [he wasn't] talking to her anymore." The agency further stated that the appellant "disregarded" Simpson's instructions. Moreover, in his decision letter, Plant Manager Bobby Miller stated that the appellant's past actions and record demonstrate his "unwillingness" to follow instructions and indicate that "[he disobeys] management's instructions to [him] and that [he has] little or no regard for authority as evidenced by [his] repeated failure to follow instructions of [his] supervisors and managers." In addition, Miller's analysis of the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981), shows that he considered the offense to be intentional. All of this language indicates, as the AJ found, that the agency charged the appellant with insubordination, not with simply failing to follow instructions.</p>

EEOC</span>, DA-0752-17-0354-I-1 (NP 1/26/2023) ("Although the agency charged the appellant with improper conduct, the underlying specification of AWOL required that the agency prove the elements of that offense. <span class="Italic">See Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 202 (1998) (finding that charges should be viewed in light of the accompanying specifications and circumstances).

<p class="Body-Text">Care must be taken to avoid confusing a recitation of evidence with a stated charge. If the agency recites evidence as a basis for an adverse action, the appeal is analyzed differently than if the agency states specific charges supported by evidence. In the former case, the Board allows greater latitude in supporting the adverse action than if the agency cites specific charges that it then attempts to broaden through an expansive reading of underlying evidentiary recitations. <span class="Italic">Nazelrod v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this instance, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency's first specification requires proof of falsification.
