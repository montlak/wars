<h6 class="h6" id="sec10-30"><span class="space">(i)</span> Representative Rate</h6>
<p class="Body-Text">If as a result of a reorganization an individual is reassigned from one job to another in different pay systems, a representative rate determination is made to determine if a demotion occurred. If the individual was taken out of his or her competitive level through the reassignment, the action may be reversed if RIF rights were not extended to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 99, 103 (1994) (agency released an employee from her competitive level by demotion when it assigned her to a position with a lower representative rate of pay than that of her former position). An individual promoted to a position with a higher representative rate does not have a RIF appeal. <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 462, 464, 5 MSPB 3 (1981). [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-211.html#sec1-209">Pay System Conversion; Grade Reduction</a>," for <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The representative rate formulation in <span class="Italic">Campbell, supra,</span> was revisited and applied in <span class="Italic">Bennington v. USPS,</span> CH-3330-10-0938-I-1 (NP 6/30/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed these appeals for lack of jurisdiction upon finding that the appellants were not demoted by reduction in force (RIF) or reduced in pay or grade when the agency reassigned them from their PS-08 Tractor Trailer Operator positions to vacant CC-01 Carrier (City) positions with saved grade....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants assert that the administrative judge misapplied the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 99 (1994). The Board in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 102, noted that when employees are assigned from positions under one pay method category to positions under another, the representative rates of pay for the positions at issue determines whether the appellants have been demoted. Thus, the Board in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> held that "an assignment to a position in a different pay system constitutes a demotion if the representative rate of the position to which the employee is assigned is lower than that of the employee's former position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board did not, however, ultimately compare representative rates in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, but instead found that "[s]ince the top rate of the new position's grade was less than the representative rate of the appellant's former grade, it follows that the representative rate of the grade of the new position was lower than the representative rate of the grade of the appellant's former position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 103. Although it is unclear why the Board did not determine the actual representative rate for the new position in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, here, unlike <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, there are ascertainable representative rates for both the former and new positions for the appellants, and the general rule set forth in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> must be applied. Thus, the administrative judge correctly applied <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants also claim that option 1 is not an appropriate comparison because the General Schedule does not apply to the Postal Service, that the Employee and Labor Relations Manual's (ELM's) Equivalent Grade Chart is the only reliable method to compare positions across rate schedule codes, and that the appellants were reduced in grade because they were reduced in a level of classification under a position classification system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge used "option 1" only as a comparison to show that the "Representative Rate Master Report," i.e., "option 4," was not patently unfair because there was no reduction in representative rate under either option. Even assuming that "option 1" is not appropriate for this purpose, the appellants do not provide any other basis for finding that the representative rates in the master report are patently unfair, the product of bad faith, or an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See Sperling v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 629, 634-35 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 152 F.3d 946 (Fed. Cir.) (Table), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by</span> <span class="Italic">Crawford v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 168 (1998). Although the appellants claim that the ELM is the only reliable method to compare positions across rate schedule codes, the ELM's Equivalent Grade Chart does not apply to determining whether an employee who is involuntarily reassigned to a position in a different pay classification system is "demoted" under the RIF regulations or "reduc[ed] in grade" as set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(3). Rather, the ELM indicates that the Equivalent Grade Chart is used to determine what grades are equivalent for <span class="Italic">pay purposes</span> when an employee changes to a position in a different pay classification system. <span class="Italic">See</span> IAF, Tab 9 at 95 ("When an employee is reassigned, reduced in grade, promoted, or otherwise permanently or temporarily changed to a position in another salary schedule, see Exhibit 418.1 for grades that are equivalent for pay purposes. This chart determines the appropriate Nature of Action (NOA) [code] triggered when processing a PS Form 50, <span class="Italic">Notification of Personnel Action</span>."). Moreover, each of the four options for defining "representative rate" under OPM's RIF regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.203 use the term "rate," which suggests a figure stated in dollar amounts, given that the touchstone for a "demotion" is whether there is movement to a position with "a lower rate of pay" when the old and new positions are in different pay method categories. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(4)(ii). The Equivalent Grade Chart does not indicate a dollar amount for the positions in the pay classification systems listed on the chart; rather, it simply lists "Equivalent Grades." The appellants' claim that the agency reduced them in a level of classification under a position classification system fails because they have provided no legal authority for their claim that their movement <span id="Page_3026"></span>from PS-8 Tractor Trailer Operators to CC-1 City Carriers is within the Board's jurisdiction as a reduction in grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its cross petition for review, the agency asserts that the administrative judge did not acknowledge that a manager indicated in a declaration that the agency exercised its discretion to adopt the General Schedule representative rate method in "option 1" for purposes of determining representative rates in the PS and CC classification pay systems. The agency also asserts that the administrative judge "properly found that 'option 4'--rather than 'options 1, 2, or 3'--...applies to determining the representative rates for positions in the PS and CC classification-pay systems." The agency notes that the Federal Register notice establishing "option 4" indicates that "option 4" applies to positions in a "negotiated pay system," and that under the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 the pay for most Postal Service positions has been determined through collective bargaining negotiations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency correctly asserts that it provided a declaration, below, which explained that, in its discretion, pursuant to "option 4" of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.203, it "adopted" the method described in "option 1" in order to determine representative rates. Although the administrative judge did not acknowledge the agency's explanation in the initial decision, we find that, regardless of whether the agency used "option 1" or "option 4," the administrative judge correctly found that the appellants were not demoted under either option.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the agency claims that the administrative judge should have compared the representative rates for full-time, rather than part-time flexible positions, and that the result would have been the same, i.e., no reduction in representative rate. Although the initial decision does reference representative rates for part-time flexible positions, even though the appellants were reassigned to full-time positions, this appears to be a typographical error. In fact, the $21.98 rate the administrative judge used for the Tractor Trailer Operator position appears to be the representative rate for the full-time position. We cannot find any support for the $24.81 rate cited by the administrative judge to describe the fourth step representative rate for the Level 01 part-time flexible City Carrier position; however, the record reflects that $24.19 is the representative rate for the full-time Level 01 City Carrier position, and this rate is higher than the representative rate for the full-time Tractor Trailer Operator position. Thus, there is no showing of a reduction in representative rate in any event.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency claims that the appellants' RIF and adverse action appeals are barred by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(e)(2). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(e)(2), a preference eligible "may not pursue redress for an alleged violation described in subsection (a) under this section at the same time the preference eligible pursues redress for such violation under any other law, rule, or regulation." Thus, even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellants' RIF and adverse action appeals overlap with their VEOA appeals, we find that the VEOA appeal would be barred, not the RIF and adverse action appeals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Movement from one pay system to another, with a lower representative rate, despite higher actual pay, qualified as an appealable RIF, <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 117 MSPR 488, 489-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-8, 2012 MSPB 30 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By memorandum dated March 24, 2010, the agency informed the appellant that, due to reorganization, she had been reached for a reduction in force (RIF) action. The agency indicated that, pursuant to the RIF procedures prescribed by 5 C.F.R. part 351, she was being offered a "change-to-lower grade" from her current position of Pay Pool Advisor, YA-0301-02, to the position of Budget Analyst, GS-0560-09, with an effective date of June 6, 2010. On March 25, 2010, the appellant signed a statement indicating that she accepted the position offer, and did so with the understanding that if she did not accept the offer she would be separated on June 6, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective June 6, 2010, the agency reassigned the appellant to the position of Budget Analyst, GS-0560-09. The Standard Form 50 recording the reassignment indicates that the action was taken under the legal authority of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.603. As a result of the reassignment, the appellant's basic pay increased from $52,433.00 to $52,643.00, and her adjusted basic pay increased from $50,858.00 to $60,097.00. The appellant filed an equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint alleging that the agency's action was the result of discrimination based on race, sex, age, and/or reprisal for protected EEO activity, and on February 20, 2011, the agency issued a final decision finding no discrimination. This appeal followed. On the appeal form, the appellant checked a box indicating that she was appealing a "reduction in grade or pay."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the appellant's reassignment to the GS-09 Budget Analyst position did not result in an appealable reduction in pay. On petition for review, the appellant concedes that she was not reduced in pay, but contends that she was subjected to a RIF action as a result of illegal discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant indicated on her initial appeal form that she was appealing a "reduction in grade or pay," it is apparent from her submissions below and on review that she is seeking to appeal the agency's June 6, 2010 RIF action. RIF actions are not appealable under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(B). However, an employee who has been "demoted" by a RIF action may appeal to the Board under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.901.[2] The term demotion is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Demotion</span> means a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;To a lower grade when both the old and the new positions are under the General Schedule or under the same type graded wage schedule; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;To a position with a lower rate of pay when both the old and the new positions are under the same type ungraded wage schedule, or are in different pay method categories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.202(b)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;An employee's acceptance of a RIF assignment offer in lieu of separation does not divest the Board of jurisdiction over the resulting action if that action is otherwise appealable under the RIF regulations. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 307, 327 (1994); <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 345, 351-52 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, an employee is moved from a position in one pay method category to a position in a different pay method category, it is the rate of pay of the position, not the pay received by the employee, that determines whether there has been a demotion. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 307, 318-19 (1994); <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 345, 349 (1993). Hence, the fact that the appellant was not herself reduced in pay is not dispositive of the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 348-50. Rather, we have held that assignment to a position in a different pay system constitutes a demotion under &#x00A7; 210.202(b)(4)(ii) if the representative rate of the position to which the appellant is assigned is lower than that of the employee's former position. <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 99, 102 (1994). Thus, in order to determine whether the appellant suffered an appealable RIF demotion, we must compare the representative rates of the GS-09 Budget Analyst and YA-02 Pay Pool Advisor positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For General Schedule positions, the representative rate is defined as the fourth step of the pertinent grade, using the applicable locality rate. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.204. Based on that definition, the representative rate of the GS-09 Budget Analyst position to which the appellant was assigned was $52,192.00. For positions in a pay band, such as the appellant's former YA-02 Pay Pool Advisor position, the representative rate is defined as "the rate (or rates) the agency designates as representative of that pay band or competitive levels within the pay band," including any applicable locality payment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because we were unable to determine from the record below what rate the agency had designated as representative of the YA-02 pay band or the appellant's competitive level within that pay band, we issued an order directing the agency to provide the necessary information. In response to that order, the agency has provided evidence showing that the representative rate of pay for the appellant's former YA-02 Pay Pool Advisor position, including the applicable locality pay, was $63,939.00 at the time of the June 6, 2010 RIF action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the June 6, 2010 RIF action resulted in the appellant's placement in a position with a lower rate of pay, we conclude that her appeal lies within the Board's jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.901.</p>
