<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-168"><span class="space">3.</span> Nature of the Exception</h4>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7103(a)(9)(c), the arbitrator's authority encompasses claimed violations, misinterpretation, or misapplication not only of the negotiated agreement but also of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment. The Statute essentially requires that an arbitrator consider the applicability of federal law, including management rights provisions of &#x00A7; 7106, when resolving a grievance. <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, AFLC Hq., AFLC/DPCE and AFGE Council 214</span>, 32 FLRA 261, 266 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">To avoid having their awards found deficient by FLRA, arbitrators must "consider any relevant law, rule or regulation when fashioning a grievance arbitration award in the Federal sector." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot and IAM Lodge 859</span>, 43 FLRA 1074, 1081 (1992) (quoting <span class="Italic">Louis A. Johnson VAMC, Clarksburg and AFGE Local 2384</span>, 15 FLRA 347, 350 (1984)). Law is defined to embrace "a body of rules of action or conduct prescribed by controlling authority, and having binding legal force." <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R3-10 and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 51 FLRA 1265, 1271 n.7 (1996). Law does not include the Restatement of Law. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1271. Federal law includes constitutional law. <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Comm'n and Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots, Marine Div. ILA, Panama Canal Pilots Branch</span>, 33 FLRA 15, 21 (1988) (First Amendment issue was resolved in the course of an arbitration award setting aside a suspension). "For purposes of section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute, the Authority has defined rule or regulation to include both Government-wide and governing agency rules and regulations." <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC, Newington</span>, 51 FLRA 1720, 1722 (1996). FLRA made the point in <span class="Italic">SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Kansas City and AFGE Local 1336</span>, 29 FLRA 1285, 1285 (1987), that the arbitrator's charter also embraces violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a), defining management unfair labor practices.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an exception involves the award's consistency with law, FLRA reviews the questions of law raised by the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 24 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, NIOSH, Cincinnati and AFGE Local 3840</span>, 52 FLRA 217, 220 (1996) ("As the Agency's exceptions challenge the award's consistency with law, the Authority must review the questions of law raised by the Arbitrator's award and the Agency's exceptions <span class="Italic">de novo</span>."); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1617 and Dept. of Air Force, Kelly AFB</span>, 51 FLRA 1645, 1648 (1996) (stating rule of <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review); <span class="Italic">DOJ, FCI, El Reno and AFGE Local 171</span>, 51 FLRA 584, 588 (1995) (stating rule).</p>
<p class="noindent">When applying <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, FLRA assesses whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law<span class="Italic">, Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU Chap. 156</span>, 54 FLRA 764, 769-70 (1998), based on the underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Picatinny Arsenal and NFFE Local 1437</span>, 54 FLRA 1190, 1195 (1998).

We note, in this connection, that questions of contract interpretation are questions solely for the arbitrator because it is the arbitrator's construction of the contract for which the parties have bargained. <span class="Italic">U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Labor (OSHA) and National Council of Field Labor</span> <span class="Italic">Locals</span>, 34 FLRA 573, 576 (1990). As such, the scope of our review of awards challenged on traditional private sector grounds is extremely narrow. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Legislative History of the</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute</span>, H.R.

Misco, Inc.</span>, 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987) (as long as an arbitrator is even arguably construing the collective bargaining agreement, that a court is convinced that the arbitrator committed serious error does not suffice to find the award deficient).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, an arbitrator was not consistently required to set forth specific findings or to specify and discuss all allegations necessary for the resolution of a grievance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Labor, Washington, D.C. and American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 12</span>, 41 FLRA 472, 476 (1991) (arbitrator's failure to specifically address union's argument that suspensions violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) provides no basis for finding award deficient); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army</span>, <span class="Italic">Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, North Carolina</span> <span class="Italic">and American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> 1770, 41 FLRA 56, 61 (1991) (arbitrator was not obligated to discuss reasons in support of legal conclusion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying a standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, however, it is necessary to assess whether the legal conclusions drawn by the arbitrator are consistent with the applicable standard of law, based upon the underlying factual findings. Subsequent to <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the Authority noted that its ability to review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the legal conclusions arrived at in an award is dependent on the sufficiency of the record before it. In the process of engaging in such review, the Authority further developed a specific standard to guide it. In this connection, the Authority has concluded that if an award fails to contain the factual findings necessary to enable it to assess the arbitrator's legal conclusions, and the findings cannot be derived from the record,[6] the award will be set aside and the case will be remanded to the parties for submission to the arbitrator so that the requisite findings can be made. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1997</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of the Air Force, 934th Air Reserve Base</span>, <span class="Italic">Minneapolis</span>, <span class="Italic">Minnesota</span>, 53 FLRA 342, 347-48 (1997) (remanding award to the parties for resubmission to an arbitrator as to whether the grievant accepted placement in a lower grade, nonreserve position); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 940 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, <span class="Italic">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</span>, 52 FLRA 1429 (1997) (<span class="Italic">AFGE Local</span> <span class="Italic">940</span>) (remanding award to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator for a determination as to whether the effect of a new weighting of performance standards on unit employees' conditions of employment was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis); U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office and</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 243</span>, 52 FLRA 358, 374 (1996) (remanding portion of award concerning compensatory damages because the arbitrator did not set forth the necessary and specific findings, including identification of objective evidence, to support the award).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We do not intend to become finders of fact. A remand would not be appropriate if a necessary fact were, for example, clearly established by an uncontested document that simply was not mentioned by the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, pursuant to such cases as <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 940</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1997</span>, we specifically affirm our intent, in this and future cases, to remand those portions of an award that are challenged by the exceptions and that fail to contain the factual findings necessary to determine whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. This is not to say, however, that arbitrators are required to address every factual contention raised by the parties. Rather, arbitrators are required to address only those contentions that are necessary for the Authority to resolve exceptions challenging the legal sufficiency of the award.</p>

<p class="noindent">A party who raises an issue of law, including the failure of an arbitrator to follow FLRA decisional law, must explain to FLRA what constitutes the claimed violation of law. Lacking that explanation, the exception fails to satisfy the requirements of &#x00A7; 2425.2 of FLRA's regulations governing exceptions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1406 and Dept. of Air Force, Edwards AFB</span>, 54 FLRA 150, 153 (1998).

<p class="noindent">The sufficiency of an exception based on an alleged legal error arose in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1897 and Dept. of Air Force, Elgin AFB</span>, 67 FLRA 239, 240 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring). An arbitrator sustained a suspension. One argument advanced by the union was that the arbitrator did not properly consider mitigating factors, but FLRA concluded that the exception was insufficiently specific:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;One of the Union's exceptions does not raise a ground under &#x00A7; 2425.6 of the Authority's Regulations for reviewing the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Union acknowledges that the Arbitrator was not required to apply the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the Union asserts that, using the "<span class="Italic">Douglas</span> [f]actors as guidance...the Agency's five[-]day suspension of [the grievant] is excessive."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2425.6(a) of the Authority's Regulations lists the grounds for Authority review of an arbitration award. Section 2425.6(e) provides that an exception may be dismissed if it fails to raise and support a ground for review. Here, the Union does not argue that the award is contrary to law or cite any other ground for review under &#x00A7; 2425.6(a). Therefore, consistent with &#x00A7; 2425.6(e), we dismiss the exception.[19]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[19]&#x2003;Member DuBester notes the following: I agree that the Union's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors exception is properly dismissed under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.6(e). In so doing, I note that following the implementation of the Authority's Arbitration Initiative, which included revision of the Authority's Regulations concerning review of arbitration awards, we counseled the parties that we would no longer construe parties' exceptions as raising recognized grounds for review when the parties have failed to state such grounds. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3955, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 65 FLRA 887, 889 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">Local 3955</span>). Following <span class="Italic">Local 3955</span>, in cases involving two of the recognized grounds for review in the private sector (essence and exceeds authority), I indicated that where parties articulate a well-established standard supporting a recognized ground, that action is sufficient to raise a recognized ground under &#x00A7; 2425.6. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE Gen. Comm</span>., 66 FLRA 367, 370 (2011) (finding that the union's claim that the award was not based on "a plausible interpretation of the [parties' agreement]" was sufficient to raise the recognized private-sector ground of essence); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3627</span>, 65 FLRA 1049, 1051 n.2 (2011) (finding that the union's claim that the award failed to "resolve the issues submitted" was sufficient to raise the recognized private-sector ground of exceeds authority). I have not yet had the occasion to consider whether any analogous principle applies to the assertion of a contrary-to-law exception. And, given the Union's acknowledgment that the Arbitrator was not required to apply the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in his award, I find that there is no need to do so in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Member Pizzella, concurring in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1897</span>, suggested that the union's exception, although without merit, was adequately articulated to FLRA, 67 FLRA at 243:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I join my colleagues to deny the Union's nonfact, essence, and due-process exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I do not agree with my colleagues, however, to the extent they conclude that we should dismiss the exception concerning application of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors because it fails to "argue that the award is contrary to law" under &#x00A7; 2425.6(e) of our Regulations. But my disagreement with my colleagues on this point should not be read in any sense as endorsing the <span id="page_1954"></span>premise of the Union's argument (which, as explained below, I find to be simply incredible).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike my colleagues, I agree with the proposition set forth by Member Beck in his separate opinions in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 33</span>[3] and in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1738</span>[4] that our regulations do not require a party "to invoke any particular magical incantation[&#8197;]" to perfect an exception so long as the party provides "sufficient citation to legal authority" or "explain[s] how" the award is deficient as contrary to law. Here, the Union submits that "in applying the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors as guidance...the...five[-]day suspension...is excessive." Even though the Union does not use the specific phrase, "contrary to law," it has clearly set forth an arguable contrary-to-law exception that cannot be merely dismissed.</p>

<p class="noindent">The exceptions to FLRA are to be self-contained. If the objection to an award is that it violated a regulation, the party filing the exception should supply, as part of its exception, a complete copy of the relevant portion of the regulations alleged to have been violated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1151 and VA</span>, 54 FLRA 20, 25 (1998); <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed.

<p class="noindent">A violation of federal law may encompass an allegation of a violation of a regulation, e.g., a provision of the late FPM concerning the award of differential pay, implementing a statute. <span class="Italic">GSA, Kansas City and AFGE Council 236</span>, 38 FLRA 438, 444 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local Lodge 1858</span>, 40 FLRA 236, 240 (1991) (allowing for possibility that OPM technical bulletin construing FPM would rise to status of regulation). After 1993 the FPM was placed on a terminal diet. The Manual was "sunsetted" as a result of the National Performance Review and implementation of that Review by OPM. When FLRA examines exceptions to awards, it permits arbitrators to follow the law in effect at the time a decision is made, even when the law changed during the course of a proceeding. An arbitrator may properly decline to give effect to a provision of the FPM, relied on by the union, abolished as part of the sunsetting process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 49 FLRA 1126, 1137 (1994).

In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California and Federal Employees Metal Trades Council</span>, 49 FLRA 802, 811 (1994), the Authority held that, consistent with a well-established principle of administrative law, agencies must apply the law in effect at the time a decision is made, even when that law has changed during the course of a proceeding, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary. In our view, the failure to apply the abolished FPM provision in this case results in no manifest injustice and there is no statutory direction or legislative history to apply the abolished provision.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award will not be set aside if the arbitrator correctly determines that she has no discretion to require an agency to deviate from a government-wide regulation. <span class="Italic">FAA, Atlantic City and Local 1340, NFFE</span>, 32 FLRA 426, 431 (1988).

Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">post</span>, the arbitrator considered a grievance alleging that the agency violated law when it changed procedures used by Customs Officers who board and inspect certain vessels, a change that adversely impacted overtime opportunities. FLRA required clarification of the award, but FLRA suggested that the subject matter was arbitrable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general matter, "we will not disturb an arbitrator's award that is based solely on a contract interpretation." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency, Aerospace Center, St. Louis, Missouri and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1827</span>, 43 FLRA 147, 153 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>). However, where a contractual provision reiterates a provision in the Statute, "we must exercise care to ensure that the interpretation is consistent with the Statute, as well as the parties' agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the parties intend such a provision to be interpreted differently from the Statute, "that should be made known to the arbitrator, who can then clearly specify the basis for an award." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the parties' contractual definition of grievance is the same as that set forth in the Statute. That definition, in turn, encompasses grievances alleging violations of "any law...affecting conditions of employment."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where, as here, a grievance challenges the exercise of a management right under section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, the "law" referenced in section 7103(a)(9) includes the "applicable laws" referenced in section 7106(a)(2). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Public Debt</span>, 42 FLRA 1333, 1338 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Public Debt</span>). Stated otherwise, alleged violations of "applicable laws" are encompassed by the definition of "grievance" in section 7103(a)(9).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "applicable laws" encompasses, among other things, "provisions of the United States Code or other lawfully enacted statutes." <span class="Italic">Treasury</span>, 42 FLRA at 389. In addition, in cases such as the one before us, the Statute does not limit the arbitrability of grievances alleging violations of law to "statutes that prescribe employee rights and benefits." <span class="Italic">Public Debt</span>, 42 FLRA at 1338. Instead, the Statute permits arbitration of alleged violations of "all 'laws' that apply to, or are relevant to, the subjects set forth in section 7106(a)(2) insofar as those subjects relate to the conditions of employment of unit employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator concluded that "Congress intended...grievance procedures to help resolve workplace disputes involving...certain personnel-related provisions of law, rules, and regulation."...&#8197;The Arbitrator found the grievance nonarbitrable because "the statutes and <span id="page_1955"></span>regulations relied upon by the Union were not intended to protect or to regulate...the employment interests of Customs Officers."...&#8197;Based on <span class="Italic">Treasury</span> and <span class="Italic">Public Debt</span>, we conclude that, insofar as the Arbitrator's award is based on an interpretation of the scope of a grievance procedure permitted under the Statute, the award is deficient as inconsistent with the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It also is clear, however, that under the Statute parties "may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(2).

Therefore, insofar as the Arbitrator's award is based solely on an interpretation of the parties' agreement, it appears that the award is not deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator stated that his award "must turn on what the...[a]greement says."

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 685, 689-91 (D.C. Cir. 1994), a reviewing court rejected FLRA's expansive definition of "law" in the <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> case, with the observation that laws enforced by arbitrators and, indirectly, by FLRA, must relate to working conditions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[In] <span class="Italic">Dep't of Treasury, United States Customs Serv. v. NTEU (Customs I), </span>43 F.L.R.A. No. 72[,] [t]he Authority reasoned that "law" as used in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) had the same scope as the term "applicable law" under &#x00A7; 7106(a), the section of the Statute that sets forth the management prerogatives of covered federal agencies<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 4. Under that latter section, an agency acting "in accordance with applicable laws" is guaranteed authority, notwithstanding any provision of the FSLMRS, to make all major personnel decisions. Since the Authority had previously interpreted "applicable law" to "include[&#8197;] provisions of the U.S. Code, the U.S. Constitution, controlling judicial decisions, and Presidential Executive Orders," so long as they "relate to the conditions of employment of unit employees," <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union &#x0026; U.S. Dep't of Treasury, Bureau of Pub. Debt</span>, 42 F.L.R.A. 1333, 1337, 1338 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Bureau Pub. Debt</span>), it read "law" under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) to have the same broad meaning. Nor was the term limited to "statutes that prescribe employee rights and benefits." <span class="Italic">Customs I</span>, 43 F.L.R.A. No. 72, at 4 (quoting <span class="Italic">Bureau Pub. Debt</span>, 42 F.L.R.A. at 1338). In short, there are no definitional constraints on the available grounds for grievances under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) other than that the law in question "affect" conditions of employment in some way in a particular circumstance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It seems clear to us that &#x00A7; 7123(a) (the preclusion of judicial review of arbitrated disputes) must be read in light of &#x00A7; 7103(a) (the definition of permissible grounds for grievances). Congress obviously assumed in drafting the former provision that an arbitrator would never have occasion to interpret a law that did not affect working conditions. The term "affecting working conditions," in turn, must have been thought to impose a real limitation on an arbitrator's authority. The FLRA's construction of that phrase would, however, deprive it of any limiting principle. Absolutely any law could under some circumstances have some adverse consequences on the working conditions of one or more employees. The Authority's definition thus does not restrict the <span class="Italic">category </span>of laws that may be brought to arbitration, but only suggests that a law may be the subject of a grievance if an employee is somehow aggrieved by its application--which in essence reduces the limitation to a standing requirement. We think, rather, that a "law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment" can be only interpreted, as it initially was by the arbitrator in this case, to confine grievances to alleged violations of a statute or regulation that can be said to have been issued for the very purpose of affecting the working conditions of employees--not one that merely incidentally does so. Once the &#x00A7; 7103(a) language is given that meaning it becomes apparent that a "grievance" predicated on a claim of violation of a law that is <span class="Italic">not</span> directed toward employee working conditions is outside both the arbitrator's and the FLRA's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that the arbitrator essentially got it right the first time. A grievance claiming a "violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of a law, rule, or regulation" may be brought under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) (assuming the relevant agreement tracks the statutory definition) if the particular legal authority relied upon was fashioned for the purpose of regulating the working conditions of employees. Our review is available for the limited purpose of determining whether the Authority exceeds its jurisdiction. Having determined that it did so here, we grant the petition for review.</p>

A regulation, 28 CFR 541, governed creation of incident reports concerning infractions of agency regulations by inmates. The agency argued that the regulation, involving control and discipline of inmates, precluded the arbitrator's authority over the performance entries pertaining to the employee's exercise of responsibility under that regulation. FLRA determined that the arbitrator had jurisdiction to resolve the grievance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span> [43 F.3d 682 (D.C.

In<span class="Italic"> U.S. Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service, Pacific</span> <span class="Italic">Region and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 50 FLRA 656, 659 (1995), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom, NTEU v.

Sept. 18, 1995), the Authority acquiesced in the court's conclusion that 19 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1448, before its 1993 amendment, was not a law "affecting conditions of employment" under section 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span> is distinguishable in all respects from this case. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span>, the Union sought to enforce a statute. Here, the Union is seeking to enforce provisions of the parties' contract. Furthermore, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span>, the Agency contested the arbitrability of the grievance, and the Arbitrator's arbitrability ruling was the issue to which the Agency then excepted. Here, by contrast, the Agency agreed that the grievance was arbitrable and, itself, submitted the now contested regulation to the Arbitrator to interpret and apply. This is not a case, therefore, where the grievance is "predicated on a claim of violation of a law...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 43 F.3d at 689 (emphasis omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if the grievance in this case had been predicated on a claimed violation of 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 541, <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span> also does not compel a conclusion that the award is deficient. The court stated that the terms "affecting working conditions" in section 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) of the Statute must "have been thought to impose a real limitation on an arbitrator's authority[,]" and could not be interpreted to mean that "any law could under some circumstances have some adverse consequences on the working conditions of one or more employees<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The court held that section 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) of the Statute confines grievances to alleged violations of a statute or regulation "that can be said to have been issued for the very purpose of affecting the working conditions of employees--not one that merely incidentally does so<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the statutory provision involved in <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>, which referred to employees only generally, the regulatory provision involved in this case, 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 541, is directed, at least in part, toward employee working conditions. In this connection, we note that 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 541 itself clearly and specifically addresses the responsibilities and duties of the staff with regard to inmate discipline. For example, section 541.10, entitled "Purpose and scope," states, in subsection (b)(1) that "[o]nly institution <span class="Italic">staff</span> may take disciplinary action." (Emphasis added)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, FBOP P.S. 5270.07, an Agency regulation that restates, explains and augments 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 541, clarifies the duties that staff or employees are expected to perform. For example, in Chapter 5, page 1 of P.S. 5270.07, the regulation states that "[t]he reporting <span class="Italic">employee</span> should complete immediately Part 1 of the Incident Report...."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of these specific and repeated references to staff and employee working requirements, we are not persuaded that, as in <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs <span id="page_1956"></span>Service</span>, the disputed regulation "merely incidentally" affects working conditions. 43 F.3d at 689. Accordingly, we reject the Agency's argument that, applying <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span>, the Arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to interpret and apply 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 541. Therefore, we find that the Agency's exception does not demonstrate that the award is deficient, as inconsistent with section 7102(a)(9)(c)(ii) of the Statute.</p>

The question then becomes: was the Tax Code "fashioned for the purpose of regulating the working conditions of employees[?]"[35]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Unlike in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, where Arbitrator Javits relied on the Incentives Act to determine whether the Agency violated the parties' agreement,[36] this case required the Arbitrator to analyze &#x00A7; 132(f) of the Tax Code to determine whether the Agency properly taxed its employees.[37] Although the grievance alleged a ULP, the issue of whether the Agency complied with the Javits awards is rooted in whether the retroactive transit-subsidy payments were taxable under the Tax Code. This is substantiated by the Union specifically requesting that the Arbitrator determine "[w]hether the [Agency] improperly withheld taxes from any retroactive [transit-subsidy] payments";[38] the Arbitrator stating that the "fundamental question" before him was "[whether the transit-subsidy] payments...[are] taxable"; and the Arbitrator's acknowledgment that his "job" was "simply to decide whether or not whatever amounts ultimately are paid to each of the affected employees are taxable or not."</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;The Authority in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> found that the Incentives Act and the BPA supported Arbitrator Javits awarding retroactive cash reimbursements for transit subsides, and, thus, it was "unnecessary" for him to interpret 26 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 132. <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 68 FLRA at 815.

<p class="noindent-1">While the Arbitrator stated that he "consider[ed] the terms of the Tax Code only to the extent that they are incorporated into the [parties' agreement] and establish the maximum amount of non-taxable monthly subsidy payable to employees under that agreement," he could not have determined whether the payments were taxable without looking at the Tax Code itself--specifically &#x00A7; 132(f). As noted above, that section sets forth what constitutes a "qualified transportation fringe" that may be excluded from gross income for tax purposes, and sets forth the maximum dollar amount of any such exclusion. Congress has specifically mandated the following forums where a party can challenge tax determinations like those at issue here: the U.S. Tax Courts,[44] the U.S. district courts,[45] and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.[46] Moreover, unlike the Incentives Act, which affects employees' working conditions by encouraging agencies to provide their employees with transit subsidies,[47] &#x00A7; 132(f) does not provide any employment-related benefit.[48] Accordingly, &#x00A7; 132(f) does not affect conditions of employment any more than the Tax Code provision providing tax deductions for charitable contributions.[49] We agree with the Agency that the impact, if any, the Tax Code has on working conditions of employees is merely incidental as a law that dictates how certain benefits <span class="Italic">will be taxed</span>.[50] Because Congress has carved out a mechanism for ruling on tax challenges, and the Tax Code was not "fashioned for the purpose of regulating the working conditions of employees," the Arbitrator does not have jurisdiction over this tax dispute.[51] </p>

<p class="noindent-2">[58]&#x2003;Under the BPA, awards of backpay are paid with interest calculated "at the rate or rates in effect under [&#x00A7;] 6621(a)(1) of the...[Tax] Code," which is known as the "[o]verpayment rate." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596. An arbitrator applying an established rate of interest under the Tax Code is not equivalent to an arbitrator <span class="Italic">interpreting provisions</span> of the Tax Code to determine tax liability for hundreds or thousands of federal employees. Congress directed arbitrators to compute interest under &#x00A7; 6621(a)(1) for backpay awards, but did not authorize arbitrators to assess whether an agency properly withheld taxes from the transit-subsidy reimbursement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596; 26 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1346(a), 7442; 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1346, 1491; <span class="Italic">see also Russello v.

(citation omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Union's allegations and the Arbitrator's award are rooted in a tax question that cannot be answered without interpreting and applying provisions of the Tax Code and its regulations,[59] we find that the Arbitrator did not have jurisdiction over this matter.[60] Therefore, we set aside the award as contrary to law.[61]</p>
