<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-121"><span class="space">f.</span> Settlement Independent of MSPB Appeal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Settlements of personnel actions outside Board channels require the Board to determine whether related personnel matters may be pursued through Board appeals. A global release could have the intent and effect of preventing a Board appeal of a matter otherwise within its jurisdiction. The Board may have to consider the effect of a settlement of an otherwise appealable action, e.g., a removal, when settlement reduces the removal to a suspension otherwise within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Swidecki v. USPS</span>, 101 MSPR 110, 115, 117 &#x00B6; 7 &#x00B6; 13, 2006 MSPB 21 (2006) (Board can consider a settlement agreement, including one reached outside of a Board proceeding, to determine the effect of an appeal rights waiver on a personnel action before the Board; noting, however, that the appellant may challenge the validity of an agreement that was not entered into the record for enforcement if the party believes that the agreement is unlawful, involuntary, or the result of fraud or mutual mistake). Similarly, the Board may be required to consider an appeal from a particular action that has a component, e.g., a discrimination claim, that was resolved through EEO or contract grievance procedures. [Refer to Chapter 16, "Settlement Reached in Another Tribunal."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a settlement is reached and not entered into the Board's record for enforcement, and that will occur when the settlement is reached outside of Board litigation, the Board cannot enforce the settlement, although it may consider a challenge to the settlement to determine the validity of a provision of the agreement that waives future Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Lee v. USPS</span>, 111 MSPR 551, 553-56 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-10, 2009 MSPB 121 (2009) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Lee v. USPS</span>, 367 Fed. Appx. 137 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP)), gave effect to an EEO settlement, resulting in the dismissal of a Board appeal from an alleged indefinite suspension exceeding 14 days:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before considering the appellant's PFR, the Board will consider the agency's submission of the parties' agreement settling the appellant's EEO complaint as a motion to vacate the ID, reopen the record, and dismiss the Board appeal as settled. <span class="Italic">See Swidecki v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 7 (2006). The Board will consider the settlement agreement, even though it was reached outside of a Board proceeding, to determine its effect on the Board appeal and any waiver of Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 81, 84 (1998); <span class="Italic">Laity v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 256, 261 (1994). The appellant may challenge the validity of the settlement agreement if he believes that the agreement was unlawful, involuntary, or resulted from fraud or mutual mistake.[2] <span class="Italic">Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 13. He may also challenge the enforceability of any waiver of Board appeal rights. Such a waiver is enforceable if its terms are comprehensive, freely made, and fair, and execution of the waiver did not result from agency duress or bad faith. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Board has no authority to enforce or invalidate a settlement agreement reached in another forum. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 8 n.5 (2008), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 315 Fed. Appx. 274 (Fed. Cir. 2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that, in the settlement agreement, the appellant released the agency from "all claims of any nature" that occurred before the March 2009 execution of the settlement agreement, and, thus, that the release "patently included" the appellant's December 2008 Board appeal. The appellant does not argue that the settlement agreement of his EEO complaint was unlawful, involuntary, or resulted from fraud or mutual mistake. Rather, he contends that it "has nothing to do with [his] MSPB appeal." He asserts that his Board appeal concerns events in "October 2008," whereas the settlement concerns events in "March and June of 2008," noting that "[n]o where in the EEO settlement is anything addressed about the events that took place in Oct 2008." He further asserts that, if the agency believed that the subject matter of his Board appeal was related to that of his EEO complaint, the agency should have addressed it in the settlement agreement. He contends that he did not give up his right to file a Board appeal in the EEO settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, the interpretation of which is a matter of law. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The words of the agreement are of paramount importance in determining the parties' intent when they contracted, and parol evidence will be considered only if the agreement is ambiguous<span class="Italic">. See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Department of the Army</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 9 (2005). Ambiguity exists if the settlement agreement's terms are reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation. <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Romano v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 319, 323 (1991). When the parties' intended meaning is not apparent from the face of the agreement, it is appropriate to examine extrinsic evidence of intent. <span id="Page_1035"></span><span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 546, &#x00B6; 17 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that the settlement agreement encompassed the matters raised in the appellant's Board appeal and find that the appellant waived his Board appeal rights in the settlement agreement. Admittedly, the settlement agreement did not explicitly refer to the Board appeal. Nonetheless, its explicit terms stated, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr. Lee further agrees to generally release John E. Potter, the Postal Service, and their employees and agents <span class="Italic">from all claims of any nature ever arising from his employment with the Postal Service up to and including the date of full execution of this agreement.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's constructive suspension appeal was a claim that arose from his employment with the agency before the settlement agreement was executed. Therefore, we find that the plain meaning of the settlement agreement's terms included the appellant's Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12. Further, by agreeing "to generally release" the agency from "all claims of any nature ever arising from his employment" before the March 2009 execution of the settlement agreement, the appellant waived his right to appeal his alleged November 2008 constructive suspension to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16. That the appellant and/or his representative may have made a unilateral mistake as to the scope of the settlement agreement does not provide a basis for not applying it in this case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Washington v. Department of the Navy</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6; 18 (2006). Accordingly, it is unnecessary to consider parol evidence, such as the e-mails and related argument submitted by the agency on review, and the appellant's response to that submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the waiver of Board appeal rights is enforceable. The settlement agreement stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr. Lee confirms that he has read this Settlement Agreement and Release and that he fully understands its terms and conditions. Mr. Lee also confirms that he has conferred with the representative of his choice and has been afforded a reasonable period of time in which to consider the terms of this Settlement Agreement and Release. He voluntarily accepts the Agreement for the purpose of fully and finally settling and releasing John E. Potter, the Postal Service, and its agents and employees from all claims arising out of or connected to the subject matter of this complaint and otherwise generally released by Hugh Lee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has failed to show that the settlement agreement was not freely made, was unfair, or resulted from agency duress or bad faith. The settlement agreement was signed by both the appellant and his representative in his EEO complaint, a factor that is quite significant in determining the validity of an appeal rights waiver. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee, e.g., Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 18. Further, the appellant has not asserted that he was mentally impaired or unable to understand the agreement or to assist his representative. Thus, he has not shown that he involuntarily entered into the agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-19. Again, that he and/or his representative may have made a unilateral mistake as to the scope of the settlement agreement does not provide a basis for finding the waiver unenforceable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Washington</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6; 18. Moreover, the agency provided consideration to the appellant in exchange for the waiver by allowing him to proceed through the agency's "DRAC" process, and, depending on the results of that proceeding, to potentially pay him $1,400 in back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find that the settlement agreement reached in the EEO proceeding encompassed the matters raised in the appellant's Board appeal, that the appellant knowingly and voluntarily signed the settlement agreement, that the appellant waived his Board appeal rights concerning his alleged constructive suspension in the settlement agreement, and that the waiver is enforceable. Accordingly we dismiss this appeal as settled. Because this appeal has been settled, we need not reach the other issues raised by the appellant on PFR. <span class="Italic">See Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 26.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Lee v. USPS</span>, 367 Fed. Appx. 137, 140 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board did not err in holding that the plain language of the settlement agreement covered Lee's appeal before the Board. Although the agreement primarily related to Lee's discrimination complaint and his placement as an electronic technician, it also unambiguously covered "all claims of any nature ever arising from his employment with the Postal Service" through March 12, 2009. That constituted a "further agree[ment]" beyond the subject matter of Lee's EEO complaint, indicating that the parties had contemplated that the agreement would cover situations other than those enumerated. It is undisputed that Lee's appeal before the Board arises from his employment with the Postal Service and involves events occurring in late 2008, before the agreement's execution. Although Lee asserts that the agreement was unrelated to his appeal before the Board, we are required to apply the unambiguous language of the contract. <span class="Italic">See Slattery v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 590 F.3d 1345, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010) ("A settlement agreement is a contract, and is reviewed, like all contracts, to ascertain its meaning including, if required to implement its purposes, determination of contractual intent and mutual understanding. However, when a contract's words and meaning are unambiguous, its terms are not subject to variation." (citations omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the Board did not err in finding the agreement enforceable. As the government points out, Lee has not alleged that the agreement or any portion of it arose from fraud or mutual mistake. Settlement agreements in which employees voluntarily waive their appeal rights are generally permissible, as long as the agency has not breached the agreement or acted in bad faith. <span class="Italic">See McCall v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 839 F.2d 664, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1988). On appeal, Lee asserts that the Postal Service breached the agreement, rendering it unenforceable. However, he does not explain how the Postal Service breached the agreement, nor did he raise the argument before the Board. If, as the government surmises, Lee's argument is that the breach occurred by the Postal Service's reliance upon the agreement to seek dismissal of the Board appeal, that reliance cannot be considered a breach. Such circular reasoning cannot prevail; the Postal Service should be entitled to rely on the plain language of its agreement with Lee to understand that the claim before the Board had already been settled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the settlement fully resolved Lee's Board appeal, "[t]here is therefore no case or controversy...over the merits of which either [the Board] or this court might exercise jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Asberry v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982). Accordingly, we <span class="Italic">affirm</span> the Board's decision dismissing Lee's appeal as settled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, CH-0752-14-0352-I-1 (NP 12/9/2014), applied <span class="Italic">Lee</span> to bar an appeal even though the possibility of a Board appeal was not specifically mentioned in an EEO settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further agree with the administrative judge that the waiver of Board appeal rights is enforceable, even though the agreement does not specifically refer to a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Landers v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 109, &#x00B6; 15 (2011); <span class="Italic">see also Lee</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 551, &#x00B6; 7. The appellant has failed to show that the settlement agreement was not freely made, was unfair, or resulted from agency duress or bad faith. <span class="Italic">See Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 17. She has not alleged that she was mentally impaired or otherwise lacked the capacity to enter into a contract. For a waiver of Board appeal rights to be enforceable, the agency must provide some consideration to the appellant in exchange for the waiver. <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Social Security Administration</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 67, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). Here, as noted, the agreement provided that the agency would pay the appellant a lump sum of $8000, and she has not argued that the agency failed to pay her this amount of money. It is also significant that the agreement was signed by the appellant and two representatives. While it does not appear that those representatives were attorneys, the agreement specifically provided that the appellant was aware of her right to representation by an attorney and was encouraged to have an attorney review the agreement prior to signing. And, as noted, the agreement also afforded the appellant 7 days in which to revoke the agreement prior to its becoming effective. Under these circumstances, there is sufficient evidence in the record to find that the appellant signed the settlement agreement with the belief that the consideration provided by the agreement was more beneficial than the preservation of her rights to bring additional claims against the agency. <span class="Italic">See Landers</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 109, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Black v. Dept. of Interior</span>, PH-0752-17-0162-I-1 (NP 2/21/2023), determined that a broad-scope settlement precluded prosecution of a Board appeal based on a release that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In exchange for the valuable consideration provided to and acknowledged by the Complainant and described fully in this Settlement Agreement, Complainant voluntarily agrees for himself and his heirs, executors, administrators, representatives (legal and personal) and assigns, to fully and forever release and discharge the Agency...from any and all matters, issues, complaints, claims, actions, grievances, demands, damages, expenses, and liabilities of every kind or nature whatsoever, that Complainant has raised, could have raised, or contemplated raising, arising directly or indirectly from any acts, omissions, incidents, or circumstances arising out of or relating to Complainant's employment with the Agency, up to and including the effective date of this Settlement Agreement.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...However, although the Board can consider a settlement agreement reached outside of a Board proceeding to determine its effect on the Board appeal and any waiver of appeal rights, it cannot enforce such an agreement. <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 551, &#x00B6; 4.

The plain language of the settlement agreement indicates that the appellant agreed to retire under the Voluntary Early Retirement Authority and states that the appellant understood and agreed that the settlement agreement "resolve[d] any and all claims of any nature that he has brought, or may have against the Agency...with respect to any actions occurring prior to the date of th[e] Agreement," including "MSPB appeals." It is well settled that, in construing the terms of a written settlement agreement, the centerpiece of the Board's analysis is the plain language of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Martin v. Department of Justice</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 59, &#x00B6; 20 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 188 F. App'x 994 (Fed. Cir. 2006). We therefore affirm the initial decision.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal alleging her resignation was involuntary. The initial decision held that the appeal constituted a collateral attack on a settlement reached in a grievance of the appellant's proposed removal. The settlement agreement called for the appellant to resign, to receive a "clean" Standard Form (SF) 50, and not to seek further recourse regarding the matter at issue. In her petition for review, the appellant repeats her contention below that the settlement was coerced and raises arguments regarding various constitutional and statutory provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that it will not entertain a collateral attack on a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Coker v. Department of Commerce</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 523, &#x00B6; 9, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 355 F. App'x 421 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Johnson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, none of the appellant's arguments on petition for review establish an error of law or regulation or constitute new and material evidence, so as to justify granting her petition.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant may establish that the Board has jurisdiction over an action taken pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement wherein he agreed to waive his appeal rights if he can establish that the agreement was invalid due to misrepresentation by the agency.[7] <span class="Italic">Simmons v.

<p class="Body-Text">What if, after a Board appeal is filed, the appellant and the agency reach an agreement collateral to that appeal to reduce the penalty to a level below the Board's appellate threshold? This occurred in <span class="Italic">Gosa v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 11, 13-15 (1989). The agency removed the appellant, who, as a preference eligible Postal employee, was entitled both to grieve and to file a Board appeal. The grievance resulted in a settlement reducing the removal to a 13-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Gosa</span> concluded that Board jurisdiction was divested:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly concluded that only suspensions in excess of 14 days are appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512(2); <span class="Italic">Harrison v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 26 MSPR 37, 39 (1985). She noted that in <span class="Italic">Himmel v. Department of Justice</span>, 6 MSPB 408, 6 MSPR 484, 486 (1981), the Board held that it is the agency's action at the time the appeal is filed that is determinative of Board jurisdiction, but she concluded that reliance on that principle alone would be inappropriate in this situation. We agree. Because the Board has not specifically addressed the issue of whether a resolution of a grievance may divest the Board of jurisdiction over the original action, we do so here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the factual situation and ultimate resolution of this case is very different from <span class="Italic">Himmel</span>, the principles set forth in <span class="Italic">Himmel</span> are applicable here. In <span class="Italic">Himmel</span>, the agency suspended the appellant for 30 days and she appealed to the Board. While the appeal was pending, the agency unilaterally rescinded the 30-day suspension and suspended the appellant for 14 days. The Board rejected the agency's argument that it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal, holding that the agency's unilateral modification of the action during the time the appeal was pending with the Board cannot divest the Board of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Himmel</span>, 6 MSPR at 486. The Board further held, however, that where the appellant consents to the divestiture or the agency completely rescinds the action being appealed, the Board may be divested of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Himmel</span>, <span class="Italic">id. See <span id="Page_1037"></span>also Howard v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 25 MSPR 132, 133 (1984). Thus, while it is the nature of the original action that is determinative of the Board's jurisdiction, where the appellant consents to the divestiture of Board jurisdiction, the appeal may be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency did not unilaterally modify its original action; the parties entered into a resolution of the grievance which reduced the removal action to a 13-day suspension. Although the agency has submitted evidence which indicates that the appellant initially did not agree with the resolution of the grievance and desired instead to submit an appeal to the Board, the appellant has not contested the resolution of the grievance before the Board or asserted that it was otherwise improper. Nor does the appellant contend that his representative was not authorized to enter into a resolution of the grievance. We, therefore, find that there is no basis upon which to conclude that the appellant's representative's actions were improper or that the grievance was not properly resolved. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service,</span> 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981), where the Board held that the appellant is responsible for the actions of his chosen representative. Thus, we find that because the appellant, through his authorized representative, entered into a resolution of the grievance which substituted a 13-day suspension for the removal, he consented to the divestiture of the Board's jurisdiction and the administrative judge's dismissal was proper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we do not address the appellant's allegation of racial discrimination because there is no matter otherwise appealable to the Board....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another problem involves a settlement collateral to the Board appeal with the effect of reducing a penalty to a level still within the jurisdiction of the Board. Does the collateral settlement divest the Board of jurisdiction? The Board determined that it did in <span class="Italic">Castro v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 530, 533-35 (1991). There the appellant was removed for failure to maintain a regular work schedule. He filed an appeal and simultaneously filed a grievance protesting the removal. The parties settled the grievance by reducing the removal to a 62-day suspension. Appellant sought to continue his Board appeal as to the suspension. The Board recognized that the agency had not completely rescinded the action, yet the Board maintained that it lost jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Castro</span> essentially determined that the agreement to reduce a removal to a suspension rendered the suspension a voluntary nonappealable action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, the settlement agreement indicates that the agency did not bargain for a bar to the Board's action. Thus, the issue is whether the appellant may yet appeal his 62-day suspension to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a case similar to this one, <span class="Italic">Wobschall v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 521, 522-23, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 918 F.2d 187 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table), the Board held that it lacked jurisdiction over an appeal by an employee who resigned in accordance with the terms of a settlement agreement resolving a grievance over his removal. The Board noted that: Wobschall had chosen to pursue his removal through the negotiated grievance procedure rather than with the Board; the settlement agreement was not reached during the course of an appeal to the Board, and thus was not made part of the Board record; and the Board lacked jurisdiction to enforce its terms. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board also noted that, to the extent that Wobschall's appeal could be viewed as one from an involuntary resignation, he had failed to establish that the agency had obtained his resignation through coercion, misinformation, or deception. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in the instant appeal, we find that the appellant has failed to demonstrate that his agreement to accept a 62-day suspension was not voluntary. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The appellant's desire to avoid the protracted grievance procedures and settle his appeal to avoid financial hardship does not establish that his choice was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136-37 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">see also Musone v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 85, 89 (1986) (an appellant's retirement in order to obtain an annuity and avoid the financial pressures facing him if he opposed the removal action does not establish coercion), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 818 F.2d 876 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table); <span class="Italic">Cormack v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 654, 659 (1983) (the appellant failed to meet his burden of establishing that his alleged suspension was involuntary).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because the agency cancelled the removal action and the appellant voluntarily accepted a suspension in its stead, we find no action over which the Board retains jurisdiction. Further, because the Board has no jurisdiction over the appeal, the appellant is not entitled to the hearing that he requested below. <span class="Italic">See Rose v. DHHS</span>, 721 F.2d 355, 357 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Vice Chairman Amador dissented in <span class="Italic">Castro</span>, 51 MSPR at 536:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the grievance the appellant filed concerned the same removal at issue in his appeal, the grievance and the appeal constituted separate proceedings. When an employee has challenged a single action by instituting two proceedings, the resolution of one of those proceedings does not necessarily resolve the other....&#8197;The parties to such proceedings are free to agree to settle either proceeding, both proceedings, or neither.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of an intentional relinquishment of the appellant's right to pursue his appeal before the Board, I would find that the Board retained jurisdiction over his appeal from the removal action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Collier v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 513, 515 (1991), summarized <span class="Italic">Castro</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We held in that case that, when an employee has challenged a single action by instituting two proceedings, the resolution of one of those proceedings did not necessarily resolve the other....&#8197;We held further, however, that, by freely accepting a suspension action in settlement of his grievance, the appellant did not suffer an involuntary action that was appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Castro's</span> reasoning and result were confirmed by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Mays v. USPS</span>, 995 F.2d 1056, 1057-60 (Fed. Cir. 1993), significantly suggesting that settlement of a Postal Service grievance must expressly reserve a right of MSPB appeal from resulting discipline for the appeal right to survive the settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Most postal employees do not have the right to appeal adverse personnel actions to the board. Their appeal options are limited to those provided for in the collective bargaining agreement for the bargaining unit of which they are a member. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC 1005(a)(1) (1988); <span class="Italic">Bacashihua v. MSPB</span>, 811 F.2d 1498, 1501 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (quoting <span class="Italic">Hall v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 233, 235 (1985) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Winston v. USPS</span>, 585 F.2d 198, 206 (7th Cir. 1978)). This appeal process is typically one of negotiated grievance with arbitration. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC 1207 (1988). Preference eligible postal employees (preference eligibles) have access to grievance procedures according to a collective bargaining agreement in the same manner as non-preference eligible employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In making the Veteran's Preference Act applicable to the Postal Service through the Postal Reorganization Act (PRA) and subsequent amendments, Congress provided preference eligibles an additional right of appeal from adverse personnel actions in accordance with title 5 of the United States Code. 39 USC 1005 (1988). Thus, preference eligibles have the appeal rights of employees in the regular competitive service, access to grievance procedures under a collective bargaining agreement, and the right to appeal to the board. But there is a significant difference between the rights of preference eligibles and those in the competitive service. We acknowledged in <span class="Italic">Bacashihua</span> that preference eligibles are not subject to the same statutory limitation on their appeal rights, found at 5 USC 7121 (1988), as are competitive service employees. 811 F.2d at 1501. As a general proposition, 5 USC 7121(e)(1) requires a regular federal employee to make an election of appeal procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Whitaker v. MSPB</span>, 784 F.2d 1109, 1110 (Fed. Cir. 1986). One must choose either the grievance procedures, or an appeal to the board, but once that election is made, the decision is binding and the avenue not chosen is then precluded. <span class="Italic">Morales v. MSPB</span>, 823 F.2d 536, 538 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Per <span class="Italic">Bacashihua</span>, on the other hand, section 7121 is not applicable to the Postal Service, and so preference eligibles are not required to make an election of appeal procedures; they may pursue both. 811 F.2d at 1502.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This opportunity to simultaneously pursue two avenues of appeal based on the same adverse action gives rise to the issue before us now. Where a preference eligible grieves an adverse action and ultimately settles that grievance, the question is what effect that settlement has on any subsequent right of appeal to the board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board based its dismissal of Mays' appeal on its <span class="Italic">Castro v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 530 (1991), which held that an employee's settlement of a grievance is normally considered a voluntary action over which the board has no jurisdiction. In that case, the employee settled a grievance by an agreement which contained the following language: "The above [agreement] constitutes a full and complete settlement of the subject case and resolves any and all other issues pertaining thereto." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 533. Pursuant to the settlement the Postal Service cancelled a removal action against Castro and substituted a suspension. Although the agreement was silent about Castro's right to appeal the suspension, the board determined that the union negotiated the settlement to get Castro back to work as soon as possible and Castro failed to establish that his acceptance of the agreement (presumably by returning to work) was not voluntary. Because he voluntarily accepted the suspension there was no further "action" over which the board had jurisdiction. We subscribe to this analysis and adopt it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our case the board saw Mays' position as indistinguishable from Castro's. It held that the language of the settlement agreement was substantially the same as that in <span class="Italic">Castro</span> and although Mays was not a signatory to the agreement, he was bound by his union's actions in settling the removal action. The board rejected Mays' argument that acceptance of the settlement was not voluntary because the union reached a settlement without consulting him, he did not agree to the suspension, and he was misinformed by his representative. It concluded that Mays did not make any showing that he was coerced, deceived or misinformed by the Postal Service and therefore did not prove that his settlement was not voluntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement is a contract, of course, and its interpretation is a matter of law. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dept. of Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). <span id="Page_1038"></span>The language of the settlement is unambiguous and provides for a broad waiver of Mays' right to continue to contest the Postal Service's adverse action. The phrase "full and final settlement <span class="Italic">to this matter</span>" is undeniably directed to the underlying removal action. It is not limited, as Mays argues, solely to the grievance procedure. In settling "this matter" by accepting a 21-day suspension in lieu of removal, Mays waived all further rights to appeal the settlement to the board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mays rejoins with an affidavit of his union representative, Martinez, that says Mays was advised that acceptance of the settlement would not affect his right to appeal to the board. The affidavit also asserts that the Service was aware of Mays' alleged appeal right because its representative discussed settling the grievance for a 14-day suspension, which the Postal Service specifically acknowledged would not give rise to any right of appeal to the board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7512 (1988). From this evidence Mays argues that neither party intended the settlement to deprive him of his right to appeal to the board. But the language of the agreement does not support the conclusion that the Postal Service intended to preserve Mays' right to appeal to the board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 560. It defies logic that it would have chosen to settle the grievance at all, let alone for a short suspension, if it anticipated the dispute would continue in the form of a board appeal. Indeed, Mays' own actions, viewed objectively, contradict his alleged subjective intent to preserve his right of appeal. By returning to work, he ratified the settlement negotiated by his union representatives and established his assent to the unambiguous agreement by accepting the fruits of the settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mays further argues that the settlement agreement is silent about board appeal rights and that, in the absence of an express waiver, his right to appeal the suspension to the board is reserved. He parrots the dissenting opinion in <span class="Italic">Castro</span> which argued for a rule requiring a preference eligible to expressly waive his right to board appeal in the event of a grievance settlement. The dissent cited a number of cases in which an employee had challenged "a single action by instituting two proceedings," these cases purportedly standing for the rule that "the resolution of one of those proceedings does not necessarily resolve the other" and there must be "an intentional relinquishment" of the right to pursue an appeal before the board. 51 MSPR at 536.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The argument falters because it overlooks the differences between the rights of a preference eligible and the rights of the employees in the cited cases. Most of the cases cited involved employees who brought a claim of discrimination under Title VII, 42 USC 2000e-2 (1988), as well as a separate claim under another statutory or contractual authority. 51 MSPR at 536 (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Judie v. Hamilton</span>, 872 F.2d 919, 923 (9th Cir. 1989) (Title VII and right to contract under 42 USC 1981); <span class="Italic">Perez v. Maine</span>, 760 F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1985) (Title VII and discrimination under state antidiscrimination laws); <span class="Italic">Kawatra v. Medgar Evers College of City University</span>, 700 F. Supp. 648, 651 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) (Title VII action after settling grievance under faculty bargaining agreement); <span class="Italic">Scherer v. Davis</span>, 543 F. Supp. 4, 11 (N.D. Fla. 1981) (employee settled state employment claim and subsequently brought action under 42 USC 1983); and <span class="Italic">Okonko v. Union Oil Company</span>, 519 F. Supp. 372 (C.D. Cal. 1981) (Title VII and breach of employment contract)). In those situations, the avenues for redress of the claims were separate and distinct from one another. The claims based on different laws giving rise to separate substantive rights were not mutually foreclosed by settlement of one of them, notwithstanding their common factual bases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dispositive difference here is that preference eligibles do not have two separate substantive rights. The grievance procedure and appeal to the board are simply two procedural avenues available to them to vindicate the same underlying cause of action. Both the grievance procedure and right to appeal facilitate challenges of the adverse actions set out in 5 USC 7512. Although the Veteran's Preference Act and the PRA establish the right to board appeal, they expressly say that the "provisions of title 5...shall apply" to preference eligibles in the Postal Service. 39 USC 1005(a)(2). The amendments make it even clearer that this right of appeal is a procedural right and not a new cause of action. <span class="Italic">See</span> Postal Service Employee Appeal Rights, Pub. L. No. 100-90, 1987 USCCAN (101 Stat.) 673 (preamble) and the accompanying legislative commentary; 133 Cong. Rec. 4489-4492 (March 3, 1987); 133 Cong. Rec. 21237-21240, 21242-21244 (July 28, 1987); 133 Cong. Rec. 22117-22118 (August 3, 1987) (containing numerous references to the rights of a preference eligible as "procedural" or "appeal procedures"). The burden is on the employee to expressly reserve the additional procedure if he chooses to settle a grievance. Mays did not.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board law requiring express reservation of an appeal right in a USPS grievance settlement was applied, <span class="Italic">Perry v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 272, 276-79 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an employee chooses to file and settle a grievance by agreeing to lesser discipline, that course of action is presumptively voluntary, and, as such, divests the Board of jurisdiction over the underlying matter. <span class="Italic">Castro v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 51 MSPR 530, 531-34 (1991). However, the Board will review the terms of a settlement agreement and the surrounding circumstances to determine if it retains jurisdiction over an appeal of an action that was settled in another procedural avenue. <span class="Italic">Laity v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 MSPR 256, 261 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement states that the "grievance is resolved in accordance with [the provisions of the agreement]." This provision indicates that the parties limited the settlement agreement solely to the grievance procedure and did not intend to foreclose the appellant from pursuing other procedural avenues. <span class="Italic">Compare Castro</span>, 51 MSPR at 532-33 (the grievance settlement did not bar a Board appeal because the terms "the subject case has been resolved" and "full and complete settlement of the subject case" indicated that the agreement was limited to a resolution of the grievance) <span class="Italic">with Mays,</span> 995 F.2d at 1059 (the phrase "'full and final settlement to <span class="Italic">this matter</span>" evidenced an intent that the appellant waived all rights to appeal the matter in any other forum; the phrase did not show that the parties intended the agreement to be limited to settlement of the grievance procedure (emphasis in original)) <span class="Italic">and Laity</span>, 61 MSPR at 263 (provision stating that the agreement "fully resolves any and all" matters and issues leading to the suspension was broad enough to support a finding that the appellant waived the whistleblower reprisal claim stemming from that action). Thus, we find that, in the grievance settlement, the agency did not bargain for a bar to a Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though the settlement agreement does not bar a Board appeal, the appellant nonetheless must have expressly reserved the right to seek Board review in order for us to retain jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 995 F.2d at 1060; <span class="Italic">Hedrick v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 82, 86 (1996). It is his burden to reserve the additional review to which he is entitled. <span class="Italic">Hedrick,</span> 72 MSPR at 86.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not argued that he was unaware of a Board appeal right when he entered into the grievance settlement agreement. However, we note that the agency's October 16, 1996 notice of placement in non-pay status did not inform him of a Board appeal right. The notice contained only information regarding the grievance process, stating that the appellant "ha[d] the right to file a grievance/arbitration procedure set forth in Article 15 of the National Agreement within 14 days of [his] receipt of this notice." The appellant filed his Board appeal one week after he entered into the settlement agreement. Hence, even though the record evidence establishes that he was aware of a Board appeal right at least by November 15, 1996, when he filed his Board appeal, the evidence does not show that he knew of any such right when he entered into the settlement agreement on November 8, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">In Rivas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 61 MSPR 121 (1994), <span class="Italic">overruled</span> <span class="Italic">on other grounds by Rivas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 383 (1996), the Board stated that even if a settlement agreement reached in a grievance proceeding could be construed as including a waiver of Board appeal rights, "any waiver would not appear to have been a knowing waiver of rights, since the agency apparently failed to inform the appellant of any appeal right he might have had concerning th[e] period of enforced leave." 61 MSPR at 131. The claims filed by the appellant in <span class="Italic">Rivas</span>, however, were based on different laws giving rise to <span class="Italic">separate substantive</span> rights. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 130. In contrast, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Mays v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span> accepted the Board majority's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Castro v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> that the grievance and Board appeals procedures implicated in this appeal do not constitute "two separate substantive rights." <span class="Italic">Mays,</span> 995 F.2d at 1058-60 (discussing <span class="Italic">Castro</span>, 51 MSPR at 533-36). Thus, because the grievance and appeal routes at issue here are not separate substantive rights, but only separate procedural avenues, the Court rejected the <span class="Italic">Castro</span> dissent's reasoning that there must be "'an intentional relinquishment"' in a settlement agreement of the right to pursue a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1059 (quoting 51 MSPR at 536 (Amador, dissenting)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Decisions of the Federal Circuit are controlling authority for the Board. <span class="Italic">Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 MSPR 33, 39, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Mays</span> leads us to conclude that it is immaterial whether the appellant knew of, and intentionally did not reserve, a Board appeal right when he entered into the settlement agreement. Moreover, under <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, it is also immaterial whether the agency's failure to inform the appellant of a Board appeal right when it placed him in off-duty status caused him to be unaware of such a right when he entered into the agreement, assuming he did not know of a Board appeal right at that time. For these reasons, and because the appellant has neither raised this issue nor submitted evidence on it, we find no basis on which to grant his petition for review to discuss the matter further.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though the appellant did not reserve an appeal right in the settlement agreement, he could still show that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal if he establishes that he involuntarily entered into the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Laity</span>, 61 MSPR at 263. In his response to the show-cause order, the appellant contended that the Board retained jurisdiction over this appeal because he did not voluntarily enter into the grievance settlement. The <span id="Page_1039"></span>appellant correctly points out on petition for review that the administrative judge did not address his contentions of involuntariness. Thus, we grant his petition for review to address those contentions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears a heavy burden to show that his acceptance of the grievance settlement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Mays,</span> 995 F.2d at 1059. He claimed that the settlement agreement was involuntary because he communicated with his union representative only by telephone, and it was his representative who negotiated the settlement with the agency. The appellant is responsible for the actions and advice of his chosen representative and is thus bound by the terms of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Department of Transportation</span>, 64 MSPR 365, 372-73 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 56 F.3d 83 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). Indeed, although his representative may have negotiated the terms of the agreement, the appellant signed it along with his representative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that he "suffered a traumatic, devastating and stressful situation when removed from pay status." He also asserted that the agency subjected him to "undue influence and economic duress."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The test for duress is an objective one; it is not measured by the appellant's subjective evaluation of the situation. <span class="Italic">See Womack</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 48 MSPR 348, 351 (1991). Where an appellant has alleged duress and emotional distress as a ground for involuntariness, the Board considers whether he was represented below, whether he has demonstrated that he was mentally impaired at the time, and whether he has otherwise shown that he was unable to understand fully the nature of the action in question or to assist his representative. <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 50 MSPR 676, 678 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant was represented during the grievance proceeding, and he acknowledged that he discussed the matter with his representative. The appellant's bare assertion of undue influence therefore does not establish involuntariness. Further, the fact that he was faced with the unpleasant alternatives of either remaining in non-pay status or signing the settlement agreement does not rebut the voluntariness of his ultimate choice. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 52 MSPR 344, 346 (1991). In addition, the appellant neither presented nor referred to any medical evidence that would support a finding that he was unable to understand fully the nature of the grievance settlement. <span class="Italic">See McCullough v. U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service,</span> 40 MSPR 476, 481 n.3 (1989) (appellant's assertion that he was unable to understand the settlement agreement was not supported by medical evidence), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 909 F.2d 1494 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement such as the one here, that is not made a part of the Board's record and is reached free of Board intervention, is treated as a contract. The interpretation of the settlement agreement is therefore a matter of law based on the words in the agreement itself. The settlement agreement, which is entitled "Formal A Settlement" and which identifies the appellant as the "[g]rievant" and the agency and union grievance numbers, provides that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]he parties agree that the Emergency Placement dated December 5, 2007 and the Notice of Proposed Removal dated December 27, 2007 will be reduced to a Letter of Warning for six (6) months from the date of incident.

<p class="Block-Quote1">These provisions suggest that the parties limited the settlement agreement solely to the grievance procedure and did not intend to foreclose the appellant from pursuing other procedural avenues. <span class="Italic">See Perry</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 276; <span class="Italic">Castro v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, even though the settlement agreement may not bar a Board appeal, the appellant still must have expressly reserved the right to seek Board review in order for the Board to retain jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Perry</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 277 (it is the appellant's burden to reserve the additional review to which he is entitled).

The appellant has not alleged that he involuntarily entered into the settlement agreement, was unaware of the union's activity on his behalf, did not designate the union to act as his representative, or did not ratify the union's actions by reporting to his normal bid assignment on his next scheduled work day, and he has not claimed that the union was representing its own interests and not those of the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Hanna v.

U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 995 F.2d 1056, 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1993).

Here, substantial evidence supported AJ Cummings' determination that Evans chose to settle the entire matter, including both the removal determination and the notice of proposed removal. As AJ Cummings found, the Postal Service treated the matter as if it had been fully resolved by returning Evans to work and expunging his record of references to both the proposed removal and the final removal determination. More importantly, Evans accepted the benefits of the resolution by returning to work. Thus, Evans' decision to settle the matter through grievance proceedings divests the Board of jurisdiction to hear an appeal of any matter arising from the proposed or final removal notices that Evans received. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the appellant did not initiate the grievance himself, the record reflects that the appellant was not only aware that a grievance had been filed regarding the agency's denial of his request for light duty, but he engaged in settlement discussions regarding the grievance, and did not disavow the grievance.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hedrick v.

The Board exercised jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the Board has jurisdiction in this case, we find illustrative several decisions recently issued by the Board in similar situations. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Castro v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 530, 531 (1991), the appellant filed a grievance as well as a Board appeal from his removal. He subsequently settled his grievance by agreeing to a suspension in lieu of the removal. The settlement agreement broadly waived all issues pertaining to the grievance but did not specifically address the appellant's right to pursue his Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 533. Under the circumstances, the Board dismissed the appeal, finding that, because the appellant's acceptance of the lesser discipline pursuant to the grievance was voluntary, there was no involuntary action over which the Board retained jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 534; <span class="Italic">see also Collier v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 513, 516 (1991). In <span class="Italic">Mays v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 995 F.2d 1056, 1059 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit "subscribe[d] to" and "adopte[d]" the <span class="Italic">Castro</span> analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">Laity v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 MSPR 256 (1994), the Board considered a similar situation which arose in a non-Postal Service setting. In <span class="Italic">Laity</span>, the appellant filed a grievance regarding a three-day suspension, then filed a complaint with the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) claiming that the suspension was in reprisal for his whistleblowing activities. After exhausting the OSC proceedings, the appellant timely filed an individual right of action (IRA) appeal with the Board. He subsequently settled his grievance, substituting a reprimand for the three-day suspension. The Board found that the appellant's prior filing of a grievance regarding the three-day suspension did not preclude its jurisdiction over the appeal because the IRA was created by Congress as a separate procedural avenue, independent of any other available procedures and not subject to jurisdictional limitations beyond its own jurisdictional requirements which the appellant had satisfied. <span class="Italic">Laity</span>, 61 MSPR at 260. The Board then found, after reviewing <span class="Italic">Castro</span> and <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, that consideration must be given to the parties' intent, as evidenced by the terms of the settlement agreement and the surrounding circumstances, in determining whether the Board retains jurisdiction over an appeal of an agency action that has been settled in another procedural avenue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 261. Upon examining the terms of the parties' grievance settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Laity</span>, the Board concluded that the agreement specifically and broadly provided for waiver of the appellant's appeal rights regarding "any and all" matters and issues related in any way to the agency's actions leading to the three-day suspension, and that this term encompassed waiver of the whistleblower reprisal claim stemming from the three-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 263. In view of this finding, the Board then remanded the case to address the remaining jurisdictional issue, that is, to allow the appellant an opportunity to show that his acceptance of the lesser discipline pursuant to the grievance settlement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant case differs from the above-cited cases in one important way. The grievance settlement agreement here specifically gave the appellant "the right to appeal this decision in writing to the Merit Systems Protection Board within Twenty (20) days of [his] receipt of this decision." Inclusion of this term in the agreement provides evidence as to the parties' intent regarding the appellant's right to pursue a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Laity</span>, 61 MSPR at 261. As further evidence of the parties' intent, we note that, in accordance with the language in the grievance settlement, the appellant promptly and properly filed his appeal with the Board within the twenty-day time frame provided in the agreement. We further note that, during processing of the appeal, the agency has never argued for dismissal on the grounds of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge found that he was precluded from considering whether the appellant was placed on enforced leave in 1990 because the parties had agreed to settle a discrimination claim the appellant had made concerning this period of leave.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Mays</span> court cited the dissenting opinion in <span class="Italic">Castro v. United States Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 530 (1991). In <span class="Italic">Castro</span>, a Postal Service employee filed both a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement and an appeal with the Board concerning his removal. The grievance was resolved when the employee agreed to a 62-day suspension in lieu of removal. The grievance settlement did not bar appeal to the Board. The Board nonetheless found that it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal of the 62-day suspension because the appellant had voluntarily entered into a settlement of the grievance. In a dissenting opinion, Vice Chairman Amador noted that preference-eligible Postal Service employees had both a right to appeal to the Board and a right to invoke the grievance procedures under the collective bargaining agreement. Thus, while the grievance and appeal concerned the same removal, the dissent concluded that they constituted separate proceedings and that the resolution of one would not necessarily resolve the other. <span class="Italic">See Castro,</span> 51 MSPR at 536 (citing <span class="Italic">Judie v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Mays,</span> the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit accepted the Board majority's reasoning regarding the grievance and appeals procedure in <span class="Italic">Castro</span>, holding that they did not constitute "two separate substantive rights." <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 995 F.2d at 1060. In so finding, however, the Court distinguished the cases relied upon in the <span class="Italic">Castro</span> dissent because most of those cases involved employees who brought claims of discrimination under Title VII, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2 (1988), as well as a separate claim under other statutory authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1059. It noted that, in the cases cited in the <span class="Italic">Castro</span> dissent, "the avenues for redress of the <span id="Page_1041"></span>claims were separate and distinct from one another," and that "claims based on different laws giving rise to separate substantive rights were not mutually foreclosed by settlement of one of them, notwithstanding their common factual bases." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1060.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in the cases cited in the <span class="Italic">Castro</span> dissent, the two claims filed by the appellant in the present case are based on different laws giving rise to separate substantive rights. The appellant's right to file a discrimination complaint is based on 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16, while his right to file an appeal is based on 5 USC chapters 75 and 77. Settlement of the former claim therefore does not divest the Board of jurisdiction over the latter claim. <span class="Italic">See Mays</span>, 995 F.2d at 1059, and citations therein; <span class="Italic">Castro</span>, 51 MSPR at 530, and citations therein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement at issue in this appeal does not preclude Board jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal of his alleged suspension of January 31, 1990. Although that agreement provided for dismissal of the discrimination complaint and for waiver of other rights related to that complaint, it did not provide for waiver of any right of appeal to the Board. Furthermore, even if the agreement could be construed as including such a provision, any waiver would not appear to have been a knowing waiver of rights, since the agency apparently failed to inform the appellant of any appeal right he might have had concerning that period of enforced leave. The administrative judge's prehearing ruling that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the 1990 alleged suspension, precluded the parties from having a full and fair opportunity to present evidence concerning this issue. Accordingly, remand for development of the record on this matter is necessary.</p>

For example, the appellant expresses her dissatisfaction with the grievance process and the timing of the administrative judge's issuance of the initial decision. The appellant argues that the agency committed a prohibited personnel practice and retaliated against her for protected union activity. The appellant also argues, among other things, that she did not know that she was required to choose between filing a grievance and a Board appeal, and she did not receive information from the agency explaining her appeal rights for adverse actions. Nonetheless, the appellant does not dispute that she settled her grievance without expressly reserving the right to seek Board review, and she does not allege that she involuntarily entered into the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Swink v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated July 31, 2006, the agency proposed to remove the appellant, a preference eligible, from his letter carrier position. The appellant filed a grievance, and on October 2, 2006, the appellant, the National Association of Letter Carriers and the agency entered into a last-chance settlement agreement ("the agreement"), in "full and complete resolution of the Notice of Proposed Removal dated July 31, 2006." The agreement reduced the proposed removal to a long-term suspension, but also provided that the appellant's failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement, which included a requirement to maintain satisfactory attendance, would result in removal based on his violation of the agreement. The agreement further provided that, in that event, "the only issue to be litigated" is whether the appellant violated the terms and conditions of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 8, 2007, the agency issued a notice, dated July 27, 2007, proposing to remove the appellant for violation of the agreement. Specifically, the agency alleged that the appellant had incurred eleven unscheduled absences between January 23 and June 6, 2007. The appellant filed another grievance, arguing that he was not properly scheduled to work on the dates in question. The grievance proceeded to Step B, and on September 17, 2007, the Dispute Resolution Team issued a joint report, finding that the notice of proposed removal was issued for good cause. Subsequently, the agency issued its decision to remove the appellant effective November 7, 2007.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal of the November 7, 2007 removal action with the Board, arguing that he had not violated the agreement, as his absences were on days he was not properly scheduled to work. The administrative judge (AJ) advised the appellant of his burden of proof on jurisdiction and ordered him to submit evidence and argument on the issue. In his response, the appellant again disputed the agency's contention that his attendance was unsatisfactory. Without holding the hearing requested by the appellant, the AJ dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that he had waived his Board appeal rights.</p>

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed, subscribing to the Board's analysis that, because Mr. Mays had voluntarily accepted the 21-day suspension in lieu of removal, he had waived his right to appeal that matter before the Board. <span class="Italic">Mays,</span> 995 F.2d at 1058-59.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board revisited the issue in <span class="Italic">Laity v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 256 (1994), a case concerning a non-postal employee who was entitled to file both a grievance and a Board appeal under the terms of the relevant collective bargaining agreement. Following a 3-day suspension, Mr. Laity filed both a grievance and a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), and after exhausting OSC proceedings, filed an individual right of action (IRA) appeal with the Board. The grievance was subsequently resolved in a settlement agreement, in which the agency agreed to rescind the suspension and substitute a letter of reprimand. <span id="Page_1042"></span>The Board dismissed the IRA appeal and in doing so clarified the holdings of <span class="Italic">Castro</span> and <span class="Italic">Mays</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We...conclude that <span class="Italic">Castro</span> and <span class="Italic">Mays</span> essentially reaffirm the longstanding general propositions that a settlement agreement binds the parties who voluntarily enter into it, even with respect to waiver of Board appeal rights, and that its interpretation is a matter of law based on the words in the agreement itself and, where the words are ambiguous, based on parol evidence....&#8197;<span class="Italic">Castro</span> and <span class="Italic">Mays,</span> in effect, simply add a legal presumption applicable to situations where the procedural avenues involved are a grievance and a Board appeal. The legal presumption is that if, in settling a grievance, an appellant broadly and generally waives his appeal rights without specifically addressing his Board appeal rights, the grievance settlement should be interpreted as waiving his Board appeal rights since a grievance and a Board appeal are merely different procedural avenues to vindicate the same substantive rights under title 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Laity,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. at 261 (internal citations omitted). <span class="Italic">See also Hanna v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 461 (2006) (dismissing appeal of alleged constructive suspension based on agency's denial of request to return to light-duty work, after grievance relating to the same matter had been settled); <span class="Italic">Perry v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 272 (1997) (dismissing appeal of suspension after settlement of appellant's grievance of the same action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In each of the above cases, the appellant attempted to appeal either the agency action that was the subject matter of the grievance or the lesser sanction he agreed to accept in its stead. Here, by contrast, the matter the appellant seeks to appeal was not at issue in his initial grievance. He instead seeks to appeal the November 7, 2007 removal action based on his alleged violation of the agreement, a matter which the agreement does not purport to resolve. Rather, the agreement specifically contemplates and allows the appellant to challenge such an action, in which case litigation is to be limited to the question of whether the appellant in fact violated the terms of the agreement. Hence, the appellant did not fully waive his right to appeal the November 7, 2007 removal action which was based on an alleged violation of the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor did the appellant surrender his Board appeal rights when the Dispute Resolution Team issued its September 17, 2007 joint report finding that the appellant had violated the terms of the agreement. While the report describes itself as "a complete and full settlement of the grievance," the subject matter of the grievance in question was the July 27, 2007 notice of proposed removal, not the November 7, 2007 removal action at issue in this appeal. Moreover, even if the resolution had included a waiver of Board appeal rights, such a provision would be unenforceable in the absence of mutual consideration. <span class="Italic">See Tetrault v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 376, 380-81 (1996). Finally, because the joint report was not the result of actual litigation, it has no collateral estoppel effect and we are not bound by its findings. <span class="Italic">See Davis v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant did not reserve a Board appeal right in the settlement agreement, if he had shown that the union filed the grievance on its own behalf and he satisfied certain other criteria, he would not have been bound by its actions. <span class="Italic">See Tetrault v.

<p class="Body-Text">Turning to appeals involving employers other than the Postal Service, from <span class="Italic">Castro</span> and <span class="Italic">Mays</span> the Board arrived in <span class="Italic">Laity v. VA</span>, 61 MSPR 256, 258-63 (1994), at a presumption that, in a whistleblower claim, a broad settlement of a grievance may result in a waiver of appeal rights concerning matters related to issues raised by the grievance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency suspended the appellant from his Housekeeping Aide position, effective February 25 through 27, 1992, for making disparaging remarks about a supervisor. The appellant filed a grievance regarding the 3-day suspension, and then filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), claiming that his suspension was in reprisal for his whistleblowing activities. After exhausting the OSC proceedings, the appellant timely filed this individual right of action (IRA) appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant subsequently settled his grievance. The settlement agreement provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;The [agency] agrees to rescind the three-day suspension and substitute a Reprimand for [the appellant] based on the charges contained in the Proposed Suspension letter. The [appellant] will be responsible for a charge of 12 hours of annual leave for the 24 hour Suspension. The Agency will be responsible for 12 hours of pay for the 24 hour Suspension. [The agency] will withdraw the reprimand on January 15, 1993, based upon the future behavior and attitude of [the appellant].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;Both parties agree that...this agreement fully resolves any and all matters related to the issues leading to the issuance of Suspension....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction based on the appellant's settlement of his grievance. The administrative judge denied the agency's motion to dismiss, finding that "the matter has not been rendered moot; the suspension has been 'replaced' with a reprimand and the appellant maintains that he has been retaliated against because of his whistleblowing activities."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because there is a serious question as to whether the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal, we reopen this appeal on our own motion to address the jurisdictional issues involved....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We will first examine whether the appellant could pursue both a grievance and a Board appeal regarding his 3-day suspension. Where, as here, a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) covers the agency action in dispute, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) provides that the CBA's negotiated grievance procedure shall be the exclusive procedure for challenging the agency action, with two exceptions. First, if the matter involves prohibited discrimination under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), the employee may elect either the negotiated grievance procedure or any statutory procedure, but not both; and second, if the matter is covered by 5 USC &#x00A7; 4303 or &#x00A7; 7512, the employee may elect either the negotiated grievance procedure or the Board's appeal procedure under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701, but not both. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d)-(e)(1). Because the appellant has not raised a claim of discrimination under section 2302(b)(1) and a 3-day suspension is not covered by section 4303 or 7512, neither of the exceptions applies, and section 7121(a)(1) would appear to limit the appellant to the negotiated grievance procedure for challenging his 3-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, this appeal involves a claim of whistleblower reprisal prohibited by 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). For such claims, Congress has created the IRA as a separate procedural avenue, independent of any other available procedures and not subject to jurisdictional limitations beyond the IRA's own jurisdictional requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1221, 1222; <span class="Italic">Ellison v. MSPB</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1034 (Fed. Cir. 1993). We therefore find that 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) does not preclude the Board's exercise of jurisdiction over this IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Augustine v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 50 MSPR 648, 653-54 (1991). In addition, we find no error in the administrative judge's determination that the appellant satisfied the jurisdictional requirements for an IRA appeal, and therefore find that the Board had jurisdiction over this appeal at the time it was filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1043"></span>We will next examine whether the Board lost its jurisdiction over this appeal because of the appellant's settlement of his grievance. In <span class="Italic">Castro v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 530, 531 (1991), the appellant filed a grievance as well as a Board appeal from his removal. He subsequently settled his grievance by agreeing to a suspension in lieu of the removal<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The settlement agreement broadly waived all issues pertaining to the grievance but did not specifically address the appellant's right to pursue his Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 533. Under these circumstances, the Board dismissed the appeal, finding that, because the appellant's acceptance of the lesser discipline pursuant to the grievance settlement was voluntary, there was no involuntary action over which the Board retained jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 534. In <span class="Italic">Mays v. USPS</span>, 995 F.2d 1056, 1059 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the court "subscribe[d] to" and "adopt[ed] " this analysis in <span class="Italic">Castro.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The analysis in <span class="Italic">Castro</span>, as adopted by the court and standing alone, would require dismissal of a Board appeal for lack of jurisdiction, solely based on an appellant's voluntary acceptance of a lesser discipline pursuant to a settlement, whether in a grievance or any other proceeding. That is, the mere voluntariness of an appellant's settlement and his consequent acceptance of a lesser discipline would deprive the Board of jurisdiction, regardless of the parties' intent with respect to his right to pursue a Board appeal. After carefully reviewing <span class="Italic">Castro</span> and <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, however, we find that such an interpretation is inappropriate. As discussed below, we find that <span class="Italic">Castro</span> and <span class="Italic">Mays</span> require consideration of the parties' intent, as evidenced by the terms of the settlement agreement and the surrounding circumstances, in determining whether the Board retains jurisdiction over an appeal of an agency action that has been settled in another procedural avenue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Castro</span> and <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, the Board and the court discussed the terms of the settlement agreements involved and interpreted them as broadly waiving the appellants' right to continue contesting the agencies' actions. <span class="Italic">See Mays</span>, 995 F.2d at 1058-59; <span class="Italic">Castro</span>, 51 MSPR at 533. In <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, the court also discussed the circumstances surrounding the grievance settlement and determined that they did not reveal the parties' intent to preserve the appellant's right to pursue the Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Mays</span>, 995 F.2d at 1059. Furthermore, the court emphasized the circumstantial factor that the procedural avenues involved were a grievance and a Board appeal and that, because they are "simply two procedural avenues available" to vindicate employee rights under title 5, USC, the "burden is on the employee to expressly reserve the additional [Board] procedure if he chooses to settle a grievance." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1060.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that <span class="Italic">Castro</span> and <span class="Italic">Mays</span> essentially reaffirm the longstanding general propositions that a settlement agreement binds the parties who voluntarily enter into it, even with respect to waiver of Board appeal rights, and that its interpretation is a matter of law based on the words in the agreement itself and, where the words are ambiguous, based on parol evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mays</span>, 995 F.2d at 1059; <span class="Italic">Montreuil v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 685, 690 (1992); <span class="Italic">Riley v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 55 MSPR 671, 677 (1992); <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 55 MSPR 499, 501-02 (1992). <span class="Italic">Castro</span> and <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, in effect, simply add a legal presumption applicable to situations where the procedural avenues involved are a grievance and a Board appeal. The legal presumption is that if, in settling a grievance, an appellant broadly and generally waives his appeal rights without specifically addressing his Board appeal rights, the grievance settlement should be interpreted as waiving his Board appeal rights since a grievance and a Board appeal are merely different procedural avenues to vindicate the same substantive rights under title 5. Of course, if the settlement agreement's terms specifically and unambiguously address Board appeal rights, such terms must be given effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the <span class="Italic">Castro/Mays</span> presumption applies in this appeal, we must consider two factors. First, unlike the Board appeals in those cases, this appeal is an IRA appeal. We find that this factor does not preclude the application of the presumption because, much as a grievance and a non-IRA Board appeal in <span class="Italic">Castro</span> and <span class="Italic">Mays</span> were different procedural avenues to vindicate the employees' right to challenge the agencies' actions under section 7512, title 5, a grievance and an IRA appeal involved here are different procedural avenues to vindicate the appellant's right to challenge the agency's action under section 2302, title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), 1221; <span class="Italic">see generally Clark v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 997 F.2d 1466, 1469 (Fed. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, _ U.S. _, 114 S. Ct. 920, 127 L. Ed.2d 214 (1994) (noting that the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 created the IRA as a "new route in whistleblowing cases for employees to take in appealing agency discipline"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> <span class="Italic">Fiorillo v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 795 F.2d 1544, 1547-48 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (a grievance proceeding involving a whistleblower reprisal claim).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that a whistleblower reprisal claim pursued through a grievance and pursued through an IRA appeal could implicate different rights, some of which may be deemed substantive. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(c) (providing for stays); 5 USC &#x00A7; 3352(a) (a prevailing IRA appellant is entitled to preference in transfers). We find, though, that any such differences, even if deemed to involve substantive rights and actually implicated in a particular case, do not significantly alter the nature of the "underlying cause of action"--a claim that the agency action was based on whistleblower reprisal--that could be raised in both procedural avenues. <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 995 F.2d at 1060. We therefore conclude that the <span class="Italic">Castro/Mays</span> presumption may be applied to an IRA appeal such as this.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An additional factor to consider in determining whether the <span class="Italic">Castro/Mays</span> presumption applies in this appeal is that the appellant did not raise his whistleblower reprisal claim in the grievance proceeding and only raised it in this IRA appeal. Neither <span class="Italic">Castro</span> nor <span class="Italic">Mays</span> addressed, or relied on, whether the appellants actually raised the same claims in both procedural avenues, and in <span class="Italic">Mays</span> the court appeared to focus instead on whether the appellant <span class="Italic">could have</span> raised in his grievance the claims raised in his Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 995 F.2d at 1060 (noting the "availab[ility] " of both procedural avenues for challenging the underlying agency action). We find nothing in <span class="Italic">Castro</span> or <span class="Italic">Mays</span> definitively precluding the application of the presumption where the claims raised in the different procedural avenues are not identical. Nevertheless, we find it unnecessary and, hence, decline to set forth here a general rule regarding how such nonidentity of claims affects the applicability of the <span class="Italic">Castro/Mays</span> legal presumption. We merely hold that, based on the particular terms of the grievance settlement agreement involved here, such nonidentity of claims does not preclude the application of the presumption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The terms of the parties' grievance settlement agreement provide that the agreement "fully resolves any and all matters related to the issues leading to the issuance of [the] Suspension." Thus, the agreement specifically and very broadly provides for waiver of the appellant's appeal rights regarding "any and all" matters and issues, not only those involved in the grievance case he actually brought but related in any way to the agency's actions leading to the 3-day suspension. Particularly since the whistleblower reprisal claim could have been raised in the grievance, it is reasonable to infer that such a claim, at a minimum, was among the matters and issues contemplated by the parties in agreeing to waive "any and all" matters and issues leading to the suspension. We therefore find that the specific terms of the settlement agreement encompass waiver of the whistleblower reprisal claim stemming from the 3-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only remaining jurisdictional issue to be resolved is whether the appellant voluntarily entered into the grievance settlement. Although, under <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, the appellant bears a heavy burden to show that his acceptance of the lesser discipline pursuant to the grievance settlement was involuntary, 995 F.2d at 1059, he must nevertheless be afforded an opportunity to meet the burden. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burgess v. MSPB</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Because the appellant has not been afforded this opportunity, the appeal must be remanded.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to EEO settlements, <span class="Italic">Robinson v. U.S. Peace Corps</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3010), pointed out the need for careful examination of releases or waivers contained in settlements if the agency seeks to bar further litigation through the Board under another theory, e.g., whistleblower reprisal. <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> determined that a waiver limited to the EEO complaint did not bar an IRA appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agreement was the result of settlement negotiations between Ms. Robinson's attorney and the Agency after Ms. Robinson filed an Equal Employment Opportunity discrimination complaint. Ms. Robinson's counsel amended the language of the Agency's draft of the Agreement in order to limit the Agreement to only her allegations of discrimination. Ms. Robinson later filed her IRA appeal of the whistleblower allegations with the Office of Special Counsel, and subsequently, the Board. After a hearing before the Administrative Judge ("AJ"), to address the question of jurisdiction, the Agency moved to dismiss the IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction asserting that Ms. Robinson's whistleblower retaliation claim was waived in the Agreement. The AJ granted the Agency's motion and dismissed the IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agreement, as amended by Ms. Robinson's attorney and agreed to by the Agency, is limited in scope to cover only Ms. Robinson's discrimination action. Language throughout the Agreement clearly indicates this limitation in scope. First, the Agreement is titled "Settlement Agreement in the <span class="Italic">Discrimination</span> <span class="Italic">Complaint</span>...." (emphasis added). Second, the preamble states that "[t]his Settlement Agreement (Agreement) represents the full resolution and full relief of the <span class="Italic">discrimination allegations raised in the complaint</span> filed by [Ms. Robinson], against the [Agency]." (emphasis added). Third, provision 11 states only that Ms. Robinson "shall withdraw her complaint <span class="Italic">of discrimination."</span> (emphasis added). The reference to "discrimination" was added to the Agency draft by her lawyer. Fourth, provision IV states that Ms. Robinson "shall not <span class="Italic">re-institute the</span> <span class="Italic">allegations of discrimination</span> contained in [her] complaint..." (emphasis added). Again, the words "re-institute the allegations of discrimination" were added by her lawyer. We hold that the language of these provisions limits the scope of the Agreement to include only her allegations of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only provision omitting this limiting language is V which states that <span id="Page_1044"></span>"this agreement resolves and releases in full any and all claims of [Ms. Robinson] in connection with the complaint <span class="Italic">and allegation(s)</span> described therein,..." Provision V is written in broad, general terms and must be construed in light of other provisions and not in isolation as the Agency suggests. Besides, it must be limited in scope to "the complaint" and cannot be broader than the complaint that the Agreement settles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have held that "a contract must be read as a whole...[and] interpreted in a manner which gives meaning to all its parts and in such a fashion that the provisions do not conflict with each other, if this is reasonably possible." <span class="Italic">Core-Vent Corp. v. Implant Innovations, Inc.</span>, 53 F.3d 1252, 1258 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (quoting <span class="Italic">B.D. Click Co., Inc. v. United States</span>, 614 F.2d 748, 753 (Ct. Cl. 1980)). Not only did numerous clauses, as shown, expressly limit the agreement to her discrimination "claims and allegations," but her complaint makes no reference to her disclosures to the Inspector General. We hold, therefore, that the Agreement, read as a whole and in light of the complaint, covers only Ms. Robinson's discrimination action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But another EEO settlement blocked a whistleblower appeal, <span class="Italic">Bautz v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> AT-1221-15-0577-W-1 (NP 4/18/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant's agreement "to abandon any right to pursue any administrative or judicial remedies related to the issues in the [EEO] complaint" was sufficiently broad to constitute a waiver of Board appeal rights in this instance and precluded her from relitigating in any administrative or judicial forum the "issue" here in question, i.e., the agency allegedly denying her a career-ladder promotion to a GS-15, at any time on or before the date of the agreement. In her reply to the agency's response to her petition for review, the appellant argues that the authority of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is separate from that of OSC. Notwithstanding, a complaint filed with the EEOC and an IRA appeal stemming from an OSC complaint are but different procedural avenues to vindicate the appellant's right to challenge the agency's alleged failure to afford her a career-ladder promotion in 2008. To the extent that pursuing this claim through an EEO complaint and an IRA appeal could implicate different rights, the Board has found that any such differences do not significantly alter the nature of the underlying cause of action and do not preclude a finding that a settlement agreement in the former can serve to waive the appellant's right to continue contesting the issue in the latter. <span class="Italic">Laity v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 256, 260-63 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not challenged on review the administrative judge's finding that the language in the settlement agreement here broadly provides for waiving the appellant's Board appeal rights as they relate to the issue raised in her amended EEO complaint, i.e., the agency denying her a career-ladder promotion to a GS-15 in 2008, and we discern no error in that finding. <span class="Italic">See Laity</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 263; <span class="Italic">see also Vogel v.

DOD</span>, 104 MSPR 245, 2006 MSPB 354 (2006) (implying that an EEO settlement might not waive related claims arising following the execution of the settlement involving an EEO claim based on an indefinite suspension and a Board appeal based on the failure to timely terminate the indefinite suspension following conclusion of the underlying security clearance proceedings); <span class="Italic">Vandesande v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 190, 195 (1997) (settlement of EEO claims did not moot a USERRA claim); <span class="Italic">Rivas v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 121, 129-31 (1994) (considering distinctions in the nature of rights resolved through EEO settlements and negotiated grievance procedures).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A grievance settlement may block an appeal based on veterans preference laws, <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, PH-0752-11-0420-I-1 (NP 3/7/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellant argues in his petition for review, as a preference-eligible employee in the U.S. Postal Service he could simultaneously pursue both a grievance and a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Mays v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 995 F.2d 1056, 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1993). However, when an employee chooses to file and settle a grievance, that course of action is presumptively voluntary and divests the Board of jurisdiction over the underlying matter. <span class="Italic">Perry v. U.S. Postal</span> Service, 78 M.S.P.R. 272, 276 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues in his petition for review that the grievance settlement agreement cannot extinguish his rights under the Veterans Preference Act of 1944 (VPA). However, he is incorrect. The Board and its reviewing court have routinely upheld jurisdictional dismissals of appeals by preference-eligible Postal Service employees who, like the appellant, waived their Board appeal rights in grievance settlement agreements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mays</span>, 995 F.2d 1056; <span class="Italic">Rhett v. U.S.</span> 3 (2010); <span class="Italic">Swink v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 372 F. App'x 90 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, (2008), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 315 F. App'x 274 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Therefore, the appellant's arguments based on the VPA are unfounded.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vandesande v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 190, 194-96 (1997), sums matters up: (a) a presumption exists that Board appeal rights are waived where the other procedural avenue is a grievance, and the settlement of that grievance does not specifically reserve the right to file a Board appeal; (b) the Board may lose jurisdiction over a matter that would otherwise be properly before it, if the appellant has received all of the relief he would have received had he prevailed before the Board; (c) other settlements, particularly those involving EEO, WPA, and USERRA claims are examined on a case-by-case basis to determine the nature of the claims settled, the scope of any waivers, the public purpose served by the statute giving rise to the later litigation, and the relief that can be achieved through continuing litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grubb v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 639, 643-44 (1997) (settlement of an EEO complaint with a broad provision releasing the agency from other pending or potential administrative actions had the effect of barring the MSPB case; the language of the agreement was unambiguous and the Board would not consider an offer by the appellant to present parol evidence that she was told that the agreement would not affect her MSPB appeal; the appeal was dismissed as withdrawn).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without a formal settlement, if the agency's cancelation of an adverse action is incomplete because a benefit is owed and not paid to the appellant, Board jurisdiction is divested when the appellant consents to the limitation of his relief. <span class="Italic">Frias v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 691, 697 (1993) (an agreement by the appellant to the date of termination of back pay liability).
