<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-7"><span class="space">C.</span> COVERED AND CREDITABLE SERVICE</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">To participate in one or the other of the federal retirement systems one must be a federal employee or an individual with a statutory interest in an annuity or other retirement-related benefit through a relation with a federal employee, most often a spouse, former spouse, or other direct relative. Assuming that an individual is or was a federal employee, to qualify for an annuity, that individual must also have covered and creditable service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Covered service refers to federal employees who are "subject to" the CSRS or FERS, i.e., employees who must deposit part of their basic pay into the retirement funds. Creditable service includes (1) federal civilian service performed by an individual meeting all of the provisions of 5 USC 2105(a); (2) military service and service with the District of Columbia Government, with qualifications and exceptions; (3) service specifically listed in 5 USC 8331(1) or 8332; and (4) service made creditable by statute, such as Postal Service employment under 39 USC 1005(b). Excluded from coverage are employees whose employment is temporary or intermittent, although that service may be credited and may support retirement if covered employment is secured.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Noveloso v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 321, 323-25 (1990), distinguished covered service and service credit for CSRS:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two types of Federal service are pertinent to a determination of whether an individual is entitled to a retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement Act (CSRA)--"creditable service" and "covered service." <span class="Italic">Herrera v. United States,</span> 849 F.2d 1416, 1417 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Almost all Federal service is creditable service. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>[1] Covered service is more limited in scope, referring to Federal employees who are "subject to" the CSRA, i.e., employees who must deposit part of their basic pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. <span class="Italic">See In re Kaltakji,</span> 1 MSPR 63, 64 (1978), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 1 MSPR 61 (1979). To qualify for a civil service retirement annuity, an employee must complete at least five years of creditable civilian service, and must have served at least one of her last two years of Federal service in a covered position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a)-(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Generally speaking, creditable service includes the following: (1) Federal civilian service performed by an individual meeting all of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a); (2) military service and service with the District of Columbia Government with certain qualifications and exceptions; (3) any service specifically listed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(1) or 8332; and (4) any service made creditable <span id="Page_4079"></span>by statute, such as Postal Service employment under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(b). <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Supp. 831-1, subch. S3-1 (Mar. 29, 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an individual's creditable service also constitutes covered service, the rule is that "[a]ll employees are covered by the retirement system except those specifically excluded by law or by regulations of the Office of Personnel Management."[2] FPM Supp. 831-1, subch. S2-1 (Sept. 21, 1981). Congress has authorized OPM to exclude from retirement coverage employees "whose employment is temporary or intermittent." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(g). OPM has exercised this authority, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> by excluding from retirement coverage employees serving under appointments limited to one year or less, intermittent employees, and employees serving under nonpermanent, indefinite appointments. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(1)-(2), (12)-(13). The exclusions contained in section 831.201(a) do not in any way affect the <span class="Italic">creditability</span> of an employee's service, however; they pertain only to the CSRA's <span class="Italic">covered service</span> requirement. <span class="Italic">See Herrera,</span> 849 F.2d at 1417-18; <span class="Italic">Kaltakji</span> [<span class="Italic">supra</span>].[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;An "employee" is defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(1)(A)-(K). Statutory exclusions from covered service are enumerated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(1)(i)-(xii). Regulatory exclusions from covered service are enumerated in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201. Whether retirement deductions were actually withheld is not necessarily determinative. If no deductions were withheld because of agency error, or because it was not determined until after the fact that such service should have been covered, the employment will still constitute covered service. <span class="Italic">See Kaltakji [supra]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">;</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.303.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;To the extent that previous Board decisions have held that temporary or indefinite appointments do not constitute creditable service, they are hereby overruled. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fontanilla v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 34 M.S.P.R. 611, 613 (1987) (service under temporary interim appointment "was not creditable because it was not covered by the Civil Service Retirement Act"); <span class="Italic">Cruz v.

Office of Personnel Management,</span> 4 M.S.P.R. 546, 547 (1981) (same). We note, however, that the denial of retirement benefits was proper in each of these cases, since none of the appellants had met the covered service requirement of the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's personnel records clearly indicate that she was an "employee" as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(1)(A) and 2105(a).[4] Since it is undisputed that she served more than five years in this civilian position, she therefore met the creditable service requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a). OPM's reconsideration decision and the Board's initial decision were thus in error when they stated that the appellant failed to complete five years of creditable civilian service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;An individual is an employee under these provisions if she was (1) appointed in the civil service by a Federal official acting in his official capacity, (2) engaged in the performance of a Federal function under authority of law or executive act, and (3) under the supervision of a named Federal official while engaged in the performance of the duties of her position. <span class="Italic">See Horner v. Acosta,</span> 803 F.2d 687, 691 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not, however, meet the covered service requirement of section 8333(b). The appellant's personnel records specifically indicate that she was appointed to an "Indefinite (Intermittent)" position that was not subject to the CSRA. Her appointment thus fell within the exclusions from covered service contained at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(2) and (a)(13). The appellant's records do indicate that, subsequent to her initial appointment, her schedule was changed from part-time to full-time work. Even if this change had the effect of making her employment no longer "intermittent" within the meaning of section 831.201(a)(2), nothing in the record reflects any change in the "indefinite" character of her appointment, or that she ever made contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although OPM's reconsideration decision and the Board's initial decision incorrectly stated that the appellant failed to meet the creditable service requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a), we conclude that OPM's denial of the appellant's application for a deferred annuity was proper, since she failed to meet the covered service requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similar analysis was provided in <span class="Italic">Delz Cruz v. OPM</span>, 553 Fed. Appx. 977, 978-79 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To qualify for a civil service retirement annuity, a government employee ordinarily must complete at least five years of creditable service, and at least one of the two years before separation must be in "covered" service, i.e., service that is subject to the Civil Service Retirement System. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a)-(b); <span class="Italic">Quiocson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 490 F.3d 1358, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Not all creditable service is covered service. <span class="Italic">See Rosete v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 48 F.3d 514, 516 (Fed. Cir. 1995). "Covered service only includes an appointment that is subject to the CSRA and for which an employee must deposit part of his or her pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(g), the Office of Personnel Management "may exclude from" coverage under the CSRS "an employee or group of employees in or under an Executive agency whose employment is temporary or intermittent." The Office has promulgated specific regulatory exclusions from covered service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(1)-(17). Among the excluded employees are (1) "[e]mployees serving under appointments limited to one year or less," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(1), and (2) "[e]mployees serving under nonpermanent appointments, designated as indefinite," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(13).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dela Cruz does not challenge the Board's finding that he served only in excepted temporary and excepted indefinite appointments that were not covered by the CSRS. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., Informal Br. of Appellant at 3 ("[M]y service...was not subject to retirement deduction because it was excluded from retirement coverage under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201."). Indeed, we see no evidence that CSRS deductions were made from Mr. Dela Cruz's pay, and his SF-50s reflect his retirement plan as "None," which provides important evidence of a lack of participation in the CSRS. <span class="Italic">See Rosete</span>, 48 F.3d at 519-20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead, Mr. Dela Cruz contends that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(c) and its implementing regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.303(a), his creditable service, though not covered by the CSRS, entitles him to make a deposit toward, and then receive, a CSRS retirement annuity. That contention is wrong. Section 8334(c) gives current and former federal employees who have eligible CSRS service the right to make a deposit for service for which deductions or deposits have not been made. It does not, however, allow someone without any service covered by the CSRS to make a CSRS deposit. <span class="Italic">See Dela Rosa v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 583 F.3d 762, 765 (Fed. Cir. 2009) ("the class of person permitted to make a deposit pursuant to &#x00A7; 8334(c)" includes only those "former employees" who are "already covered by the CSRS"); <span class="Italic">see also Calilong v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 527 F. App'x 950, 952 (Fed. Cir. 2013); <span class="Italic">Calimlim v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 489 F. App'x 458, 460 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">Esposo v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 321 F. App'x 961, 963 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Likewise, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.303(a), which allows those already covered by the CSRS to include certain creditable service in calculating a retirement annuity, does not permit Mr. Dela Cruz to make a CSRS deposit for his non-covered service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fontilla v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 482 F. App'x 563, 565 (Fed. Cir. 2012) ("There is nothing in the language of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.303(a) to support the argument that it retroactively converted 'creditable service' into 'covered service' or changed who qualified for an annuity.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Reboja v. OPM</span>, 752 Fed. Appx. 977, 980 (Fed. Cir. 2018 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ correctly determined that Reboja's federal service was excluded from CSRA coverage because none of Reboja's SF-50 forms indicated that his service was covered, because CSRS contributions were not deducted from his pay, and because he was paid a lump-sum severance benefit in accordance with the CBA. Thus, the AJ correctly determined that Reboja is not eligible for a CSRS annuity because his appointment was not covered service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 831.303(a) does not compel a different result. As this court has held previously, &#x00A7; 831.303(a) does not alter the definition of covered service or convert creditable service into covered service. <span class="Italic">See Lledo v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 886 F.3d 1211, 1214 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (concluding that "&#x00A7; 831.303(a) does not alter the definition of covered service, or convert creditable service into covered service" (citations omitted)); <span class="Italic">see also Dullas v.

Because &#x00A7; 831.303(a) does not convert Reboja's service into covered service, the AJ did not err in affirming OPM's determination that Reboja is not entitled to an annuity.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Blasco v. OPM</span>, PH-0831-16-0141-I-1 (NP 6/24/2022), explained why intermittent employment was not "covered" employment sufficient to meet the requirement of one year of covered employment during the two years prior to separation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM denied the appellant's application, initially and on reconsideration, explaining that, when he retired, he was age 62 with 18 years, 2 months, and 12 days of creditable service, and that, due to the nature of his intermittent appointment, he did not meet the "one out of two" requirement for an annuity. In its reconsideration decision, OPM referred to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b), stating that the appellant "did not complete 1 year of continued service within the 2 years immediately preceding [his] separation in a position subject to the [Civil Service] Retirement Act."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's entitlement to an annuity is governed by chapter 83 of title 5 of the U.S. Code. Two types of Federal service are pertinent to a determination of whether an individual is entitled to a retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement Act (CSRA)--"creditable service" and "covered service." Almost all Federal service is creditable service. Covered service is more limited in scope, referring to Federal employees who are "subject to" the CSRA, i.e., employees who must deposit part of their basic pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (the Fund). <span class="Italic">Noveloso v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 321, 323 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 925 F.2d 1478 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are two requirements that govern eligibility for an annuity under the CSRA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333. The first is that the employee must have completed at least 5 years of civilian service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a). There is no question that the appellant met this requirement. In finding that he also met the second requirement, the administrative judge agreed with the appellant that the law requires only that 1 of his last 2 years have been covered service, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b), which it was.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Early on in the adjudication of this appeal, OPM took the position that the appellant had not been engaged in "covered service" for 1 of the last 2 years before his separation. Ultimately OPM acknowledged that the appellant's service was covered because retirement contributions were deducted from his salary during his last appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the administrative judge misreads 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b) as not requiring that 1 of the appellant's last 2 years also be creditable service. Subpart (b) requires that an employee has completed, within the last 2 years before any separation from service, except a separation because of death or disability, <span class="Italic">at least 1 year of creditable civilian service</span> that is covered service. The issue here is whether, because of his intermittent schedule, the appellant had 1 year of creditable service out of his last 2 years of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Intermittent employment means employment without a regularly scheduled tour of duty. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 340.401(b). There is no dispute that the appellant had an intermittent work schedule. OPM's <span class="Italic">Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices (Handbook)</span> explains how such service is credited. <span class="Italic">De Laet v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 390, 394 (1996) (recognizing that the <span class="Italic">Handbook</span> is an authoritative interpretation of employee rights and agency responsibilities under Federal retirement laws); <span class="Italic">see Handbook</span> (April 1998), <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publicationsforms/csrsfers-handbook/">https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publicationsforms/csrsfers-handbook/</a> (last visited June 23, 2022). It provides that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, such employees can only receive credit for time they actually served. <span class="Italic">See Handbook</span>, Section 20A3.1-1(C)(1); <span class="Italic">see also Handbook</span>, Section 50A2.1-3(G)(1) (generally, when an individual is employed on an intermittent basis without a prearranged regularly scheduled tour of duty, only the actual days in a pay status are credited). Therefore, even though the appellant's service was covered service, because he only worked 1 month and 10 days in 2013 and 27 days in 2014, his last 2 years of service, he did not complete 1 year of creditable civilian service prior to his 2014 separation, and therefore he is not entitled to an annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Notwithstanding this disposition, the appellant is entitled to have returned to him the amounts deducted from his pay during this period of service for which no eligibility for an annuity has been established. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reversing the initial decision, we agree with OPM that the administrative judge erred in crediting the appellant's witnesses, DVA employees who worked in the agency's retirement counseling center, who testified at the hearing that, over the years, other similarly situated employees had received retirement benefits from OPM. That testimony is not relevant to the matter at issue because it involves statutory interpretation, which is a question of law, and therefore such unsubstantiated anecdotal evidence has no bearing on this case. <span class="Italic">Herrera v. United States</span>, 849 F.2d 1416, 1417-18 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Nor do we attach any significance to the fact that OPM originally found the appellant eligible for benefits, and then, in its subsequent decision, found that he was not, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 6, or that, even then, it incorrectly maintained that his ineligibility was due to the fact that his service was not covered, <span class="Italic">id</span>. Payments of money from the Fund are limited to those authorized by statute, <span class="Italic">see Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 416 (1990), and the requirements for eligibility for a retirement benefit are substantive legal requirements that allow for no administrative discretion by OPM or by the Board. <span class="Italic">Andrada v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 226, 233, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 132 F.3d 55 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table).</p>
