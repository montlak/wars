<p class="Body-Text">Suitability regulations establish a delegation, subject to revocation, from OPM allowing agencies to make suitability determinations and to take suitability actions, 5 CFR 731.103 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 731.103 <span class="Italic">Delegation to agencies.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Subject to the limitations and requirements of paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, OPM delegates to the heads of agencies authority for making suitability determinations and taking suitability actions (including limited, agency-specific debarments under &#x00A7; 731.205) in cases involving <span class="Italic">applicants</span> for and <span class="Italic">appointees</span> to covered positions in the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;OPM may revoke an agency's delegation to make suitability determinations and take suitability actions under this part if an agency fails to conform to this part or OPM issuances as described in &#x00A7; 731.102(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;OPM retains jurisdiction to make final determinations and take actions in all suitability cases where there is evidence that there has been a material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment. OPM also retains jurisdiction over all suitability cases involving a refusal to furnish testimony as required by &#x00A7; 5.4 of this chapter. Agencies must refer these cases to OPM for suitability determinations and suitability actions under this authority. Although no prior approval is needed, notification to OPM is required if the agency wants to take, or has taken, action under its own authority (5 CFR part 315, 5 CFR part 359, or 5 CFR part 752) in cases involving material, intentional false statement in examination or appointment, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment; or refusal to furnish testimony as required by &#x00A7; 5.4 of this title. In addition, paragraph (a) of this section notwithstanding, OPM may, in its discretion, exercise its jurisdiction under this part in any case it deems necessary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of an agency suitability determination under delegated authority from OPM, resulting in removal and debarment of the appellant from future employment with the respondent agency, is <span class="Italic">Brown v. SSA</span>, 118 MSPR 128, 129-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-14, 2012 MSPB 65 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has petitioned for a review of an initial decision sustaining his removal and debarment from employment with the Social Security Administration for a period of 3 years. For the reasons discussed below, we AFFIRM the initial decision as MODIFIED by this Opinion and Order and SUSTAIN the appellant's removal and debarment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">Background</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to his appointment with the Social Security Administration (SSA), the appellant was employed by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). On July 19, 2009, the appellant was hired by SSA as a Contact/Teleservice Representative (TSR), GS-07.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a TSR, the appellant had access to information on "virtually every citizen and large numbers of non-citizens," including an individual's social security number, date of birth, place of birth, mother's name, father's name, and Internal Revenue Service data including records of earnings and where the individual was working. If the individual were an SSA beneficiary using direct deposit, the appellant could also access that person's bank account information. As a TSR, the appellant had the ability to make changes to Social Security records without supervisory approval. The Standard Form 50 (SF-50) pertaining to the appellant's appointment <span id="Page_761"></span>indicated that the appointment was "subject to satisfactory completion of [a] required security and/or suitability investigation. Accordingly, the agency requested a background check on the appellant from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which ran a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;SSA procedures require that employees be fingerprinted when they enter on duty and that the FBI check the individual's fingerprints to determine if the individual has a criminal history. This is consistent with Executive Order No. 10450 &#x00A7; 3(a), which states that: "The appointment of each civilian officer or employee in any department or agency of the Government shall be made subject to investigation...[I]n no event shall the investigation include less than a national agency check (including a check of the fingerprint files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation), and written inquiries to appropriate local law-enforcement agencies, former employers and supervisors, references, and schools attended by the person under investigation...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The background check performed on the appellant revealed that, prior to beginning his employment with SSA, the appellant applied for a position with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). As part of the FBI application process, the appellant agreed to undergo polygraph testing, which was conducted on July 14, 2008. During the 2008 polygraph, the appellant gave answers that were determined to be "indicative of deception." In a post-test interview with the FBI, the appellant signed statements admitting to the following conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The appellant's relative allowed the appellant to register his vehicle at the relative's residence in Albany, NY instead of Manhattan so that the appellant's insurance rates would be lower.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The appellant's cousin obtained credit cards fraudulently and gave the appellant a $100 gift card on one occasion which the appellant then gave to a friend.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;While in graduate school, the appellant would obtain other students' identification information and use this information to obtain fraudulent credit cards. The appellant did this on three to five occasions and applied for credit cards in the names of the other students. He used these cards to purchase merchandise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;During college, when the appellant went shopping at the mall, he would shoplift items. He also shoplifted since leaving college, including one event as recently as a week before the polygraph exam.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;In 2007, the appellant was sued by a creditor for $11,000. At one point, the creditor attempted to collect the debt, and the debt eventually went to civil court. "All along [the appellant] knew this debt was truly [his] but [he] did not want to pay it. [He] told the creditor via an affidavit that this debt was NOT [his] when it actually was."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;In the pre-test interview and application with the FBI, the appellant stated that another particular debt was not his "due to 'identity theft' but following the polygraph the appellant admitted that the debt was actually his.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency placed the appellant on administrative leave starting on February 16, 2010. On February 19, 2010, the agency proposed the appellant's removal and debarment from employment with SSA for a period of three years under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731 for "dishonest conduct." In his response to the notice of proposed action, the appellant alleged that he had been the subject of discrimination based upon race (black) and sex (male) and that the agency's request for the polygraph results was part of a management official's "campaign of sexual harassment" towards him. The appellant also contended that, because no other SSA employees were the subject of an FBI polygraph, he had been subjected to disparate treatment. In the agency's notice of decision, the deciding official explained why he found the appellant's arguments unpersuasive. The appellant was then informed that he was removed effective April 2, 2010, and barred from employment with SSA until March 25, 2013.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a timely appeal, asserting race and sex discrimination and that he was subjected to a more extensive background check than was warranted. In response to the administrative judge's order to provide information regarding his assertions of race and sex discrimination, the appellant stated that, because he came to the SSA from another "Federal agency," there was no reason for SSA to perform the background check and "specifically no need" to obtain the FBI report from his polygraph. In his pre-hearing submission, the appellant asserted that the issues before the Board were whether: (1) the agency acted properly in requesting and obtaining the FBI report; (2) the agency acted properly in removing the appellant from his position based on the information in the FBI report; and (3) the agency's use of the FBI report was part of a campaign of sexual harassment.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The prehearing conference memorandum did not address the appellant's affirmative defenses other than race and sex discrimination, and the administrative judge did not discuss why she did not include as a defense the appellant's assertion that the agency acted improperly in conducting the investigation or requesting and obtaining the FBI report.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following a hearing, the administrative judge determined that the agency proved by preponderant evidence that the appellant was unsuitable for employment with SSA and that the appellant failed to prove his affirmative defenses of race or sex discrimination. The administrative judge addressed whether the background investigation and use of the FBI report were discriminatory, but did not address whether the agency's investigation and possession of the report was improper for other reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">Analysis</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">A background check to determine the appellant's suitability was required by federal regulations</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The federal regulations in place at the relevant time stated that an investigation was required when a person was hired into a covered position unless the person had already undergone a background investigation and one of four additional criteria was met. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.104(a) (2009).[6] A "[c]overed position means a position in the competitive service, a position in the excepted service where the incumbent can be noncompetitively converted to the competitive service, and a career appointment to a position in the Senior Executive Service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b). The appellant's position with SSA was in the competitive service and thus was a covered position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The language from 5 C.F.R. Part 731 used here was in effect at the time the appellant was hired and the background investigation was performed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 73 Fed. Reg. 66492 (Nov. 10, 2008); <span class="Italic">but see</span> 76 Fed. Reg. 69608 (Nov. 9, 2011) (modifying 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.104 to add a fifth criteria). We note that under the regulations that took effect in 2011, the outcome of this case would not differ.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the order from the Clerk of the Board, the appellant admits that he is unable "to provide specific evidence...of the background check that was conducted by the Postal Service when he was hired by them. However, the appellant has provided evidence that when the Postal Service performs background checks it uses OPM's services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, public officials are presumed to have properly discharged their official duties. <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service v. Gregory,</span> 534 U.S. 1, 10 (2001) (holding "that a presumption of regularity attaches to the actions of Government agencies"); <span class="Italic">Dow v. General Services Administration,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 342, &#x00B6; 11 (2008). Thus, if OPM had previously performed a background check on the appellant for the Postal Service and under its own regulations a new check of the appellant's record was not warranted, we presume that OPM would not have performed this check and would have notified the agency that such a check was not warranted. The agency has provided evidence that it is OPM's practice to provide such notifications. Because the regulations require that a background check must have been conducted in order to exempt an individual from a new check, and the appellant has not shown that a background check occurred prior to his employment with SSA, the appellant has not shown that the background check performed in 2009 was improper. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.104 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Because SSA was authorized by the appellant to obtain the FBI's information about the appellant, its use of this information cannot constitute harmful procedural error</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Harmful procedural error is defined as error by an agency in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)] . Thus, by definition, a harmful procedural error by the agency cannot be found if the agency has not erred. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The record shows that the appellant signed an OF-306, Declaration for Federal Employment, which stated: <span class="Italic">"I consent</span> to the release of information about my ability and fitness for Federal employment by employers, schools, law enforcement agencies, and other individuals and organizations to investigators, personnel specialists, and other authorized employees or representatives of the Federal Government." The appellant also signed an SF-85 release form, which stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">I Authorize</span> any investigator, special agent, or other duly accredited representative of the authorized Federal agency conducting my background investigation, to obtain any information relating to my activities from schools, residential management agents, employers, criminal justice agencies, retail business establishments, or other sources of information. This information may include, but is not limited to, my academic, residential, achievement, performance, attendance, disciplinary, employment history, and criminal history record information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the record indicates that on two separate occasions the appellant <span id="Page_762"></span>expressly authorized the FBI, as a law enforcement agency or a criminal justice agency, to release information about his fitness for employment to investigators, personnel specialists, and other authorized Government employees. Therefore, there was nothing improper about OPM--as the agency investigating the appellant--obtaining information about the appellant's suitability from the FBI or providing that information to SSA's personnel specialists. Similarly, there was nothing improper about SSA using the information to determine if the appellant was suitable for employment, as that was the express reason for the appellant's authorization. As there was no error by the agencies involved in SSA obtaining and using this information, by definition there could not be harmful error in the acquisition and use of this information. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge did not err when she determined that the appellant failed to prove the affirmative defenses of racial discrimination, sex-based discrimination, or sexual harassment</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted that he was subjected to disparate treatment on account of his race (black) and sex (male) when the agency requested a copy of the FBI's investigative polygraph report. The appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in evaluating these assertions because she "relied excessively" on the testimony of Ms. Freeburn. However, the initial decision indicates that the administrative judge did not rely upon Ms. Freeburn's conclusions regarding the appellant's allegations but that she noted Ms. Freeburn's testimony and relied upon the record as a whole in evaluating the appellant's discrimination claims. Furthermore, we discern no error by the administrative judge with respect to her own conclusions that the appellant failed to prove his allegations of hostile work environment or <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment. Accordingly, the appellant's removal and debarment are affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A suitability determination, delegated to an agency, is distinct from an objection made by the agency and sustained by OPM concerning the qualifications of an individual on a register with veterans preference and who, without the objection, would be entitled to an appointment made from the register. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vislisel v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 679, 682 (1986). The passover of the individual with veterans preference is not appealable as a negative suitability determination, although it may be that review with the Board could be sought under VEOA. [The passover process is described earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-328.html#sec1-320">Veterans Employment Opportunities Act</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is an assertion that an agency barred an applicant, as unsuitable, for any agency or subagency positions, and if the assertion is nonfrivolous, that is, specific and supported by some acceptable evidence, the appellant should receive a jurisdictional hearing. The AJ should not assess agency submissions and summarily resolve against the appellant factual issues as to the nature of the agency's employment action. <span class="Italic">See Grant v. Dept. of Interior</span>, AT-0731-17-0661-I-1 (NP 1/25/2023) ("The appellant has made numerous allegations of fact, supported by the language contained in the agency's own letters, that its suitability determination applied to multiple agency positions and thus was not a singular nonselection or cancellation of eligibility for a specific position. This allegation, if proven, would mean the agency took a 'suitability action' covered by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(a), which is within the Board's jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501. As such, we conclude that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction and is entitled to a hearing on the jurisdictional question. <span class="Italic">Lara</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 7."); <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Solis v. DHS</span>, DA-3443-14-0065-I-1 (NP 7/23/2014) ("Here, the administrative judge weighed the evidence and resolved conflicting assertions without holding a hearing, determining that the December 2012 letter was limited to the two positions tentatively offered to the appellant. We find that the administrative judge erred when he resolved conflicting assertions in the agency's documents and improperly denied the appellant a jurisdictional hearing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Regulations in effect before 2008 also allowed OPM to delegate to agencies responsibility for making suitability determinations. The individual deemed unsuitable by an employing agency under an to OPM delegation could appeal to the Board in the same manner that the applicant would have if OPM made the suitability determination<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">McCormack v. DOJ</span>, 22 MSPR 408, 411 (1984). The delegation scheme under regulations controlling before 2008 was explained in <span class="Italic">McCormack v. DOJ</span>, 22 MSPR 408, 410-11 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n 1980 OPM delegated to INS limited authority to make final suitability determinations under 5 C.F.R. Part 731 of applicants for the position of Border Patrol Agent.... INS accepted responsibility for defending any appeal to the Board of INS actions under the delegated authority....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argued that the delegation documents demonstrate that there was no intent by either OPM or INS to divest the Board of its existing jurisdiction to hear appeals of negative suitability determinations under the provisions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.401. Rather, OPM argued that the delegation documents required INS to "stand in the shoes" of OPM with regard to these appeals. OPM stated that the President has delegated to it, through Executive order 10577 (as amended), his authority for federal personnel management functions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104(a)(1).[3] In turn, OPM has delegated to INS the limited authority to make suitability determinations of applicants for the position of Border Patrol Agent under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104(a)(2).[4]</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Under earlier regulations, before an agency could initiate a suitability action on its own, it had to establish a specific delegation from OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brady v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 94 MSPR 439, 441-42 &#x00B6; 6 (2003) (under prior regulations, the Board lacked jurisdiction over an appeal from a negative suitability determination when the determination was made by an agency without delegated authority from OPM; the Board lacked the authority to refer the matter to OPM for issuance of an appealable suitability determination); <span class="Italic">Seigla v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 62 MSPR 55, 57, 59 (1994) (considering but reversing an action under Chapter 75 based on allegedly dishonest representations on employment forms); <span class="Italic">Hester v. USIA</span>, 38 MSPR 39, 41 (1988) ("[A]pplicants for employment who are found by an agency to be unsuitable have the same right of appeal to the Board under 5 CFR 731.401(a) [(1988)] as do applicants who are declared unsuitable by...OPM, where OPM has delegated to the agency limited authority to make suitability determinations."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Behrendt v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 72, 74 (1984) (when the agency was not operating under delegated authority from the OPM to make a suitability determination, the AJ properly recharacterized the agency charge of unsuitability for employment to falsification of an employment application and adjudicated the case as an adverse action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before 2008 regulatory revisions, without record evidence of an OPM delegation to an agency to issue a suitability determination, the Board lacked jurisdiction over nonselection of an individual for a position based on the agency's determination that the individual was unsuitable for the job, <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum v. GSA</span>, 83 MSPR 243, 246-48 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-9 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Generally, the Board does not have jurisdiction to consider an applicant's non-selection for a vacant position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Ward v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 530, 533 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> No. 99-3045, 1999 WL 231990 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 15, 1999) (Table). However, the Board has jurisdiction to consider non-selections that are the result of suitability determinations made by OPM or made by agencies operating under delegated authority from OPM. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501; <span class="Italic">Dillingham v. Department of Justice,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 538, 541 (1997). An agency may only conduct a suitability determination upon a grant of authority by OPM. <span class="Italic">See Stiles v. Department of the Navy,</span> 36 M.S.P.R. 646, 648 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the hearing, the appellant alleged that he had been selected from a civil service register, and he articulated a motion for summary judgment, arguing that he was entitled to prevail in his appeal because OPM did not delegate authority to the agency to make suitability determinations for applicants appointed from a civil service register. In denying this motion, the administrative judge noted that the record contained OPM's delegation of authority to the agency. Although the record contains ample evidence to support the appellant's allegation that he was selected from a civil service register, it does not contain any delegation of authority from OPM. OPM provides a blanket delegation of authority to the head of each agency to adjudicate suitability for applicants filing directly with the agency outside a civil service register. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he preponderance of the evidence supported the appellant's allegation that he was tentatively selected from a civil service register. For applicants appointed from a civil service register, the regulations provide that OPM may, in its discretion, delegate authority for adjudicating suitability to the heads of agencies. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the parties did not raise the issue prior to the hearing, delegation of authority is a jurisdictional issue, and as such, it is an issue that is always before the Board and may be raised at any time. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 415, 419 (1992); <span class="Italic">McDermott v. Govt. of District of Columbia</span>, 11 M.S.P.B. 588, 13 M.S.P.R. 345 (1982). The record before the administrative judge contained conflicting evidence concerning the agency's authority to adjudicate suitability for applicants on a certificate of eligibles. The agency submitted an agency handbook entitled "Suitability and Personnel Security" which set forth the agency's policy for making suitability determinations pursuant to 5 C.F.R. Part 731. However, during the hearing, the agency provided an agency memorandum entitled "The Regional Law Enforcement Role in Determining Suitability of Police Officer Applicants." This document <span id="Page_763"></span>suggested that suitability issues concerning applicants on an OPM certificate should be referred to OPM for the suitability determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the initial decision did not identify delegation of authority as a material issue of law and the record contained inconclusive evidence concerning the agency's authority to adjudicate the appellant's suitability, the Clerk of the Board issued a show-cause order requiring the parties to file additional evidence and argument to show why this appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In its response, the agency states that it is not aware of any delegation of authority from OPM concerning the agency's ability to make suitability determinations. In his response, the appellant alleges that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal because OPM conducted his suitability investigation. Even if this allegation is true, however, it does not establish that OPM made a suitability determination nor that OPM delegated authority to make such a determination to the agency. The appellant also argues that the Board has jurisdiction pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(7). Section 1201.3 is the Board regulation that lists the types of appeals over which the Board has been given jurisdiction by other laws, rules, or regulations; this section does not provide the Board with an independent jurisdictional basis. The appellant also argues that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal because disability discrimination and reprisal for prior EEO activity were accepted as issues in his formal EEO complaint. However, absent an otherwise appealable action, the Board does not have jurisdiction to consider allegations of discrimination prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b). <span class="Italic">See Wren v. Department of the Army,</span> 2 M.S.P.B. 174, 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980) (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant failed to establish Board jurisdiction over his appeal by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] . He did not establish that OPM delegated authority to the agency to make suitability determinations with regard to applicants on a civil service register. Although the agency apparently determined that the appellant was unsuitable for the position for which he applied, there is no indication that OPM was involved in that determination. Because the appellant did not establish Board jurisdiction over his appeal, we VACATE the initial decision and DISMISS this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Botello v.
