<p class="Body-Text">That an employee faces the probability that an agency will remove him unless he resigns does not make his resignation involuntary, <span class="Italic">Griessenauer v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 754 F.2d 361, 364 (Fed. Cir. 1985), particularly if the employee knows that some action may be taken, the employee is sophisticated, he is represented, and the options are explained to him<span class="Italic">, affirming</span> <span class="Italic">Griessenauer v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 20 MSPR 172, 173 (1984) ("[A]ppellant's supervisor informed him that the agency would probably propose appellant's termination if he did not resign, this fact, standing alone does not constitute duress or coercion sufficient to render the resignation involuntary[.]"). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Franzen v. MSPB</span>, 238 Fed. Appx. 616 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP) (resignation was not involuntary when an employee chose between resignation with a clear record and receiving a proposed removal for the failure to pass a drug screening test); <span class="Italic">Autera v. United States</span>, 389 F.2d 815, 817 (Ct. Cl. 1968) ("[A]n agency official does not act illegally or improperly in telling an employee he can choose between separation and resignation, unless the plaintiff alleges and proves that the official knew or believed that the proposed reasons for the proposed separation could not be substantiated."); <span class="Italic">Caniglia v. USDA</span>, 26 MSPR 603, 604 (1985) ("The agency only provided appellant permissible information as to his options.... [A]n agency official does not act illegally or improperly in telling an employee that he can choose between an adverse personnel action or resignation unless the official knew or believed that the proposed reasons for the adverse action could not be sustained."); <span class="italic">Ham v. VA</span>, AT-0752-15-0518-B-1 (NP 5/18/2022) ("at the time of her resignation, there was not any discipline planned or pending against the appellant. Thus, she could not have been coerced into resigning by a hypothetical threat of discipline at some undefined future date. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Staats v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (concluding that the choice between two unattractive options does not render a decision to retire or resign involuntary); <span class="italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ('[W]here an employee is faced merely with the unpleasant alternatives of resigning or being subject to removal for cause, such limited choices do not make the resulting resignation an involuntary act.')."); <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. VA</span>, 109 MSPR 392, 2008 MSPB 169 (2008) (claim of coerced resignation: the appellant did not demonstrate that charges were so stale that the agency should have known it could not prevail when the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous argument that it was impossible to defend against the charges; following remand, <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. VA</span>, 111 MSPR 586, 2009 MSPB 126 (2009), on further review of counsel fee petition, <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 413, 2010 MSPB 221 (2010)); <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 52 MSPR 357, 360 (1992) ("[B]y settling the appeal, [appellant] has precluded the Board's authority to consider the propriety of the removal action.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilson v. DHHS</span>, 5 MSPR 102, 106-07, 5 MSPB 172 (1981), commented on statements made to an employee about the possibility of adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official was further persuaded to find the resignation involuntary by the admitted uncertainty of the agency's proposing official as to whether a proposed removal for conviction of a single felony count of fraud would be warranted. There is no doubt that any agency action was in its earliest stages, subject to alteration or nullification by higher level officials based upon their evaluation of the case and the circumstances surrounding it. We must focus not on events subsequent to the resignation but upon what was known to the parties at the time of the discussions leading to Mr. Wilson's action. We view the full disclosure to the employee of his status, options, and possible agency actions by an employee relations officer not as a surreptitious threat, but rather as an attempt to apprise the employee of the totality of the situation, which would enable the employee to make a meaningful decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The voluntariness of a resignation is not vitiated by a showing that the agency contemporaneously issued a termination notice. <span class="Italic">Apodaca v. MSPB</span> (Fed.

In <span class="Italic">Spiegel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 6 MSPR 31, 34, 6 MSPB 40 (1981), the employee was faced with a proposed removal. That she was faced with unpleasant alternatives did not negate the resignation for lack of voluntariness, especially when the AJ determined that there was good cause for the proposed removal. The claim of involuntariness was weakened by an appellant's statement that the resignation was caused by her lack of transportation. Nor did the Board consider involuntary a resignation by an appellant who later alleged that the agency committed harmful error by not conducting the preaction investigation required by agency regulations. In the decision the Board implied that the error could have been challenged through an adverse action appeal. <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 683, 688 (1989).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">To summarize the judicial view, a resignation is ordinarily voluntary when it is submitted to avoid a threatened termination for cause.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Swick v. DOD</span>, DC-1221-17-0008-W-1 (NP 5/12/2023), considered voluntariness in the context of performance issues:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant may show that a resignation was based on coercion when the resignation is induced by a threat to take an adverse or performance-based action that the agency knows could not be substantiated or when the agency takes steps against an employee "not for any legitimate <span id="Page_1947"></span>agency purpose but simply to force the employee to quit." <span class="italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (holding that an example of an involuntary resignation based on coercion is a resignation induced by a threat to take disciplinary action that the agency knows could not be substantiated); <span class="italic">Barthel v.

However, the doctrine of coerced involuntariness is "a narrow one." <span class="italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124. It does not apply if the employee resigns because [s]he "does not want to accept [measures] that the agency is authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant...that [s]he feels that [s]he has no realistic option but to leave." Id. Likewise, "the fact that an employee is faced with an unpleasant situation or that h[er] choice is limited to two unattractive options does not make [her] decision any less voluntary." Id.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's December 13, 2012 memorandum informed the appellant of four complaints lodged against her about her patient care during November and December 2012 and informed her that disciplinary action and a PIP would be forthcoming. The appellant does not assert that the agency proposed any disciplinary action or issued her a PIP prior to her resignation. Although a PIP is a precursor to a performance-based action, it is not itself a performance-based action. See 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 432.104 (providing that if an employee's performance is determined to be unacceptable in one or more critical elements, the agency shall, inter alia, notify the employee that unless her performance in the critical elements improves and is sustained at an acceptable level, she may be reduced in grade or removed, and provide her with a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance); <span class="italic">see also Shores v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 F. App'x 911, 913 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (nonprecedential) (explaining that the threat of a PIP would not support a finding of coercion because it is not itself a disciplinary action). Because the agency did not propose an adverse or performance-based action at the time of the appellant's resignation, and because we are not adjudicating a chapter 43 action, we need not determine whether any such action could be substantiated. <span class="italic">See supra</span> &#x00B6; 15 n.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we have considered whether the totality of the circumstances surrounding the appellant's resignation would support a finding that the agency coerced her resignation, including whether the agency took any actions without a legitimate purpose to force her to quit. <span class="italic">See Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124. Below, the appellant contended that her resignation was based solely on her supervisor's threats during their meeting on December 13, 2012. The appellant alleged that on that date, in addition to her supervisor's issuing the memorandum threatening disciplinary action and a PIP, her supervisor gave her a performance plan with absolute standards. Additionally, the appellant alleged that at the end of the meeting, she asked her supervisor "if she was going to be fired" and her supervisor said, "[Y]es, if you keep making mistakes." The appellant then informed her supervisor that she was resigning; her supervisor replied, "Well, why don't you think about it, and stick around at least during the holidays."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the agency could not threaten to place her on a PIP because it did not place her on performance standards during her probationary period, and she did not receive an annual performance rating. It is true that if an agency determines an employee's performance to be unacceptable in one or more critical elements, it must notify the employee of those critical elements, inform her of the performance requirements or standards that must be attained to demonstrate acceptable performance in the position, and afford her a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate performance. See 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 432.104. The appellant submitted evidence that the agency had implemented performance standards and had evaluated her performance throughout 2012, including a November 2012 performance assessment, and notified her of performance concerns as early as August 2012. The appellant does not contend that these concerns were unwarranted. In the performance plan implemented on December 13, 2012, portions of the critical elements do appear to contain absolute standards. There is no prohibition against absolute performance standards; rather, performance standards must be reasonable, based on objective criteria, and communicated to the employee in advance. <span class="italic">Guillebeau v. Department of the Navy</span>, 362 F.3d 1329, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (finding that the applicable statute "does not bar absolute performance standards"). The appellant does not contend that the performance standards in her December 13, 2012 performance plan were unreasonable or subjective, and she acknowledges receiving the plan. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has not set forth facts that would show that the agency lacked a legitimate basis for notifying her of its intent to place her on a PIP or was otherwise improperly undermining her performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Zed v. USPS</span>, 228 Fed. Appx. 972, 972-74 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), provides an example of a resignation that was deemed voluntary when the employee was faced with the alternative of resigning or returning to work, but not in a different position or shift, after a period of absence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...From about October 2004 through November 2005, Zed was in a "leave without pay" status. On December 20 and 27, 2004, Zed underwent fitness-for-duty examinations and was found able to return to work. Zed did not return to work, however, and submitted medical documents stating that he was under the care of a physician and should be excused from work. None of the documents stated why Zed was under the physician's care.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 10, 2005, the USPS issued Zed a notice of proposed separation from his position as a Supervisor Distributions Operations for physical inability to perform the duties of his position. On December 16, 2005, Zed submitted his resignation, effective December 19, 2005, stating his reason as, "Management inability to move me to daytime same grade level job despite repeated requests." On January 6, 2006, Zed filed a petition for review to the Board contending that his resignation was involuntary and made under duress because he was told that if he did not resign, he would be terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Zed argues that the Board failed to consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding his resignation, and, if it had done so, it would have found that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign. Zed contends that he was humiliated, intimidated, and threatened at work and therefore felt compelled to resign. Zed also notes that in a meeting with the Plant Manager, Zed asked what would happen if he did not resign and he was told that he would be terminated. Thus, Zed contends that his only reasonable alternative was to resign, and that his resignation was made under duress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government responds that the Board correctly dismissed Zed's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The government observes that the AJ properly found that Zed did not make non-frivolous allegations that his resignation was involuntary. The government argues that even if Zed's allegations concerning a hostile working environment were true, he would still not be able to prove that he had no alternative but to resign. The government also argues that the AJ correctly found that Zed did not make non-frivolous allegations that his resignation was coerced by the USPS because his allegations of coercion were based only on the USPS's stated intention to separate him if he did not resign. The government observes that Zed had the option of not resigning, remaining in his position and contesting the separation, but that he elected to resign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that the Board correctly dismissed Zed's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. A decision to resign is presumed to be voluntary and is usually beyond the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 99 F.3d 1120, 1123-24 (Fed. Cir. 1996). In order to overcome the presumption of voluntariness, an employee must make a non-frivolous allegation that the resignation was the result of misinformation, deception, or coercion by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To establish that a resignation was involuntary based on coercion by the agency, an employee must show that the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's resignation, that the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign, and that the employee's resignation was the result of improper acts by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ correctly observed, Zed was given the option of resigning in lieu of being separated for a physical inability to perform the duties of his position. Zed chose the former option. Even though Zed believed that that option may not have been the happiest for him, presenting options to an employee does not constitute agency coercion. Zed further stated that another reason he resigned was that he was not transferred to a daytime position. That reason also does not demonstrate agency coercion. Based on the evidence of record, the agency thus acted properly in communicating to Zed his options of resigning or being separated. Neither that communication, nor any other agency action, rose to the level of coercion, and the AJ therefore properly found that Zed failed to make non-frivolous allegations that his resignation was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The circuit court again addressed involuntary resignations under coercive circumstances in <span class="Italic">Bryant v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3377), determining that the limited choice of resignation or removal for cause does not make the resulting resignation an involuntary act, but the agency must have reasonable grounds for threatening to take the adverse action. The burden of proof is on the employee to show that the agency knew or should have known that the reason for the threatened removal could not be substantiated. The choice may be coercive, however, if the agency threatens the employee with criminal prosecution and states that his career will be ruined if he fails to resign. Those facts go beyond facing an unpleasant choice and rise to the level of coercion. The agency should have known it could not have sustained the disciplinary action when a contested unemployment compensation hearing determined that there was no substantial evidence of misconduct. <span class="Italic">Latham v. USPS</span>, 909 F.2d 500 (Fed. Cir. 1990), concluded there was ample justification for a threat of adverse action when the Postal Service determined that the employee had taken sick leave and was training for another job with a local police <span id="Page_1948"></span>department. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. VA</span>, 122 Fed. Appx. 503, 506 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP) (choice between resigning and being removed for cause is not inherently coercive; the court looks for a showing that the agency effectively imposed the terms of the resignation, that the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign, and that the resignation was the result of improper acts of the agency).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The possibility of a misconduct investigation did not make a resignation involuntary, <span class="Italic">Wiggins v. MSPB</span>, 490 Fed. Appx. 336, 338 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...First, Wiggins was not threatened with termination, but rather with an investigation that he claims would have exonerated him. This is not consistent with his claim that his termination was inevitable and that he had no choice but to resign. <span class="Italic">See Holman v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. 218, 220 (1981) (concluding that fear of a possible future adverse action is not adequate to rebut a presumption of voluntariness). Second, he has at no point in this proceeding even alleged, let alone offered factual support for, the factors necessary to show coercion. Nor has he alleged facts that would support a finding that a reasonable employee in the same circumstances would feel coerced into resigning.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Wiggins alleges only that he chose to retire rather than endure an investigation that he believes would have exonerated him. However, the choice between two unattractive options does not render the decision to retire involuntary. <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("An unpleasant choice between disciplinary action and retirement does not rebut the presumption of voluntariness of [a] choice to retire."); <span class="Italic">Christie v. United States</span>, 518 F.2d 584, 587 (Ct. Cl. 1975) ("Merely because the plaintiff was faced with an inherently unpleasant situation in that [the] choice was arguably limited to two unpleasant alternatives does not obviate the voluntariness of [the] resignation."). Even if true, these allegations are not sufficient to overcome the presumption that Wiggins' retirement was voluntary....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The problem of threats of improper disciplinary action was discussed in <span class="Italic">Schultz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987), reversing the Board's dismissal of an involuntary resignation appeal and ordering the employee reinstated. The salient facts were that the employee encountered stress on the job and requested leave based on a physician's statement both that continuation on the job would cause further mental harm to the appellant and that the appellant was totally disabled for her position. The leave was denied by a supervisor who apparently had not seen the medical certificate, and the appellant was offered a retroactive resignation to avoid a charge of AWOL following the denial of the leave. The appellant resigned, filed for disability retirement, and appealed from the resignation after OPM denied the retirement application. The court concluded that the resignation was coerced. The agency should have known at some point in the proceedings that the employee was entitled to leave as a result of the medical certificate that was provided to the agency, although the certificate was not, apparently, provided to the immediate supervisor. Once the agency knew of the medical certificate, received by the time the resignation was accepted, the agency should have acted to properly advise the appellant. Because the appellant should have been granted the leave she requested, the threat to place her on AWOL (and the associated threat of possible disciplinary action) was unjustified. Given the short time the appellant had to consider the resignation, but given principally the unwarranted threat by the agency, the court determined that the resignation was unlawfully procured:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A resignation is not voluntary where an agency imposes the terms of an employee's resignation, the employee's circumstances permit no alternative but to accept, and those circumstances were the result of improper acts of the agency.... [W]here an employee is faced merely with the unpleasant alternatives of resigning or being subject to removal for cause, such limited choices do not make the resulting resignation an involuntary act. On the other hand, inherent in that proposition is that the agency has reasonable grounds for threatening to take an adverse action. If an employee can show that the agency knew that the reason for the threatened removal could not be substantiated, the threatened action by the agency is purely coercive. <span class="Italic">Cosby v. United States</span>, 189 Ct. Cl. 528, 417 F.2d 1345, 1355 (1969); <span class="Italic">Autera v. United States</span>, 182 Ct. Cl. 495, 389 F.2d 815, 817 (1968); <span class="Italic">Rich v.

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Garland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 44 MSPR 537, 540-41 (1990), the employee's burden to show that the agency knew or should have known that it could not bring an adverse action is not met by the appellant's rebuttal of the agency's reasons for the removal action; the rebuttal of those reasons is insufficient to show coercion. If an employee resigns to avoid a downgrading, the resignation is not involuntary because the agency could have taken some action other than demotion. Restating <span class="Italic">Garland</span>, <span class="Italic">Howard v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-13-0360-I-2 (NP 8/26/2014), explained that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has found that, under such circumstances, an employee may be faced with a difficult choice between retiring and facing a removal action with which he disagrees, but this does not render his decision to retire involuntary. <span class="Italic">Garland v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 537, 540-41 (1990). To show that his retirement amounted to a constructive removal under this theory, the appellant must do more than merely rebut the agency's reasons for the removal. He must show that the agency lacked reasonable grounds for threatening the action in the first place. <span class="Italic">Id</span>....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dorsey-Williams v.

Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 81, 85 (1998); <span class="Italic">Garland v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 537, 540 (1990). The appellant's contentions on review do not show that the agency knew or believed it could not substantiate a removal action or that an arguable basis for removal did not exist.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the action to be involuntary there must be no alternative and coercive acts. The issue is not whether the agency actions are reasonable under the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> disciplinary standards; rather, the issue is whether the resignation was involuntary due to coercive factors. <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 19 MSPR 548, 551 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Hijar v. Dept. of Army</span>, 6 MSPR 133, 6 MSPB 121 (1981)). At times, however, the Board recites the rule that a threatened removal may be considered coercive if the appellant can show that the agency had no reasonable grounds for threatening to take the removal action, and the Board then proceeds through a point-by-point examination of the merits of the removal action and its defenses. <span class="Italic">Lamb v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 470, 475-76 (1990), noted of a resignation submitted to avoid removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge considered the appellant's explanation for the incorrect time cards but, nevertheless, found that the agency had a basis for bringing a removal action against him. The administrative judge noted that the appellant supplied no evidence of the agency's awareness or approval of the practice of trading times with coworkers<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Gray v. Department of Justice</span>, 30 MSPR 635, 639 (1986). The Board has previously sustained a charge of falsification for recording time inaccurately under similar circumstances<span class="Italic">. See McAllister v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 MSPR 658, 663 (1989) (charge of falsification of time records by a Postmaster was sustained but the penalty of removal was mitigated to a demotion to a nonsupervisory position). Thus, the administrative judge correctly found that the resignation was not coerced through a baseless threatened removal action for falsification of time cards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant cites several statements allegedly made by agency personnel to him about his future job prospects, trouble with the Internal Revenue Service stemming from financial irregularities, and the likelihood of his not prevailing in a removal action, as evidence that the agency coerced his resignation. The appellant asserts that these statements were deceptive. The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to meet his burden of proof on that issue because there was no evidence to show that the agency fraudulently obtained or created evidence against him, that the agency misrepresented any evidence to him, or that the agency concealed any exculpatory evidence from him. Furthermore, the appellant was represented during all the meetings with agency personnel. The appellant's reiteration of these claims in the petition for review represents mere disagreement with the fact findings of the administrative judge and does not establish a basis for reversal of the initial decision<span class="Italic">. See Jackson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Hillen v.

<p class="Body-Text">An agency's threat to place an employee on AWOL for not timely documenting a FMLA request for leave to take care of a parent was not sufficient cause to make a resignation involuntary when circumstances suggested that the agency would likely have granted additional leave and, had it not done so, the employee could have challenged the denial of FMLA leave and AWOL status through other means, <span class="Italic">Axsom v. VA</span>, 110 MSPR 605, 611-13 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-18, 2009 MSPB 35 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's August 15, 2006 memorandum requesting additional medical documentation, with a short period to comply and a threat of AWOL, was obviously the trigger for the appellant's resignation. However, this agency action did not render the appellant's resignation involuntary, considering the totality of the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's concern over an AWOL issue is clearly overstated, given that the appellant admitted that he had been charged AWOL numerous times in the past, but he had readily corrected the record in short order on each occasion. Furthermore, the appellant acted precipitously, tendering his resignation almost immediately after requesting the extension to respond to the August 15, 2006 memorandum, before any negative action took place. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 29 (2000) ("To prove a constructive discharge[,] an employee has an obligation to act reasonably, not assume the worst, and not jump to conclusions too quickly."). On this point, it is noteworthy that the appellant's request for an extension was duly reviewed and granted through September 29, 2006. In addition, the agency memorandum itself advised the appellant of the potential availability of additional leave (beyond the FMLA limits), <span id="Page_1949"></span>a fact inconsistent with coercive pressure to resign. On that same score, an agency human resources specialist stated that he repeatedly tried to contact the appellant, after the extension to provide documentation was granted, to confirm that the appellant wished to resign rather than return. These overtures are also inconsistent with the appellant's claim that the agency compelled his resignation. <span class="Italic">See Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1245 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Thus, the appellant's claim that he was coerced to resign by the agency's request for documentation and the threat of AWOL is utterly refuted by the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Vitale</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 501109 M.S.P.R. 392, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-26 (the appellant's placement on sick leave certification did not render his working conditions intolerable such that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign); <span class="Italic">see also Baldwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, &#x00B6; 12 (2008) (a resignation is not involuntary simply because the appellant had to choose between resigning and opposing an adverse action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In making this determination, we have considered the agency's August 15, 2006 memorandum in the context of the totality of the circumstances, including evidence regarding the appellant's employment history with the agency. <span class="Italic">See generally Shoaf v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 260 F.3d 1336, 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (the level of evidentiary weight the Board must grant to events temporally distant from the appellant's alleged involuntary resignation is within the Board's discretion, but at a minimum, the Board must consider such events as necessary "to place the activity and inactivity more immediately preceding [the resignation] into the proper context"); <span class="Italic">Terban</span>, 216 F.3d at 1024 (the most probative evidence of involuntariness "will usually be evidence in which there is a relatively short period of time between the employer's alleged coercive act[s] and the employee's retirement"). The appellant has particularly complained about the agency's failure to select or reassign him to a position closer to his parent's home in North Carolina and the agency's denial of his request to telecommute from North Carolina. He has also made allegations of discriminatory, harassing, and retaliatory conduct that created intolerable working conditions. We have considered the evidence regarding these allegations as it pertains to the issue of the voluntariness of his resignation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vitale</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claims of harassment, retaliation, and discrimination figured only tangentially in his decision to resign, if at all. Notably, the alleged incidents of discrimination and harassment preceded his decision to resign by several months. In addition, the appellant was on family medical leave for an extended period before his resignation, and thus he had little, if any, contact with any allegedly hostile supervisors in the months leading up to his decision to resign, which further weakens any inference that any alleged harassment and discrimination on their part weighed heavily in his decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant had already begun the process for addressing all such claims--he originally filed an EEO action in April 2006, well-before his resignation. Thus, the appellant had the option to stand and fight the alleged discrimination, harassment, and retaliation rather than resign. <span class="Italic">See Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329 (the resignation was not involuntary if the employee had a choice whether to resign or contest the validity of the agency action). The appellant has failed to prove that the agency was handling his EEO complaints inequitably or that, under the circumstances, his request for an extension to respond to the August 15, 2006 memorandum or any challenge to an improper agency action taken as a result of that memorandum would have been futile. In fact, the evidence shows that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have expected that the agency would likely accommodate his request for an extension of time to gather the appropriate medical documentation in response to the August 15, 2006 memorandum. The record reflects that the agency granted all the appellant's FMLA leave requests to that point, and had even accommodated his requests for additional leave beyond the requirements of the FMLA. For instance, the EEO investigative file contains testimony from the Chief of Medical Services that the agency had granted the appellant over 40 weeks of leave between July 2005 and November 2006.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the appellant has not shown by preponderant evidence that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have felt compelled to resign.</p>
