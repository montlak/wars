<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-407"><span class="space">4.</span> Interest of Justice</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596(b) provides, in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)(1)&#x2003;An employee of an agency who, on the basis of a timely appeal or an administrative determination (including a decision relating to an unfair labor practice or a grievance) is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A)&#x2003;is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, to receive for the period for which the personnel action was in effect--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that period; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;reasonable attorney fees related to the personnel action which, with respect to any decision relating to an unfair labor practice or a grievance processed under a procedure negotiated in accordance with chapter 71 of this title, or under chapter 11 of title <span id="page_2444"></span>I of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, shall be awarded in accordance with standards established under section 7701(g) of this title.</p>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7701(g), incorporated by reference into the fee provisions of the Back Pay Act, provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Board, or an administrative law judge or other employee of the Board designated to hear a case, may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board, administrative law judge, or other employee (as the case may be) determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;If an employee or applicant for employment is the prevailing party and the decision is based on a finding of discrimination prohibited under section 2302(b)(1) of this title, the payment of attorney fees shall be in accordance with the standards prescribed under section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000e-5(k)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The primary interpreter of 5 USC 7701(g) is the MSPB, whose seminal decision in <span class="Italic">Allen v. USPS</span>, 2 MSPR 420, 434-35 (1980), explains that fees should be awarded to a prevailing party:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Where the agency engaged in a "prohibited personnel practice" (&#x00A7; 7701(g)(1));</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Where the agency's action was "clearly without merit" (&#x00A7; 7701(g)(1)), or was "wholly unfounded," or the employee is "substantially innocent" of the charges brought by the agency (a determination to be based on the record on the merits of the agency action without a separate hearing; in making the determination, the presiding official should examine the degree of fault on the employee's part and the existence of any reasonable basis for the agency's action);</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Where the agency initiated the action against the employee in "bad faith," including:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;Where the agency's action was brought to "harass" the employee;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;Where the agency's action was brought to "exert improper pressure on the employee to act in certain ways";</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;Where the agency committed a "gross procedural error" which "prolonged the proceeding" or "severely prejudiced" the employee (a criterion which goes beyond harmful procedural error and requires weighing the nature of and any excuse for the error against the prejudice and burden resulting for the employee).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5.&#x2003;Where the agency "knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits" when it brought the proceeding (which may include circumstances in which the agency prepared or presented its case so negligently as to make it a foregone conclusion that the action could not be sustained on the record established before the Board).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">However, we note that, to the extent that the Authority has sometimes implied that attorney fees are warranted only if they satisfy one of the five <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors,[81] that is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Allen</span> itself. As <span class="Italic">Allen</span> itself states, the factors are "not exhaustive, but illustrative," and are not intended to serve as a "litmus...test[&#8197;] for award or denial of attorney fees. Rather, these examples should serve primarily as directional markers toward 'the interest of justice.'"[82] Further, taking into account the very different purposes for which Congress established the Authority and the MSPB, we believe that it may be time--in an appropriate case--to reconsider our nearly exclusive reliance on the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors in this area and to fashion interest-of-justice guidelines that are better adapted to the collective-bargaining context and to the types of cases that the Authority is called upon to review.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Regarding attorney fees, we note, as we have before, that in an appropriate case, the Authority should reconsider its reliance on the interest-of-justice factors established in <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span> (<span class="Italic">Allen</span>). In <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) created the interest-of-justice factors in the context of an adverse-action appeal; as such, most of <span class="Italic">Allen's</span> interest-of-justice factors relate to an award of attorney fees in circumstances where an adverse action is being either challenged, overturned, or modified. But, unlike the MSPB, the Authority cannot review adverse actions. Thus, the Authority, as it has stated before, needs interest-of-justice factors "that are better adapted...to the types of cases that the Authority is called upon to review"--such as in this case, where an adverse action is not at issue. As Congress established the Authority and the MSPB for "very different purposes," the Authority should develop interest-of-justice factors that serve the purposes of <span class="Italic">its</span> organic statute--not the MSPB's. And when the Authority reconsiders the interest-of-justice factors, it "should consider, as appropriate, the views of the federal labor-management community, to truly ensure that the interest of justice is served."</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We observe that in many arbitration cases in which the grieved action is not disciplinary in nature, the dispute arises not because the agency acted in disregard of the facts or its legal obligations, but rather because the parties disagree in good faith over the most reasonable interpretation of a CBA provision or a statutory or regulatory requirement. In such circumstances, it can seldom be said that the agency knew or should have known at the time it denied the grievance that it would not prevail on the merits at arbitration. Nor will an action be deemed clearly without merit merely because the arbitrator ruled in the grieving party's favor. Even in cases where the grievant prevails based on compelling evidence introduced during arbitration, a fee award will be warranted under the clearly without merit standard only to the extent the agency took actions that caused the grievant to incur additional fees after the dispositive evidence was introduced. Ordinarily, an agency does not needlessly prolong the proceeding merely by awaiting the arbitrator's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The majority, concurring, and dissenting opinions in <span class="Italic">DeBakey</span> are set out below:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We take this opportunity to clarify the standards for determining when an award of attorney fees in an arbitration proceeding is warranted under the BPA and &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).[33]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;While the case before us involves exceptions to an arbitrator's award, we note that the BPA also serves as authority for attorney fee awards in unfair-labor-practice proceedings in which the union was the charging party. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">We clarify how the legal standards for attorney fee awards under the BPA and &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) apply to arbitration awards in which the grieved action is not disciplinary in nature</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b) provides that an arbitrator's final award may include an award of backpay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596. Section 5596 in turn provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)(1)&#x2003;An employee of an agency who, on the basis of a timely appeal or an administrative determination (including a decision relating to an unfair labor practice or a grievance) is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(A)&#x2003;is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, to receive....</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(ii) reasonable attorney fees related to the personnel action which, with respect to any decision relating to an unfair labor practice or a grievance processed under a procedure negotiated in accordance with chapter 71 of this title...shall be awarded in accordance with standards established under section 7701(g) of this title[.][34]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[34]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the threshold requirement for an award of attorney fees under the BPA is a finding that the employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action,[35] which resulted in a withdrawal or reduction of the employee's pay, allowances or differentials.[36] The BPA further requires that an award of attorney fees be: (1) in conjunction with an award of backpay to the grievant on correction of the personnel action; (2) reasonable and related to the personnel action; and (3) in accordance with the standards established under 5 U.S.C. 7701(g).[37]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[35]&#x2003;An "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" may include an act of omission, i.e., failure to take an action or confer a benefit. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803. The determination that a personnel action is unjustified or unwarranted must be made by an appropriate authority--which includes arbitrators and the Authority--and may be based on applicable law, Executive order, rule, regulation, or mandatory personnel policy established by an agency or through a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_2445"></span>[36]&#x2003;The term "pay, allowances, and differentials" includes pay, leave, and other monetary benefits payable by the employing agency to the employee during periods of Federal employment, with the exception of contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NAIL, Local 5</span>, 69 FLRA 573, 575 (2016) (<span class="Italic">Local 5</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7701(g) in turn sets forth the requirements for an award of attorney fees by the Merit Systems Protection Board (the Board):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;[The] Board, or an administrative law judge or other employee of the Board designated to hear a case, may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board, administrative law judge, or other employee (as the case may be) determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hence, the Board will award attorney fees under the BPA only if the requirements of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) are satisfied. The requirements of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) include the following: (1) the employee must be the prevailing party;[38] (2) the employee must have incurred attorney fees pursuant to an existing attorney-client relationship; (3) an award of attorney fees must be warranted in the interest of justice; and (4) the amount of fees claimed must be reasonable.[39]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[38]&#x2003;Under the definition set forth in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Bd. &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Res</span>., 532 U.S. 598 (2001), and adopted by the Board, a grievant is a prevailing party when he or she obtains an enforceable judgment that benefited him or her at the time of the judgment. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1592</span>, 65 FLRA 921, 922 (2011).

The Authority has recognized these same requirements, though sometimes stated in a different order. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Local 5</span>, 69 FLRA at 575. In addition to the requirements spelled out in &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the Authority has held that an award of fees under that section must be supported by a fully articulated, reasoned decision setting forth the specific findings supporting the determination on each pertinent statutory requirement. <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act reflects that Congress considered and rejected an alternative provision that would have granted the Authority discretion to establish its own regulatory standards for determining what fees should be awarded in unfair labor practice cases and arbitration awards.[40] Considering as well the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii), the Authority has concluded that it is not free to fashion its own standards for attorney fees under the BPA, but is constrained to follow the same standards applied by the Board under &#x00A7; 7701(g), including the "interest of justice" requirement of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).[41] The Authority looks to decisions of the Board and its reviewing court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, for guidance in interpreting these standards.[42]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, an appeal of a removal action, the Board introduced guidelines for determining when the "interest of justice" requirement of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) has been satisfied. Considering the language of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), its legislative history, and court precedent applying the "interest of justice" standard in other contexts involving attorney fees, the Board compiled a list of five circumstances in which an award of attorney fees may be warranted in the interest of justice:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Where the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Where the agency's action was clearly without merit, or was wholly unfounded, or the employee is substantially innocent of the charges brought by the agency;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Where the agency initiated the action against the employee in bad faith, including:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;Where the agency's action was brought to harass the employee;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;Where the agency's action was brought to exert improper pressure on the employee to act in certain ways;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;Where the agency committed a gross procedural error which prolonged the proceeding or severely prejudiced the employee;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;Where the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding.[43]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[43]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 434-35.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board stressed that the five listed categories were "not exhaustive, but illustrative," and were intended as "directional markers" rather than a "catalogue of litmus paper tests for award or denial of attorney fees."[44] The Federal Circuit subsequently endorsed the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> guidelines, while also recognizing that the five categories are not exhaustive.[45]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has traditionally relied on <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, finding that the interest of justice requirement is satisfied if any of the five categories applies.[46] In addition, the Authority has held that an attorney fee award is warranted in the interest of justice when there is service rendered to the federal work force or there is a benefit to the public derived from maintaining the action.[47] However, the Authority has also observed that the categories listed in <span class="Italic">Allen</span> were developed in the context of an adverse action appeal and are not necessarily well adapted to the types of cases the Authority is called upon to review.[48] This is especially apparent when, as in this case, the grieved action is not disciplinary in nature.[49]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Board has itself recognized that the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> guidelines were developed in the adverse action context, and require modification for use in other types of cases in which attorney fees may be awarded under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).[50] Most helpfully for our purposes, these include cases in which an applicant for retirement benefits[51] successfully appeals an unfavorable reconsideration decision by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).[52]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Board has held that in such appeals, the most relevant considerations in determining whether an attorney fee award is warranted in the interest of justice are whether OPM knew or should have known when it made its decision that it would not prevail on appeal, and whether OPM's decision was clearly without merit.[53] In this context, the "knew or should have known" standard requires an evaluation of the evidence that was available to OPM at the time it made the reconsideration decision.[54] In determining whether a fee award is warranted under this category, the Board considers whether OPM was negligent in its processing of the application, lacked a reasonable and supportable explanation for its position, or ignored clear, unrebutted evidence that the appellant satisfied the criteria for a benefit.[55]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Where OPM's reconsideration decision would not have been reversed absent evidence introduced during the appellate process, the attorney fee request is analyzed under the "clearly-without-merit" standard.[56] The "clearly[-]without[-] merit" standard focuses on the result of the case before the Board.[57] To award fees under this category, the Board must determine that, at some point prior to the close of the record on appeal, OPM's failure to acknowledge the appellant's entitlement to the benefits he or she sought was blameworthy.[58] In making that determination, the Board considers the totality of the evidence.[59] Factors to be considered include the extent to which the appellant produced evidence that was so compelling that reasonable minds could not differ as to the appellant's eligibility for an annuity and OPM's continued refusal to approve the annuity prolonged the proceedings.[60]</p>

Other factors include whether the appellant was misled by OPM to his or her detriment, or whether OPM's initial decision was insufficient under the circumstances to permit a reasonable person to identify the kind of evidence needed to prevail on reconsideration, and the extent to which the reversal was based on evidence that the appellant did not present to OPM, but that nevertheless was readily available to OPM. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reexamining our reliance on the Board's interest-of-justice criteria, we find that the Authority may, without departing from Board and Federal Circuit precedent, adapt these modified guidelines to arbitration awards in which the grieved action is not disciplinary in nature, such as when the grievance centers around a question of the interpretation of the parties' collective-bargaining agreement. In doing so, we analogize the grieved agency action to OPM's denial of a retirement benefit, the denial of the grievance to OPM's reconsideration decision, and the arbitration to the Board appeal. Like most analogies, this analogy is imperfect, and not every aspect of the Board's analysis in retirement cases has a clear counterpart in the collective bargaining context, or vice versa. However, we may reasonably draw the following conclusions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, in assessing whether a fee award in a non-disciplinary case is warranted in the interest of justice, it is unnecessary to address each <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category. Rather, the most relevant considerations will generally be whether the agency knew or should have known at the time it denied the grievance that it would not prevail at arbitration, or whether, given the result of the arbitration, the grieved action was clearly without merit. There may be exceptional circumstances in which other considerations are relevant,[61] but in most cases it will be sufficient to apply the "knew or should have known" or the "clearly without merit" criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[61]&#x2003;For example, &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) expressly contemplates that the interest of justice requirement will be satisfied where the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice. It should be borne in mind, however, that this provision refers specifically to prohibited personnel practices as defined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b), and does not encompass every situation in which the agency's action is found to be an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action for purposes of the BPA. <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, U.S. CBP</span>, 69 FLRA 412, 415 (2016).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "knew or should have known" standard requires an evaluation of the evidence that was available to the agency at the time it denied the grievance. Attorney fees may be warranted under that criterion if it is found that the agency was negligent in taking the grieved action, that it lacked a reasonable and supportable explanation for its position, or that it ignored clear, unrebutted evidence that the grieved action was contrary to law, regulation, or negotiated agreement provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "clearly without merit" standard focuses on the result of the arbitration, and may be satisfied if, at some point prior to the close of the record before the arbitrator, the agency's failure to reverse its position was blameworthy. In applying that standard, the arbitrator should consider the totality of the circumstances. Relevant considerations include the extent to which the grievant produced evidence that was so compelling that reasonable minds could not disagree that the grieved action was unwarranted or unjustified and, if such compelling evidence was introduced, the extent to which the agency's intransigence needlessly prolonged the arbitration process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We observe that in many arbitration cases in which the grieved action is not disciplinary in nature, the dispute arises not because the agency acted in disregard of the facts or its legal obligations, but rather because the parties disagree in good faith over the most reasonable interpretation of a CBA provision or a statutory or regulatory requirement. In such circumstances, it can seldom be said that the agency knew or should have known at the time it denied the grievance that it would not prevail on the merits at arbitration.[62] Nor will an action be deemed clearly without merit merely because the arbitrator ruled in the grieving party's favor.[63] Even in cases where the grievant prevails based on compelling evidence introduced during arbitration, a fee award will be warranted under the clearly without merit standard only to the extent the agency took actions that caused the grievant to incur additional fees after the dispositive evidence was introduced.[64] Ordinarily, an agency does not needlessly prolong the proceeding merely by awaiting the arbitrator's decision.[65]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[62]&#x2003;In contrast, retirement appeals more frequently turn on factual disputes, and it is not out of the ordinary for the Board to find a fee award warranted in the interest of justice where OPM failed to properly assess the evidence that was available to it at the time it issued its reconsideration decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Duke v. OPM</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 578 (1998).</p>

<p class="noindent">Member Abbott, concurring:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our decision today clarifies when and under what circumstances attorney fees may be warranted in the context of an aggrieved action that is not disciplinary in nature, such as a contract-interpretation grievance pursued through the grievance-arbitration process. This clarification is long overdue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I write separately to discuss two matters.&#x2003;First, a central premise of this decision rests on two plausible, but precarious, definitional foundations. Second, important questions, that must be addressed on another day and may well return to us on remand, remain unanswered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As our decision reiterates, the threshold upon which an award of attorney fees may be made in the context of grievance-arbitration is by our Statute's reference to the Back Pay Act in &#x00A7; 7122(b) and the BPA's definition of "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" in &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1). At the time Congress enacted the BPA (in 1966), the legislative history indicates that Congress understood that the definition of personnel action was limited in scope "to provide a monetary remedy for wrongful reductions in grade, removals, suspension, and 'other unwarranted or unjustified actions affecting pay or allowances that could occur in the course of reassignments and change from full-time to part-time work.'"[3] According to the Supreme Court, the term "personnel actions" only applied to employees who are "subjected to a reduction in their duly appointed emoluments or position."[4] Although the legislative history of the CSRA indicates that Congress considered a broader definition, the final version of the retained the original, limited definition with only slight modifications.[5]</p>

The exact language of &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1) is "an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowance, or differentials of the employee."</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It is, thus, only OPM's regulatory definition of the term "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" which extends the BPA to matters other than pay matters.[6] While I believe it is clearly within the mandate of OPM to interpret and define the BPA (an interpretation we are constrained to follow),[7] I remain unconvinced that OPM's regulatory definition is consistent with Congress's intent.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Our decision also defers to the MSPB's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) and the multiple factors it uses to determine when attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice. Although Section 7701(g)(1) enumerates two circumstances in which attorney fees may be awarded--"<span class="Italic">including</span> [those] in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency <span class="Italic">or</span> any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit"[8]--the MSPB in <span class="Italic">Allen</span> found <span class="Italic">five</span> circumstances. On this matter, as with OPM, we defer to MSPB's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). I note, however (as did several <span class="Italic">amici</span>), that Congress did not incorporate the phrase--<span class="Italic">but not limited to</span>--following the word "including" as it often has in other contexts when it establishes a non-exhaustive list of criteria or requirements.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It is not just the U.S. Supreme Court that has called for a narrow interpretation of those circumstances under which attorney fees are warranted. For example, the U.S. Civilian Board of Contract Appeals has determined that the legislative history of the BPA indicates that Congress did not intend for its attorneys-fee provisions to apply to pay actions <span class="Italic">unrelated to personnel actions</span>.[9] The Comptroller General arrived at a similar conclusion and found that "<span class="Italic">personnel actions,</span>" as the term is used in the BPA, is restricted to "reductions in grade, removals, suspensions, and other unwarranted or unjustified actions affecting pay or allowances that could occur in the course of reassignments and change from full-time to part-time work."[10] And, the Authority recently held that attempts by an Agency "to recoup moneys that it actually overpaid...do not constitute <span class="Italic">unwarranted and unjustified personnel actions</span> that result in the withdrawal or withholding of pay under the BPA."[11]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">These definitional conundrums are not for us to resolve but are most appropriately left to Congress to resolve or for the Courts to provide additional clarification and guidance.&#x2003;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, other questions concerning attorney fees in the context of grievance-arbitration need not be addressed today but were questioned recently by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit[12] and were raised as concerns by various <span class="Italic">amici</span>--i.e., the applicability of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix, proportionality of fees when balanced against results achieved or the value of the matter in dispute, and the reasonableness of fees when representation is provided by union in-house attorneys.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">DL et al. v. District of Columbia</span>, although not directly rejecting the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, the Court called into question its long-term viability.[13] The Court distinguished between cases that involve "<span class="Italic">complex federal litigation</span>" (such as <span class="Italic">DL</span> that involved a novel issue concerning the scope of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act as well as a protracted dispute regarding class certification) which "presumptively" warrants fees that are supported by the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix as opposed to those cases which involve "<span class="Italic">non-complex cases</span> [litigated] primarily before an <span class="Italic">administrative body</span>."[14] The case before the Court was of such a complex nature that the parties on remand had to "work together and think creatively about how to produce a <span class="Italic">reliable assessment of fees</span> charged for <span class="Italic">complex</span> federal litigation in the District."

<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 595 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of particular note, the majority and the dissent in <span class="Italic">DL</span> recognized that many cases, particularly those that are litigated before an administrative body, are not sufficiently complex to warrant the elevated rates of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix. The majority put it this way--administrative cases "<span class="Italic">sometimes</span> fall within a submarket characterized by below-<span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rates...[which] may not have discovery and pre-trial exchanges of the sort found in other federal litigation."[16] The dissent was even more blunt when he concluded that every case does not require "the most specialized or the most expensive counsel in order to receive competent legal services."[17]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 597.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is thus imperative that the parties and the Arbitrator address on remand how reasonable attorney fees in matters arising before the Authority (an administrative body) should be assessed following the Court's guidance in <span class="Italic">DL</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The questions that I raise above are several that beg for answers.</p>
<p class="noindent">Member DuBester, concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I agree with the decision to deny the Agency's exceptions and to remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator to make specific findings as to whether an award of attorney fees is appropriate. But I strongly disagree with the majority's modification of the standards used to determine entitlement to attorney fees in arbitration awards in which the grieved action is not disciplinary in nature.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While I have previously suggested that the Authority should reconsider the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors because they are unnecessarily cumbersome and impractical for practitioners and arbitrators, reconsideration of such an important doctrine should not take place without a material basis for doing so. As I stated in my dissent to the Federal Register notice soliciting <span class="Italic">amici curiae</span> briefs, this is not an ideal case in which to address the Authority's reliance on the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors because its "disposition does not even require application of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> [f]actors." Indeed, the Arbitrator did not make any of the findings required by the Back Pay Act (the BPA) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) to support his denial of attorney fees. Moreover, neither party addressed, or even raised, the appropriateness of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors in its exceptions to the Arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, today the majority creates new standards for attorney fee awards which it has already "observe[d]" will not be met in "many arbitration cases."[3] Notably, the majority crafts these new standards without even a passing reference to the views of parties that submitted briefs on the matter, thereby dissolving any pretense that modification of these standards was necessary to our decision today. And because the majority's creation is not grounded on the facts of any case actually before us--and is instead derived from an analogy to appeals from Office of Personnel Management decisions involving retirement benefits--our decision today will only generate greater uncertainty regarding how these standards apply to arbitration awards.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Again, because the Arbitrator--the appropriate authority to resolve attorney-fee requests in the first instance[5]--has not decided the attorney-fee request under the BPA, reconsideration of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors is not ripe for review.[6] Accordingly, I dissent.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Authority clarifies how <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor (5)--i.e., whether the Agency "knew or should have known" that its action would not be sustained--applies in the context of minor disciplinary actions.[1]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 2 M.S.P.R. 420 (1980), the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) identified five broad categories of cases in which an award of attorney fees would be warranted in the interest of justice: (1) where the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice; (2) where the agency action was clearly without merit or wholly unfounded or the employee was substantially innocent of charges brought by the agency; (3) where the agency initiated the action in bad faith; (4) where the agency committed a gross procedural error; and (5) where the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 434-35.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is before the Authority on the Union's exceptions to Arbitrator William Croasdale's supplemental award, which denied the Union's request for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act (BPA).[2] The request for attorney fees followed a merits award in which the Arbitrator sustained the Agency's charge against the grievant but mitigated the penalty from a fourteen-day suspension to a five-day suspension. The main issue before the Authority is whether payment of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice because the Agency knew or should have known that its original penalty determination would not be upheld. For the reasons that follow, we set aside the supplemental award and remand the matter <span id="page_2448"></span>to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator--or a different one--absent settlement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency suspended the grievant for fourteen days because she violated its timekeeping policy repeatedly over a two-year period. The Union filed a grievance challenging the suspension. The grievance proceeded to arbitration. In the merits award, the Arbitrator sustained the charges, but mitigated the penalty to a five-day suspension. Neither party filed exceptions to the merits award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union subsequently filed a request for attorney fees under the BPA.&#x2003;In its request, the Union argued that an award of fees was warranted in the interest of justice under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category (5), because the Agency knew or should have known that the fourteen-day suspension was too severe.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On April 4, 2018, the Arbitrator issued a supplemental award denying the Union's request for attorney fees. The supplemental award is nearly incomprehensible, and it is difficult to ascertain which portions of the analysis represent the Arbitrator's own findings of fact and conclusions of law, and which portions are restatements of the parties' positions or summaries of the facts and holdings of various Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) and court decisions. In the closing paragraph, the Arbitrator states that "the Agency met the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> [f]actor...5 and the 'interest of justice' was met." Although this statement could be interpreted as a determination that an award of attorney fees was warranted in the interest of justice, the context of the statement suggests the Arbitrator meant the opposite. Ultimately, the Arbitrator found that the Agency was the prevailing party, and he denied the Union's request for attorney fees. The Arbitrator did not make findings as to whether fees were incurred or the reasonable amount of those fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed exceptions to the supplemental award on May 2, 2018. Among other exceptions, the Union contends that the denial of attorney fees was contrary to law. On August 2, 2018, the Agency filed an opposition to the exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span> any questions of law raised by the exception and the award. In a case such as this one, where the decision to award backpay was not based on a finding of discrimination, the BPA requires that an award of fees be in accordance with the standards set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).[8] The Authority looks to decisions of the Board and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for guidance in interpreting those standards.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5596, 7701(g).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2002</span>, 70 FLRA 812, 814 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) requires that payment of fees is "warranted in the interest of justice." When, as in this case, the underlying grievance concerns a disciplinary action, the Authority determines whether the interest of justice requirement is satisfied by applying the criteria set forth by the Board in <span class="Italic">Allen</span>.[10] Here, the Union contends that payment of fees warranted in the interest of justice under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category (5), because the Agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it disciplined the employee.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, U.S. CBP</span>, 70 FLRA 73, 74 (2016). In addition to the categories listed in <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, the Authority has held that an award of fees is in the interest of justice when there is a service to the federal workforce or a benefit to the public derived from maintaining the action. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 69 FLRA 614, 618 (2016).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;2 M.S.P.R. at 435. Because the Union relies exclusively on <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category (5), we do not address the remaining <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories. <span class="Italic">See NAIL, Local 5</span>, 69 FLRA 573, 575 (2016).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In disciplinary actions,[12] "the penalty imposed by the agency is an aspect of the merits of the agency's case."[13] Hence, in a case such as this one, where the agency prevails on the charges[14] but the penalty is mitigated, an award of fees may be warranted in the interest of justice under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category (5) if and only if the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be sustained.[15] However, mitigation alone does not create a presumption that payment of fees is warranted.[16] The critical question is whether the agency acted unreasonably by imposing a penalty that it knew or should have known would not be sustained.[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;The Authority has recently clarified that when the grieved action is not disciplinary in nature, the interest-of-justice analysis is generally limited to categories (2) and (5). <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1633</span>, 71 FLRA 211 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting).</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;We acknowledge that, contrary to the Arbitrator's finding, the grievant was "the prevailing party" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) even though the Arbitrator sustained the underlying charges. <span class="Italic">See Dunn v. Dep't of VA</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (<span class="Italic">Dunn</span>) ("Because the arbitrator mitigated [the petitioners'] removals to thirty-day suspensions, [the petitioners] qualify as prevailing parties."); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 987</span>, 64 FLRA 884, 886-87 (2010) (finding that, where the arbitrator's award resulted in a mitigation of the grievant's suspension and an award of backpay, the grievant was the prevailing party, having received an enforceable judgment that benefited him at the time of the judgment). In the everyday sense of the word, however, the Agency may be said to have "prevailed" on the most important issue, namely the merits of the charge.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that under <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Department of the Air Force</span> (<span class="Italic">Lambert</span>),[18] fees must be awarded here in the interest of justice because the Agency knew or should have known that its chosen penalty would not be upheld. In <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, the Board held that payment of fees is generally warranted under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category (5) when the Board sustains the charges in an adverse action appeal but mitigates the penalty, provided the decision to mitigate was based on information available to the agency at the time it took the action.[19] The Board reasoned that, under <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>,[20] the Board will not mitigate a penalty unless it finds that the agency failed to consider the relevant factors or that its chosen penalty is outside the bounds of reasonableness.[21] Consequently, if the Board mitigates a penalty, and does so based on information that was available to the agency at the time of its decision, this amounts to a finding that the agency acted irresponsibly or unreasonably in selecting the penalty, which in turn implies that the agency knew or should have known that its penalty would not be sustained.[22]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[19]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 505-07.

The Board and the Authority have recognized that <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> is consistent with <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, as it does not establish a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule that mitigation alone warrants a fee award. <span class="Italic">See Payne v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 79 M.S.P.R. 71, 74 (1998); <span class="Italic">Local 3294</span>, 66 FLRA at 432.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">On several occasions, the Authority has applied <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> in cases involving minor disciplinary actions--e.g., suspensions of 14 days or less, written reprimands, and oral counselings.[23] We conclude, however, that the Board's rationale in <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> should not apply in this context, because <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> applies to adverse actions--e.g., suspensions of more than 14 days, demotions, and removals. First, when arbitrators review minor disciplinary actions, they are not required to apply the same substantive standards that the Board applies in its review of adverse actions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512.[24] Second, while the Board must defer to the agency's penalty determination, provided the agency considered all of the relevant factors and the penalty is within tolerable limits of reasonableness, arbitrators, however, may mitigate penalties using their own sense of fairness. Thus, in the grievance context, mitigation of a penalty does not necessarily imply that the agency knew or should have known that its penalty would not be sustained, even if the evidence on which the arbitrator relied was available to the agency at the time of its decision.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Authority will no longer follow <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> in cases where the arbitrator mitigates a minor disciplinary action. In other words, the fact that the evidence on which the arbitrator relied was available to the agency at the time it made its decision will not serve as a sufficient basis for finding that the agency knew or should have known that its penalty would not be sustained. Rather, in determining whether an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category (5), arbitrators must evaluate the nature and strength of the evidence that was available to the agency and assess whether its penalty determination was reasonable in light of that information. To hold otherwise would effectively require an agency to "have a crystal ball to predict precisely <span id="page_2449"></span>how an arbitrator will view the grievance."[25] Circumstances such as this, where all of the charges were sustained and the Agency's choice of penalty was consistent with its table of penalties, strongly support a finding that the Agency's penalty determination was reasonable, and that <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category (5) does not apply.[26]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Although I have previously suggested that the Authority reconsider the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors because they are unnecessarily cumbersome and impractical for practitioners and arbitrators, this reconsideration should not occur in a case, such as the one before us today, where our decision does not even require application of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors.[1] And rather than <span class="Italic">clarifying</span> the standards pertaining to <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category (5), the majority's decision will require arbitrators to determine whether an agency's penalty was "reasonable" without providing a coherent explanation as to how that determination should be made.[2] Indeed, the only guidance the majority provides in this respect suggests that it will not affirm an arbitrator's award of attorney fees in <span class="Italic">any</span> case where an agency's choice of penalty is consistent with that agency's table of penalties.

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the award is based on nonfacts because the grievant was substantially innocent of the charges, and therefore, the Arbitrator erred when he found that the fourteen-day suspension "was within the Agency's table of offenses for the misconduct at issue." The Union also argues that the award is based on nonfacts because, at the hearing, it disputed that the grievant was made aware of her misconduct four months after the Agency discovered the misconduct. To establish that an award is based on a nonfact, the appealing party must show that a central fact underlying the award is clearly erroneous, but for which the arbitrator would have reached a different result.[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union fails to demonstrate that the award is based on nonfacts.&#x2003;While the grievant's conduct was found to be unintentional, the Agency's table of penalties plainly demonstrates that a first offense for "a failure to follow policy, procedure, rules, and regulations" can range from a "reprimand to a fourteen&#8209;day suspension." Therefore, because the Union does not challenge the fact that the merits award sustained the charge of that offense, the mere fact that the grievant's conduct was not intentional does not constitute a basis for concluding that the fourteen&#8209;day suspension was not within the Agency's table of penalties.[21] Moreover, the Authority has held that a mere challenge to the weight accorded testimony does not provide a basis for finding that an award is based on nonfacts.[22] Therefore, in the absence of evidence demonstrating that the Arbitrator's conclusions are clearly erroneous, the Union fails to demonstrate that the Arbitrator's findings regarding the exact time when the grievant became aware of her misconduct are based on a nonfact.[23] Consequently, we deny the Union's nonfact exceptions.</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2450"></span>Here, the Arbitrator's findings in the fee award clearly demonstrate that attorney fees are not warranted under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor. The Union argues that attorney fees are warranted because Arbitrator Croasdale mitigated the grievant's suspension from fourteen to five days because her conduct was not "intentional," but rather was due to "sloppy" work habits. Therefore, the Union argues that the Agency should have known that the fourteen&#8209;day suspension would not be upheld. However, the Union does not raise a nonfact challenge to the Arbitrator's finding that the "grievant did not raise 'sloppy work habits' to the Agency as the reason for her 'working off the clock,' during the investigation." Therefore, because the record clearly demonstrates that the Agency was not aware during the investigation that the grievant was claiming her actions were unintentional, the Agency could not have known that the suspension would be mitigated.[35]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Arbitrator noted that the grievant was guilty of the charge brought against her and that the Agency's fourteen&#8209;day suspension for a "Failure/Refusal to Follow Orders" was within the table of penalties for a first offense. Therefore, consistent with <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2076</span>, the mere fact that the grievant's suspension was mitigated to five days does not demonstrate that the merits award supports an award of attorney fees under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor.[37] Accordingly, because the Authority no longer follows <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> in cases where minor discipline has been mitigated, the Union fails to demonstrate that the fee award is contrary to law under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the grievant was substantially innocent under the second <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor. An employee is substantially innocent as a matter of law when he or she prevails on substantive rather than technical grounds on the major charges.[38] Additionally, an employee is substantially innocent when he or she is essentially without fault for the charges alleged, and was needlessly subjected to attorney fees in order to vindicate herself.[39] While the Arbitrator noted that the grievant was not guilty of intentional misconduct, he found that the "[original] arbitrator did not find the grievant substantially innocent of the charge" and that she failed/refused to follow orders. As a result, because the grievant was not substantially innocent of the only charge brought against her, the Union has failed to demonstrated that the fee award is contrary to law under the second <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor.[41] Therefore, we deny this exception.</p>

<p class="noindent">A fee award was set aside when FLRA concluded that, although the arbitrator found the disciplinary suspension untimely under the contract, the agency did not act in bad faith (it had already reduced the length of the suspension), the agency could not properly be said to have known it would not prevail (there was evidence of misconduct), and the delay in imposition of the suspension was not gross procedural error (the delay caused no prejudice to the grievant).

<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrator Almalee P. Guttshall issued an award sustaining the Union's request for attorney fees based, in part, on Agency management having reduced the grievant's suspension from seven to two days. The Arbitrator found that the reduction of the suspension showed that the Agency initiated the suspension in bad faith and knew, or should have known, that it would not prevail on the merits. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">On exceptions, the Agency argued that the award of attorney fees was contrary-to-law and based on nonfacts. We grant the contrary-to-law exception because the Arbitrator's application of the <span class="Italic">Allen v.

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the fee award is contrary to the Back Pay Act, which incorporates &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1)'s interest-of-justice standard for attorney-fee awards. Specifically, the Agency argues that neither its violation of the parties' agreement nor its reduction of the suspension establishes that the Agency acted in bad faith, committed a gross procedural error, or knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits of the disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, a prerequisite for an award of attorney fees under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) is that the award of attorney fees must be in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">Allen's</span> illustrative criteria for determining whether fees are in the interest of justice include whether (1) the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice; (2) the agency's action was clearly without merit, or was wholly unfounded, or the employee is substantially innocent of the charges brought by the agency; (3) the agency initiated the action against the employee in bad faith; (4) the agency committed a gross procedural error which prolonged the proceeding or severely prejudiced the employee; or (5) the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding. In resolving whether an arbitrator properly applied the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> interest-of-justice factors, the Authority looks to the decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.[17]</p>

However, the Union did not present any specific evidence before the Arbitrator to support the claim that the Agency acted in bad faith in this case. The Union does not allege, and the record does not indicate, that the Agency proposed suspending the grievant to "harass" him or to "exert improper pressure on [him] to act in certain ways." Further, the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant "was lying and taking payment he had not earned" undermines any notion that the Agency brought the disciplinary action for improper reasons.</p>

However, the grievant's admitted guilt, paired with the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant lied and took payment he had not earned, rebuts the Arbitrator's determination that the Agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits.</p>

In order to prove that an agency committed a gross procedural error warranting attorney fees, a party must demonstrate more than "simply ‘harmful' procedural error"; gross procedural errors include those errors sufficient to require reversal of the agency action.[35] To assess this standard, the MSPB balances the nature of, and any excuse for, the agency's error against the prejudice and burden that error caused the appellant.[36] If the prejudice and burden to the appellant predominates, then gross procedural error exists and the appellant is entitled to a fee award.[37] The MSPB specifically requires that "the [procedural] error must have resulted in ‘prejudice and burden' to the appellant."[38] And in <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, the MSPB noted legislative history that discussed gross procedural error as being a situation "where the employee has been dragged through a lengthy and costly legal proceeding while in fact he was innocent of the charges."[39]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Again, <span class="Italic">CBP El Paso</span> is instructive. There, the Authority considered a similar Article 32(G) violation and found that a 695-day delay did not constitute gross procedural error.[40] In so holding, the Authority emphasized that even if the agency had proposed the grievant's discipline sooner, the grievant would not "have been any less responsible for his admitted misconduct," so the length of the investigation "did not cause the grievant to suffer prejudice and burden."[41]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In the case presently before us, the Union's motion for attorney fees neglected these central concepts of prejudice and burden to the grievant and equated the Agency's violation of Article 32(G) with a finding of gross procedural error. Despite the Union's assertion to the contrary, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency did not furnish the grievant with notice of his discipline "as soon as practicable" does not automatically equal a gross procedural error.[45]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[45]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See CBP El Paso</span>, 71 FLRA at 600.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not find that the Agency's four-month delay in disciplining the grievant prejudiced and burdened the grievant. Here the grievant was neither dragged through a "lengthy and costly legal proceeding"[47] nor was he "innocent of the charges";[48] in fact, the grievant admitted to the charges alleged by the disciplinary action. Further, the grievant's four-month delay is far less than the 695-day delay in <span class="Italic">CBP El Paso</span>, which the Authority found was insufficient to establish gross procedural error.[50]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, attorney fees are not warranted in the interest of justice, and we set aside the fee award as contrary to the Back Pay Act.[51]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[51]&#x2003;The Agency also argues that the fee award is based on nonfacts. Exceptions Br. at 6.

<p class="noindent">Recognizing the 2019 revision in approach of FLRA to analysis of fee petitions in cases involving awards of pay or benefits and mitigation of minor disciplinary penalties, we continue our discussion of <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> and elaboration on the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criteria in the context of arbitration provided in <span class="Italic">Naval Air Dev. Ctr. and AFGE Local 1928, AFL-CIO</span>, 21 FLRA 131, 136-41 (1986) (an EDP case) [discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-17-401.html#sec9-399">Required Findings and Analysis</a>"]. Additional discussion of counsel fee justification was offered in <span class="Italic">FAA Nat'l Aviation Facilities Experimental Ctr. and NFFE Local 1340</span>, 32 FLRA 750, 752 (1988). The arbitrator vacated a three-day suspension and awarded back pay after finding the agency did not prove charges of negligent work performance and giving false information to his supervisor. The arbitrator then denied fees because the agency had reason for bringing charges against the employee and could not have known in advance that it would lose the case in arbitration. Setting the denial of fees aside for failure properly to apply the law, FLRA declared:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the result of the appeal shows that (1) an agency's action was "clearly without merit" or "wholly unfounded," or (2) the employee was "substantially innocent," a determination as to whether the attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice should not be made by references to the agency's motivation at the time it initiated its action....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "substantially innocent" standard is not satisfied by an employee who deliberately fails to communicate facts which would lead the deciding official to decide to modify or overturn the disciplinary action....&#8197;However, a decision that an employee is "substantially innocent" of the agency charges requires a determination that reasonable attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 34 FLRA 725, 728-33 (1990), reaffirmed the application of the MSPB's <span class="Italic">Allen</span> [2 MSPR 420 (1980)] factors, to be used by arbitrators in determining whether the interest of justice standard has been met. Citing <span class="Italic">Sims v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 711 F.2d 1578, 1580-82 (Fed. Cir. 1983), FLRA concluded that fees are not warranted under the "clearly without merit" or "wholly unfounded" fee standards if the grievant admitted or was involved in some wrongdoing leading to the initial discipline. Citing <span class="Italic">Massa v. DOD</span>, 833 F.2d 991, 997 (Fed. Cir. 1987), FLRA determined that the grievant did not demonstrate "substantial innocence" because the charges against the grievant were sustained, meaning that the grievant was not without fault and was not needlessly subjected to fees. As to the fee standard requiring a determination of whether the agency should have known that it would not prevail on the merits, FLRA recognized the import of <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 501 (1987), allowing fees when unreasonable agency penalties are mitigated. Having recognized the existence of <span class="Italic">Lambert,</span> FLRA essentially ignored its reasoning and determined that the arbitrator properly held the agency should not have known that the two-day suspension against the grievant would not be sustained.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA refined the analysis in <span class="Italic">Army Hq., XVIII Airborne Corps, Ft. Bragg and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 35 FLRA 390, 394-96 (1990), attempting to distinguish <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories 2 ("substantial innocence" or "clearly without merit" or "wholly unfounded") and 5 ("knew or should have known that [the agency] would not prevail on the merits" when it brought the proceeding):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is important to recognize that criterion 5 and criterion 2 have different focal points.&#x2003;Criterion 5 requires a showing that the agency, by making a reasonable inquiry, should have determined that its action was without merit but nevertheless persisted in its action....&#8197;Criterion 2, on the other hand, refers to the result of the appeal, not to the evidence and information available prior to the hearing....&#8197;Thus, under criterion 2, the focus of the arbitrator's analysis should be based on the decision he or she has rendered, that is, the extent to which the grievant has prevailed or the agency's action is found to be without merit or unfounded....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under criterion 5, an award of attorney fees is warranted...where the activity "knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Arbitrator found that the conflicting "views" concerning hazards in the work area presented questions of fact "to be resolved by neutral analysis." Therefore, the Arbitrator did not find the Activity knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits. In our view, the Union fails to establish that the denial of fees in these circumstances is contrary to law....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under criterion 2, an award of...fees is warranted...where...the agency's actions are clearly without merit....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Arbitrator should have focused on the merits of the grievance before him....&#8197;[T]he underlying award fully sustained the grievance....&#8197;Consequently, the Arbitrator sustained the Union's grievance and awarded retroactive EDP to the affected employees....&#8197;We note that the Arbitrator must still decide the Union's request under the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criteria and, notwithstanding his findings as to the grievance, he <span id="page_2452"></span>can and may determine that the Activity's action was not unfounded or clearly without merit....</p>
<p class="noindent">Still more guidance on counsel fees arrived when FLRA denied union exceptions to an award that disallowed fees following an award mitigating a five-day suspension for AWOL to a reprimand. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 38 FLRA 1240, 1249-54 (1990), considered both prevailing party status and application of the "interest of justice" criteria under <span class="Italic">Allen</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Prevailing Party</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to be eligible for attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), an employee must be a prevailing party in the proceeding. This requirement is met if the employee has obtained all or a significant part of the relief which was sought. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 4015</span>, 34 FLRA 725, 728-29 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Department of Navy</span>). The "prevailing party" requirement was examined in detail by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In applying this standard, it should be borne in mind that determining who prevails is really no more than a totaling up of who won and who lost. It is a practical matter: for example, if a penalty is imposed against an employee and, as a result of his appeal, it is reduced, then that employee may be deemed to have prevailed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Sterner v. Department of the Army</span>, 711 F.2d 1563, 1567 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (footnote omitted) (<span class="Italic">Sterner</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the definition of "prevailing party" set forth in <span class="Italic">Sterner</span>, a grievant may be the prevailing party in the proceeding if he or she obtains mitigation of discipline, even though he or she may have committed the offense which is the basis for that discipline. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, 34 FLRA at 728-29. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Van Fossen v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 788 F.2d 748, 749 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator in this case found that although the grievant properly was subject to discipline, the 5-day suspension should be mitigated. We conclude, consistent with <span class="Italic">Sterner</span> and <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, that the mitigation is sufficient to make the grievant the prevailing party for the purpose of determining eligibility for attorney fees. Therefore, we agree with the union that the Arbitrator erred by finding that the grievant was not the prevailing party. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Navy</span>, at 728-29.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Interest of Justice</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the grievant was the prevailing party, it is necessary to determine whether the Arbitrator's denial of fees is proper under the "interest of justice" requirement. The court stated in <span class="Italic">Sterner</span> that "[t]he determination of who prevailed is, after all, only a threshold test of <span class="Italic">eligibility</span>; the more difficult question of <span class="Italic">entitlement</span> is reserved for the second prerequisite, 'warranted in the interest of justice.' Eligibility is broad but the entitlement standard operates to limit it." <span class="Italic">Sterner</span>, 711 F.2d at 1567....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Allen v. United States Postal Service</span>, 2 MSPR 420 (1980) (<span class="Italic">Allen</span>), the MSPB listed five illustrative examples which "provide a useful indication of circumstances considered to reflect 'the interest of justice.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 434. The Authority applies the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> standards, as interpreted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (<span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Boese v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">Boese</span>)), in determining whether an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice if <span class="Italic">any</span> of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criteria are met....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As there is no contention that attorney fees are warranted on the basis of criterion 1, 3, or 4, we will address only criterion 2 and 5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Criterion 2</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under criterion 2, an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice where the result of the appeal--here the arbitration award--shows that (1) the agency's action was "clearly without merit" or was "wholly unfounded"; or (2) the employee is "substantially innocent" of the charges brought by the agency....&#8197;In determining whether fees are warranted under criterion 2, "the competing interests to be examined are the degree of fault on the employee's part and the existence of any reasonable basis for the agency's action." <span class="Italic">Lokos v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 44 MSPR 115, 120 (1990). With respect to the latter point, we note that in <span class="Italic">Sims v. Department of the Navy</span>, 711 F.2d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">Sims</span>), the court determined that an employee whose removal was mitigated to a 10-day suspension was not entitled to attorney fees under criterion 2, because the grievant admitted the wrongdoing. The court held that "[t]he agency's adverse action was not 'clearly without merit,' and it concerned indisputably improper conduct." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1582.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator noted the grievant's long history of late arrivals and stated that if the grievant had been warned by his supervisor at an earlier date about his late arrivals, he "would have had no difficulty whatsoever in accepting the propriety of a five day suspension." As some of the grievant's late arrivals preceded the official warning from his supervisor, however, the Arbitrator mitigated the discipline to an official reprimand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found both that the grievant acted improperly and that "the Agency was correct in concluding that discipline was warranted[.]..." In view of these findings, and the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Sims</span>, we have no basis on which to conclude that the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency's action was not clearly without merit is contrary to law. Therefore, we conclude that the Union has failed to show that the Agency's action was "clearly without merit" or "wholly unfounded" so as to warrant an award of attorney fees under the first factor of criterion 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to whether the grievant was "substantially innocent" of the Agency's charges, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has stated that "the substantially innocent standard means that...an employee is essentially without fault for the charges alleged, and was needlessly subjected to attorney fees in order to vindicate himself." <span class="Italic">Massa v. Department of Defense</span>, 833 F.2d 991, 993 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">Massa</span>). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Defense</span>, 42 MSPR 35, 43 (1989) (MSPB found that "the appellant was not without fault and was therefore not substantially innocent.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Arbitrator's findings that the charges against the grievant were sustained support a conclusion that the grievant was not without fault and was not needlessly subjected to attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Massa</span>, 833 F.2d 991. <span class="Italic">Compare Boese</span>, 784 F.2d at 391, in which the court overruled the MSPB's denial of attorney fees because the grievant was shown to be "substantially innocent" of the charges; and <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration, National Aviation Facilities, Experimental Center and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1340</span>, 32 FLRA 750 (1988), in which the Authority found that the arbitrator failed to apply the correct "interest of justice" standard when he denied attorney fees to an employee against whom charges were not proven. Because the Arbitrator in this case found that the grievant was not "substantially innocent" and the Union fails to show that this finding is contrary to law, attorney fees are not warranted under the second factor of criterion 2. <span class="Italic">See Department of Navy</span>, 34 FLRA at 731-32.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Criterion 5</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under criterion 5, an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice where the agency "knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits" when it brought the proceeding. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPR at 435. The Arbitrator found that this criterion was not met because "[t]o say that the Agency did not succeed in suspending the [grievant] is not to say that it did not prevail on the merits. Clearly, the Agency was correct in concluding that discipline was warranted[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that attorney fees are warranted under this criterion, as interpreted by the MSPB in <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> and <span class="Italic">Sprenger</span>. In <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, the MSPB ruled that an employee was not substantially innocent, but that attorney fees were warranted in the interest of justice because the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the discipline imposed--a removal which was mitigated by the MSPB to a 60-day suspension. The MSPB held "that the penalty is part of the merits of the case, and that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice where the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would be reversed." <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, 34 MSPR at 505. In <span class="Italic">Sprenger</span>, 34 MSPR 664, the MSPB awarded attorney fees to an employee whose reduction in grade was mitigated to a 30-day suspension. The MSPB concluded that, under <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, the appellant had "carried his burden of showing that the agency 'knew or should have known that it could not prevail' on its selection of the penalty, which is part of the merits of the case, when it brought the adverse action." <span class="Italic">Sprenger</span>, 34 MSPR at 668.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, it is clear that, with respect to criterion 5, attorney fees may be warranted based on mitigation of a penalty even when the charges underlying the penalty are sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, 34 MSPR at 505. <span class="Italic">See also</span>, <span class="Italic">Ciarla v. United States Postal Service</span>, 43 MSPR 240, 244 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Ciarla</span>) ("attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice under the knew-or-should-have-known category where all of the charges of misconduct against an appellant are sustained but the Board still mitigates the agency-imposed penalty because it exceeds the bounds of reasonableness."). In this regard, the "critical point" is that "an agency should not act irresponsibly or unreasonably in imposing a penalty if it either knows or should have known that the penalty would not withstand...scrutiny, even if all of the charges are sustained." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 245. It is also clear that this criterion is applied based on whether the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail at the time it took the disputed action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yorkshire v. Merit Service Protection Board</span>, 746 F.2d 1454, 1457-59 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Arbitrator concluded that the grievant committed the offense and that disciplinary action was warranted. The Arbitrator stated, in addition, that if the grievant had been warned about his late arrivals at an earlier date, the Arbitrator "would have had no difficulty in accepting the propriety of a five day suspension." Based on these findings, the Arbitrator stated that "[t]o say that the Agency did not succeed in suspending the [grievant] is not to say that it did not prevail on the merits." The Arbitrator stated also, in this regard, that the suspension could not be characterized as an "avoidable [A]gency action."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2453"></span>In these circumstances, and based on the record as a whole, we conclude that the Union has not demonstrated that, as a matter of law, it is entitled to attorney fees because the Agency knew or should have known that the proposed 5-day suspension exceeded the "bounds of reasonableness" or would not withstand...scrutiny. <span class="Italic">Ciarla</span>, 43 MSPR at 244, 245. Moreover, there is nothing in the record before us on which to conclude that the Agency failed fully to investigate the case or relied on incomplete facts and information in deciding to suspend the grievant. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>, 746 F.2d at 1457 (if an agency is "negligent in its conduct of the investigation then the agency 'knew or should have known' not to take the action"); <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Region IV, Atlanta, Georgia and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 210</span>, 34 FLRA 823, 831-33 (1990) (fees were warranted under criterion 5 because but for the agency's reliance on incomplete facts and information, the agency would have known that it would not prevail in arbitration).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's failure to award fees under criterion 5 violates law, rule, or regulation. We find, therefore, that the Union has failed to demonstrate that the supplemental award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA applied the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors and denied fees in <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 220 and SSA,</span> 61 FLRA 582, 585-86 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator's award and award clarification and the record permit us to make the appropriate resolution of this attorney fees dispute. The disputed <span class="Italic">Allen </span>factors are discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The First <span class="Italic">Allen</span> Factor</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the Agency committed a prohibited personnel practice, the first <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor. However, the Union never identifies which of the twelve prohibited personnel practices set out at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) it believes took place, or explains how the Agency's actions constitute a prohibited personnel practice. Given the Union's failure to explain how the Agency's conduct amounted to a prohibited personnel practice, or to even identify which of the twelve types of prohibited personnel practices is at issue in this case, the Union's claim amounts to a bare assertion that does not support its position. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Tex.</span>, 58 FLRA 87, 91 (2002). Therefore, we conclude that the Union has not established that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice based upon fulfillment of the first <span class="Italic">Allen </span>factor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The Third <span class="Italic">Allen</span> Factor</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor is that the agency's actions were taken in bad faith. The Union notes in its exceptions that it did not allege before the Arbitrator that attorney fees were warranted because the Agency's actions were taken in bad faith. The Arbitrator, however, construed certain of the Union's arguments as alleging bad faith on the part of the Agency, but found that "[n]o specific examples are cited by the Union in its charge of bad faith on the part of the Agency." Assuming without deciding that the issue of bad faith is before us, the Union does not dispute that it provided no specific examples to the Arbitrator regarding any bad faith on the part of the Agency, and we note that the Union has presented no support for a claim that the Agency acted in bad faith. Thus, we deny any such claim as a bare assertion and conclude that attorney fees are not warranted in the interest of justice based upon any bad faith by the Agency in taking these personnel actions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Coatesville, Pa.</span>, 56 FLRA 966, 971 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;The Fourth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> Factor</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fourth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor is that the agency committed a gross procedural error that prolonged the proceedings or severely prejudiced the employees. In order to prove that a "gross" procedural error occurred an employee must establish that the error amounts to more than simple harmful error warranting reversal of an agency action. <span class="Italic">See Olson v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 62 MSPR 261, 265 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Olson</span>). For example, the MSPB found that gross procedural error occurred warranting an award of attorney fees when an agency, while conducting a reduction-in-force (RIF), failed to give an employee the required specific RIF notice, did not establish required competitive areas, competitive levels, and retention lists, did not consider or honor the employee's bump and retreat rights, and did not accord him priority placement required for preference-eligible employees. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. United States Postal Serv</span>., 77 MSPR 502 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims it was obvious that the grievants were "severely prejudiced" by the Agency's actions and were forced to go through a "long drawn out and protracted grievance procedure" which subjected the grievants to a loss of income and future promotional opportunities. The Arbitrator, however, found that the grievants were not "severely prejudiced as to backpay and interest and future promotional opportunities[&#8197;]" by the Agency's actions and denied any attorney fee award based upon this <span class="Italic">Allen </span>factor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conducting a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review we note that the Union did not allege or argue any particular procedural error, "gross" or otherwise, on the Agency's part, in taking these personnel actions: the only arguments asserted addressed a prolongment of the grievance process and severe prejudice to the grievants' income and future promotional opportunities. A party has no entitlement to attorney fees under this factor absent a showing of gross procedural error. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Olson, </span>62 MSPR at 265. Consequently, the Union has not established that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice because the Agency committed a gross procedural error.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;The Fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> Factor</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor is whether the Agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits with respect to its decision not to provide the grievants their priority consideration rights. Whether fees are warranted under this factor requires evaluation of the nature and weight of the agency's evidence. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 50</span>, 54 FLRA 250, 254 (1998) (<span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 50</span>). The knew-or-should-have-known factor essentially requires an arbitrator to determine the reasonableness of an agency's actions and positions in light of what information was available to it at the time it makes its decision to take the personnel action involved. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(<span class="Italic">citing Mullins-Howard v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 619, 626 (1996)). That assessment is primarily factual, because the arbitrator evaluates the evidence and the agency's handling of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 50</span>, 54 FLRA at 254.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To substantiate its contention that the Agency should have known that it would not prevail on the merits, the Union relies on the number of witnesses it called versus those called by the Agency. According to the Union, it called expert witnesses and four factual witnesses to testify before the Arbitrator, while the Agency only called two witnesses. However, the Arbitrator concluded that it was "speculation to assume that the number and type of witnesses called show that the Agency knew it would not prevail on the merits."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conducting a <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review of this claim, we conclude that the number of witnesses called by the Agency at the hearing on the merits of the personnel action, by itself does not establish that the Agency knew, at the time it took the personnel action, that it would not prevail on the merits of the case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Health Care Fin. Admin</span>., 26 FLRA 860, 863 (1987) (agency failed to substantiate in what way the testimony of scheduled witnesses could have changed the facts). <span class="Italic">See also Lofton v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 12 MSPR 91 (1982) (witnesses would have no knowledge of appellant's performance); <span class="Italic">Christensen v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 11 MSPR 209 (1982) (number of supervisory scientists sought as witnesses would have no knowledge of reduction-in-force procedures). In particular, the Union has not shown how the number of witnesses called at a hearing subsequent to an action is an indication of what the Agency knew or should have known at the time of the action. Accordingly, we conclude that the Union has not established that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice because the Agency knew at the time it took these personnel actions that it would not prevail.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1061 and VAMC Los Angeles</span>, 63 FLRA 317, 317-21 (2009), another example of the multifactor fee analysis in the circumstances of a mitigated disciplinary penalty, determined that the arbitrator correctly denied fees under the interest of justice standard:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant was charged with acting inappropriately and in violation of Agency standards of conduct when he intimidated a colleague by speaking in a loud tone and pointing a pen at her in a threatening manner. He was also charged with tape recording his colleague without her permission. The Agency suspended the grievant for three days for behaving in a threatening manner and tape recording the conversation. The grievant filed a grievance that was submitted to arbitration on the stipulated issues of whether the grievant acted inappropriately and, if so, whether the penalty was reasonable and just in accordance with Agency regulations and the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the grievant engaged in intimidating behavior that caused his colleague to feel threatened.&#x2003;However, she found that the tape recording charge was not sustained because the Agency had not met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the grievant made an electronic recording without permission. In this regard, the Arbitrator observed that the grievant's supervisor could conclude that the grievant admitted he had a tape recorder with him during the incident giving rise to the charges. The Arbitrator also observed, however, that the grievant's supervisor could conclude to the contrary. The Arbitrator concluded that the three-day suspension was not a reasonable and just penalty because the tape recording charge was not sustained and that the seriousness of the intimidation charge could be impressed upon the grievant by a written reprimand. Therefore, the Arbitrator ruled that the suspension was to be rescinded, the grievant was to be made whole, and a written reprimand for inappropriate conduct was to be issued.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, the Union submitted an application for an award of attorney fees in the amount of $42,437.50 under the Back Pay Act and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). In particular, the Union claimed that the grievant was entitled to an award of fees under the Back Pay Act because the grievant was the prevailing party and an award of fees was warranted <span id="page_2454"></span>in the interest of justice. As for the interest of justice, the Union asserted that the Agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits and that the grievant was substantially innocent of the charges brought by the Agency. In response, the Agency disputed that an award of fees was warranted in the interest of justice and that the Union's requested amount was reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving the Union's application, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency did not know or have reason to know that the charges would not be upheld. The Arbitrator also concluded that the grievant was not substantially innocent because he did not prevail on the more serious of the two charges. Therefore, the Arbitrator denied the fee request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, an award of attorney fees must be in accordance with the standards established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g). The prerequisites for an award of attorney fees under &#x00A7; 7701(g) are that: (1) the employee is the prevailing party; (2) the award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice; (3) the amount of fees is reasonable; and (4) the fees were incurred by the employee. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Phila. Serv. Or., Phila., Pa.,</span> 53 FLRA 1697, 1699 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Attorney Fees Are Not Warranted in the Interest of Justice</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When exceptions concern standards established under &#x00A7; 7701(g), the Authority looks to the decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for guidance. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Def., Def. Distrib. Region E., New Cumberland, Pa.,</span> 51 FLRA 155, 160 n.5 (1995). In <span class="Italic">Allen v. United States Postal Service,</span> 2 M.S.P.R. 420 (1980) <span class="Italic">(Allen),</span> the MSPB listed five broad categories of cases in which an award of attorney fees would be warranted in the interest of justice: (1) cases involving a prohibited personnel practice; (2) agency actions clearly without merit or wholly unfounded, or in which the employee is substantially innocent of charges brought by the agency; (3) agency actions taken in bad faith to harass or exert improper pressure on an employee; (4) agency gross procedural error which prolonged the proceeding or severely prejudiced the employee; or (5) cases where the agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding. 2 M.S.P.R. at 434-35. Another criterion that the Authority has added is whether a service was rendered to the federal work force, or the public derived a benefit, from maintaining the action. <span class="Italic">Naval Air Dev. Ctr., Dep't of the Navy,</span> 21 FLRA 131, 139 (1986). The Authority applies these criteria in resolving exceptions to an arbitrator's determination under the "interest of justice" standard. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Asheville, N.C.,</span> 59 FLRA 605, 609 (2004). An award of fees is warranted if any of these criteria is satisfied. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 609.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the Union contends that an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice because of the first, second, and fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;No prohibited personnel practice was involved</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first criterion for an award of attorney fees warranted in the interest of justice is whether the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 2 M.S.P.R. at 434. The Union asserts that the Agency committed a prohibited personnel practice when it imposed the three-day suspension. The Union identifies the personnel practice as a "decision concerning pay" covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ix). However, the Union does not identify which of the 12 types of prohibitions set out in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) is at issue in this case or explain how the Agency's action constituted a prohibited personnel practice. Therefore, the Union's claim amounts to a bare assertion that does not support its position. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Council 220,</span> 61 FLRA 582, 585 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, attorney fees are not warranted under criterion 1 of the "interest of justice" standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The grievant was not substantially innocent of the charges</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second criterion for an award of attorney fees warranted in the interest of justice is whether the agency action is clearly without merit or wholly unfounded, or whether the appellant is substantially innocent of the charges brought by the agency. <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 2 M.S.P.R. at 434. The Federal Circuit has found that "substantial[&#8197;] innocence" is an operative <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category in and of itself. <span class="Italic">Van Fossen v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 788 F.2d 748, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The "substantial" aspect is met when the employee is without fault, and was needlessly subjected to attorney fees in order to vindicate himself. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Defense,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 35, 42 (1989) (citing<span class="Italic"> Massa v. Department of Defense,</span> 833 F.2d 991 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). Put another way, it is met when the employee "is innocent of the primary or major charges, or of the more important and greater part of the original charges." 42 M.S.P.R. at 42. <span class="Italic">See also Boese v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 784 F.2d 388 (Fed. Cir. 1986) <span class="Italic">(Boese)</span> (fees awarded when employee vindicated on the major charge and the secondary charge was upheld); <span class="Italic">Van Fossen, supra</span> (fees awarded when sustained charges were technical and very minor). The "substantially innocent" criterion of <span class="Italic">Allen</span> refers to the "result of the case" in an arbitration award or before the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Boese,</span> 784 F.2d at 391; <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R5-188,</span> 54 FLRA 1401, 1407 (1998) (Member Wasserman dissenting on other grounds).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determinative principle of these holdings is that substantial innocence is an objective assessment of the merits of the employee's challenge to the agency's disciplinary action. These cases demonstrate that an employee who has prevailed on substantive rather than technical grounds on the major charges is substantially innocent as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R5-188,</span> 54 FLRA at 1407.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's factual findings, to which we defer, establish that the grievant was not substantially innocent within the meaning of the second <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criterion. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that the grievant was disrespectful and engaged in intimidating behavior that threatened his colleague. Therefore, the Arbitrator found that the grievant did not prevail on the Agency's more serious charge. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Van Fossen</span> and <span class="Italic">Boese,</span> this finding supports the Arbitrator's conclusion on this criterion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jones, supra.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, attorney fees are not warranted under criterion 2 of the "interest of justice" standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;The agency did not know and should not have known that it would not prevail on the merits</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fifth criterion for an award of attorney fees warranted in the interest of justice is whether the agency "knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits" when it brought the proceeding. 2 M.S.P.R. at 435. A determination of whether an agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits requires an arbitrator to determine the reasonableness of the agency's actions in light of the information available to the agency at the time it imposed discipline. <span class="Italic">GSA,</span> 61 FLRA at 70. This determination is primarily factual because the arbitrator evaluates the evidence and the agency's handling of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Consequently, when the factual findings support the arbitrator's legal conclusion, the Authority will deny the exceptions to the arbitrator's determination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority has held that "the penalty is part of the merits of the case, and that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice where the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would be reversed." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12,</span> 38 FLRA 1240, 1253 (1990) (citing<span class="Italic"> Lambert v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 34 M.S.P.R. 501, 505 (1987)). Where an agency's choice of penalty is based on multiple charges, and an arbitrator's decision to reduce the penalty is based in part on the fact that not all of the charges were sustained, "it cannot be said that the agency should have known its original penalty selection was not reasonable." <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R4-6,</span> 56 FLRA 1092, 1095 (2001) (quoting <span class="Italic">Shelton,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. at 221-22).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency determined what penalty to impose based on its evaluation of two charges, threatening behavior and impermissible tape recording, and the Arbitrator reduced the penalty based on her dismissal of the tape recording charge. Although the Arbitrator dismissed that charge, she found that Agency management could have concluded that the grievant admitted to carrying a tape recorder during the incident of threatening behavior. Moreover, the Arbitrator found that the testimony and documentary evidence presented during the hearing demonstrated that the Agency had no substantive basis for believing, at the time the discipline was imposed, that the tape recording charge would not be sustained. These findings support the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agency neither knew nor should have known that its three-day penalty would not be sustained on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, attorney fees are not warranted under criterion 5 of the "interest of justice" standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Arbitrator set forth a fully articulated decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the fee award was conclusory, primarily because it was four pages long with one-and-one-half pages of analysis. In resolving a request for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act, an arbitrator must provide a fully articulated, reasoned decision setting forth specific findings supporting determinations on each pertinent statutory requirement. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-109,</span> 49 FLRA 815, 818 (1994). It is clear from the award that the Arbitrator sufficiently articulated her reasons with respect to her determination that an award of attorney fees was not in the interest of justice. Specifically, the Arbitrator discussed each of the six standards set out in <span class="Italic">Allen v. United States Postal Service, supra,</span> when determining that attorney fees were not warranted as in the interest of justice. As such, the record permits us to appropriately resolve the exceptions disputing the Arbitrator's determinations on pertinent statutory requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, based on the foregoing, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Denial of another fee application was sustained, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 and USDA, Forest Serv., Asheville</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-200.html">71 FLRA 1020</a>, 1020-21 (2020) (Member DuBester concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that an award of attorney fees was not in the interest of justice because the Agency's action was not clearly without merit, the grievant was not substantially innocent, and the Agency did not know, or <span id="page_2455"></span>could not have known, that it would not prevail. In evaluating the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had a reasonable basis for disciplining the grievant because the "Agency thoroughly investigated and collected statements from various individuals," and the "statements contained observations that, if true, would constitute a reasonable basis for discipline." The Arbitrator also found that the grievant was not substantially innocent because the reasons for reversing the discipline were limited to the Agency failing to meet its burden of proof on charge one and the grievant's actions not warranting discipline on charge two. Finally, the Arbitrator found that the Agency could not have known that it would not prevail on the merits because the Arbitrator's decision rested on credibility determinations of witnesses and evidence that were only determinable at hearing. Based on these conclusions, the Arbitrator denied the Union's motion for attorney fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...the Arbitrator acknowledged and addressed each <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor raised by the Union. The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency's action was not "clearly without merit or wholly unfounded," that the grievant was not substantially innocent, and that the Agency could not have known it would not prevail on the merits. We fail to see how the Arbitrator's fully articulated and well-reasoned denial of attorney fees based on the application of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr. and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 57 FLRA 417, 423 (2001) ("clearly without merit" standard supported fee award when agency should readily have concluded, based on past practice, that interest was payable after grievance resulted in employee's entitlement to back pay for unjustifiably delayed within grade increase); <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-6 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Eustis</span>, 56 FLRA 1092, 1094-95 (2001) (sustaining award denying fees as to penalty mitigation; FLRA considered "substantial innocence," "clearly without merit and wholly unfounded," and "knew or should have known" fee tests).</p>
<p class="noindent">That the agency violated a legal requirement concerning pay administration, although placing the union into prevailing party status, did not automatically warrant a fee award, <span class="Italic">IBEW Local 2219 and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Little Rock</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/node/78167">69 FLRA 431</a>, 434-35 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Union argues that, because it successfully recovered employee compensation that federal law "mandated" and that otherwise would have been lost, the Arbitrator should have recognized the Union's success as demonstrating that attorney fees were in the interest of justice here. For support, the Union relies on Chairman Calhoun's concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Naval Air Development Center, Department of the Navy</span> (<span class="Italic">Navy</span>),[58] in which he stated that attorney fees may be in the interest of justice where an agency acts "in disregard of prevailing law" to deny employees compensation for "shift differentials."[59] But in <span class="Italic">Navy's</span> other concurring opinion, Member Frazier clarified that "prevailing in an arbitration award which calls for backpay...is not, standing alone, a sufficient basis for an award of attorney fees. It is only the first step in meeting the requirements under the [BPA]."[60] And the Authority has never found that Chairman Calhoun's concurrence supports granting fees based solely on the existence of a legal violation that resulted in lost compensation.[61] In that regard, the Union's argument is inconsistent with the principle that correcting an "unwarranted or unjustified personnel action"[62] and recovering backpay will not, standing alone, support an attorney-fee award under the BPA.[63] Moreover, the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency acted "in disregard of prevailing law,"[64] but, rather, that the Agency made a mistake despite "careful attention to [its] legal obligations." Thus, the Union's argument provides no basis for finding the award contrary to law.</p>

<p class="noindent">Ordinarily, it is the arbitrator's task to determine whether the interest of justice standard is met. To avoid protracting a fee dispute already the subject of remands, FLRA has sized up the circumstances and the arbitrator's factual findings and determined whether the interest of justice standard was met. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alabama ACT and DOD, Alabama NG</span>, 56 FLRA 231, 234 (2000). If FLRA is to consider an agency's objection to a fee award based upon the concern that the interest of justice standard was not met, the agency will need to invoke more than "bare assertions" of its objections to merit FLRA's reasoned considered of the agency's objections. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot and AFGE Local 2142</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v58/58-017.html">58 FLRA 87</a>, 91 (2002).</p>
