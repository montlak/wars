<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-431"><span class="space">3.</span> Standing to Raise Challenge</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">An individual must have standing to launch an employment practice challenge. <span class="Italic">Lackhouse v. OPM</span>, 13 MSPR 667, 668 (1982), dismissed a petition for lack of standing. The appellant challenged the use of the Outstanding Scholar Program as discriminatory. The Board determined that the appellant would not have been selected, even without the use of that program. Because Mr. Lackhouse was not adversely affected by the program, he lacked standing to challenge the program. Also on standing, <span class="Italic">Rindfleish v. OPM</span>, 11 MSPR 498, 501 (1982), said of a challenge to a qualification requirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before reaching OPM's contentions concerning jurisdiction, we note that the presiding official found that the visual acuity standard "was applied" to the appellant, as required under 5 CFR 300.104(a) for the appellant to have standing to appeal, simply because the appellant was a candidate for an Air Traffic Controller Specialist position and the standard applied to all candidates. We find that, since the Board is prohibited from issuing advisory opinions by 5 USC 1205(g), the Board has appellate jurisdiction under a 5 CFR 300.104(a) only when a candidate for a position has been denied that position and he or she believes that the denial was based on an unlawful employment practice applied by OPM. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hatler v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 3 MSPB 406, 407, 3 MSPR 322, 324 (1980) (reduction in grade action which had been cancelled held not appealable because it no <span id="Page_837"></span>longer affected the employee, despite the agency's expressed intent to reinstitute the action against the employee). In this case, the appellant's attorney admitted at the hearing that the appellant submitted to no physical examination by the FAA, and no formal denial of her application was ever received. Nonetheless, a letter from the FAA's Federal Air Surgeon to a Congressman, which is contained in the record, offers the agency's regret that it "had to find the appellant not medically qualified for employment as an Air Traffic Controller Specialist" because of her insufficient visual acuity. We find this to be sufficient to establish that the appellant was indeed denied employment as an Air Traffic Control Specialist based on the visual standard in question.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In another employment practice challenge involving the Outstanding Scholar Program, the Board lacked jurisdiction because operation of the Program, although it was used to hire several individuals, did not result in the failure to hire the appellant, who was considered under a separate vacancy announcement for the same type of jobs filled under the Program but nonselected because the selecting official felt that the appellant's background was not a good fit for the job. The Board lacked jurisdiction over the employment practice challenge because the employment practice (use of the Outstanding Scholar Program) did not result in the harm complained of by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Dow v. GSA</span>, 590 F.3d 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2010). <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. DOD,</span> DA-300A-09-0661-I-1 (NP 10/26/2010), concluded that the appellant, who challenged a minimum education requirement, failed to properly invoke Board jurisdiction because the requirement was not applied to result in the appellant's nonselection:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge based her initial decision on a finding that the appellant failed to show that OPM was significantly involved in administering the challenged employment practice, i.e., the minimum educational standard. We agree with the appellant that this finding was in error. Specifically, the vacancy announcements themselves and the declaration from the agency's Human Resources specialist explicitly attribute the basic qualification standards to OPM. <span class="Italic">[S]</span> <span class="Italic">ee Mapstone</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 691, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (evidence that an OPM qualification standard formed the basis for the qualification standard used during the selection process at issue supported finding jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a)); <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 12 (2007) (same); <span class="Italic">see also Lackhouse v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 773 F.2d 313, 315 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (OPM was involved in administering the "rule of three" because OPM promulgated the governing regulation). We therefore find that OPM is involved in administering the employment practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we find that the appellant failed to show that the appeal concerns a matter within the Board's jurisdiction because he failed to show that the challenged employment practice was applied to him. An individual's right to appeal an employment practice arises under the following regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A candidate who believes that an employment practice <span class="Italic">which was applied to him or her</span> by the Office of Personnel Management violates a basic requirement in &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of its regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) (emphasis added). The administrative judge accurately recited this language in apprising the appellant of the jurisdictional standard. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has found that, in order for the Board to have jurisdiction over an employment practices appeal, it is "necessary that the challenged employment practice have been applied to the applicant as the basis for the adverse hiring decision." <span class="Italic">Dow v. General Services Administration</span>, 590 F.3d 1338, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the challenged employment practice is a minimum educational requirement. The purpose of a minimal educational requirement, like other minimum qualification standards, is to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">identify applicants who are likely to perform successfully on the job, and to screen out those who are unlikely to do so. The standards are not designed to rank candidates, identify the best qualified applicants for particular positions, or otherwise substitute for a careful analysis of the applicant's knowledge, skills, and abilities.</p>

Accordingly, agencies may not appoint applicants to positions for which they do not meet the minimum qualification standards. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 338.301 (regarding qualification requirements for competitive service appointment); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 334.103(b)(3) (regarding agency promotion programs).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The undisputed documentary evidence shows that the appellant's nonselection was not based on his failure to meet the minimum educational requirement. Only applicants who meet the minimum qualification standards will appear on a certificate of eligibles, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3313, 3317(a), 3318(a), and the record shows that the agency placed the appellant on several certificates of eligibles for the vacancy at issue. Because the agency found that the appellant satisfied the allegedly unlawful minimum educational requirement, its application of that requirement was not the basis for the appellant's nonselection. Thus, the undisputed evidence shows that the agency's reason for not selecting the appellant was not, nor could it have been, based on his failure to meet the minimum educational requirement. <span class="Italic">See Dow</span>, 590 F.3d at 1344 (affirming the Board's decision dismissing an employment practices appeal for lack of jurisdiction where the appellant failed to show that the challenged employment practice had anything to do with the agency's rejection of his application); <span class="Italic">see also Beets v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 9 (2005) (the Board may rely upon the undisputed evidence of record to resolve jurisdictional issues).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant failed to show that his appeal concerns an employment practice that was the basis for the agency's adverse hiring decision, we find that he has failed to establish jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Dow</span>. 590 F.3d at 1342-44. Accordingly the appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An individual seeking reemployment as an annuitant terminable at will lacked standing to challenge a practice of DOD concerning reemployed annuitants, or the Board lacked jurisdiction to consider that challenge, in <span class="Italic">McKnight v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCKNIGHT_SAMMY_R_AT_3443_05_0157_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_247811.pdf">103 MSPR 255</a>, 256-59 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-10, 2006 MSPB 247 (2006) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Vesser v. OPM</span>, 29 F.3d 600 (Fed. Cir. 1994), involving an annuitant who was willing to waive his annuity if he was selected as an ALJ from an OPM register):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant retired from the federal government. As an annuitant, the appellant seeks employment in the Department of Defense (DoD). According to his uncontested allegations, DoD has adopted a policy that it will reemploy an annuitant only under the following conditions: (a) The vacant position must be one that is hard to fill as evidenced by historically high turnover, a severe shortage of candidates or other significant recruiting difficulties, or be one that is critical to accomplishing the organization's mission or completing a specific project or initiative; (b) the applicant has unique or specialized skills, or unusual qualifications, not generally available; and (c) the incumbent must, for not more than 2087 hours, mentor less experienced employees and/or provide continuity during critical organizational transitions. The appellant claimed that this policy "grant[ed] a preference and advantage to all non-annuitants during the hiring process that is not authorized by any law, rule or regulation," and that it was "a discriminatory action affecting all annuitants." The appellant also claimed that the agency withdrew a tentative job offer to him as a result of a purported agency-wide freeze on the hiring of annuitants....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue before us is whether the Board has jurisdiction over a part 300, subpart A, employment practice claim filed by an annuitant challenging a policy governing the appointment of annuitants at DoD. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1) states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Notwithstanding other statutes, an annuitant, as defined by [5 U.S.C.] section 8331 [relating to the Civil Service Retirement System] or 8401 [relating to the Federal Employees' Retirement System], receiving annuity from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund is not barred by reason of his retired status from employment in an appointive position for which the annuitant is qualified. An annuitant so reemployed, other than an annuitant reappointed under paragraph (2) of this subsection [relating to retired administrative law judges], serves at the will of the appointing authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, an annuitant may be reemployed in the civil service, and an annuitant so reemployed, with exceptions not applicable here, is terminable at the will of the appointing authority. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(j) states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If an annuitant receiving an annuity from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund becomes employed in a position within the Department of Defense, his annuity shall continue. An annuitant so reemployed shall not be considered an employee for purposes of chapter 83 or 84.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, under section 9902(j), an annuitant reemployed by DoD is deemed not to be an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. chapter 83 (Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS)) or 84 (Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS)). We do not extrapolate from section 9902(j) that an annuitant reemployed by DoD is not an "employee" for any purpose under title 5 of the United States Code. Indeed, the specific language of section 9902(j) suggests that Congress intended exclusion from CSRS and FERS only. Further, a reemployed annuitant may be an employee for purposes of other parts of title 5. <span class="Italic">See Acting Special Counsel v. U.S. Customs Service</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 342, 347 (1986) (a reemployed annuitant is an "employee" protected against prohibited personnel practices set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, by law, the rights of reemployed annuitants are inferior to those of other civil servants. For example, a reemployed annuitant is: Not eligible for a voluntary separation incentive payment, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3521(2)(B)(i), <span id="Page_838"></span>3522; not eligible for separation pay, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5597(a)(3)(A); excluded from the procedures covering actions based on poor performance (which confer a right to a reasonable opportunity to improve), 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 432.102(f)(11), 432.104; and not eligible for "guaranteed placement" in a GS-15 or equivalent position if he fails to complete Senior Executive Service probation satisfactorily, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 359.901(a)(3), 359.902. These provisions show that a reemployed annuitant has a special status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the most significant characteristic of a reemployed annuitant is that he is terminable at will with no right of appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3323(b)(1), 7701(j). The Board has previously acknowledged that a reemployed annuitant serves at the will of the appointing authority. <span class="Italic">See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Hays v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 14 (1999), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 232 F.3d 905 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding whether the Board has jurisdiction over an employment practice claim filed by an annuitant challenging a policy governing the appointment of annuitants at DoD, we also must consider the following regulations relating to employment practices:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The purpose of this subpart is to establish principles to govern, as nearly as is administratively feasible and practical, the employment practices of the Federal Government generally, and of individual agencies, that affect the recruitment, measurement, ranking, and selection of individuals for initial appointment and competitive promotion in the competitive service.... For the purpose of this subpart, the term "employment practices" includes the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.102:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This subpart is directed to implementation of the policy that competitive employment practices:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a) Be practical in character and as far as possible relate to matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of candidates for the jobs to be filled;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b) Result in selection from among the best qualified candidates [and]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c) Be developed and used without discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, partisan political affiliation or other nonmerit grounds [.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a) <span class="Italic">Employment practices</span>. A candidate who believes that an employment practice which was applied to him or her by the Office of Personnel Management violates a basic requirement in &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of its regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sections 300.101, .102, and .104, when read together, evidence an intent on OPM's part to provide an appeal mechanism for identifying and correcting invalid qualification standards and examination methods used in making appointments in the competitive service. This purpose simply would not be served by allowing an annuitant, who would be an at-will employee if rehired, to challenge a policy directed solely to the conditions under which annuitants may be reemployed. Although the appellant seeks to be considered on equal footing with other applicants for employment in DoD, his special status as an annuitant means that he does not have the right to be considered on equal footing. Other applicants who are not annuitants will attain tenure if they complete probation, whereas the appellant, as an annuitant, is statutorily barred from attaining tenured status. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1). This difference in conditions of employment is so fundamental that the appellant should not be permitted to challenge the criteria that DoD uses to evaluate his application for employment as other, non-annuitant applicants may do.</p>
