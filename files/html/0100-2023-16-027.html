<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-28"><span class="space">a.</span> Involvement of Higher-Level Agency Component</h5>
<p class="noindent">The agency has a duty to negotiate with the exclusive representative of an appropriate unit of its employees concerning conditions of employment affecting them, except as provided by federal law and regulation or government-wide regulation. Unless there is exclusive recognition at a higher level of an agency, that higher level has no duty to bargain with the union before issuing directives to subordinate elements concerning employment conditions, e.g., a paid parking program. The higher-level element commits no ULP without a showing that it prevents subordinate elements from fulfilling their duty to bargain with the union at the level of recognition. <span class="Italic">Boston Dist. Recruiting Command and AFGE Local 1900</span>, 15 FLRA 720, 742 (1984) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior and NFFE Local 1309</span>, 52 FLRA 475, 482 (1996) (explaining decisions distinguishing situation of higher-level organization advising lower-level activity to take course of action (not ULP) from situation of directing latter to take action (ULP)). An agency has no obligation to notify and bargain with a union that represents some employees at a lower activity level before promulgating directives concerning an agency grievance procedure, as long as the agency does not preclude appropriate bargaining at the activity level. <span class="Italic">NASA and Goddard Eng'rs, Scientists and Technicians Ass'n</span>, 18 FLRA 282, 296-97 (1985) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency has no duty to bargain with a union above the level of recognition concerning internal directives to subordinate elements that may concern working conditions, e.g., paid parking programs. The higher-level organization does not violate the Statute, as long as it does not prevent subordinate organizations from fulfilling their obligations to bargain within the limits of their discretion. If subordinate organizations decline to bargain over aspects of working conditions, defending on the basis of higher-level directives or regulations, it is the responsibility of the activity at the level of recognition to establish a compelling need, either through negotiability or ULP procedures, as a defense to the refusal to bargain. <span class="Italic">Harry Diamond Labs., Dept. of Army and AFGE Local 2, OPM</span>, 15 FLRA 216, 231-34 (1984) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">If a union holds exclusive recognition in a component of an agency, that component is obligated to bargain over conditions of employment, even though control over a particular condition of employment rests with a different organizational component in the same overall agency. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 27 FLRA 492, 497 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 22 FLRA 351, 361 (1986)). The employer is not free unilaterally to change working conditions at the local level if negotiations are being conducted concerning those conditions at the national level; even a policy change at a level of organization above the unit of recognition does not permit an unbargained local change. Conditions of employment must be maintained pending completion of the bargaining obligations, assuming the union requests bargaining or impasse assistance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Cent. Comm. and DHHS, SSA</span>, 40 FLRA 584, 590-91 (1991). The issue is whether the higher-level organization preempts bargaining authority at the level of recognition. A higher-level organizational entity did not commit a ULP when it issued a memo concerning the method of paycheck delivery that did not unconditionally direct its subordinate levels to make the change, but rather gave them discretion to change the policy to the maximum extent possible within constraints of the current labor agreement. <span class="Italic">DOD, Dept. of Navy and NAGE Local R4-97</span>, 20 FLRA 121, 123 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">The distinction between advice and direction from a higher-level component of an agency was illustrated in <span class="Italic">Nevada Air Nat'l Guard and ACT, Silver Barons Chap.</span>, 54 FLRA 316, 322-23 (1998), <span class="Italic">reaff'd on reconsideration</span>, 54 FLRA 595 (1998), concluding that the parent organization committed no ULP by supplying legal advice ultimately relied on by the respondent organization:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When higher level management directs management at a subordinate level in the same chain of command to act in a manner that is inconsistent with the subordinate level's bargaining obligations under the Statute, the higher level entity violates section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statue. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. and U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia</span>, 52 FLRA 475, 481 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Survey</span>). Conversely, if the party at the level of exclusive recognition is prevented from bargaining based on direction from higher level management, no violation is found against the party that is merely complying with the higher-level direction and whose actions are ministerial in nature. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record in this case clearly establishes that Respondents Nevada Guards refused to execute a collective bargaining agreement containing the Panel-imposed official time provision. However, there is nothing in the record that establishes that Respondents Nevada Guards' refusal occurred as a result of the Headquarters' direction. In particular, there is nothing in the two communications (telefaxes) from Respondent Headquarters to Respondents Nevada Guards that establishes that the Headquarters directed the Nevada Guards to refuse to comply with the Panel's order concerning the official time provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first communication was a copy of an internal legal opinion from the Office of the Judge Advocate.&#x2003;The fact that the Headquarters provided the Nevada Guards with a legal opinion does not establish that the Headquarters directed the Nevada Guards to act in any particular manner. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Survey</span>, 52 FLRA at 482 ("the fact that Interior provided advice to Survey does not establish that Interior directed Survey to act in a particular manner or to refrain from taking any action in fulfillment of its bargaining obligation.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second communication was a copy of a draft labor relations alert.&#x2003;Stipulation, Exhibit 14 ("reminding the states that it is illegal...to use federal funds to influence members of Congress"). The fact that the alert was clearly marked "draft" and contained words such as "recommend" and "remind" is inconsistent with viewing the alert as a direction to refuse to comply with the Panel's order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Survey</span>, 52 FLRA at 482 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service and Centers for Disease Control, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Appalachian Laboratory for Occupational Safety and Health</span>, 39 FLRA 1306, 1314 (1991) (more than a mere reference to the existence of a policy by an agency is necessary to establish that the agency has unlawfully interfered with the collective bargaining relationship).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the stipulated record in this case, we conclude that the Respondent Headquarters did not interfere with the local bargaining relationship and, therefore, did not violate section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Survey</span>, 52 FLRA at 482. Accordingly, we dismiss the portion of the complaint with respect to the Respondent Headquarters.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1253"></span>Conversely, when management at a higher level in an agency directs or requires management at a subordinate level to act in a manner that is inconsistent with the subordinate level's bargaining obligations under the Statute, the higher-level entity violates &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5). <span class="Italic">Hq., Dept. of Air Force 375th Combat Div., Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 44 FLRA 117, 126 (1992) (headquarters component of agency violated Statute when it delayed notifying its subordinate agency to issue notices of proposed furloughs, causing delays in notice to unions of proposed action). Acts and conduct of higher-level agency management may constitute a ULP if the conduct prevents agency management at the level of exclusive recognition from fulfilling its bargaining obligation. <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Fed'n of Teachers</span>, 11 FLRA 597, 598 n.3 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">USDA, Farmers Home Admin., Little Rock and NFFE Local 108</span>, 24 FLRA 682 (1986) (involving higher-level directive repudiating contract provisions governing payment of travel and per diem expenses for employees representing labor organization). Entities of the same agency, but not in the same chain of command as the activity with exclusive recognition, violate &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) by taking action conflicting with the bargaining relationship between the parties at the level of exclusive recognition. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Soldier Support Ctr., Ft. Benjamin Harrison and AFGE Local 1411</span>, 41 FLRA 926, 941 (1991) (ALJ Decision) (relying upon <span class="Italic">Hq., DLA and AFGE Local 2449</span>, 22 FLRA 875 (1986)). The responsibility for the ULP assumes an underlying statutory violation. If management unilaterally has the right to take action or to refuse to take action without bargaining, there is no ULP at any level if the directive concerning bargaining issues from a higher level than the unit of recognition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nat'l Guard Bureau and Adjutant Gen., Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania State Council, ACT</span>, 35 FLRA 48, 53-54 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">If interference with the right to bargain descends from higher agency levels, then a ULP finding is appropriate as to the higher level of the agency, assuming that it is named in the complaint and that it is separately charged with a ULP. A ULP finding is not appropriate as to the installation that operates under direction from the higher organization. <span class="Italic">Army Eng'r Ctr. and AFGE Local 1052</span>, 13 FLRA 707, 714 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Reg'l Office and AFGE Local 1978</span>, 33 FLRA 671, 674 (1988) (higher-level organization directs discontinuation of negotiated pay premium; lower-level organization acts in good faith by agreeing to bargain over impact of change; relying on <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Water and Power Resources Project, Grand Coulee and Columbia Basin Trades Council</span>, 9 FLRA 385 (1982)). If a higher level of the agency directs implementation of decisions made at that level, leaving no local discretion, it does not effectuate the Statute to find a separate violation based on actions of local officials who did not themselves initiate any change in conditions of employment but only acted ministerially in implementing the directives of higher-level agency management. The higher-level management commits the ULP if it fails to bargain over its actions and precludes local management from bargaining by directing its action. <span class="Italic">DHHS and NTEU</span>, 16 FLRA 288, 292 (1984). But an activity is not relieved from its bargaining responsibilities because it was acting under the command of higher management, unless the activity is performing solely ministerial functions. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Region VIII and NTEU</span>, 9 FLRA 606, 616 (1982) (ALJ Decision). Under <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span>, implementation by local activities of a general policy to curtail overtime is not a ministerial function. It was not an objection to the negotiation of a proposal requiring the establishment of a shuttle bus service that the only official with authority to approve the arrangement was at a level higher in the organization than the level of negotiation. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3525 and DOJ, Bd. of Immigration Appeals</span>, 10 FLRA 61, 64 (1982).This line of decisions applies to negotiability determinations that lead to ULP charges and complaints. If the activity refuses to negotiate at the direction of a higher-level agency, the agency, not the activity, is responsible for commission of the ULP. <span class="Italic">USDA, Agric. Mktg. Serv. and AFGE Nat'l Meat Graders Council</span>, 29 FLRA 940, 942 (1987). The same result applies to situations involving unilateral changes in working conditions. A violation of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) was committed when instructions on entering mileage on travel vouchers were changed by higher authority without notice to the union. The agency committed the ULP at the level that issued the direction. The local office that performed only the ministerial act of implementing the directive did not commit a ULP. The employer was directed to withdraw the change and negotiate. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Region VI and NFFE Local 1823</span>, 10 FLRA 26, 28-29 (1982) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy and Washington Area Metal Trades Council</span>, 28 FLRA 1022 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the general rule is that a subordinate level activity does not commit a ULP when it "merely carries out higher level instructions and acts ministerially and without discretion in the matter," <span class="Italic">Hq., Dept. of Air Force 375th Combat Div., Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 44 FLRA 117, 125-27 (1992), earlier decisions stated that conduct of agency management at a level lower than the level of exclusive recognition may form the basis of a ULP if lower-level agency management acts as the agent of management at the level of exclusive recognition. <span class="Italic">Marshals Serv. and AFGE Int'l Council of Marshals Serv. Locals</span>, 12 FLRA 650, 653 (1983) (changes in parking space allocations). The more recent analysis is provided in <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>, where the bargaining relationship was at the level of the Base but Air Force Headquarters directed the implementation of a furlough. The ULP occurred when the headquarters component precluded the local facility from conducting impact bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Respondent HQ USAF</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">When management at a higher level in an agency directs or requires management at a subordinate level to act in a manner that is inconsistent with the subordinate level's bargaining obligations under the Statute, the higher level entity violates section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Commander Naval Air Pacific, San Diego, California and Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Oak Harbor, Washington</span>, 41 FLRA 662, 676 (1991); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service and Centers for Disease Control, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Appalachian Laboratory for Occupational Safety and Health</span>, 39 FLRA 1306, 1316 (1991) (<span class="Italic">PHS, CDC</span>). <span class="Italic">See generally Headquarters, Defense Logistics Agency, Washington, D.C</span>., 22 FLRA 875 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that, as early as August 20, 1990, Respondent HQ USAF was aware of possible furloughs of unit employees beginning on October 15, 1990. At that time, Respondent HQ USAF was also aware that notices of proposed furlough had to be issued to employees by September 18, 1990 to meet the minimum 30 days' advance notice required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. The record reflects that Respondent HQ USAF was "hoping" that it would not be necessary to issue notices of proposed furlough to employees. However, the record also reflects that Respondent HQ USAF "elected not to send out notices of furlough early on because [it] felt that [it] could take the money from other areas[&#8197;]" to cover the civilian payroll for a period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the timing of Respondent HQ USAF's directive precluded Respondent Scott AFB from fulfilling its statutory duty to give the Union adequate advance notice of an impending change and a reasonable opportunity to bargain before implementation of the change. Although Respondent HQ USAF was aware in August of possible furloughs, it "elected" to wait until Friday, September 14, to direct its subordinate activities to issue notices of proposed furlough by Tuesday, September 18. Moreover, Respondent HQ USAF makes no assertion that it could not have provided notice earlier. By its actions, Respondent HQ USAF directed its subordinate activity to act at a time which prevented the subordinate activity from complying with its obligations under the Statute and, thereby, unlawfully interfered in the bargaining relationship between Respondent Scott AFB and the Union. <span class="Italic">See PHS, CDC</span>, 39 FLRA at 1316. We conclude, in these circumstances, that Respondent HQ USAF violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Respondent Scott AFB</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a subordinate level activity merely carries out higher level instructions and acts ministerially and without discretion in the matter, the Authority will not find that the subordinate level activity violated the Statute by its actions. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah and Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 39 FLRA 1381, 1392 (1991); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. and U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Western Regional Office, San Francisco, California</span>, 37 FLRA 804, 805 (1990), <span class="Italic">application for enforcement filed sub nom. FLRA v. U.S. Department of the Interior</span>, Washington, D.C., Nos. 90-70517, 90-70542 (9th Cir. Oct. 3, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that on Friday, September 14, 1990, Respondent Scott AFB was directed by Respondent HQ USAF to issue notices of proposed furlough by Tuesday, September 18, 1990. There is no argument, or basis on which to conclude, that Respondent Scott AFB could or should have provided the Union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over the furlough notices prior to receiving direction from Respondent HQ USAF on September 14. In these circumstances, we conclude that Respondent HQ USAF's directive deprived Respondent Scott AFB of its discretion to provide the Union with adequate notice of, and an opportunity to bargain over, the issuance of the proposed furlough notices and that it would not effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute to find that Respondent Scott AFB violated the Statute when it implemented the directive. Accordingly, we will dismiss the complaint against Respondent Scott AFB.</p>
<p class="noindent">If a higher-level organization directs the activity to take action in violation of the Statute, a ULP will ordinarily be assessed against the higher-level organization and not against the activity that implements the directed action. But if the higher-level organization is not named in the ULP complaint, for purposes of effectuating a remedy the lower-level activity will be held to have committed a ULP. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 52</span>, 23 FLRA 774, 779 (1986). But where "agency management at a higher level is not a named respondent, agency management at a subordinate level will be held to have violated the Statute, even where subordinate level management was merely following orders." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, Office of Ass't Sec'y for Admin. and Mgmt., San Francisco and AFGE Local 2391</span>, 33 FLRA 429, 432 (1988). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 0922</span>, 57 FLRA 787, 790 (2002) (parent agency was not named in complaint and the subordinate activity was named in the complaint but took no part in the actions of the departmental OIG).</p>
<p class="noindent">If a higher-level component of an agency has control over a working condition and the level of recognition lies at a lower point in the organization, the <span id="Page_1254"></span>higher-level agency will not commit a ULP if its directive to change working conditions is not delayed pending bargaining if no request is made to it for a delay. The agency does not commit a ULP if no one asks it to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo,</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp. and PASS</span>, 40 FLRA 690, 705-07 (1991) (ALJ Decision):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has addressed the question of responsibility for violations of the Statute where different levels within an agency are involved.&#x2003;It is well established that the obligation to bargain with a union holding exclusive representation for employees in a bargaining unit concerning conditions of employment affecting those employees rests at the level of the agency at which exclusive recognition exists....&#8197;However, when management at a higher level of an agency directs or requires management at a subordinate level at which exclusive recognition exists to act in a manner that is inconsistent with the subordinate level's bargaining obligations under the Statute, the higher-level management entity violates section 7116 (a) (1) and (5) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, recognition rested at the level of FAA, not DOT. Thus, DOT itself had no duty to bargain with PASS concerning the issuance of internal directives to its subordinate levels regarding the drug-free workplace program....&#8197;Rather, the primary responsibility for fulfilling the duty to bargain with PASS prior to implementation of any changes in conditions of employment rested with FAA. In order to find that DOT committed a violation of the Statute, it would be necessary to establish that DOT prevented FAA from fulfilling its duty to bargain with PASS. In the absence of such a showing, DOT cannot be held to have violated the Statute as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no showing here that DOT ordered FAA to implement the drug-free workplace program while negotiations with PASS were still pending. While the record establishes that DOT controlled the date on which the random drug testing component of the program was to become operational, it does not establish that FAA specifically requested of DOT that the scheduled September 8 implementation date be postponed within the PASS bargaining units. That is, while the record establishes that some conversations occurred between FAA and DOT representatives concerning a postponement, the record does not establish that FAA specifically requested such a delay and that DOT refused....&#8197;Nor does the record establish that DOT had foreclosed such a request from FAA. Consequently, while we are unable to find that DOT was actually prepared to postpone the implementation of the random testing component of the program at the request of FAA, we are also unable to conclude, based on the record, that a request was actually made by FAA and denied by DOT or that, under the circumstances, a request by FAA would have been futile.</p>
