<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-141"><span class="space">d.</span> Unauthorized Act of Representative</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Although there are decisions, discussed below, that permit reinstatement of appeals that are improperly withdrawn by representatives, there are Board decisions refusing to permit appeals to be reinstated when the appellant asserts that her counsel should not have withdrawn, or was not authorized to withdraw, the appeal. Concerning withdrawal of an appeal by counsel, the Federal Circuit advises that "[a] person appearing before the Board is bound by the actions of his or her selected representative, regardless of the representative's expertise." <span class="Italic">Jackson v. MSPB</span>, 64 Fed. Appx. 764, 766 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Mistelske v. MSPB</span>, 314 Fed. Appx. 272, 275 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) (union representative's withdrawal of the appeal bound the appellant; the appellant's assertion that he did not consent to the withdrawal did not serve to waive the time for reopening the appeal or filing a PFR).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Withdrawal of the appeal by the representative is an "act of finality" that cannot be undone later without evidence or argument showing why the withdrawal was invalid. <span class="Italic">Beasley v. DLA</span>, 38 MSPR 25, 27-28 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. MSPB</span>, 620 Fed. Appx. 958, 959 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP) ("Ms. Jackson signed a document designating her attorney as her representative and authorizing her attorney to act on her behalf. A person appearing before the Board is bound by the actions of her selected representative. <span class="Italic">Duncan v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 795 F.2d 1000, 1002-03 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Ms. Jackson's attorney submitted a withdrawal that was 'clear, unequivocal, and decisive.' <span class="Italic">Page</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. at &#x00B6; 5. The withdrawal was an 'act of finality' that removed the appeal from the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Spencer v. R.R. Ret. Bd.</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 80, 82 (2002). We find no unusual circumstances such as misinformation or new and material evidence that would have justified reinstating Ms. Jackson's appeal. <span class="Italic">See White v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 113, 114 (2002)."); <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. USPS</span>, DA-0353-12-0115-I-1 (NP 3/5/2013) ("Further, withdrawal of the appeal by the appellant's designated representative has the same effect as a withdrawal by the appellant herself. <span class="Italic">Bilbrew</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 34, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Bass v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 683, &#x00B6; 6 (2004). The appellant does not allege that her representative acted against the appellant's express wishes or without her knowledge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bass</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 683, &#x00B6; 6. The appellant also does not allege that her representative thwarted the appellant's diligent efforts through either negligence or malfeasance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 297, &#x00B6; 6. The Board has consistently held that an appellant is responsible for the actions of her chosen representative. <span class="Italic">Bilbrew</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 34, &#x00B6; 14."); <span class="Italic">Schultze v. Dept. of Army</span>, 57 MSPR 250, 255 (1993) (as to the withdrawal of her appeal: "[T]he appellant's allegations of wrongdoing by her former counsel do not provide a basis on which to reinstate this appeal because she is responsible for the actions of her chosen representative."); <span class="Italic">Roberts v. VA</span>, 52 MSPR 168, 172 (1991) (Board declined to set aside the withdrawal of an appeal that was entered by the appellant's representative on the date of the hearing and confirmed by the appellant during questioning by the AJ to ensure the appellant was not coerced into withdrawing the appeal). If an individual withdraws an appeal on the basis of poor advice from his representative, the Board will not reinstate the case; the party is bound by the acts of his chosen representative. <span class="Italic">Nathaniel v.

<p class="Body-Text">Distinguished are cases that are dismissed as withdrawn when neither the appellant nor his authorized representative acted to withdraw the appeal in a manner recognized by the Board. If the appellant does not withdraw the appeal or if the appeal is not withdrawn by his designated representative, but someone else withdraws the appeal without a designation, the appeal is not effectively withdrawn. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cole v. DOD</span>, SF-0752-13-1125-I-1 (NP 9/25/2015) ("There is no evidence that the appellant designated the union representative to represent him in this appeal. To the contrary, he filed his appeal on his own behalf, indicating that he did not wish to designate a representative. Other than the withdrawal request, the only other pleading filed for the appellant before the initial decision was issued was filed by the appellant himself, updating his business and personal contact information. The withdrawal request was not sufficient to designate the union representative as the appellant's representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brothers v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 377, 380 (1984) (rejecting the appellant's assertion that a motion for continuance filed by his new representative served as the equivalent of the required written notification of a change in representation 'since there is no assurance that the purported representative is authorized to act on appellant's behalf without such written notice')."); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 483, 485 (1990) (local union president who withdrew appellant's appeal was not shown to have had any authorization to act on the appellant's behalf; no evidence that appellant or his designated representative (a union business agent) took any affirmative action to withdraw the appeal). However, the Board will attempt to determine from the appellant's conduct, including silence, after being notified of what appears to be a withdrawal of the appeal by her representative, whether withdrawal occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bender v. Dept. of Army</span>, 49 MSPR 542, 544 (1991). [Refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-189.html#sec16-185">Agreement to Withdraw EEOC Case or Other Litigation</a>," for the operation and effect of settlement agreements that withdraw appeals.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board binds a party to his representative's actions, including withdrawal of an appeal, a reviewing court may step in and reverse that result if it seems particularly inequitable. <span class="Italic">Kipen v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1991 NP No. 91-3077), reviewed and reversed the Board's dismissal of an appeal upon receipt of a notice of withdrawal of the appeal by Kipen's lawyer. On PFR, Kipen asserted that the lawyer acted without authorization by filing the withdrawal and that the appellant did not intend to withdraw the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, a party is bound by the consequences of his representative's conduct, which includes both his acts and omissions....&#8197;Once an MSPB appeal has been withdrawn, the Board's policy is not to reinstate it in the absence of unusual circumstances such as misinformation or new and material evidence....&#8197;In particular, the Board has refused to reinstate appeals where the appellant has failed to submit any evidence or argument in support of invalidating the prior withdrawal on any basis....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having reviewed Kipen's petition for review, we conclude that Kipen submitted therein persuasive argument for invalidation of the withdrawal of his appeal, albeit not accompanied by supporting documentary evidence. However, the facts of record are themselves evidence which supports Kipen's position. These facts suggest that the withdrawal of Kipen's appeal was the unilateral act of an over-extended attorney, not the authorized, informed decision of his client. For example, the Notice of Withdrawal of Appeal is not signed by Kipen. The Notice was filed on the morning of the day on which the AJ had scheduled the next conference call in the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ had previously denied attorney Johnson's request for a continuance, filed the day before the May 17, 1990 deadline for prehearing submissions. Moreover, the AJ stated in her report of a May 24, 1990 conference call with Johnson and the agency's representative that the parties had made no progress toward settlement, and that Kipen was "willing to consider nothing short of full relief." The AJ further stated that during the conference call Johnson "failed to adequately explain why he has been unable to submit the prehearing submissions which he has known were due since the end of March," and that Johnson was also without adequate justification for having failed to submit a witness list by the designated deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent argues that because it is undisputed that Kipen was represented by an attorney, he is bound by his attorney's action of withdrawing the appeal in his name. We cannot agree that that broad generality applies in every case, and certainly not in the present one. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Morales v. MSPB</span>, 823 F.2d 536 (Fed. Cir. 1987). We hold that the facts of record, which support Kipen's argument, constitute sufficient evidence to rebut any presumption that Johnson had the express authority required to withdraw his client's appeal. We therefore vacate the Board's order of October 10, 1990, and remand the case to the Board for reinstatement of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1086"></span><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP No. 03-3022) ("When faced with an action from Jackson's counsel withdrawing the appeal, the Board cannot assume that the actions of counsel 'fail to reflect the [party's] own desires.' <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 721 F.2d at 365.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board generally views with disfavor arguments that a representative withdrew an appeal without the appellant's authority or consent. <span class="Italic">Muse v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 164 (1999), declined to credit the appellant's uncontested sworn statement that his appeal was withdrawn by a prior representative without his consent:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has consistently held that an appellant is responsible for the actions of his chosen representative. <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service,</span> 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has provided no new and material evidence to warrant reinstatement of his original appeal. Although the appellant has submitted sworn statements that the appeal was withdrawn without his knowledge or consent, and that he did not receive a copy of the initial decision in that appeal, we find these statements unpersuasive. The appellant was expressly informed by his agency's removal letter that if he appealed to the Board he would thereby waive access to the grievance-arbitration procedures. This very specific notice charged him with making inquiry whether his Board appeal must be withdrawn to avoid jeopardizing his arbitration rights. Moreover, even if we presume that the appellant did not receive a copy of the initial decision, we find that he lacked due diligence by waiting until he received the arbitration decision before inquiring into the status of his appeal. It is well settled that an appellant has a personal duty to monitor the progress of his appeal<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Edmundson v. Department of Justice,</span> 73 MSPR 267, <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed,</span> 113 F.3d 1255 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table).</p>

USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 660, 664-66 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14 (1999), required an AJ to consider whether an appellant authorized his counsel to withdraw his appeal. The Board suggested that an attorney's negligence in failing to secure his client's consent to withdrawal sufficed to permit reinstatement of the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although an appellant is bound by the errors of his chosen representative, <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service,</span> 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981), the Board has held that, where an appellant's diligent efforts to prosecute his appeal were thwarted by his representative's negligence or malfeasance, the appellant and his representative were not acting as one, and the representative's negligence or malfeasance should not be attributed to the appellant, <span class="Italic">Boyce v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 79 MSPR 402 &#x00B6; 7 (1998); <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Department of the Navy,</span> 43 MSPR 640, 643-45 (1990). Moreover, an attorney does not have the right, by virtue of his general retainer only, to compromise his client's claim. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 69 MSPR 469, 472 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant averred, "under [c]riminal [p]enalty [sic]," that he never gave his former attorney "permission to settle any appeal(s)." Moreover, the appellant asserts in his affidavit that, when his former attorney asked him a week or ten days prior to the scheduled January 20, 1998 hearing to withdraw his removal appeal, he informed his former attorney "that [he] wanted to continue and take [his] chances with the MSPB." The appellant asserts further that, when his former attorney informed him by telephone on January 16, 1998, that he would notify the regional office that he was withdrawing as the appellant's representative, the appellant thought that the hearing would be postponed since his representative was withdrawing only a few days before the hearing. The appellant states that he did not know that his former attorney intended to withdraw not only his representation but also the appellant's removal appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the record suggests no good reason for the appellant to have withdrawn his removal appeal, and further suggests that the appellant's former attorney might have been negligent or worse in withdrawing the appellant's removal appeal on the eve of an adjudication on the merits by the Board in light of his averred desire for an adjudication on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Edney</span>, 79 MSPR 60. The record further shows that, while the former attorney faxed the notice of withdrawal of the appellant's removal appeal to the AJ and the agency, he posted by regular mail the appellant's copy of the withdrawal. If, as the appellant alleges, his former attorney did not inform him in the January 16, 1998 telephone conversation that he was informing the regional office of the appellant's purported request to withdraw his removal appeal, then the appellant would have first become aware of the withdrawal of his appeal upon receipt of either his former attorney's withdrawal letter to the AJ or the AJ's January 20, 1998 initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the record and the appellant's assertions, which are more than merely conclusory, raise a genuine question of fact as to whether the appellant made a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act to relinquish his right to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 71 MSPR 381, 383 (1996). Under the circumstances of this case, we find that this appeal must be remanded for a determination of whether the appellant's withdrawal of his removal appeal was voluntary. <span class="Italic">Cf. Roberts,</span> 81 MSPR at 521-22 &#x00B6; 7 (the Board remanded for further development of the record to determine whether the appellant's withdrawal of her appeal was based on the misinformation of a third party and thus involuntary); <span class="Italic">Mueller v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Where the appellant has raised a genuine question of fact as to whether she made a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act to relinquish her right to appeal to the Board, in the interest of justice, the Board has vacated the ID dismissing the appeal as withdrawn, and remanded the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Beeler</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 173, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (the appellant presented a statement under penalty of perjury averring that his attorney withdrew his appeal without his consent and that he pled with his attorney to amend the motion to state that he would proceed <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and the record evidence showed that his attorney notified the Board that he was withdrawing as counsel and that the appellant would be proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, which was at odds with the motion to withdraw the appeal in its entirety); <span class="Italic">Caracciolo</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (the appellant submitted an affidavit that her attorney had no authority to withdraw her appeal, the record contained two letters from the appellant's attorney stating without explanation that the appellant was withdrawing her appeal, and there was no indication that the letters were ever sent to the appellant). In <span class="Italic">Caracciolo</span>, the Board found that "the record suggests no good reason for the appellant to have withdrawn her appeal, and, in light of her averred desire for an adjudication on the merits, further suggests that the appellant's former attorney might have been negligent in withdrawing the appellant's appeal on the eve of an adjudication by the Board." <span class="Italic">Caracciolo</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has timely filed her PFR, and asserts under penalty of perjury that "my represenative [sic] withdrew my claim without authorization several days before my court date. I was not given and [sic] equal and fair opportunity to present my side of the story. I have relevant information that could drastically change my case." However, she does not submit any documents on review. The record evidence shows that the appellant did not sign the April 20, 2009 Motion for Withdrawal, and was not on the certificate of service. Based on the foregoing evidence and argument, we find that the appellant has exercised due diligence in seeking reopening, and has raised a genuine question of fact as to whether she acted in a clear, unequivocal and decisive way to relinquish her Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Beeler</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 173, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Caracciolo</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 8. Under these circumstances, it is appropriate to reopen this appeal in the interest of justice, and remand for a determination of whether the appellant's withdrawal of her appeal was voluntary.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Edney v. OPM</span>, 79 MSPR 60, 61-63 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-7 (1998), reinstated an appeal after withdrawal when the appellant demonstrated that withdrawal was the product of an attorney's negligence. Weighing into the decision was the nature of the case--a retirement appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, the Board will not reinstate a withdrawn appeal absent unusual circumstances such as misinformation or new and material evidence. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 MSPR 474, 477 (1996); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Navy,</span> 71 MSPR 451, 454 (1996). Here, the appellant has not shown that the additional evidence she submitted on review was unavailable before the record closed below despite her due diligence....&#8197;Nevertheless, under the unusual circumstances of this appeal, as discussed below, we exercise our broad discretion to reopen and reinstate the appeal, in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Carey v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 50 MSPR 359, 361 (1991) (the Board may reopen an appeal on its own motion, in the interest of justice).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has been diligent throughout in her efforts to obtain a review by the Board of OPM's reconsideration decision. She timely filed the appeal, submitting substantial medical evidence, and has timely filed the petition for review, again submitting substantial additional medical evidence. Our review of the record reveals no good reason for the appellant to have withdrawn her appeal, and suggests that the appellant's attorney below might have been grossly negligent or worse in having her withdraw her appeal on the eve of an adjudication on the merits, particularly in light of her apparent desire for an adjudication on the merits by the Board. Although an appellant is responsible for the errors of her chosen representative, the Board has recognized that there are situations when applying this principle would be inequitable. <span class="Italic">Cf. Crawford v. Department of State</span>, 60 MSPR 441, 445-46 (1994) (where the appellant's diligent efforts to prosecute her appeal were thwarted by <span id="Page_1087"></span>her attorney's negligence or malfeasance, the appellant and her attorney were not acting as one, and the attorney's negligence or malfeasance should not be attributed to the appellant); <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Department of the Navy,</span> 43 MSPR 640, 643-44 (1990) (similar holding).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A further reason to exercise discretion in this case is the fact that we are reviewing a retirement case which is substantively different from the nature of an adverse action appeal. This case, as other retirement matters, does not involve an adverse action or other workplace conflict. Instead, it involves a determination of whether an employee is entitled to the statutory benefits established by Congress. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337. In a discipline or removal case, it can be said that an expedient response to an appeal enables the agency to move forward with the management of its programs and its workforce. However, in an appeal related to a retirement decision made by OPM, there is no such agency need for finality to compete with the right of an appellant to a decision on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The whole purpose of the retirement application and appeal process is to determine whether the applicant is entitled to a retirement benefit. If she is, then OPM is obligated to provide the benefit; if she is not, then OPM is obligated to deny the benefit. Unlike the competing interests of agency management and employee rights involved in a disciplinary appeal, there is only one primary interest involved in a retirement appeal, that of the applicant's entitlement under law to a benefit. Therefore, any doubt as to whether the Board should reopen the appeal for an adjudication of its merits should be resolved in favor of the appellant, even more so than in a disciplinary appeal. Indeed, as to disability retirement benefits, OPM has the right to reevaluate a claim even after it has been granted and to discontinue the benefits, as appropriate. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1208 (termination of disability annuity based on the annuitant's recovery from previously disabling condition); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1209 (termination of disability annuity based on restoration to earning capacity); <span class="Italic">Deutsch v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from her GS-6 Police Officer position. On appeal to the Board, the appellant asserted, among other things, that there was "no just cause" for the action, the penalty was too harsh, and the agency committed harmful procedural error. The appellant requested a hearing. The agency moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, claiming that the appellant had filed a grievance regarding her removal before appealing to the Board, and therefore made a binding election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1) to proceed only under the grievance procedure. Thereafter, in a "Notice of Voluntary Dismissal," the appellant's attorney wrote that the appellant "voluntarily dismisses/withdraws her request for a hearing in this matter." The attorney requested that the administrative judge "cancel the pre-hearing conference scheduled for December 10, 2008, as well as the hearing currently scheduled for December 29, 2008." In a subsequently-filed "Amended Notice of Voluntary Dismissal," the appellant's attorney asserted that the appellant "voluntarily dismisses/withdraws her appeal and request for a hearing in this matter."</p>

The attorney contends that the dismissal of the appeal was involuntary and requests that the initial decision be vacated and the case remanded for further action. The petition for review includes an affidavit from the appellant indicating that there was "a miscommunication between my counsel and me as it relates to our response to the Agency's motion, given that my counsel dismissed my appeal when I believed we would await a ruling on the motion to dismiss." The appellant avers that she was not aware that her appeal had been dismissed until she received a copy of the initial decision, and that she "immediately instructed my counsel to take whatever steps were necessary to have my appeal reinstated, so that a ruling on the Agency's motion to dismiss can be made...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that it is generally appropriate to treat a request for reconsideration of an appellant-initiated dismissal of an appeal as a late-filed appeal or a request to reopen and reinstate a prior appeal. <span class="Italic">Caracciolo v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 592, 595 (1989); <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 271, 273 (1986). Under these circumstances, we find that there was a miscommunication between the appellant and her attorney such that the appellant's diligent efforts to prosecute her appeal were thwarted by what appears to be her attorney's negligence. Furthermore, it is clear that the appellant and her attorney were not acting as one. We therefore find that the appellant has established that her appeal should be reinstated. <span class="Italic">See Connolly v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 422, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2005) (reinstating a withdrawn appeal where the appellant's attorney mistakenly withdrew the wrong appeal).</p>

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 110 MSPR 173, 2008 MSPB 233 (2008) (remanding for determination of the voluntariness of the appellant's withdrawal of his appeal in light of representations by the appellant on PFR concerning the apparent lack of authority, or confusion, on the part of his prior counsel as to the circumstances of the withdrawal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without an assertion that counsel lacked the authority or an allegation that the conduct of counsel went beyond an error in judgment, it is unlikely that the Board will reinstate an appeal withdrawn by counsel to pursue the case in another forum, <span class="Italic">Luellen v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 11, 16 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he reason that [appellant] withdrew his appeal was to pursue a remedy under the Rehabilitation Act in U.S. District Court. Pursuit of a remedy in another forum does not constitute good cause for the untimely filing of a Board appeal<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Zuhlke v. U.S.</span>, Postal Service, 74 MSPR 401, 404 (1991). Additionally, the appellant's submissions suggest that the withdrawal of his appeal was possibly error on the part of his representative in pursuing a court complaint based on a personnel action, his reassignment in 1992, that was wholly distinct from the personnel action, removal in 1997, underlying the appellant's Board appeal. There is no evidence that the appellant made independent efforts to prosecute his Board appeal that were thwarted by his attorney. <span class="Italic">Cf. Crawford v. Department of State</span>, 60 MSPR 441, 445-46 (1994) (where an appellant's diligent efforts to prosecute his appeal independent of the actions of his attorney were thwarted by his attorney's negligence or malfeasance, the appellant and his attorney are not acting as one, and the attorney's negligence or malfeasance should not be attributed to the appellant). Thus, to the extent that the appellant's attorney erroneously decided to withdraw his appeal to pursue on the appellant's behalf a court action under the Rehabilitation Act on a different personnel action, the appellant is responsible for such an error by his chosen representative<span class="Italic">. Njaka v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 MSPR 264 &#x00B6; 11 (2000): <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's request to reopen his original appeal also must fail. Generally, an appellant's withdrawal is an act of finality that has the effect of removing the appeal from the Board's jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 MSPR 474, 477 (1996). In the absence of unusual circumstances such as misinformation or new and material evidence, the Board will not reopen or reinstate an appeal once it has been withdrawn merely because the appellant now wishes to proceed before the Board<span class="Italic">. Zuhlke</span>, 74 MSPR at 404; <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 71 MSPR at 477.</p>
