<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-73"><span class="space">5.</span> Military Assignments</h4>
<p class="noindent">Matters related to the military aspects of technician employment may not be negotiated. 10 USC 976. A proposal was nonnegotiable that excused employees from being required to perform duties in other than civilian status except in times of emergency, war, or annual training. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 687 and Dept. of Air Force, Hq., 63rd Air Base Group (MAC), Norton AFB</span>, 19 FLRA 617, 619 (1985); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Seymour Johnson AFB and NAGE Local R5-188</span>, 57 FLRA 884 (2002) (FLRA lacked jurisdiction to direct a correction of the agency's refusal to make a military assignment to an Air Reserve Technician by reason of the employee's union activities). Negotiations could not be required concerning the timing of military assignments required to maintain compatibility between military and civilian functions. The military aspect of technician employment is totally mandated by law and, therefore, is not a condition of employment under the Statute. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 15 FLRA 52, 53 (1984). An arbitration award was set aside that sustained a grievance over a policy change providing a grace period for incompatibility of National Guard civilian and military assignments. The grace period was inconsistent with law that required complete compatibility between the positions. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-87 and Adjutant Gen. of Kan., Kansas Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 17 FLRA 120, 121 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">ACT Wichita Air Capitol Chap. And DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau Kansas NG</span>, 58 FLRA 28, 30-31 (2002), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 58 FLRA 483 (2003), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">ACT v. FLRA</span>, 360 F.3d 195 (D.C. Cir. 2004), <span class="Italic">post</span>, <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">ACT Wichita Air Capitol Chap. And DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Kansas NG</span>, 60 FLRA 342 (2004) (<span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 60 FLRA 835 (2005)), <span class="Italic">post</span>, determined to be nonnegotiable a proposal that the agency: (1) include any military training duty assigned as work in a technician's position description, with notice to the Union prior to such inclusion and an opportunity to discuss the inclusion with technicians; (2) require that military training be assigned as work only under certain parameters including an opportunity to discuss the Agency's decision with both the Union and technician; (3) engage in impact and implementation bargaining when a technician is assigned a military training duty as work; (4) not require employees to wear Chem Gear as a methods and means of performing work. The proposals were nonnegotiable because they required bargaining over the conditions of military service:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976I, bargaining over the "terms and conditions" of military service is prohibited. The Authority has previously determined that "terms and conditions" are interpreted in a broad manner so that with respect to dual status technicians, whose day-to-day work lives have both civilian and military components, the prohibition applies to military aspects of civilian technician employment. Those terms and conditions are outside the duty to bargain without regard to whether or not they are either (1) within the sole discretion of an agency or (2) specifically provided for by law. <span class="Italic">See Lone Star, </span>55 FLRA at 1229.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A technician's status at the time a proposal would operate is not critical in applying &#x00A7; 976I, but rather, the crucial distinction is whether the proposal relates to military service or civilian employment. <span class="Italic">ACT, Texas</span> <span class="Italic">Lone Star Chapter 100, </span>56 FLRA 432, 433 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Lone Star</span> <span class="Italic">II</span>) <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> <span class="Italic">ACT, Texas Lone Star Chapter 100 v. FLRA, </span>250 F.3d 778 (D.C. Cir. 2000). This is consistent with <span class="Italic">ACT Schenectady, </span>230 F.3d at 379, which held:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">But the status of the technicians at the time of the negotiation cannot matter. No one would claim that &#x00A7; 976I permitted the union to bargain about the type of uniform the technicians would wear when they were called to full-time duty (or training, <span class="Italic">see </span>32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 502(a)(1)). What does matter is the substance of the proposal to be negotiated<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of the Navy v. FLRA, </span>952 F.2d 1434, 1440-42 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section &#x00A7; 976I prohibits negotiations "on behalf of members of the armed forces, concerning the terms or conditions of service of such members." The proposal in this case concerns "military training duties," which are defined as duties required for all members of the National Guard, whether or not employees, "designed to impart or measure proficiency in a military skill" and requiring the achievement of "a specified level of achievement." Examples of such duties include "rifle qualifications" and "training in the wear of garments designed to afford protection from chemical weapons." Proposal 9-2b(1). It is clear that the military training duties that are the subject of the proposal are military skills required because an individual is a member of the National Guard--not skills based in the individual's civilian status. As a result, it is also clear, that the military training duties constitute a "condition of service" under &#x00A7; 976(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Paragraph 5 of the proposal conditions the assignment of military training duties on a variety of requirements, including bargaining over the impact and implementation of the assignment and 30 days' notice to affected employees. These requirements, among others, clearly "concern" the military training duties that, in turn, constitute the "condition of service" under &#x00A7; 976I. As a result, we find that paragraph 5, if within the duty to bargain, would require the Agency to "negotiate...concerning the terms or conditions of service" of members of the armed forces and, as a result, runs afoul of &#x00A7; 976I.[2] Because paragraph 5 of the proposal is inconsistent with &#x00A7; 976I, it is outside the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7117 of the Statute and, because the Union's request to sever the proposal is denied, the petition for review as to the entire proposal should be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;We reject the Union's argument that the proposal is within the duty to bargain because it concerns the assignment of duties as civilian work. This argument ignores the precedent, discussed above, holding that the prohibition in &#x00A7; 976I applies to terms of military service during time of civilian employment, as well as times of active duty. We also reject the Union's argument that the negotiability of this proposal is supported by the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">ACT, Pennsylvania,</span> 29 FLRA at 1300-01. The Authority found that proposal in that case "in no manner determines or affects" a military matter. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="noindent-1">Federal law makes it a crime to engage in collective bargaining over the terms or conditions of military service on behalf of members of the National Guard who are serving on full-time National Guard duty. Relying on that law, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976 (2000), the Federal Labor Relations Authority declined to order the Guard to bargain over a union proposal concerning military training duties assigned to National Guard technicians who serve as both civilian employees and military members of the Guard. Because the union's proposal concerns duties assigned to technicians while serving in civilian status, not while serving on full-time National Guard duty, we hold that the statute does not prohibit bargaining over the proposal and thus grant the union's petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to active-duty military personnel, the National Guard employs civilian technicians to meet its day-to-day administrative, clerical, and technical needs. <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Techs., Schenectady Chapter v.

<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner, the Association of Civilian Technicians, Wichita Air Capitol Chapter, is the exclusive representative of dual-status National Guard technicians employed by the Kansas National Guard. During collective bargaining, the union submitted a proposal concerning the assignment of military training duties to technicians. Although all members of the National Guard must undergo such training, the proposal involves training assigned to technicians while serving in their civilian capacity. The union's proposal defines "military training duty" as:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">duty that is (1) required by a written policy or regulation that is applicable to members of the National Guard irrespective of whether they are employees, (2) designed to impart or to measure proficiency in a military skill, and (3) required by written policy or regulation to be performed for a specified period of time, or with a specified frequency, or until a specified level of proficiency is achieved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal gives two examples of military training duty: "rifle qualification" and "training in the wear of garments designed to afford protection from chemical weapons (Chem Gear)." It would require the Guard to include in technician position descriptions any military training duty assigned as work, to give both technicians and the union notice and an opportunity to discuss any changes to the listed information, and, upon union request, to "negotiate the impact and implementation of military training duty assigned to any employee as work." Paragraph five of the proposal would require the Guard to assign military training duty by written order that describes, among other things:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the type, severity, and relative frequency of occurrence of any injury or Illness that is known to have resulted from past performance of the duty or that is foreseeable;...precautionary measures that the [Guard] will take and that the employee may take to reduce the risk of injury;...[and] measures that the [Guard] will take to provide prompt, effective treatment in the event injury does occur.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_664"></span>Paragraph five would also require the Guard to make representatives available to technicians "to discuss [the assigned military training duty], to answer questions, and to listen to any concerns." Finally, paragraph six would prohibit the Guard from requiring technicians to wear chemical gear "as a method and means of performing work."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Declaring the proposal outside its obligation to bargain, the Kansas National Guard refused to negotiate, and the union appealed to the Federal Labor Relations Authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117I (2000). According to the union, its proposal did not run afoul of section 976I because the proposal pertained only to military training duties performed on civilian time. The Authority disagreed, holding that the critical distinction under section 976I is not "[a] technician's status at the time a proposal would operate," but rather "whether the proposal relates to military service or civilian employment." <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Techs. Wichita Air Capitol Chapter,</span> 58 F.L.R.A. 28, 30, 2002 WL 31060623 (2002). Applying that test, the Authority explained: "[i]t is clear that the military training duties that are the subject of the proposal are military skills required because an individual is a member of the National Guard--not skills based in the individual's civilian status." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 31. "Because paragraph 5 of the proposal is inconsistent with &#x00A7; 976I," the Authority concluded, "it is outside the [Guard's] duty to bargain under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;] 7117." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> FLRA Chairman Cabaniss concurred on the grounds that the proposal was "outside the duty to bargain" because it was "contrary to the Technicians Act" and concerned "a military aspect of technician employment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 32.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union now petitions for Review.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 976I(2) provides: "It shall be unlawful for any person...to negotiate or bargain...on behalf of members of the armed forces, concerning the terms or conditions of service of such members." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976I(2). Section 976(a)(1) defines "member of the armed forces" as "(A) a member of the armed forces who is serving on active duty, (B) a member of the National Guard who is serving on full-time National Guard duty, or (C) a member of a Reserve component while performing inactive-duty training." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 976(a)(1). Because Congress has not delegated any responsibility to the Authority for administering section 976, we owe the agency's interpretation of the statute no deference. <span class="Italic">See Ill. Nat'l Guard v. FLRA,</span> 854 F.2d 1396, 1400 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Although "we follow the FLRA's reasoning to the extent that we deem [it] sound, we review the FLRA's decision...<span class="Italic">de novo</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union argues, as it did before the Authority, that section 976(a)(1)'s definition of "member of the armed forces" places a temporal limit on section 976I's prohibition on bargaining over terms or conditions of military service. As the union sees it, "[p]rocedures used to assign technicians work to be done during hours of civilian employment, for civilian pay, are not terms [or] conditions of military service, regardless of the nature of the work assigned." According to the union, therefore, because its proposal concerns duties that, though military in nature, are performed by technicians in their civilian capacity, the statute is inapplicable. Neither the Authority's decision nor its brief in this court responds to the union's argument. Instead, the Authority argues that purely military aspects of technicians' employment--like the military training duties at issue--constitute terms or conditions of military service regardless of when the training takes place. Based on the statute's text, its legislative history, and established canons of statutory construction, we think the union's interpretation of section 976 is correct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin with the language of the statute.&#x2003;Section 976(a)(1) defines "member of the armed forces" as "a member of the National Guard <span class="Italic">who is</span> serving on full-time National Guard duty." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976(a)(1) (emphasis added). If we import this definition into section 976(c)(2), the provision reads as follows: "it shall be unlawful for any person...to negotiate or bargain...on behalf of [members of the National Guard who are serving on full-time National Guard duty], concerning the terms or conditions of service of such [members who are serving on full-time National Guard duty]." The union is thus quite right: section 976(c)(2) prohibits bargaining not on behalf of members of the National Guard, but rather on behalf of members of the National Guard "who [are] serving on full-time National Guard duty." Because the union's proposal applies exclusively to those military training duties that the Guard assigns to technicians during hours of civilian work and for civilian pay, it falls outside the terms of section 976(c)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, military training duty regardless of when performed could be viewed as a term or condition of National Guard service, for technicians, who are required to be military members of the Guard, must undergo such training in order to serve on active military duty. The statute, however, does not prohibit bargaining over terms or conditions of National Guard service in all circumstances. It prohibits only bargaining concerning terms or conditions of full-time National Guard duty on behalf of members who are serving on fulltime National Guard duty. When the Guard chooses to assign military training duties to technicians in their civilian capacity, those duties also become terms or conditions of civilian employment. Because the technicians perform those duties while serving in their civilian capacity, they are not, at that time, "serving on full-time National Guard duty." The union thus seeks to bargain not "on behalf of members of the armed forces, concerning the terms or conditions of service of such members," but rather on behalf of civilian technicians concerning the terms or conditions of their civilian employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority points out that the statute's purpose is "to promote the readiness of the armed forces to defend the United States," Pub. L. No. 95-610, &#x00A7; 1(b), 92 Stat. 3085 (1978), and argues that the "military training at issue here, regardless of when it takes place, is intended to maintain skills and expertise required of an active duty member of the military[.]" This is certainly true, but section 976 makes clear that it applies only when members are serving on full-time National Guard duty. The legislative history, moreover, reveals that Congress was well aware of the need to ensure the Guard's military readiness and yet drafted the statute narrowly. The House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service rejected Senate provisions that would have fully included civilian technicians as members of the armed forces, explaining that it "was not persuaded by the arguments...that collective-bargaining activities by employee representatives detracted from the preparedness of the National Guard." H.R. Rep. No. 95-894(II), at 6 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7586, 7590. Striking those more inclusive Senate provisions, the committee rejected "the premise...that civilian technicians, while serving in their civilian capacity, are members of the military." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 7. The House Armed Services Committee, which also had jurisdiction over the bill, shared this view. Although recognizing that "the prohibition on military labor union membership must extend to the personnel of Reserve and National Guard components, since they are subject to mobilization in the event of a war or national emergency and would be serving side by side with active forces personnel," the committee emphasized section 976 's narrow scope:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[S]ince the restriction on their union membership affects First Amendment rights, the committee believes that the restriction should be drawn as narrowly as possible. To accomplish this, the bill provides that Reserve and National Guard personnel shall be considered as members of the armed forces only "while performing inactive duty training," i.e. those periods when they are actually in uniform and engaged in military training or instruction. It is the committee's belief that this limitation will be sufficient to govern the conduct of reservists while they are actually engaged in military duties....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">H.R. Rep. No. 95-894(I), at 8-9 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7575, 7580-81.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union's temporal reading of section 976 also finds support in the well-established principle that "penal statutes are to be construed strictly." <span class="Italic">United States v. Campos-Serrano,</span> 404 U.S. 293, 297, 92 S. Ct. 471, 474, 30 L. Ed.2d 457 (1971). "When choice has to be made between two readings of what conduct Congress has made a crime, it is appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Although this is not a criminal case, the Supreme Court has made clear that "[t]here cannot be one construction for the [regulatory agency] and another for the Department of Justice. If we should give [the statute] the broad construction urged by the [agency], the same construction would likewise apply in criminal cases." <span class="Italic">FCC v. Am. Broad. Co.,</span> 347 U.S. 284, 296, 74 S. Ct. 593, 600-01, 98 L. Ed. 699 (1954). So too here. Absent "clear and definite" guidance from Congress, we will not choose the Authority's "harsher alternative," which would criminalize negotiations on behalf of technicians concerning work assigned to them in their civilian capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Authority's view, nothing in <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Schenectady Chapter v. FLRA,</span> 230 F.3d 377 (D.C. Cir. 2000), our only previous decision addressing section 976I, requires a different result. In that case, we considered whether the statute prohibited negotiations over a union proposal that would have restricted the Guard's ability to communicate with technicians about their eligibility to volunteer for active duty by taking leave from their civilian posts while still receiving civilian pay. Interpreting section 976I, we explained that what "matter[s] is the substance of the proposal to be negotiated," not "the status of the technicians at the time of the negotiation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 379. Because the proposal "deal[t] with how the technicians [would] be paid <span class="Italic">while on active duty,</span>" we held that section 976I barred negotiations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 380 (emphasis added). By contrast, the issue in this case is not the technicians' status at the "time of the negotiation," but rather their status at the time the duties are performed. Unlike the proposal in <span class="Italic">ACT, Schenectady,</span> which dealt with the terms of technicians' pay while on active duty, i.e., "during full-time National Guard duty," the substance of the proposal here concerns the performance of duties, albeit of a military nature, assigned during hours of civilian employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also relies on two other decisions, <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1623 v. FLRA,</span> 852 F.2d 1349 (D.C. Cir. 1988), and <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Texas Lone Star Chapter 100 v. FLRA,</span> 250 F.3d <span id="page_665"></span>778 (D.C. Cir. 2001), to support its interpretation of section 976. Those cases, however, dealt with technicians' collective bargaining rights under the Technicians Act, 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709, not the criminal statute at issue here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We share the Authority's concern that aspects of the union's proposal could permit bargaining over purely military matters--such as rifle qualification or wearing chemical warfare gear--"designed to impart or to measure proficiency in a military skill" and mandated for all members of the Guard, whether or not employed as civilian technicians. But we may neither ignore section 976's temporal limit nor distort the statute to accommodate such concerns. Our job is to enforce the statute as enacted by Congress. If the Guard wishes to insulate all military training duties from collective bargaining, it should either ask Congress to amend section 976, or, more simply, assign military training duties to technicians while they are serving on full-time National Guard duty--the time when all other Guard members perform such training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union's petition for review is granted, the Authority's decision is vacated, and this matter is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent">Proceedings continued as FLRA again considered the proposals in <span class="Italic">ACT Wichita Air Capitol Chap.

<p class="noindent-1">This case is before the Authority on remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in<span class="Italic"> Association of Civilian Technicians, Wichita Air Capitol Chapter v. FLRA</span>, 360 F.3d 195 (D.C.

In the original matter, <span class="Italic">ACT, Wichita</span>, the Union filed a petition for review on a negotiability matter under &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)I of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute). The petition for review concerned one proposal, consisting of six paragraphs. The Authority denied the Union's request that the proposal be severed on the ground that the request failed to comply with the Authority's regulatory requirements governing severance. The Authority determined that the proposal was nonnegotiable as it was inconsistent with 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976. The D.C. Circuit reversed this determination and remanded the matter of the proposal's negotiability to the Authority for further processing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VI.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Technicians Act</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Technicians Act requires that National Guard technicians "[h]old the military grade specified by the Secretary concerned for [their] position." 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(b)(3). The Authority has held that the Agency's rules dictating that technicians have compatible military and civilian job assignments implement this statutory requirement. <span class="Italic">NAGE, </span>18 FLRA 736.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the proposal is contrary to the Technicians Act because it subjects to negotiation military training duties linked to compatibility.&#x2003;However, unlike the proposal in <span class="Italic">NAGE, </span>the proposal in this case does not concern the Agency's determination of what military skills are necessary to maintain compatibility. As the Union points out, the proposal does not limit the Agency's ability to require technicians to have any particular military skills, ranks, or positions. Instead, it requires the inclusion of military training duties in position descriptions, impact and implementation bargaining, and notice of the assignment of such duties. Moreover, the Authority has held specifically that proposals that "military assignment[s] be incorporated in the civilian technician's position description" are within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">ACT, Pennsylvania State Council,</span> 29 FLRA 1292, 1301 (1987). Thus, we reject the Agency's claim that the proposal is inconsistent with compatibility requirements of the Technicians Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's claim that the proposal is inconsistent with the Technicians Act based on prior Authority holdings that technicians may not bargain over "military aspects of their civilian technician employment." SOP at 7 (<span class="Italic">citing ACT, Texas Lone Star Ch. 100, </span>55 FLRA 1226 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd </span>250 F.3d 778, 784 (D.C. Cir. 2001)). In this regard, the court in <span class="Italic">ACT, Texas Lone Star</span> found "merit in [the Union's] contention" that the Authority "goes too far in suggesting that any proposal affecting the military aspects of technician employment" is outside the duty to bargain. 250 F.3d at 784. We agree, and find that there is no basis for applying &#x00A7; 7117(a) of the Statute differently with respect to the Technicians Act and other statutes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court's decision in this case is instructive on this point. In particular, the court held that 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976, which concerns bargaining over terms of military service:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">does not prohibit bargaining over terms or conditions of National Guard service in all circumstances. It prohibits only bargaining concerning terms or conditions of full-time National Guard duty.... When the Guard chooses to assign military training duties to technicians in their civilian capacity, those duties also become terms or conditions of civilian employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id. </span>At 198. Thus, &#x00A7; 976, which specifically addresses collective bargaining, does not have the effect of foreclosing bargaining by technicians while in civilian status. As such, it would be anomalous to find that the Technicians Act, which does not specifically address bargaining, has this effect. Instead, the Technicians Act forecloses bargaining only to the extent that proposals are "inconsistent with" that Act under &#x00A7; 7117(a) of the Statute, and a separate doctrine concerning military aspects of technician employment is not supportable.[4]</p>

Where an agency claims that a proposal affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a), and a union disagrees or claims that the proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and/or (3), as well as being electively negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), the Authority will first resolve those claims that would determine if a proposal is within the duty to bargain. Then, if necessary, the Authority will address those claims that would determine if a proposal is electively negotiable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NAGE, Local R1-109</span>, 54 FLRA 521, 526-28 (1998). Consistent with this sequence, we first consider the claims that the proposal comes within the terms of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7106(a) and 7106(b)(2) and (3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The Proposal Affects Management's Right to Assign Work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that the right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute encompasses the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what positions the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1985</span>, 55 FLRA 1145, 1148 (1999). Moreover, the Authority has held that proposals prescribing when a management right may be exercised constitute substantive limitations on the exercise of that right. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1345</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 174 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Fort Carson</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 862 F.2d 880, 882 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>), reversed and remanded as to other matters, 494 U.S. 922 (1990); <span class="Italic">United States Customs Service, Washington, D.C. v. FLRA</span>, 854 F.2d 1414, 1419 (D.C. Cir. 1988)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Fort Carson</span>, the Authority adopted the view of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> that "certain proposals precluding an agency from exercising a management right unless or until other events occurred directly interfered with that right." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 174. In this respect, the Authority found that, in at least some situations, timing is an integral part of the right to assign work. The proposal in <span class="Italic">Fort <span id="page_666"></span>Carson</span> effectively prohibited management from assigning any task, no matter how small or large, unless the specific work assignment was currently listed in the position description. In finding that the proposal directly interfered with the agency's right to assign work, the Authority noted that the bargaining unit included medical personnel who reasonably could be required to respond rapidly to a variety of medical situations. The Authority found that even in circumstances which did not constitute medical emergencies, requiring the agency to amend position descriptions before assigning work could effectively prohibit such assignments, and therefore the proposal was nonnegotiable as it directly interfered with the agency's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">Fort Carson</span>, 48 FLRA at 175 (Proposal 1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Paragraph 5 of the proposal in this case is similar to the proposal in <span class="Italic">Fort Carson</span>. Paragraph 5 requires the Agency to assign military training duties as work by written order that must be delivered to the employee no less than 30 days before the duty will begin, unless the order states facts and reasons explaining why the Agency is providing shorter notice. In this written order or notice of assignment, the Agency must identify: the portion of the written policy or regulation that requires performance of the duty and specifies the period of time, frequency, or level of proficiency required; the specific military skills to be imparted or military proficiency to be tested; the date, time, and place the duty will begin; and the expected duration of the duty for each separate period of duty time. Also, the Agency must describe in the order: the type, severity, and relative frequency of occurrence of any injury or illness that is known to have resulted from past performance of the duty or that is foreseeable; the precautionary measures that the Agency will take and that the employee may take to reduce the risk of injury; and the measures that the Agency will take to provide prompt, effective treatment in the event injury does occur. In addition, the Agency must meet, upon request, with employees and Union representatives to discuss the assignment of work of military training duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under paragraph 5, the Agency is effectively prohibited from assigning work involving any military training duty, as defined by the proposal, unless and until the Agency takes several actions that place substantive limitations on the Agency's right to assign work. It is well established that the Guard is a military organization dedicated to a military mission that provides "trained personnel" for "mobilization in times of war, national emergency or civil disruption." <span class="Italic">New York Council, Ass'n of Civil Tech. v. FLRA</span>, 757 F.2d 502, 505 (2nd Cir. 1985). In this respect, within the context of mobilization and deployment of troops, timing is an integral if not crucial aspect of the Agency's right to assign work. Within the practical realities of mobilizing and deploying employees under the circumstances mentioned above, paragraph 5 imposes significant requirements that the Agency must meet before assigning such military training duties as work. In this respect, ensuring compliance with these requirements would effectively prohibit the Agency from assigning work in mobilizing and deploying technicians immediately or very quickly.[7] Thus, we find that paragraph 5 of the proposal substantively restricts management's exercise of its right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The portion of paragraph 5 that would excuse the Agency from delivering written notice to employees no less than 30 days before the duty will begin itself affects the Agency's right to assign work by requiring the Agency to state in the order facts and reasons why the Agency is providing shorter notice. Such a requirement places a substantive limitation on the Agency's right to assign work by precluding it from timely assigning a military training duty unless and until it justifies in writing its reasons for providing shorter notice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority precedent, proposals or provisions that affect the exercise of management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) do not constitute negotiable procedures. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1214</span>, 40 FLRA 1181, 1188 (1991). Applying that precedent, which the parties do not challenge, to this case, we find that paragraph 5 of the proposal does not constitute a negotiable proposal under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. The Union does not make, and hence we need not address, any claim that paragraph 5 constitutes either an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) or involves a matter under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. Since paragraph 5 of the proposal is outside the duty to bargain, and as noted earlier the proposal is not severable, we find that the entire proposal is outside the duty to bargain.[8] <span class="Italic">See Professional Airways Systems Specialists, District No. 6, PASS/NMEBA</span>, 54 FLRA 1130, 1131 (1998) (if any portion of a proposal is outside the duty to bargain, the entire proposal falls outside the duty to bargain).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Both parties agree that paragraph 6 of the proposal concerns a matter that is bargainable at the election of the Agency under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. Nothing in Authority precedent suggests that this fact affects our conclusion that the proposal as a whole is outside the duty to bargain.</p>
