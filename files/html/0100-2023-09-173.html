<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-171"><span class="space">m.</span> Condition Unrelated to Underlying Action; Ambiguous Condition; Condition Described in Notice of LCA Violation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The LCA may include conditions unrelated to the adverse action suspended by the agreement. The LCA may result from a proposed disciplinary action linked to a specific charge and the ensuing LCA may require the appellant to avoid any material misconduct or substandard performance during the agreement's term. The harshness of a term of the agreement is irrelevant, in the Board's estimation, to whether the agreement is enforceable. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 344, 346 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Ferby v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 451 (1985), and <span class="Italic">Tootsie Roll Industries v. Local Union No. 1</span>, 832 F.2d 81 (7th Cir. 1987)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 162, 164 (1988) (removal was proposed for AWOL; the LCA called for the subsequent removal without an appeal if during one year "any other offense or performance problem of any kind" occurred). If the employee is removed for the "unrelated" misconduct, under the typical LCA the employee waives the right of Board review unless he demonstrates the agency's action was arbitrary or capricious or in bad faith. In <span class="Italic">Green v. DHHS</span>, 38 MSPR 577, 582-84 (1988), the appellant was removed for failure to follow leave regulations and AWOL. An LCA allowed the removal to be reinstated if the appellant's conduct became unsatisfactory to management within one year following his return to duty. The appellant was then removed under the agreement when the agency charged him with removing two boxes of garbage bags from a work area and giving them to a private contractor to settle a personal debt. The agency properly invoked the LCA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that, unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Ferby</span>, he has denied the agency's theft charges. He also argues that both administrative judges erred in finding that the removal could be reinstated on the basis of the charged conduct, inasmuch as they both merely found that he engaged in questionable conduct. He argues that, under the terms of the agreement, the removal could be reinstated only on the basis of misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, in <span class="Italic">Ferby</span>, the Board did not distinguish between the two employees involved on the basis of their denial or admission of the charges. In fact, in <span class="Italic">Ferby</span>, one employee denied the agency's new charges while the other did not. <span class="Italic">See Ferby</span>, 26 MSPR at 454-55. Moreover, the appellant agreed to the terms of the agreement that specifically state that he waived his right to appeal the agency's action. This waiver includes his right to defend against the charges before the Board. Thus, we reject the appellant's argument that both administrative judges erred in finding that the removal could be reinstated on the basis of the newly charged conduct. The term of the agreement stating that the appellant would be removed for any misconduct is unambiguous. <span class="Italic">See Ferby</span>, 26 MSPR at 457.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's subsequent misconduct was reasonably considered by the agency to violate the agreement, and, under the explicit terms of the agreement, the appellant waived his right to have the Board review the agency's action. Although the terms of the agreement may be harsh, the appellant freely agreed to them<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Tootsie Roll Industries v. Local Union No. 1, Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers' International Union</span>, 832 F.2d 81, 84 (7th Cir. 1987) (even though the term of the last chance agreement stating that the employee would be discharged if she was absent for any reason whatsoever is "very harsh and might even be termed as unreasonable, the parties agreed to it and the contract is exactly what it purports to be--a 'last chance' agreement"). Additionally, we note that the appellant was represented during the relevant period when the settlement agreement was negotiated and executed. <span class="Italic">See Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981) (the appellant is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also requests that the Board remand both appeals for hearings on the issue of whether he committed the misconduct. He argues that the administrative judges erroneously interpreted <span class="Italic">Butler v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPB 200, 8 MSPR 528 (1981), because in <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, the Board upheld the employee's removal only after a hearing was held on the issue of whether the employee had committed the charged theft.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject the appellant's argument that he is entitled to a hearing on the merits. An appellant has a right to a hearing only in an appeal to the Board from any action that is appealable under any law, rule, or regulation. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1). Where, as here, the appellant has executed an enforceable settlement agreement in which he specifically waived his right to appeal the agency's actions, the right to a hearing also is waived. Furthermore, in <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, a settlement agreement was not involved; rather, the Board was adjudicating a petition for appeal from a removal action based on charges of theft and possession of alcohol on agency property. Thus, we find no error in the administrative judges' citations of <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, nor do we find that the decision in <span class="Italic">Butler</span> supports the appellant's argument that he should be afforded a hearing in both of his appeals. Further, in <span class="Italic">McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the court addressed the issue of the Board's jurisdiction over an appeal where the appellant's right to appeal to the Board had been waived in a last-chance agreement. The court stated that "[i]f an agency acts in bad faith or takes other arbitrary and capricious action, as a breaching party it would not be able to enforce the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 667. The appellant's allegations and evidence, however, do not raise a non-frivolous question as to whether the agency acted in bad faith or acted arbitrarily or capriciously. Therefore, under <span class="Italic">McCall</span>, a hearing on the issue of jurisdiction is not required. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span> at 668-69.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCloud v. Dept. of Commerce,</span> DC-0432-10-0888-I-1 (NP 9/30/2011) ("Further, the appellant agreed in the LCA that the agency could remove her at its sole discretion if she committed any act of misconduct that would warrant disciplinary or adverse action during the 2-year abeyance period. The agency, in its notice to the appellant that she had breached the LCA, stated <span id="Page_1151"></span>that the appellant's conduct regarding the failure to follow her supervisor's instructions regarding Patent Application No. 10/937 314 constituted a breach of the agreement which warrants removal. The Board has long recognized that failure to follow a supervisor's instructions is a basis for disciplinary and/or adverse action. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of the Army</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 90, 91 (1982) (appellant removed for failure to follow supervisory instructions). Thus the appellant's failure to comply with her supervisor's instruction is a breach of the LCA.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an LCA that results from a particular offense sets as a contingency to fulfillment of the agreement that the appellant will commit neither the original nor another defined offense, the agreement will be enforced. Commission of the second offense is not a new charge; it is a "contingency" of the LCA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Girani v. FAA</span>, 924 F.2d 237 (Fed. Cir. 1991). To qualify as an offense cutting off appeal rights under an LCA, the definition of the offense should be unambiguous. One LCA spoke separately of AWOL and tardiness and the consequences of each. When the appellant missed a half an hour of work, the agency called it AWOL and removed the appellant. On appeal, the appellant argued that his absence was tardiness, an offense that under the circumstances did not permit removal under the agreement. The Board remanded the case to the region for a hearing to resolve the proper interpretation of the operative clauses of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Romano v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 319, 324 (1991). If the focus of the LCA waiver is on repetition of the underlying misconduct, and reference to unrelated conduct is not unambiguously tied to waiver of an appeal right, the Board may, as it did in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 81 MSPR 537, 542 &#x00B6; 17 (1999), determine that commission of the unrelated offense may be cause for adverse action but not a basis for waiver of the appeal that would follow that adverse action. To qualify as a violation of an agreement to maintain satisfactory conduct acceptable to management, the appellant's conduct must be material; it must constitute more than a "minor technical violation of [a]policy, resulting in no harm to the agency...." <span class="Italic">Tackett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 624, 632 &#x00B6; 19 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Many LCAs that arise out of specific instances of misconduct provide for the reinstatement of the appellant on the condition that the appellant commits no misconduct for the duration of the agreement. The Board determined that a broad provision pertaining to future misconduct would be considered without regard to the technical interpretation of charged misconduct relied on by the agency that reinstates the removal based on an LCA violation. The Federal Circuit would disagree with its approach, but the Board considered whether misconduct occurred rather than determining whether the agency properly described the misconduct in the charge against the appellant. <span class="Italic">Lizzio v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/LIZZIO_PETER_J_PH_0752_06_0546_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246073.pdf">105 MSPR 322</a>, 324-31 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-17, 2007 MSPB 89 (2007) (remanded, <span class="Italic">Lizzio v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed as a Special Agent with the Major Procurement Fraud Unit (MPFU) of the agency's Criminal Investigation Command (CID). On October 6, 2005, Wesley Kilgore, Director of MPFU, issued a decision to remove the appellant from his position based on charges of insubordination and conduct unbecoming a federal employee. The parties subsequently entered an LCA, dated December 15, 2005, in which the agency agreed to hold the removal decision in abeyance for one year, provided that the appellant complied with his obligations under the agreement. Among other obligations, the appellant agreed to "[a]void any misconduct." The LCA further provided that if the appellant failed to abide by the terms of the agreement, the agency would execute its original decision to remove him, and issue written notice of the removal action as soon as practical. In addition, the LCA included the following provisions, under the heading "Waiver of Appeal Rights":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Employee agrees not to contest or appeal any subsequent removal action and other actions taken under this agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Employee waives the right to appeal or contest a supervisor's determination of future misconduct and agency action based upon misconduct for one year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Employee waives his right to file a grievance, appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board and appeal to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for actions taken under the agreement and actions prior to the signing of this agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 10, 2006, the appellant and two other federal agents, Jessica Binns and Sylvia Askinazi, drove to a General Electric (GE) facility in Fairfield, Connecticut, for the purpose of interviewing Wanda McCarthy, an employee of both GE and the Defense Contract Auditing Agency, and a key witness in a major procurement fraud investigation. Upon their arrival, the agents were denied entry by security personnel, on the grounds that they had not obtained the necessary clearance to enter the facility. While attempting unsuccessfully to gain access, the appellant spoke in person with GE Security Officers Marcus McCall and Richard Goetz, Wackenhut Security Officer Eilecer Rodriguez, and Wackenhut Security Supervisor Rodney Jones, and spoke on the telephone with another GE employee, Phillip Lucy. Detective Peter Bravo of the Fairfield Police Department was also present at the facility entrance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following day, Retired General Frank Taylor, Corporate Security Manager for GE, and formerly Commanding General, Office of Special Investigations, U.S. Air Force, contacted MPFU to relate a complaint that the appellant had behaved unprofessionally while seeking entry into the GE facility. On April 12, 2006, James Podolak, Operations Officer, MPFU, referred the allegations of misconduct to the Standards of Conduct Office (SOCO). The SOCO inquiry, conducted by Special Agent Marion Robey, determined that the appellant had not improperly used his position as a CID agent, but had "failed to maintain the highest standards of personal conduct and professionalism to avoid embarrassment to the Army and the government," in violation of Army Regulation (AR) 195-3 and CID Regulation (CIDR) 195-1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 2, 2006, Mr. Kilgore issued the appellant a memorandum with the subject line "Notice of Intention to Invoke Last Chance Agreement." The memorandum offered the following explanation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On 9 May 2006 I received a report of an investigation from the Standards of Conduct Office (SOCO), U.S. Army Investigation Command, conducted as a result of allegations made against you for failing to maintain the standards of personal conduct and professionalism as directed by AR 195-3 and CIDR 195-1 and a possible violation of the Joint Ethics Regulation and CIDR 195-1. The SOCO conclusion was that you engaged in misconduct by failing to maintain the standards of personal conduct and professionalism required by AR 195-3 and CIDR 195-1. I have reviewed the investigation and supporting documentation and have determined that you did engage in misconduct. As a result of that misconduct I also concluded that you failed to comply with paragraph 2a of the Last Chance Agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was removed effective June 8, 2006, pursuant to &#x00B6; 4 of the LCA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a timely appeal with the Northeastern Regional Office. In the Acknowledgment Order, the administrative judge notified the appellant that the Board might not have jurisdiction over his appeal, as he had signed an LCA waiving his appeal rights. The administrative judge set forth the elements required to establish Board jurisdiction in such circumstances, and ordered the appellant to file evidence and argument on the issue. In his response, the appellant contended that his actions on April 10, 2006, did not constitute misconduct, that he had complied with the LCA, and that the agency had materially breached the agreement by removing him. The agency in turn argued that the appellant may not contest before the Board his supervisor's finding that he had engaged in misconduct, as such a challenge would itself amount to a violation of the LCA, specifically the waiver provision at &#x00B6; 2(b)(2). It further argued that the appellant had failed to introduce evidence of bad faith, and that "[w]ithout evidence of bad faith, there is no jurisdiction."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge determined that the appellant had made a nonfrivolous allegation of compliance with the LCA, and that he was therefore entitled to a hearing on the issue of jurisdiction. She further found that the waiver provision at &#x00B6; 2(b)(2) was unenforceable as a matter of public policy, on the grounds that "operation of such a waiver would supplant the Board's authority to determine its own jurisdiction over the challenged employment action." Following the hearing, the administrative judge found that the appellant had complied with the LCA, and that the agency was therefore not entitled to invoke the appellant's waiver of appeal rights. Having further determined that the agency did not afford the appellant due process in removing him for his alleged breach of the LCA, the administrative judge reversed the action and ordered the agency to provide interim relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On PFR, the agency argues that the initial decision should be reversed for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;the administrative judge erred in ruling &#x00B6; 2(b)(2) of the LCA unenforceable and proceeding to address the appellant's claim that he did not engage in misconduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;the administrative judge improperly limited the issue of the appellant's compliance with the LCA to the specific misconduct cited in the SOCO report;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;the administrative judge misapplied AR 195-3 by inquiring as to whether the appellant's action caused embarrassment, instead of whether the appellant failed to "maintain the highest standards of personal conduct and professionalism";</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;the administrative judge erred in concluding that the appellant's conduct, which she found to be "rude and obnoxious," was insufficient to establish embarrassment to the agency and the government;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;the administrative judge failed to apply the principle that law enforcement officers are held to a higher standard than ordinary employees;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;the administrative judge erred in her credibility determination by relying upon selected witnesses; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_1152"></span>(7)&#x2003;the agency acted in good faith in accordance with the provisions of the LCA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of proving that an appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] . The Board does not have jurisdiction over an action taken pursuant to an LCA in which the appellant waives his right to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Department of Transportation</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 365, 375 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 56 F.3d 83 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). To show that a waiver of appeal rights in an LCA is unenforceable, an appellant must establish that he complied with the agreement, that the agency breached it, that he did not voluntarily enter into the agreement, or that the agreement was the product of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Rosell v. Department of Defense</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). In this case, the appellant contends that he complied with the LCA, and that the agency materially breached the agreement by removing him in spite of his compliance. Where an employee raises a nonfrivolous factual issue of compliance with a last-chance settlement agreement, the Board must resolve that issue before addressing the scope and applicability of a waiver of appeal rights<span class="Italic">. See Stewart v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Thus, the administrative judge correctly began the jurisdictional inquiry by addressing the appellant's contention that he complied with the LCA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has argued that the appellant's denial that he engaged in misconduct is ipso facto a breach of the LCA, specifically &#x00B6; 2(b)(2), which provides that the appellant "waives the right to appeal or contest a supervisor's determination of future misconduct and agency action based upon misconduct for one year." However, the appellant's position is that the agency had already breached the agreement by removing him, thereby voiding the waiver provision in question. Moreover, contrary to the agency's argument, the appellant need not show that the agency acted in bad faith in order to establish a breach; he may also prove Board jurisdiction by showing that the agency materially breached the agreement, regardless of motive. <span class="Italic">Link v. Department of Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1995). If, at the time of his removal, the appellant had thus far complied with the LCA, then the agency's removal action was a material breach of the agreement and grounds for disregarding its waiver provisions. Thus, the threshold issue in determining the Board's jurisdiction over this appeal is whether the appellant violated the LCA by engaging in misconduct, as the agency alleges. Insofar as &#x00B6; 2(b)(2) might be construed as precluding the Board from addressing that issue, we agree with the AJ's decision not to enforce it on public policy grounds. <span class="Italic">See Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1244 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (observing that the Board "has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction, as do its AJ's").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining the threshold issue of the appellant's compliance with the LCA, our role is not to interpret the language in a way that modifies the agreement's material terms, but rather to determine whether the alleged breach occurred, considering the facts and circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Tackett v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 8 (1999). The provision of the LCA requiring that the appellant refrain from "any misconduct" is unambiguous. <span class="Italic">See Green v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 577, 582 (1988). If the appellant's actions at GE on April 10, 2006, constituted misconduct of any kind, then it follows that he breached the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the administrative judge limited her inquiry into the appellant's compliance with the LCA, reasoning as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[M]y assessment of the appellant's conduct must be informed by the standard of conduct expressly considered by [Mr. Kilgore] as outlined in the notice to the appellant of the agency's decision to invoke the LCA in making the determination as to whether the appellant's actions at GE on April 10, 2006 constituted a breach of the LCA's provision that he not engage in any misconduct. The Board is required to review an agency's decision on an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency and may not substitute what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge further found that Mr. Kilgore, in determining that the appellant had engaged in misconduct, relied upon AR 195-3, which provides, in relevant part, that CID employees "maintain the highest standards of personal conduct and professionalism to...[a]void embarrassment to the Army and the Government."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on her review of hearing testimony and the written record, the administrative judge found that the appellant had not violated the regulation in question. In reaching this conclusion, she observed that the hearing testimony of the GE security officers and the written sworn statements included in the SOCO report "support a finding that the appellant's conduct at GE on April 10, 2006 was rude and obnoxious." She added, however, that the behavior described in the SOCO report did "not equate to conduct causing embarrassment to the United States Army and the Government." The administrative judge also gave significant weight to the testimony of Detective Bravo, who stated that, while the appellant's conduct with the GE security officers could be construed as rude, it was not out of line, as "loud and aggressive" behavior may be required of law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties. She concluded as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appellant may have been rude in the dispatch of his responsibilities as a federal law enforcement official conducting an investigation during a brief encounter with various individuals at GE. However, the agency did not find that the appellant had failed to avoid rudeness when it issued the appellant notice of his removal for violation of the LCA. Instead, the agency's determination [that]the appellant violated the LCA was based on its regulation which requires that individuals assigned to the CID program maintain the highest standards of personal conduct and professionalism to avoid embarrassment to the Army and the Government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I find the preponderant evidence of record, however, fails to show the appellant's conduct on April 10, 2006 resulted in such embarrassment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has challenged the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's conduct on April 10, 2006 did not violate AR 195-3. We need not decide this issue, however, as we find that the administrative judge erred in limiting the issue of the appellant's compliance to the grounds relied upon by Mr. Kilgore in his determination that the appellant had engaged in misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The principle that the Board is required to review an agency's decision on an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency does not apply to the agency's notice of intention to invoke the LCA. Where a removal action is held in abeyance by an LCA, and the appellant commits a breach of the LCA, the result is not a new adverse action, but reinstatement of the removal that had been held in abeyance. The penalty of removal is then a product of the former misconduct, rather than the breach itself. <span class="Italic">See Tackett</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 8. Thus, there are no due process concerns at stake with regard to the agency's invocation of the LCA, as it is undisputed that the appellant received notice and an opportunity to respond to the charges that were the basis of the original removal action. <span class="Italic">See Hanley v. Department of Transportation</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 43, &#x00B6; 12 (2001). Moreover, the appellant had the opportunity below to examine the agency's evidence of his alleged misconduct on April 10, 2006, and to introduce evidence of his own, including hearing testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor is the Board's jurisdictional inquiry limited by the rule set forth by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp.</span>, 318 U.S. 80 (1943), and <span class="Italic">Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp.</span>, 332 U.S. 194 (1947). In the latter decision, the Court explained the rule as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When the case was first here, we emphasized a simple but fundamental rule of administrative law. That rule is to the effect that a reviewing court, in dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make, must judge the priority of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency. If those grounds are inadequate or improper, the court is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis. To do so would propel the court into the domain which Congress has set aside exclusively for the administrative agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">332 U.S. at 196. The Board is not a court, however, and the Federal Circuit has expressly declined to apply the <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> rule to the Board's review of a personnel action by another executive agency. <span class="Italic">See Huber v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 793 F.2d 284, 287 (Fed. Cir. 1986). To argue that the Board's review of another agency's action is limited by <span class="Italic">Chenery</span>, the court stated, is to "confuse the assigned roles of the Board, itself part of the administrative agency structure, and the courts." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To the contrary, "[i]t is the grounds for the Board's decision on the agency's action that is subject to judicial review, guided by <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> and the controlling statutes." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Licausi v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 350 F.3d 1359, 1363-65 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (declining to apply <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> to the Board's review of Office of Personnel Management disability retirement determinations). In any event, we find no indication that Congress has granted the agency the exclusive authority to determine whether an LCA into which it entered has been breached. Rather, Congress has granted the Board the authority to process adverse action appeals according to its regulations, which in turn require the appellant to establish jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we conclude that we are free to rely on a different ground than the agency did in determining whether the appellant established by a preponderance of the evidence that he complied with the LCA. Regardless of whether the appellant violated AR 195-3, rude and discourteous behavior toward members of the public constitutes misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lednar v. Social Security Administration</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 364, &#x00B6; 16 (1999). Thus, the finding of the administrative judge that the appellant was "rude and obnoxious" during his encounter with the GE security guards on April <span id="Page_1153"></span>10, 2006, is sufficient to establish that the appellant failed to meet his burden of showing that he did not breach the agreement. Accordingly, we uphold the waiver provision at &#x00B6; 2(b)(3) of the LCA, and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit did not support the Board's reconstitution of the bases for finding a violation of a last chance agreement. The problem was one of due process. The employee was entitled to rely on the agency's statement of the reasons to determine whether his conduct did or did not violate the LCA. The Federal Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">Lizzio v. Dept. of Army</span>, 534 F.3d 1376, 1377-87 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (on remand, <span class="Italic">Lizzio v. Dept. of Army</span>, 110 MSPR 442, 2009 MSPB 10 (2009), <span class="Italic">post</span>, <span class="Italic">aff'd on further appeal</span>, <span class="Italic">Lizzio v. Dept. of Army</span>, 374 Fed. Appx. 973 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP)), as it remanded the appeal for determination of breaches of the LCA alleged by the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency removed Mr. Lizzio from his position because it determined that he had breached a last chance agreement that he entered into with the agency in settlement of a previous removal action. The last chance agreement contained a waiver of appeal rights. Mr. Lizzio appealed his removal to the Board. Following a hearing on the issue of jurisdiction, the administrative judge ("AJ") to whom the appeal was assigned issued an initial decision in which she held that the waiver of appeal rights in the last chance agreement was unenforceable. She did so after ruling that Mr. Lizzio had established that he had not committed the breach of the last chance agreement asserted by the agency in its Notice of Intention to Invoke the last chance agreement (the "notice of breach"). She therefore reversed the removal action. Following the <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span>, the Board granted the agency's petition for review, reversed the <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span>, and dismissed Mr. Lizzio's appeal. Contrary to the AJ, the Board determined that Mr. Lizzio had failed to establish that the waiver of appeal rights was unenforceable by demonstrating that he had not breached the last chance agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we hold that the Board erred in its analysis by relying on a ground for breach of the last chance agreement different from the one found by the AJ to have been asserted by the agency in the notice of breach, we vacate the <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>. The case is remanded to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 6, 2005, Wesley Kilgore, the Director of the Major Procurement Fraud Unit, issued a decision to remove Mr. Lizzio from his position as a special agent. The grounds asserted for the action were that Mr. Lizzio had been insubordinate and had engaged in conduct unbecoming a federal employee. Rather than immediately remove Mr. Lizzio, however, the agency entered into a last chance agreement with him. In paragraph 2a of the agreement, Mr. Lizzio agreed to "[a]void any misconduct" in exchange for the agency's agreement to hold in abeyance his removal for a period of one year and to cancel the proposed removal if he refrained from "misconduct" for the one year period. The last chance agreement further provided that any "misconduct" on the part of Mr. Lizzio would constitute a breach of the agreement and would permit the agency to immediately execute its original decision to remove him from employment. In that regard, paragraph 4 of the agreement stated: "If the employee fails to comply with any of his obligations under this Agreement, the Agency will end the abeyance agreed to in this Agreement, and execute the original decision to remove the employee." Finally, the last chance agreement provided for a waiver of Mr. Lizzio's appeal rights. Specifically, in paragraph 2b(2) of the agreement, Mr. Lizzio agreed "not to contest or appeal any subsequent removal action and other actions taken under this agreement." In addition, in paragraph 2b(3), he waived "his right to file a grievance, appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board and appeal to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for actions taken under the agreement and actions prior to the signing of this agreement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 10, 2006, after he had entered into the last chance agreement, Mr. Lizzio and two other agents visited a General Electric ("GE") facility in Fairfield, Connecticut, in order to interview a GE employee who was a witness in a procurement fraud investigation. As discussed more fully below, while attempting to gain access to the witness, Mr. Lizzio engaged in a confrontation with GE security officers. The following day, a GE employee reported the incident to the Major Procurement Fraud Unit, which led to an inquiry by the agency's Standards of Conduct Office ("SOCO"). The SOCO inquiry ultimately produced a report concluding that Mr. Lizzio had "'failed to maintain the highest standards of personal conduct and professionalism to avoid embarrassment to the Army and the government,'" in violation of Army Regulation ("AR") 195-3 and Criminal Investigation Division Regulation ("CIDR") 195-1. As a result, on June 2, 2006, Mr. Kilgore issued to Mr. Lizzio the notice of breach. The notice stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On 9 May 2006 I received a report of an investigation from the Standards of Conduct Office (SOCO), U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, conducted as a result of allegations made against you for failing to maintain the standards of personal conduct and professionalism as directed by AR 195-3 and CIDR 195-1 and a possible violation of the Joint Ethics Regulation and CIDR 195-1. The SOCO conclusion was that you engaged in misconduct by failing to maintain the standards of personal conduct and professionalism required by AR 195-3 and CIDR 195-1. I have reviewed the investigation and the supporting documentation and have determined that you did engage in misconduct. As a result of that misconduct I also concluded that you failed to comply with paragraph 2a of the Last Chance Agreement you signed on 15 December 2005.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 8, 2006, the agency removed Mr. Lizzio.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Lizzio appealed his removal to the Board, arguing that he had not breached the last chance agreement and that the agency therefore was not entitled to invoke the waiver of appeal rights in paragraph 2b against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Board, Mr. Lizzio bore the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Board had jurisdiction to consider his appeal. <span class="Italic">Link v. Dep't of the Treasury,</span> 51 F.3d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1995); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) (2006). Though the Board lacks jurisdiction whenever a person waives his or her appeal rights in a last chance agreement, <span class="Italic">Link,</span> 51 F.3d at 1581; <span class="Italic">McCall v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 839 F.2d 664, 668 (Fed. Cir. 1988), an appellant may nonetheless establish jurisdiction by demonstrating that he or she complied with the agreement, that the agency breached it, or that he or she did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the agreement. <span class="Italic">Link,</span> 51 F.3d at 1582.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, following a hearing on jurisdiction, the AJ issued an initial decision reversing the agency's removal action. In her decision, the AJ considered Mr. Lizzio's conduct on April 10, 2006. As noted, on that date, Mr. Lizzio and two other agents drove to a GE facility in Fairfield, Connecticut, in order to interview a GE employee who was a witness in a procurement fraud investigation. Upon arrival at the GE facility, Mr. Lizzio and the other agents presented their credentials to a security guard at the entrance. After a fifteen minute delay, Mr. Lizzio exited his vehicle, whereupon he encountered a supervisory security officer, who directed Mr. Lizzio to return to his vehicle. Though the testimony before the AJ differed as to Mr. Lizzio's precise conduct during his in-person discussions with the security guards following his exit from his vehicle, he acknowledged that he took an "'insistent' and 'persistent' approach" with the security guards. After returning to his vehicle, Mr. Lizzio telephoned a GE finance manager. The manager testified that Mr. Lizzio acted in a "'rude and condescending'" and "'unprofessional'" manner during the telephone conversation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The security officers with whom Mr. Lizzio dealt testified that, though Mr. Lizzio's conduct may have been "'an embarrassment to himself [Mr. Lizzio] ,'" they did not conclude that Mr. Lizzio represented all federal employees or otherwise embarrassed the federal government. At the same time, an eyewitness to the events described Mr. Lizzio as "'heated'" and "'aggravated'" during his exchange with the security guards, but he stated that Mr. Lizzio did not raise his voice or abuse his authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Mr. Kilgore's letter cited both AR 195-3 and CIDR 195-1, the AJ determined that, based on Mr. Kilgore's testimony, the agency relied solely upon AR 195-3 in determining that Mr. Lizzio had committed misconduct in violation of the last chance agreement. ([N]oting that Mr. Kilgore admitted that "embarrassment to the agency and the government constitutes a 'material' element to his finding [Mr. Lizzio] engaged in misconduct," and further noting that the only standard cited in the notice letter which refers to "embarrassment" to the agency and the government is AR 195-3, paragraph 4-1(a)(3)). Despite the notice letter's explicit references to CIDR 195-1, the AJ stated that she was "unimpressed with [Mr. Kilgore's] testimony that he gave significant weight to any other agency standards of conduct because such testimony conflicts with the actual notice of intention to invoke the [last chance agreement] issued to [Mr. Lizzio]." Thus, the AJ confined her analysis to the question of whether Mr. Lizzio had breached the last chance agreement by engaging in conduct that embarrassed the government. After considering the evidence, the AJ found that, although Mr. Lizzio's conduct on April 10, 2006 was "rude and obnoxious," it was not embarrassing to the government. The AJ stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appellant may have been rude in the dispatch of his responsibilities as a federal law enforcement official conducting an investigation during a brief encounter with various individuals at GE. However, the agency did not find the appellant had failed to avoid rudeness when it issued the appellant notice of his removal for violation of the [last chance agreement] . Instead, the agency's determination the appellant violated the [last chance agreement] was based on its regulation which requires that individuals assigned to the CID Program maintain the highest standards of personal conduct and professionalism to avoid embarrassment to the Army and the Government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the AJ concluded that Mr. Lizzio had not breached the last chance agreement and that the agency could not invoke the appellate rights waiver in the agreement. The AJ therefore reversed the agency's removal of Mr. Lizzio.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1154"></span>The agency petitioned for review of the <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span>. In so doing, it argued, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that Mr. Lizzio's conduct was in fact embarrassing to the government and that his removal was therefore proper under AR 195-3. In the <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, the Board reversed the <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span> and dismissed Mr. Lizzio's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. at 331. The Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The agency has challenged the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's conduct on April 10, 2006 did not violate AR 195-3. We need not decide this issue, however, as we find that the administrative judge erred in limiting the issue of the appellant's compliance to the grounds relied upon by Mr. Kilgore in his determination that the appellant had engaged in misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The principle that the Board is required to review an agency's decision on an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency does not apply to the agency's notice of intention to invoke the [last chance agreement] . Where a removal action is held in abeyance by [a last chance agreement], and the appellant commits a breach of the [agreement], the result is not a new adverse action, but reinstatement of the removal that had been held in abeyance. The penalty of removal is then a product of the former misconduct, rather than the breach itself. Thus, there are no due process concerns at stake with regard to the agency's invocation of the [last chance agreement], as it is undisputed that the appellant received notice and an opportunity to respond to the charges that were the basis of the original removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 330 (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board rejected Mr. Lizzio's argument that relying on a ground for breach of the last chance agreement different from the one found by the AJ to have been asserted by the agency in the notice of breach constituted a violation of due process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 331. The Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Thus, we conclude that we are free to rely on a different ground than the agency did in determining whether the appellant established by a preponderance of the evidence that he complied with the [last chance agreement] . Regardless of whether the appellant violated AR 195-3, rude and discourteous behavior toward members of the public constitutes misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lednar v. Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 364, 371-72 (1999). Thus, the finding of the administrative judge that the appellant was "rude and obnoxious" during his encounter with the GE security guards on April 10, 2006, is sufficient to establish that the appellant failed to meet his burden of showing that he did not breach the agreement. Accordingly, we uphold the waiver provision at &#x00B6; 2(b)(3) of the [last chance agreement], and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. at 331.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Mr. Lizzio argues that he established before the AJ that he had not breached the last chance agreement, thereby preventing the agency from invoking the waiver of appeal rights in paragraph 2b of the agreement. Turning to the <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, he contends that the Board improperly relied upon a ground for breach that was neither cited by the agency in its decision to remove him nor adjudicated by the AJ in the <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span>. Mr. Lizzio notes that the AJ concluded that the only ground for breach properly cited by the agency was a violation of AR 195-3, which requires CID employees to "maintain the highest standards of personal conduct and professionalism to...[a]void embarrassment to the Army and the Government." Mr. Lizzio contends that Board case law makes it clear that the Board must review a removal action based upon the grounds cited by the agency and cannot substitute what it deems a more appropriate justification. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Shaw v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 98, 106-107 (1998) ("[T]he Board is required to adjudicate an appeal solely on the grounds invoked by the agency, and it may not substitute what it considers to be a more appropriate charge."). According to Mr. Lizzio, since the Board relied upon a different ground for breach than the one found by the AJ to have been asserted by the agency in the notice of breach, he was deprived of due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government responds that Mr. Lizzio's alleged misconduct on April 10, 2006 was not a separate charge upon which the agency relied to remove him. Rather, it was merely the event that triggered the agency's decision to proceed with the removal action originally proposed. According to the government, Mr. Lizzio was not entitled to "pre-termination notice" in connection with the agency's decision to implement the provisions of the last chance agreement. The government states: "Mr. Lizzio received pre-termination notice and an opportunity to respond to the charges upon which the agency based his removal which led to the [last chance agreement]." The government cites our decisions in <span class="Italic">Girani v. Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 924 F.2d 237 (Fed. Cir. 1991), and <span class="Italic">Baker v. Department of Transportation,</span> 418 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2005) for the proposition that an employee who breaches a last chance agreement is removed as a consequence of the initial misconduct that led to the entry of the agreement. The government reasons that an employee who signs a last chance agreement has no due process rights with respect to later misconduct justifying invocation of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph 4 of the last chance agreement provided in pertinent part as follows: "If the employee fails to comply with any of his obligations under this Agreement, the Agency will end the abeyance agreed to in this Agreement, and execute the original decision to remove the employee." In short, if Mr. Lizzio breached the agreement, the agency would put back into place the October 6, 2005 removal for insubordination and conduct unbecoming a federal employee. Thus, as the government notes, a breach of the last chance agreement on Mr. Lizzio's part would serve as a trigger for reinstatement of the previous removal action. At the same time, in paragraph 2b of the last chance agreement, Mr. Lizzio waived his right to appeal the reinstated removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That does not resolve the matter, however. Mr. Lizzio could render unenforceable the waiver of appeal rights and thereby enable the Board to exercise jurisdiction by establishing that he did not breach the last chance agreement. "[T]o establish Board jurisdiction, [an appellant has] the burden of proving that he did not breach the agreement." <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 334 F.3d 1065, 1070 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">see also Link,</span> 51 F.3d at 1582 ("[Appellant]could overcome his waiver of appeal rights by proving that he complied with the last-chance agreement...."); <span class="Italic">Rogers v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 647, 651 (1993) ("[T]he appellant was required to show that the appeal-rights waiver should not be enforced against him because he did not violate the agreement....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, as a matter of law, an appellant may establish Board jurisdiction in the face of a last chance agreement by establishing that he or she did not breach the agreement, it necessarily follows that, to be able to exercise that right, the appellant must be told in what way he or she allegedly breached the agreement. Otherwise, the appellant will not know what he or she has to prove was not done. This is nothing more than what due process requires. <span class="Italic">See Licausi v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 350 F.3d 1359, 1363 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (pointing out that both this court and the Board have recognized "the due process principle that a person must be given notice of the charge on which the action against him is based"). This principle applies when an employee is charged with breach of a last chance agreement. Otherwise, an employee will not be able to exercise his right to "overcome his waiver of appeal rights by proving that he complied with the last chance agreement." <span class="Italic">Link,</span> 51 F.3d at 1582.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we agree with the Board and the government that the alleged breach of the last chance agreement in this case was not a separate charge, but rather the event that triggered the reinstatement of the original charge. However, we do not agree with them that Mr. Lizzio was not entitled to notice with respect to the alleged breach. He was entitled to notice in the form of being told what his alleged breach was. In this case, the agency met that obligation when it sent Mr. Lizzio the notice of breach, informing him that he had breached the agreement on April 10, 2006 "by failing to maintain the standards of personal conduct and professionalism required by AR 195-3 and CIDR 195-1." AR 195-3 requires employees to "[a]void embarrassment to the Army and the Government," while CIDR 195-1 provides for the elimination of agents "considered substandard in performance or conduct, deficient in character, or otherwise unsuited for the [United States Army Criminal Investigation Division Command] program." As noted, the AJ found, based upon the testimony of Mr. Kilgore, that the ground asserted by the agency in the notice of breach was that Mr. Lizzio had engaged in conduct embarrassing to the government, in violation of AR 195-3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ concluded that Mr. Lizzio had not breached the last chance agreement. Focusing upon the alleged breach cited by Mr. Kilgore (misconduct in failing to comply with AR 195-3), the AJ concluded that, though "rude and obnoxious," Mr. Lizzio's conduct could not have embarrassed the government and therefore did not justify invocation of the last chance agreement. Thereafter, in response to the agency's petition for review, rather than disturbing the AJ's finding that the agency asserted in the notice of breach that Mr. Lizzio breached the agreement by engaging in conduct embarrassing to the government or her finding that Mr. Lizzio's conduct did not embarrass the government, the Board relied upon a ground for breach different from the one found by the AJ to have been asserted by the agency in the notice of breach. Thus, the Board concluded that "rude and obnoxious" behavior comprised "misconduct" within the meaning of the last chance agreement and therefore justified the agency's invocation of the agreement and removal of Mr. Lizzio for his prior misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that, in the <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, the Board erred in its reliance on a ground for breach different from the one found by the AJ to have been asserted by the agency in the notice of breach. In <span class="Italic">Gose v. United States Postal Service,</span> 451 F.3d 831 (Fed. Cir. 2006), where an employee was removed pursuant to a last chance agreement, we rejected the government's argument that we could sustain the removal action on the basis of statutory provisions that the employee may have violated but that were not cited as grounds for removal in the proceedings, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at<span id="Page_1155"></span> 839 n.4. We stated: "We reject the agency's argument that we can sustain its removal action based on Gose's alleged violations of other statutory provisions. Agency action must be sustained, if at all, on the actual grounds relied on by the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As we noted in <span class="Italic">Licausi,</span> "[a]lthough that principle has frequently been recognized by this court and the Board, it is not so much an application of the <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> doctrine as an application of the due process principle that a person must be given notice of the charge on which the action against him is based." <span class="Italic">Licausi</span>, 350 F.3d at 1363 n.1.[5] Here, the AJ found, as a matter of fact, that the agency's asserted ground in the notice of breach for breach of the last chance agreement was conduct "embarrassing" to the government. Significantly, the Board did not disturb that finding. By not disturbing that finding and by relying upon a ground for breach ("rude and obnoxious" behavior) different from the one found by the AJ to have been asserted by the agency in the notice of breach (conduct "embarrassing" to the government), the Board effectively deprived Mr. Lizzio of his right to establish Board jurisdiction by proving that he did not breach the last chance agreement by engaging in the conduct found by the AJ to have been asserted by the agency in the notice of breach.[6]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Lednar v. Social Security Administration,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 364 (1999), cited by the Board, is inapposite. The Board recognized there that rude and discourteous behavior by a government employee may constitute misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 371-72. The issue presented by this case is entirely different: whether, in the <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, the Board erred by relying on a ground for breach of the last chance agreement not found by the AJ to have been asserted by the agency in the notice of breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not agree with the government that our decisions in <span class="Italic">Girani</span> and <span class="Italic">Baker</span> compel a different result. In <span class="Italic">Girani,</span> an employee of the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA"), Robert Girani, entered into a last chance agreement in lieu of being removed for using cocaine. 924 F.2d at 239. Under the agreement, the FAA agreed to delay Girani's removal pending successful completion of a rehabilitation program. The agreement required Girani to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and to refrain from reporting for work under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The agreement further provided that "'any further involvement...with illegal mind-altering substances, or failure to adhere to any of the terms of this letter, will result in separation.'" Less than a year after entering into the agreement, Girani was arrested for driving under the influence. Consequently, the FAA removed him for having violated the conditions of the last chance agreement as they related to his rehabilitation program. Girani submitted his case to arbitration. After the arbitrator sustained his removal, Girani appealed to this court, arguing that the FAA removed him without providing notice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) that he was being removed for alcohol consumption. Specifically, though Girani conceded that he received all process required by section 7513(b) insofar as the original proposed removal for cocaine usage was concerned, he argued that the FAA violated section 7513(b) by removing him for a reason for which he was never given notice, i.e., alcohol consumption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We affirmed the arbitrator's decision sustaining Girani's removal. In so doing, we rejected Girani's argument that he was entitled to the procedural safeguards of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) in connection with his alcohol usage. We stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We are unpersuaded by petitioner's argument. It is based on the faulty premise that alcohol consumption was a separate disciplinary charge against him, therefore entitling him to a new notice of proposed removal and all of the other procedural safeguards of &#x00A7; 7513(b). Alcohol use, however, was not a separate charge, but was merely the evidence relied on by the FAA to demonstrate that petitioner had breached the "last chance" agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we added that there was substantial evidence in the record that Girani was aware that his alcohol consumption was the FAA's reason for removing him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Baker,</span> Rex Baker, an Air Traffic Control Specialist with the FAA, entered a substance abuse rehabilitation/treatment program following his arrest for possession of a controlled substance and his proposed removal by the FAA for that offense. 418 F.3d at 1371-72. In a memorandum that he received, Baker was informed that, in deciding whether to remove him, the FAA would give consideration to his successful completion of the treatment program. Subsequently, after Baker was discharged from a treatment facility for alleged use of drugs, the FAA removed him from his position. Baker appealed his removal to the Board, arguing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the FAA committed harmful procedural error by removing him following his failure to complete the rehabilitation program without issuing a second notice of proposed removal. The Board affirmed Baker's removal. The Board determined that the FAA was not required to issue a second notice of proposed removal in that Baker conceded that the FAA removed him on the basis of his prior controlled substance possession, not on the basis of his discharge from the treatment facility.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Baker then appealed his removal to this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, we affirmed the decision of the Board, rejecting Baker's argument that he was entitled to a second notice of proposed removal. We stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The reasoning of <span class="Italic">Girani</span> applies here. Mr. Baker's failure to complete the rehabilitation/treatment program was not a separate charge upon which the agency relied in order to remove him. Instead, Mr. Baker's discharge from [the treatment facility] was merely the event that triggered the agency's decision to proceed with the removal action originally proposed.... Accordingly, we conclude that Mr. Baker was not entitled to a new notice of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government's reliance on <span class="Italic">Girani</span> and <span class="Italic">Baker</span> is misplaced. Both cases simply stand for the proposition that, when an agency removes an employee from his or her position following breach of a last chance agreement, the breach is the trigger for the reinstatement of the original removal action and, consequently, a second formal notice of removal is not required. Neither <span class="Italic">Girani</span> nor <span class="Italic">Baker</span> involved the situation presented in this case: the Board rejecting an AJ's finding that there was no breach of a last chance agreement by relying on a ground for breach different from the one found by the AJ to have been asserted by the agency in the notice of breach, a finding not disturbed by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the Board erred when, in the <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, it relied on a ground for breach of the last chance agreement--conduct on Mr. Lizzio's part that was "rude and obnoxious"--different from the ground found by the AJ to have been asserted by the agency in the notice of breach--conduct on Mr. Lizzio's part that was "embarrassing" to the government, a finding not disturbed by the Board. In so doing, the Board deprived Mr. Lizzio of due process. <span class="Italic">See Gose,</span> 451 F.3d at 839 n.4; <span class="Italic">Licausi,</span> 350 F.3d at 1363 n.1. We therefore vacate the <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span> and remand the case to the Board so that, after receiving the views of the parties, the Board may consider anew the grounds for reversal of the <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span> advanced by the agency in its petition for review. We do so because the Board rested the <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span> solely upon the ground that Mr. Lizzio engaged in rude and obnoxious behavior. Among other things, it declined to review the AJ's finding that the agency charged Mr. Lizzio with breaching the last chance agreement by engaging in conduct that embarrassed the agency, or her finding that his conduct on April 10, 2006 did not embarrass the agency. <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. at 330 ("The agency has challenged the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's conduct on April 10, 2006 did not violate AR 195-3. We need not decide this issue, however, as we find that the administrative judge erred in limiting the issue of appellant's compliance to the grounds relied upon by Mr. Kilgore in his determination that the appellant had engaged in misconduct."). The agency is entitled to have the Board decide, under the proper standard, the arguments it presented in its petition for review. Finally, if on remand the Board affirms the <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span>, after receiving the views of the parties, it should determine the relief to which Mr. Lizzio is entitled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, <span class="Italic">Lizzio v. Dept. of Army</span>, 110 MSPR 442, 2009 MSPB 10 (2009), determined that the evidence supported a finding that the appellant did not comply with the requirements of the LCA as the agency alleged in its notice to the appellant. Because the appellant breached the LCA, the appeal from the ensuing removal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. On subsequent appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed: potential for embarrassment, criticism, or harm to an ongoing criminal investigation was all that was required to establish a violation of the Army regulation (AR 195-3), one of the bases advanced by the agency in support of Mr. Lizzio's violation of the LCA. <span class="Italic">Lizzio v. Dept. of Army</span>, 374 Fed. Appx. 973 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ashe v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rowe v. Dept. of Navy,</span> DC-0752-10-0703-I-1 (NP 9/9/2011), involved a challenge to removal based on the alleged violation of an LCA that, according to the initial decision, required:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rowe will maintain satisfactory relationships with co-workers or fellow employees. Disrespectful conduct of any kind will not be tolerated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rowe will demonstrate conduct becoming of a Federal employee at all times (on and off duty).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mr. Rowe was removed when he made a couple profane statements in the workplace. The Board remanded <span class="Italic">Rowe</span> for further analysis by the AJ on whether the profanities could be construed as a breach of the LCA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant argues that the administrative <span id="Page_1156"></span>judge improperly denied him a jurisdictional hearing because he did raise a non-frivolous allegation of jurisdiction that his conduct on June 5, 2010, did not violate the last-chance settlement agreement. Specifically, the appellant claims that his language and conduct were within the accepted norms of that workplace. While it may be true that use of profanity in the workplace is unacceptable and not conducive to a stable working atmosphere, <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Justice</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 303, &#x00B6; 10 (1995), it is well-established that the Board also considers the context in which the purported remarks were made to determine whether they constitute misconduct, <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 673, &#x00B6; 12 (2011). Moreover, given the particularized nature of the misconduct that gave rise to the last-chance settlement agreement at issue, the appellant arguably could not have been on notice that the scope of the agreement extended to any use of profanity, banal or otherwise.</p>
