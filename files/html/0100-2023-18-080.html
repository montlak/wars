<h3 class="h3" id="sec11-81"><span class="space">E.</span> FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE FILE, OTHER INFORMATION</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7513(b)(1) requires a proposal notice stating the specific reasons for the proposed action. An OPM regulation, 5 CFR 752.404(b)(1) (2022), requires the employing agency to inform the employee of his right to review the material relied on to support the reasons stated for the action proposed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Graham v. USPS</span>, 2 MSPR 213, 216, 2 MSPB 377 (1980). In an unacceptable performance action, the employee has the right to review evidence supporting the proposal notice, even though OPM regulations at 5 CFR Part 432 (2022) do not specifically confer that right. Any other interpretation would make the reply procedure meaningless and would conflict with the fundamental fairness required by due process. <span class="Italic">Beatty v. DHUD</span>, 20 MSPR 436, 439 n.1 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an agency may supply an evidence file with the proposal, all the statute requires is that the agency supply the material relied on at the employee's request, <span class="Italic">Greene v. OPM,</span> NY-0752-11-0043-I-1 (NP 1/31/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3224"></span>The agency explicitly based the charges in the notice of proposed removal on the OIG's Report of Investigation. Thus, this is not a situation where the agency considered <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information that it did not identify in the notice of proposed removal. Importantly, the agency specifically informed the appellant in the notice of proposed removal how to obtain the information upon which it based its action. The relevant statutory authority only requires that the agency provide such materials upon the affected employee's request. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(e). The appellant does not assert that he requested an opportunity to review that information, or that if he did so, that the agency denied his request. He also fails to identify any authority under which the agency would be obligated to provide such documentation to him in the absence of such a request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of the right of the employee to obtain documentation supporting the charges against him, <span class="Italic">Bize v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 3 MSPR 155, 162, 3 MSPB 261 (1980), observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[4]&#x2003;When considering the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978), the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs was aware that the right to review material relied on was conferred by regulation and decided not to expand this right. However, the Committee also intended that an employee receive a full evidentiary hearing before the Board, evidence that the regulation was not viewed as limiting an appellant's right to material evidence. S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 50, 54 (1978).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brady v. Dept. of Navy,</span> AT-0432-14-0389-I-1 (NP 7/25/2015) ("Even assuming that the appellant requested access to materials on the computer and the agency denied that request, she has not identified a procedure the agency has violated. The agency complied with OPM's required procedures for proposing an action based on unacceptable performance by providing the appellant advance notice of the removal and an opportunity to answer the proposal notice. Neither has she shown that it is likely that the agency would not have removed her had she been granted access to the materials on her computer. Therefore, we find that she has not proven a harmful procedural error.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Typically, the material supporting an adverse action is mailed to the employee at his (or his representative's) request or it is provided along with the adverse action proposal. If an agency requires an employee to come to the agency premises to receive copies of materials supporting an adverse action proposal (as opposed to mailing the material to the employee), there is no harmful error if no showing is made that the agency procedure was anything more than an inconvenience, i.e., there must be a demonstration that the agency requirement substantially impaired the employee's rights. <span class="Italic">Novotny v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 735 F.2d 521 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Neal v. DOJ</span>, 120 Fed. Appx. 300, 303 (Fed.

The material relied on in proposing the furlough was available on the website and in the civilian personnel section.

Based on the foregoing we find no basis for disturbing the administrative judge's finding that the agency provided the appellant with due process."...

<p class="Body-Text">Failure to provide to the appellant information relied on to support a proposal will not result in reversal of the agency action unless the Board is convinced that harmful error occurred, <span class="Italic">Gilmore v. USPS</span>, <span class="blue">103 MSPR 290</span>, 297-98 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17, 2006 MSPB 267 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have noted above that an employee is entitled, upon request, to copies of any material on which the agency has relied in support of the charges against her. Regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management require that the notice of proposal to take an adverse action inform the employee of this right. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b)(1). As the administrative judge noted, the proposal notice in this case did not include any such information. Moreover, although the appellant's supervisor met with the appellant and a union representative more than a month before the proposal notice was issued, and although the supervisor indicated during that meeting that she would provide the union representative with documents allegedly supporting the specifications later brought against the appellant, the union representative testified that she never received those materials. As noted above, the administrative judge relied on these failures in concluding that the appellant's change to lower grade could not be sustained, indicating that providing the materials to the appellant might have lent "some specificity and meaning" to the reasons for the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded that the agency's failure to provide the appellant with copies of the documents on which it relied, or its failure to advise her in the proposal notice of her right to those copies, is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of these errors. We have found above that the appellant was adequately informed of the bases for the action proposed and subsequently taken against her. Moreover, the hearing testimony described above, as well as the appellant's own hearing testimony, shows that the appellant was aware of the existence of the documents at issue here, and of her supervisor's willingness to make them available for review. Although the appellant testified that she did not receive copies of those documents, she also testified that her supervisor had said, during the meeting that preceded issuance of the proposal notice, that she would give the appellant "a copy of everything that she was using or...talking from" on that occasion. While it is unfortunate that the appellant's supervisor did not provide copies of the documents to the union representative or to the appellant, it is not unreasonable to expect that the appellant would follow up on the supervisor's apparent oversight if she wished to see the documents in question. Finally, we note that the appellant has neither shown nor even alleged that she was harmed by the agency's failure to ensure that she received the documents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also have noted that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, an employee has the right to reply both orally and in writing to a proposal to take adverse action against her. Neither the proposal notice in this case nor the mediator's notice of December 28 informed the appellant properly of this right. Instead, as indicated in the initial decision, both notices informed the appellant only that she could submit either a written reply or an oral reply. The appellant has not indicated, however, that she relied on this error to her detriment. She has not alleged, for example, that she would have submitted both written and oral replies if she had been advised of her right to do so. In fact, she has not raised this issue at all. We find, therefore, that the appellant has not shown that she was harmed by the error described above.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McNab v. Dept. of Army</span>, 121 MSPR 661, 671 &#x00B6; 18, 2014 MSPB 79 (2014) (Vice Chairman Wagner concurring and dissenting in part), implied that the agency's failure to provide an evidence file in advance of the period allowed for a reply did not rise to the level of a constitutional due process violation when the appellant did not request the file:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We likewise affirm the administrative judge's finding that the agency did not violate the appellant's due process rights. Procedural due process guarantees are not met if the employee has notice of only certain charges or portions of the evidence and the deciding official considers new and material information; therefore, it is constitutionally impermissible to allow a deciding official to receive additional material information that may undermine the objectivity required to protect the fairness of the process. <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The appellant challenges the administrative judge's finding on review, claiming that "the burden should have been on the agency" to prove that it provided the appellant with the materials underlying his proposed removal or that he never requested this information. The appellant is correct that the agency must comply with the minimum requirements of due process. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985) (an agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond). However, regardless of the allocation of burdens, we find, as discussed above, that the weight of the evidence establishes that the appellant did not request the underlying materials. Therefore, we decline to find that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no constitutional requirement that an agency to make its employees available for questioning or as witnesses during the reply stage preceding removal, although there is a statutory procedure available under 5 USC <span id="Page_3225"></span>7114(b)(4) to obtain information for a unit member who is being assisted by the a labor union in the reply process, and a labor contract might impose a requirement for an agency to produce witnesses for questioning at the reply stage. Under <span class="Italic">Fearon v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 99 MSPR 428, 430 n.1 (2005), the Board will not conduct an unfair labor practice analysis or supply an unfair labor practice remedy based on the appellant's assertion that the agency violated &#x00A7; 7114 when the union was involved in a grievance arbitration leading to a Board appeal. FOIA or the Privacy Act may be used, however, to develop information. Discovery is a Board process following appeal. At the reply stage the employee may obtain and present affidavits or statements from agency employees if he can do so. <span class="Italic">Hazlitt v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-606); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hatch v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 40 MSPR 260, 264 (1989) (agency was not required to make witnesses available on official time for interview prior to the appellant's removal and appeal to the Board, when he could ask the Board to compel the presence of witnesses through discovery); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Pippinger v. Rubin</span>, 129 F.3d 519 n.8 (10th Cir. 1997) (5 USC 301, permitting an agency head to prescribe regulations for the conduct of its employees and the use of agency records and property, allowed the agency to preclude its employees from speaking informally with the plaintiff or his counsel; discovery was available to gather relevant information).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The duty to disclose information relied on does not establish standards concerning the organization or maintenance of information. An employee has the right to examine the documentary evidence relied on, 5 CFR 752.404(b)(1) (2022), but this right cannot be expanded into a right to examine and challenge conclusions about his performance at every step of the way. The agency does not commit harmful error by preparing memoranda critical of the employee's performance without his knowledge, although doing so may not be a good employment practice. <span class="Italic">Turnage v. USDA</span>, 230 Ct. Cl. 799 (1982). It is not harmful error for the agency to fail to properly document the basis for a required psychiatric fitness for duty examination the appellant refused to take. <span class="Italic">Hodgson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 20 MSPR 541, 545 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sibert v. DHEW</span>, 4 MSPR 41, 44, 4 MSPB 132 (1980), considered an argument that harmful procedural error occurred when the agency used documents in the hearing that were not provided to the appellant before the adverse action was taken against her. The agency had not relied upon information earlier withheld. The record evidence was sufficient to sustain the adverse action, a conclusion that led the Board to hold that there could be no harmful error from any use of material not in the file. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brewer v. DOD</span>, 249 Fed. Appx. 174 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP) (a somewhat unclear decision implying that if the agency should have but did not provide information during the reply stage that may have been helpful to the appellant, any error was cured through the availability of discovery during the MSPB appeal). [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-003.html#sec3-4"><span class="Italic">De Novo</span> Hearing</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Salter v. United States,</span> 412 F.2d 874, 876 (Ct. Cl. 1969), ascertained no due process denial when the employee was not provided material that was not relied on in or related to the adverse action charges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff's main argument seems to be based upon the fact hereinbefore stated that a copy of the "summary of information" about his physical and mental condition, attached to the agency letter of March 27, 1964 requesting a medical examination, was never furnished to him despite his request. Plaintiff states that this examination was part of an effort to first have him removed on the basis of mental disability, as "the predecessor to the letter of charges" by defendant under which plaintiff was subsequently demoted. He urges that this attachment or summary by the agency to its letter requesting the medical examination and the subsequent medical reports were "part and parcel of this action," and refusal of the agency to supply him with these documents was a denial of administrative due process. Plaintiff also asserts as to specifications 2 and 3, Charge IV, that the medical reports would "clearly reflect that the personality of plaintiff was not one which was capable of the actions charged."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we can find no prejudice to plaintiff from the agency's refusal to supply these documents. In the final analysis, the Board of Appeals and Review of the Civil Service Commission concluded, as stated in its letter to plaintiff's attorney in March 1966:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">With respect to the medical reports and related correspondence the Board notes that all medical questions had been resolved in Mr. Salter's favor prior to the initiation of these charges. Since the current charges are not related to any medical questions, the Board finds that Mr. Salter's case has not been prejudiced by the agency's failure to produce these documents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no reason to try to go beyond or behind this reasonable conclusion by the Board. Clearly, the charges upon which plaintiff was demoted do not relate to any medical questions as to plaintiff's physical or mental condition, and even if such relationship had existed, all medical questions had been resolved in plaintiff's favor prior to the initiation of the charges. We can perceive no way in which the denial of these documents was a denial of an opportunity for plaintiff to rebut charges wholly unrelated thereto. Certainly, the withholding of these documents did not vitiate the adequacy or regularity of the agency's notice of charges, or the agency's letter notifying plaintiff of its decision to effect his demotion. In this salient respect, the facts in this case are clearly distinguishable from the facts in <span class="Italic">Bennett v. United States</span>, 356 F.2d 525, 174 Ct. Cl. 492, <span class="Italic">judgment vacated and case remanded</span>, 385 U.S. 4, 87 S. Ct. 39, 17 L. Ed.2d 4 (1966); thus, the dissenting opinion of Judge Davis, 356 F.2d at 530, 174 Ct. Cl. at 500, upon which plaintiff largely relies, is inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Perez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 32, 36-37 (1988), no harmful error occurred when the agency obtained supplemental statements from employees after the appellant's reply and before the agency issued its decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant next argues that the CALJ erred in not finding that the agency committed harmful error by considering in its decision to remove him three statements from co-workers obtained after the deadline for the appellant's response to the notice of proposed removal. The agency argues that the co-workers from whom these statements were taken had provided earlier statements on the appellant's behalf that he had submitted with his reply to the proposal notice, and that the subsequent statements that it obtained from them were merely clarifications of the earlier comments submitted by the appellant on his own behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant requested, and was permitted, the three co-workers as witnesses but called only one of them at the hearing and then did not question him regarding the second statement, even after the agency raised the issue in its cross-examination of that witness. The appellant has thus made no showing that he was surprised or harmed by, or unable to challenge, the second statements given by the three co-workers....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The result in <span class="Italic">Perez</span> would likely not survive a more constitutional due process test.

<p class="Body-Text">Nor was it error for an agency to exclude information from an adverse action proposal file if the information was not relied on to reach the adverse action decision. <span class="Italic">Martel v. FAA</span>, 15 MSPR 141, 155 (1983). <span class="Italic">Klein v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 6 MSPR 292, 295-96, 6 MSPB 249 (1981), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He is not entitled to material not relied upon. <span class="Italic">Hoover v. U.S.</span> 513 F.2d 606 (Ct. Cl. 1975).... [T]he agency did <span class="Italic">not</span> rely upon the material in question.... [T]he material was provided to the appellant at the hearing before the presiding official. Review of this material disclosed that it consists of a number of statements from persons to the effect that they have no knowledge of the matter under investigation. There is also one lengthy statement, however, it contains no information not otherwise of record, but rather corroborates affidavits included in the Report. The Board finds these documents to have been immaterial to the appellant's ability to respond to the charges before the agency or to his appeal to the Board. Therefore, we find no error in excluding the material from the Report of Investigation. <span class="Italic">McClelland v. Andrus,</span> 606 F.2d 1278 (D.C. Cir. 1979).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, <span class="Italic">Hill v. DOD,</span> DC-0752-09-0042-I-2 (NP 11/18/2010), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also reiterates her arguments below that: Mr. Kane unduly influenced CMDR Spanheimer's decision to propose the appellant's removal; and the agency committed harmful procedural error and violated her due process rights by failing to provide her a binder that CMDR Spanheimer gave Col. Beck, which contained an annotated version of the notice of proposed removal and the documents referenced in that notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of Mr. Kane's position as the appellant's supervisor during the time period relevant to the charge of Failure to Comply with Leave Requirements, CMDR Spanheimer's consultation with Mr. Kane in drafting the notice of proposed removal was entirely appropriate, and we see no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that Mr. Kane did not unduly influence CMDR Spanheimer decision to propose the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A due process violation may occur when non-cumulative, new and material information is brought to the attention of the deciding official without providing notice to the employee. <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>,<span class="Italic"></span> 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The administrative judge found that Col. Beck credibly testified that he "only considered information contained in the proposal notice." We see no reason to disturb this finding. Because Col. Beck did not consider the information in the binder, the agency's failure to provide the binder to the appellant does not constitute harmful error or violate the appellant's due process rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employer need not provide an entire investigation file to an employee if the proposal is based on only the portions of the file that were provided to the employee. <span class="Italic">Porrazzo v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 19 MSPR 496, 497 n.1 (1984). When, by administrative oversight, an agency failed to provide an appellant at the reply stage with some medical evaluations that it relied on, there was no harmful error. The appellant agreed the evaluations were genuine and that the diagnoses were valid. There was no prejudice to the appellant when the documents were submitted at the hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taccone v. USPS</span>, 12 MSPR 132, 133-34 (1982).

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3226"></span>Although an investigation report might not have been used in formulating the proposal or have been previously disclosed, it may still be used as evidence at the Board hearing. <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. SSA</span>, 22 MSPR 75, 77-78 (1984). Refer to the Federal Circuit decision in <span class="Italic">Callahan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 748 F.2d 1556 (Fed.

[Discussed in Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-023.html#sec3-23">Adjudication After Waiver, Failure to Attend Hearing</a>"; refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-003.html#sec3-4"><span class="Italic">De Novo</span> Hearing</a>."] 5 CFR 752.404(f) (2022) does not require an agency to furnish all the supporting material concerning an adverse action proposal that exists at the time it issues its decision. <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 13 MSPR 413, 415 (1982), concluded that the agency may develop and rely upon additional evidence after the employee responds to the proposal and the additional material need not be provided to the employee. The <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> holding was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266 (Fed.

Those communications vitiated the due process required in the reply procedure. The question of harm concerning materials or information reviewed within the agency, but not provided to the appellant, has received considerable attention since <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>. If <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> investigative reports are provided to an agency deciding official, the employee will not prevail on the basis of an allegation that his ability to defend himself was impaired unless he shows that the deciding official was influenced by the new information and that either the consideration of the new information likely had a harmful effect on the outcome before the agency or there was a violation of an OPM or agency regulation with harmful effect. <span class="Italic">Forrester v.
