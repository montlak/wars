<p class="Body-Text">The CSRS regulations provide, 5 CFR 831.1205 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">831.1205 <span class="Italic">Agency-filed disability retirement applications.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Basis for filing an application for an employee</span>. An agency must file an application for disability retirement of an employee who has 5 years of civilian Federal service when all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The agency has issued a decision to remove the employee;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The agency concludes, after its review of medical documentation, that the cause for unacceptable performance, attendance, or conduct is disease or injury;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The employee is institutionalized, or the agency concludes, based on a review of medical and other information, that the employee is incapable of making a decision to file an application for disability retirement;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;The employee has no personal representative or guardian; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;The employee has no immediate family member who is willing to file an application on his or her behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency procedures</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;When an agency issues a decision to remove an employee and not all of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section have been satisfied, but the removal is based on reasons apparently caused by a medical condition, the agency must advise the employee in writing of his or her possible eligibility for disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If the agency is filing a disability retirement application on the employee's behalf, the agency must inform the employee in writing at the same time it informs the employee of its removal decision, or at any time before the separation is effected, that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The agency is submitting a disability retirement application on the employee's behalf to OPM;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;The employee may review any medical information in accordance with the criteria in &#x00A7; 294.106(d) of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;The action does not affect the employee's right to submit a voluntary application for retirement under this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">OPM Procedures.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;OPM will cancel any disability retirement when a final decision of an administrative authority or court reverses the removal action and orders the reinstatement of an employee to the agency rolls.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The counterpart FERS regulation is 5 CFR 844.202 (2022). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Timberlake v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 231, 234 &#x00B6; 9 (2003) (reviewing regulation); <span class="Italic">Bailey v. DOD</span>, 92 MSPR 59, 62 &#x00B6; 7 (2002) (interpreting regulation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reviewing regulatory guidance, the Board noted, <span class="Italic">Murray v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 250, 257 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As the administrative judge noted, an agency's obligation in this regard has long been examined in connection with appeals from removal actions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Randall v. United States Postal Service</span>, 8 MSPR 434, 438-39 (1981). OPM regulations have been changed, however, since <span class="Italic">Randall</span> was issued. They now require, <span class="Italic">inter</span> <span class="Italic">alia</span>, that an agency must have first made a decision to remove the employee before considering involuntary disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 831.1203.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The requirement of a removal action as a precondition to an agency-initiated disability application resulted from OPM regulatory changes in 1984, explained at 49 Fed. Reg 1321, 1327 (Jan 11. 1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Current regulations and guidance provide for the retention of the employee on the agency's rolls until OPM has acted on the agency's application for an employee's disability retirement. If OPM allows the disability claim, the employee is then removed from the agency's rolls onto the civil service annuity rolls. Should OPM disallow the claim, the <span id="Page_2196"></span>agency is left with an employee who it has already determined is no longer employable and who it has notified of an intent to remove front the Government. The time that elapses between the agency's notice of proposed removal and the disallowance of the disability claim by OPM can be substantial, and if the agency proceeds with an action under Parts 432 or 752 of OPM's regulations, the time may be so long that the agency needs to compile further documentation to support an action under the removal procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The change contained in &#x00A7; 831.1205(a) is consistent with the purposes of Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 that actions adverse to employees be based on documented deficiencies in performance, conduct, or attendance, and that warranted actions be taken and completed expeditiously. It is also consistent with conclusions of former Congresswoman Spellman's Subcommittee on Compensation and Employee Benefits that separations for medical reasons may be more stigmatizing than those based on the actual deficiency in performance, conduct, or attendance. OPM intends that agencies' removal actions be reviewable quickly on their merits and that they stand or fall based primarily on whether the employee concerned can provide useful and efficient service to his/her employing agency. Whether or not the employing agency concurrently files an application for disability retirement benefits for the employee is a separate issue. Even if the agency did not do so as early as it might have, this error would not be harmful to the employee since the one-year time limit for filing does not apply when an employee is found to have been incapable of making a decision to file an application for disability retirement at the time of his/her separation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM wants to discourage agencies from attempting to file an application for disability retirement on behalf of the employee where some other personnel action is appropriate, even an adverse action. The unnecessary use of the "agency-filed" disability retirement provisions of the Civil Service Retirement law as an agency management tool is viewed by OPM as an abuse of this provision. Under the revised procedures, we believe that managers will be more confident in addressing employee performance problems and that they will not delay in taking appropriate and timely actions based on the employee's performance</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employing agency is required to file a disability retirement application on an employee's behalf where the employee meets the service requirements for disability retirement and five conditions are met: (1) The agency issued a decision to remove the employee; (2) the agency concludes after reviewing the medical documentation that the cause of the employee's misconduct is disease or injury; (3) the employee is institutionalized or the agency concludes (based upon medical and other information) that the employee is incapable of making the decision to file an application for disability retirement; (4) the employee has no personal representative or guardian; and (5) the employee has no immediate family member who is willing to file the application on his behalf. <span class="Italic">Galwey v.

When 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(a) is triggered, the Board is to oversee a cooperative process in conjunction with the agency and OPM that assures that the mentally-impaired employee will not lose his rights to disability retirement benefits based upon his incapacity. <span class="Italic">See Dixon v.

Even if the agency has an obligation to file for retirement on an employee's behalf, that obligation is extinguished upon the employee's death.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit advised in <span class="Italic">Harris v. VA</span>, 142 F.3d 1463, 1469-71 (Fed. Cir. 1998), that the Board and employing agencies should ensure that agencies apply for disability retirement for employees when the regulatory requirements governing agency-initiated applications are met. The court took the unusual step of remanding the case to the Board to consider the appropriate remedy on an appellant's petition to enforce a settlement agreement that the court determined the appellant breached. In the court's estimation, the evidence demonstrated that the appellant was sufficiently incapacitated that the agency should have filed for disability retirement on the employee's behalf, even though the employee filed, then withdrew, his own disability application:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 844.202(a) imposes a duty on an agency to file a disability retirement application when all of the necessary conditions are satisfied. The language of section 844.202 necessitates this construction. Because the regulation uses "must" instead of, for example, "may," it gives rise to a duty on the agency's part. In the commentary that accompanied the publication of the regulation as an interim rule, OPM confirmed that such a duty exists when it stated: "These regulations <span class="Italic">require</span> an agency to apply on the employee's behalf" when the enumerated conditions are met. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 33,434 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Related law has been understood to require the agency to protect an employee's rights in this context when he or she is unable to do so. The Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), which is the retirement system that preceded FERS for federal employees, has an almost identical regulatory scheme for agency-filed applications. Like FERS, CSRS authorizes agencies to file a disability retirement application on behalf of an employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(a) (1994) ("An employee who completes 5 years of civilian service and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee's own application <span class="Italic">or on application by the employee's</span> agency." (emphasis added)). The CSRS regulation for agency-filed applications presently appears at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1205(a). Its predecessor, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1203(a), which became effective in 1984, was essentially the same. The only difference between section 844.202(a) under FERS and present-day section 831.1205(a) under CSRS is that the preambles to the two regulations state the different eligibility requirements for the two retirement systems. Otherwise, the five numbered conditions in the two regulations are identical. Because of the similarities between the two regulatory schemes in this instance, commentary on CSRS helps to construe FERS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In promulgating the 1984 CSRS regulation, OPM stated: "It is envisioned that the employee involved in an agency-filed case will be suffering from a disease or injury that will have resulted in an appreciable eroding of mental and sometimes also physical capabilities." Medical Determinations Related to Employability; Reduction in Grade and Removal Based on Unacceptable Performance; Adverse Actions; and Retirement, 49 Fed. Reg. 1321, 1328 (1984) (final rule). In discussing agency-filed applications under CSRS, a federal district court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he agency's obligation arises only for those employees whose mental condition gives the agency reason to believe the disability is rooted in mental disease or injury. In such a situation, the employee's sense of judgment could well be impaired<span class="Italic">. To protect the rights of the impaired employee, the law requires the agency to file for retirement on the employee's behalf.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">National Post Office Mail Handlers, Watchmen, Messengers and Group Leaders v. United States Postal Serv</span>., 657 F. Supp. 295, 300 (D. Colo. 1987) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language of the regulation, the intent of OPM, and the comparable CSRS regulation, all mandate that section 844.202 be construed to impose a duty on the agency for the benefit of its employees when the conditions described in the regulation are met. That duty, in short, requires the agency to file and prosecute in good faith a disability retirement application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From the record, it appears that the conditions that trigger the DVA's duty under section 844.202 may be satisfied in Mr. Harris's case. It seems certain that Mr. Harris has 18 months of creditable service under FERS, as the preamble requires; that the DVA removed him, as subsection (a)(1) requires; and that the DVA removed him because of his alleged disability, as subsection (a)(2) requires.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to subsection (a)(3), there are numerous statements from the DVA suggesting that the DVA had reason to conclude that Mr. Harris was incapable of making a decision to file an application for a disability retirement. First, the very disability for which Mr. Harris was removed, a persecutory complex, conceivably prompted him to oppose his disability retirement application. The DVA knew of his predilection, as evidenced by the numerous statements by his supervisors and the fitness for duty examination. The evidence, much of which has been summarized above, strongly suggests that the DVA should have concluded that this condition was met. <span class="Italic">Cf. Lizut v. Department of the Army</span>, 717 F.2d 1391, 1394-95 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (holding that, under a 1980 CSRS regulation governing agency-filed disability retirement applications, "[t]he reason to <span id="Page_2197"></span>believe standard serves as an appropriate test for determining when the agency's obligation to fulfill the administrative task of filing for disability retirement for an employee arises").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Mr. Harris actually filed a disability retirement application, that fact does not discharge an agency's duty under section 844.202 if the agency concludes that an employee is incapable of making a rational decision both to file and to process a retirement application with OPM. The retirement application itself, and Mr. Harris's subsequent reaction to it, raise serious questions whether Mr. Harris was capable of deciding whether, in the first instance, to apply for a disability retirement and, equally important, to pursue the application with OPM. In the portion of the application that he completed, Mr. Harris did not, as the form requested, explain that he was disabled or why his disability impaired his work. He believed that the application was based on lies, and that the DVA, not he, instituted the application. Nowhere in the record is there any inkling that Mr. Harris thought himself disabled, much less mentally disabled. All of this evidence strongly suggests that Mr. Harris was incapable of making a decision to file and pursue a disability retirement application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to subsections (a)(4) and (a)(5), the record before us does not indicate whether Mr. Harris had either a personal representative or guardian, or an immediate family member, who could stand in his stead. Certainly, there is no evidence suggesting that there was such a person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because section 844.202 imposes a duty on the DVA when certain conditions are met, and because there is substantial reason to suspect that those conditions have been satisfied in this case, we remand Mr. Harris's case to the Board for it to decide, upon further examination, whether the DVA should have filed a disability retirement application for Mr. Harris. Were the Board to rule that the DVA had neglected this duty, then in accordance with section 844.202 and the Agreement, the DVA should file a disability retirement application, and OPM should process the application expediently and in good faith.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of the application of <span class="Italic">Harris</span> is <span class="Italic">Shaw v. USDA</span>, 88 MSPR 656, 658-59 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (2001). The appellant, removed for unacceptable performance, appealed and lost. She filed a PFR. The Board determined from the filings that the appellant had an apparent mental illness that could have been the cause of her unacceptable performance. The Board essentially directed the agency to file a disability retirement application on the appellant's behalf. The agency did so, and the Board then suspended the processing of the PFR and remanded the case for the AJ to monitor and facilitate the disability application process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 142 F.3d 1463, 1471-72 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the court instructed the Board to implement section 844.202 in a manner that draws the Board, the employing agency, and OPM together in a cooperative undertaking to assure that persons of likely mental incapacity will not suffer impairment of their rights to disability retirement benefits on account of their incapacity. The court envisioned that this cooperative undertaking would first examine whether the employing agency breached disability retirement regulations by failing to initiate and process a disability retirement application on an appellant's behalf<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1472. Here, because the agency has filed an application for disability retirement on the appellant's behalf, we need not examine whether the agency breached the disability retirement regulations. We remand this appeal, with instructions on the role that the administrative judge should play as he participates in the cooperative undertaking among the Board, the employing agency, and OPM to assure that the appellant's rights are protected until that application is decided.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge should monitor the progress of the application, including setting reasonable time limits, where appropriate, to ensure that the agency complies with its duty to prosecute the application in good faith and to ensure that OPM complies with its duty to process the application expediently and in good faith. <span class="Italic">Harris,</span> 142 F.3d at 1470-71. The administrative judge may join OPM as a party to the appeal, or initiate the procedures to request <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation for the appellant, if he determines that such steps are appropriate or necessary. <span class="Italic">See French v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board has suspended its consideration of the petition for review pending completion of the nonadversarial process in which it is participating with the employing agency and OPM. The Board will resume consideration of the petition for review when OPM has issued a final decision on the disability retirement application, unless the petition for review is withdrawn or the initial decision is vacated due to settlement.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that this case involves a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant who may be mentally incompetent to represent himself but that this is not a disability retirement case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e reopen this case to consider whether the agency had an obligation to file a disability retirement application on this appellant's behalf.

Before issuing a decision to remove an employee for cause, an agency, under certain conditions, has a duty to advise an employee in writing of his eligibility for disability retirement and the time limit for applying for disability retirement, and, under certain other conditions, the agency may even have a duty to file the disability retirement application on behalf of an employee. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 844.202(a) and (b). Under these regulations, an agency has a duty to file a disability retirement application for an employee when the agency concludes that an employee is incapable of making the decision to file. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 844.202(a)(3). <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1463 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From our review of the record, it appears that the conditions that trigger the agency's duty under section 844.202 may have been satisfied in this case. The appellant has at least 18 months of creditable service under FERS. Here, the agency clearly believed that the appellant was mentally impaired since it removed him, after concluding from its review of the medical documentation that the cause for the unacceptable performance was his mental condition. The record shows that the agency had evidence from the appellant's treating psychologist indicating that the appellant does not believe that he suffers from any mental illness. We also note that, in accordance with 5 CFR &#x00A7; 844.202(b), the agency provided the appellant with notice of the filing deadlines for applying for disability retirement. Furthermore, the administrative judge also reminded the appellant that OPM will only consider disability retirement applications received within one year from the date of an employee's removal or separation from service. The appellant specifically acknowledged this reminder and indicated that, if the Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP) denied his claim for benefits based on his alleged job-related stress disorder, he would "consider other options." A May 14, 1998 letter from OPM, which is attached to his petition for review, states that OPM received documentation indicating his intent to apply for disability retirement, but that no application has been received by OPM. Given the appellant's state of denial and the nature of his impairment, one could reasonably conclude that the agency should have known that the appellant was incapable of making a decision to file an application for disability retirement and should have filed such an application on his behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the record indicates that the appellant was pursuing an Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) claim and that he said he would "consider other options" if his claim was not approved, those facts do not discharge the agency's duty under section 844.202 if the agency concludes that an employee is incapable of making a rational decision to file and to process a retirement application. <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 142 F.3d at 1470. In that regard, the agency had evidence from the appellant's treating psychologist showing that the appellant "does not believe he suffers from any mental illness."

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Carrillo</span> was modified or clarified by <span class="Italic">Hall v. OPM</span>, 85 MSPR 371, 376-79 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-24 (2000), as to the conditions and timing of an agency application for retirement. <span class="Italic">Hall</span> required, in the Board's review of an OPM retirement appeal by an individual who appeared to be mentally incompetent, that the employing agency be joined in the appeal, a result leading to a dissent by Vice Chair Slavet, who believed the appellate involvement of the employing agency to be unnecessary:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first take this opportunity to modify <span class="Italic">Carrillo</span>. Under both Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) regulations, an employing agency must apply for disability retirement for an employee, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, when "[t]he agency has issued a decision to remove the employee." 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1205(a)(1), 844.202(a)(1). Thus, the agency's issuance of a removal decision notice is a precondition for an employing agency's obligation to apply for disability retirement for an employee whose removal for unacceptable performance, attendance or conduct is caused by disease or injury. 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1205(a)(l)-(2), 844.202(a)(l)-(2). The regulations contemplate that an employing agency should effect its removal decision, and, <span class="Italic">following separation</span> "must provide OPM with a copy of the documentation of the separation." 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1205(b)(3), 844.202(b)(3). "OPM will not act on any application for disability retirement filed by an agency on behalf of an employee until it receives the appropriate documentation of the separation." 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1205(c)(1), 844.202(c)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This modification, however, does not affect the holding that, under certain circumstances, an employing agency has an obligation to file a disability retirement application on an employee's behalf. Both the FERS and the CSRS regulations set forth this obligation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That regulation provided that an agency "shall" file a disability retirement application for an employee who has five years of civilian federal service if the agency has issued a decision to remove the employee; the agency concludes, after reviewing medical documentation, that the cause of the unacceptable performance, conduct, or attendance is disease or injury; the employee is institutionalized, or the agency concludes, based on its review of medical and other information, that the employee is incapable of deciding to apply for disability retirement; the employee has no personal representative or guardian; and the employee has no immediate family member willing to apply on her behalf. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1203(a) (1991). We find that these criteria may be met in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously noted, the employing agency removed the appellant for unsatisfactory attendance, after she did not come to work for six years, and failure to follow instructions, and she pursued her removal through arbitration. The July 13, 1992 arbitration decision indicated that the employing agency knew that the appellant possibly had psychological problems. For example, it noted that the employing agency's medical officer, Dr. Kopecki, stated that, on July 13, 1989, he told the appellant that she needed to submit a release concerning "her psychiatric problems, if any, from a Board certified psychiatrist," and that he testified that he had given this same advice to others who had inquired about the appellant's status. It further noted that the appellant had been seen by four psychiatrists, and that the employing agency refused to release a psychiatric evaluation by Dr. Cor DeHart, concerning the appellant's January 9, 1985 visit and consultation, directly to the appellant under a provision that permits the medical officer to send the record only to a physician if the medical officer decided that unqualified disclosure "would be likely to affect the subject adversely." Because the appellant refused to designate a doctor to receive the report, she did not obtain access to it. Moreover, the arbitration decision stated that, although one doctor indicated that the appellant was not psychiatrically incapable of performing her duties, four other doctors "were of a different opinion."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the arbitration decision suggested that the appellant's condition prevented her from applying for disability retirement. It cited the appellant's explanation that she had not applied for a disability retirement because the doctors would not fill out the required forms and it presumed that their refusal was directly related to her refusal to cooperate with them. The decision noted, among other things, the appellant's "unalterable disdain for the entire medical profession" and her refusal to take medication or permit diagnostic tests. It also noted that the appellant has brought complaints against a number of medical practitioners.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, although the appellant had a union representative below, the record does not indicate that he was authorized to claim mental incompetence on her behalf or that she would have cooperated with him if he had tried to raise it. Indeed, the arbitrator's decision stated that, although the appellant had a union representative, the appellant's refusal to cooperate had hindered it "in establishing the basic facts necessary to resolve the matter in her favor." In doing so, the decision implied that a disability retirement application should be filed for the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 142 F.3d at 1471-72, the court stated that, when disability retirement benefits are at stake, the Board, the employing agency, and OPM should "draw[ ] ...together in a cooperative undertaking to assure that persons of likely mental incapacity will not suffer an impairment of their rights on account of their incapacity." The court remanded the case for a determination of whether the employing agency breached its obligation to initiate and process a disability retirement application for the appellant. We find that result appropriate in this case, as well. To deny the appellant's petition before she has the benefit of the non-adversarial cooperative undertaking mandated by the court, after the Board has assisted her in obtaining <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation, would be wrong under <span class="Italic">French</span> and <span class="Italic">Harris.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases such as this, where the employing agency potentially had an obligation to initiate a disability application for a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant, the appellant has failed to timely initiate her own application, and the appellant's failure to assert incompetence is itself a manifestation of that incompetence, the Board has an obligation to enforce the rules that it has adopted for mentally incompetent appellants. As noted above, both the employing agency and OPM are similarly required to cooperate in assuring that mentally incapacitated employees are treated with fundamental fairness. It is incumbent upon the Board to be proactive in involving all the parties in finding a solution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's pre-separation behavior and the comments from the arbitrator and the employing agency's psychiatrist should have been a "red flag" for the employing agency that it might have a regulatory obligation to help the appellant apply for disability retirement after it decided to remove her. As noted, the employing agency had a January 1985 psychiatric evaluation by Dr. DeHart that may provide an indication of her pre-separation mental state and whether the employing agency should have assisted her in filing for disability retirement at the time. In light of the concerns of Congress, as reflected in the regulations, the court's decisions in <span class="Italic">French</span> and <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, and the Board's own rules regarding appellants who are mentally incompetent, we find that this case should also be remanded to determine whether the employing agency breached its regulatory obligations by failing to initiate and process a disability retirement application for the appellant.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We remand this case for further adjudication on the issue of waiver of OPM time limits in accordance with the standards adopted by the Board in <span class="Italic">French,</span> 37 MSPR at 499. Before deciding that issue, the administrative judge should direct OPM to obtain and submit into the record a copy of Dr. DeHart's January 1985 psychiatric evaluation. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Burton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 83 MSPR 174, 178, 118 (1999) (finding that the agency is obligated to Me relevant evidence concerning timeliness). The administrative judge should also join the employing agency as a party to this case. If the administrative judge determines that the appellant is entitled to waiver of the one-year time limit for filing a disability retirement application, the administrative judge should remand the case to OPM for a decision on the merits of the appellant's application.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Walker v. VA</span>, 109 MSPR 158, 2008 MSPB 130 (2008), the Board was unclear as to agency obligations to assist in the retirement process for a mentally disabled employee whose disability was first made known to the agency during the appellate processes of the Board. An appeal was remanded for further development by the AJ long after the appellant was discharged, and that discharge was sustained by the Board, when in the later appeal it appeared to the Board that the agency may have had an obligation to file a disability retirement application on the employee's behalf. <span class="Italic">Augustin v. FDIC</span>, NY-3443-15-0124-I-1 (NP 1/4/2016) (also addressing <span class="Italic">French</span> procedures for appointment of <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> counsel).
