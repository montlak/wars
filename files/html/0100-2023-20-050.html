<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-49"><span class="space">9.</span> Disclosures in Multiple Forums</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ramos v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 72 MSPR 235, 242-43 (1996), summarized decisions concerning IRA jurisdiction when the appellant is involved in multiple disclosures and complaints, sometimes in multiple forums:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1035 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the court found that, when an employee makes a number of related disclosures based upon the same operative facts, some of which are argued to come under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and some under section 2302(b)(9), those that come under section 2302(b)(8) provide a basis of Board IRA jurisdiction to review allegations of reprisal for whistleblowing. Thus the Board held in <span class="Italic">Loyd</span>, 69 MSPR at 688-89, that an employee's disclosure to Congress regarding the agency's mishandling of his grievance did not preclude IRA jurisdiction of his suspension taken against him allegedly in reprisal for his disclosure of a possible abuse of authority. In <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 504 (1995), the appellant filed an unfair labor practice charge and disclosed the operative facts of the asserted unfair labor practice on a radio talk show. The Board found that the appellant's allegation that the agency retaliated against her for what she stated on the radio talk show was an allegation of whistleblower reprisal under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) over which the Board had jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 509-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, in some circumstances, the same factual situation and issues raised in a filing protected by section 2302(b)(9) may also serve as the basis for a section 2302(b)(8) disclosure if they establish the type of fraud, waste, or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1035; <span class="Italic">Bump v. Department of the Interior</span>, 64 MSPR 326, 332 (1994). Hence, we find that the fact that the appellant's letter to the Attorney General disclosing allegations of agency attacks upon IRS Hispanic employees in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 also formed a basis for his EEO complaint with the agency concerning his suspension and reassignment does not necessarily preclude IRA jurisdiction over this disclosure. The appellant's filing of an EEO complaint concerning the agency's actions does not, in itself, disqualify him from pursuing corrective action under the WPA based on the same operative facts, provided that such underlying and intertwining facts also constitute violations of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1035; <span class="Italic">Bump</span>, 64 MSPR at 332.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/THOMAS_KENN_W_AT_1221_96_0406_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_199877.pdf">77 MSPR 224</a>, 230 (1998) (if an employee makes one disclosure in an agency grievance proceeding, and one outside that proceeding, the fact that both disclosures stem from the same set of facts is not inconsistent with the Board's jurisdiction over an IRA appeal), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Ganski v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 86 MSPR 32 (2000); <span class="Italic">Hupka v. DOD</span>, 74 MSPR 406, 409 (1997) ("The exercise of a complaint right does not, however, in and of itself, disqualify an employee from pursuing corrective action under the WPA as well."); <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 73 MSPR 574, 578 (1997) ("When an employee makes a number of related disclosures based upon the same operative facts, some of which are argued to come under 5 USC 2302(b)(8), and others under section 2302(b)(9), those that come under section 2302(b)(8) provide a basis of Board IRA jurisdiction to review allegations of reprisal for whistleblowing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3727"></span>The Federal Circuit explained the distinction between multiple disclosures that create appeal rights under WPA and those that do not, <span class="Italic">Ellison v. MSPB</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1035-37 (Fed. Cir. 1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Spruill</span>...did not address the situation in which an employee makes a number of related disclosures based upon the same operative facts, some of which are argued to come under section 2302(b)(8) and others under section 2302(b)(9). Such is the situation in the instant case. Ellison claims that he made two separate and distinct disclosures, one to the agency IG and the other to agency supervisors through the grievance process. Ellison contends that the former falls within the scope of section 2302(b)(8) and thus provides the necessary predicate for Board jurisdiction under section 1221, irrespective of the fact that it derives from the same events as the nonwhistleblower disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a threshold matter, we agree that where an employee makes one disclosure to supervisors in an agency grievance proceeding and one to the agency IG, the fact that both disclosures stem from the same set of operative facts is not necessarily inconsistent with the Board's jurisdiction over an IRA appeal. Such disclosures might be similar in substance to the extent that they both criticize the agency's selection process, but each might be independent of the other and serve different purposes. The "IG disclosure" might reveal violations of regulations, gross mismanagement, and abuse of authority on the part of the agency in conducting its selection process. On the other hand, the "grievance disclosure" could challenge the selection process as being unfair and inequitable to the employee because the agency considered nonmerit factors in denying him a promotion opportunity. Thus, the same operative facts supporting an employment grievance may also give use to questions of government violations of law or gross mismanagement and waste. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Department of Defense</span>, 52 MSPR 470, 474 (1992) (remand necessary to determine nature of numerous disclosures made by employee for resolution of jurisdictional issue).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the fact that Ellison filed a grievance action through agency procedures in response to the contested personnel action did not in and of itself disqualify him from pursuing corrective action under the WPA as well. Ellison had a right to pursue all courses of action at his disposal, and the law provides remedies for violations of that right. The WPA was enacted for the purpose of protecting federal employees who disclose government illegality, waste, and corruption, 5 USC 1201 note (Supp. III 1991); it was not intended to discourage employees who are subject to prohibited personnel practices from also seeking redress through other authorized means, such as a grievance process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, not every disclosure to the IG pertaining to personnel actions can rise to the level of a section 2302(b)(8) disclosure. An employee does not necessarily make a section 2302(b)(8) disclosure merely by informing the IG of an adverse personnel action and alleging that it evidences mismanagement or the like. This would convert grievances based on section 2302(b)(9) into cases appealable to the Board under the WPA, a result Congress clearly did not intend. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, 978 F.2d at 690-92. The facts underlying a section 2302(b)(9) disclosure can serve as the basis for a section 2302(b)(8) disclosure only if they establish the type of fraud, waste, or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 692.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, under the statutory scheme of the WPA, if the personnel action challenged by the employee is not otherwise directly appealable to the Board, the employee must first seek corrective action from the OSC. 5 USC 1214(a)(3), 1221(a), (b). Only after the OSC has notified the employee that its investigation has been terminated, 5 USC 1214(a)(3)(A)(i), (ii), or if no action has been taken by the OSC within 120 days, 5 USC 1214(a)(3)(B), may the employee seek corrective action from the Board. Not until the employee has exhausted this mandatory procedural route may he or she be entitled to file an IRA appeal under section 1221 to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Knollenberg v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 953 F.2d 623, 625-26 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ellison argues, as he did before the Board, that he complied with the procedural requirements for corrective action and that his complaint alleged that his third nonselection for promotion was in reprisal for a whistleblowing disclosure made to the agency IG, separate and apart from his disclosure made in the course of the agency grievance process. The law, however, is well settled that the mere recitation of a basis for jurisdiction by a party is not sufficient. Rather, substantive details establishing jurisdiction must be alleged in the complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Livingston v. Derwinski</span>, 959 F.2d 224, 225 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Moreover, the test of the sufficiency of an employee's charges of whistleblowing to the OSC is the statement that the employee makes in the complaint requesting corrective action under 5 USC 1214, not the employee's <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> characterization of those statements. <span class="Italic">Ward v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 981 F.2d 521, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OSC construed that statement as alleging that "[Ellison's] most recent non-selection for promotion to a supervisory position [was] in continued reprisal for information [he] disclosed in the course of previous grievances [he] filed in April 1989." Thus, the OSC essentially interpreted the complaint as being tantamount to further pursuit of the claim that Ellison raised during his unsuccessful grievance, not an assertion of reprisal for disclosing illegality or mismanagement at the agency. In light of the language of the complaint and the record before the OSC, we find no error in the OSC's interpretation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ellison claims that during his November 16, 1989 meeting with IG officials, he reported that the selection of Dearl Runyon over Ellison constituted an abuse of authority and would result in a gross waste of government funds. Specifically, Ellison informed them that Ellison was ranked above Runyon on the promotion register and that Runyon was not qualified to hold a supervisory contracting position because he had no previous contract experience and did not hold a Contracting Officer's Warrant. Ellison contends that as a result of these disclosures of gross agency mismanagement the IG ordered an audit of the aggrieved selection process, which ultimately led to the third vacancy announcement. He maintains that he was not selected for that position in reprisal for this whistleblowing to the IG. The Board, however, made no findings regarding these alleged disclosures to the agency IG because Ellison failed to explicitly raise them first with the OSC. He raised them clearly only after his appeal to the Board in a second complaint dated September 25, 1991. That was too late. Thus, we may not consider them here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case illustrates the need for an employee to articulate with reasonable clarity and precision the basis for his request for corrective action under the WPA. [citing <span class="Italic">Ward v. MSPB</span>, discussed <span class="Italic">post</span>] ...</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Heining v. GSA</span>, 61 MSPR 539, 555 (1994), <span class="Italic">reaff'd on reconsideration</span>, <span class="Italic">Heining v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that her submission of a copy of her grievances to the agency's Inspector General did not constitute whistleblowing. As the administrative judge found, the filing of grievances does not constitute whistleblowing under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Fisher v. Department of Defense</span>, 47 MSPR 585, 587-88 (1991). Since the Inspector General presided over the office in which the appellant worked, the administrative judge correctly remarked that submitting a copy of her grievances to him might well have constituted a simple courtesy. The record also does not contain any evidence that the appellant actually asked the Inspector General to conduct an investigation in connection with the allegations contained in her grievances. Finally, as the administrative judge concluded, if the filing of grievances can be defined as whistleblowing merely because a copy of those grievances was filed with the Inspector General, then the distinction that the Board has described between 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) would be rendered meaningless. <span class="Italic">See Fisher</span>, 47 MSPR at 587-88.</p>

Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3383) ("While '[t]he facts underlying a section 2302(b)(9) disclosure can serve as the basis for a section 2302(b)(8) disclosure,' <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1035 (Fed. Cir. 1993), Mr. Garcia's simple notification that he intended to file an EEO complaint based on sexual, racial, and ethnic harassment hardly constituted a set of facts that 'establish the type of fraud, waste, or abuse that the [Whistleblower Protection Act] was intended to reach,' the test established by <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Under Loyd v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 69 MSPR 684, 688-90 (1996), even though a disclosure, e.g., through a grievance procedure, may lack IRA protection, a related disclosure through another medium, e.g., a congressional complaint, may give rise to an actionable IRA appeal if the second disclosure, although related to the first disclosure outside IRA jurisdiction, establishes a protected disclosure within &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), e.g., a violation of law or regulation governing the processing of the grievance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the appellant raised below a nonfrivolous allegation that he made a protected disclosure. In his allegations before the Special Counsel, the appellant stated that, on or about February 25, 1994, information was disclosed to the House of Representatives, Post Office and Civil Service Affairs Subcommittee (House Subcommittee) concerning the agency's mishandling of a grievance he had previously filed. He stated that the grievance concerned the assistance he rendered to Ms. Garcia in her attempt to file a sexual harassment complaint against her supervisor. The appellant further stated that, on or about March 8, 1994, testimony was presented before the House Subcommittee, and the documentation concerning the appellant's grievance was included in the official Congressional record. The appellant contends on review that he did not allege below that the agency retaliated against him for filing a grievance but, rather, that it acted in reprisal against him because of the evidence of the agency's violation of law and regulation that was presented to Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the documents submitted to Congress, the appellant asserted that <span id="Page_3728"></span>the agency failed to resolve his grievance within the proper time frames and that the agency assigned Edward Conroy, "one of the subjects of his grievance," to "decide and handle" it. Mr. Conroy arguably stood to benefit from handling the appellant's grievance because he was likely in a position to exonerate himself and other preferred agency officials named in the grievance, as well as in a position to potentially adversely affect the appellant's rights by his investigatory handling and deciding of the grievance. Thus, the appellant disclosed a possible "abuse of authority" as that term is defined in <span class="Italic">D'Elia v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 60 MSPR 226, 232 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this case is similar to <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 504 (1995), issued after the initial decision in this case. In <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, the administrative judge dismissed the appellant's IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the appellant's disclosure was actually an allegation of unfair labor practice within the jurisdiction of the Federal Labor Relations Authority and was not covered by 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). The Board, however, noted that, in <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1035 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that the fact that an employee files a grievance in response to a contested personnel action does not in itself disqualify him from pursuing corrective action under the WPA based on the same operative facts. The Board then found that the availability of unfair labor practice proceedings did not preclude WPA jurisdiction over whistleblowing based on the same operative facts, provided that the alleged facts underlying the potential unfair labor practice would also constitute violations of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). On the other hand, if the facts disclosed only an unfair labor practice and not any other violation of law, rule, or regulation, or gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, then the disclosure would not be covered by 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and there would be no IRA jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Mitchell</span>, 68 MSPR at 507-10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, the appellant filed an allegation of unfair labor practice, but she also appeared on a radio talk show and disclosed the operative facts of the unfair labor practice on the show. The Board found that her allegation that the agency engaged in unfair labor practice was not covered by 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) but that the alleged abuses of authority she disclosed on the radio talk show were covered. The Board also found that the appellant's allegation that the agency retaliated against her for what she stated on the radio talk show was an allegation of whistleblower reprisal over which the Board had jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Mitchell</span>, 68 MSPR at 510-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no material distinction between this case and <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>. In <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, the appellant filed an allegation of unfair labor practice. She then went on the radio and disclosed to the public the operative facts relating to the unfair labor practice. She alleged that the agency retaliated against her for what she disclosed on the radio. Here, the appellant filed a grievance. Subsequently, in documents submitted to Congress to supplement Ms. Garcia's testimony before the House Subcommittee, he complained about the manner in which the agency handled the grievance, disclosing a possible abuse of authority in that the named official in the grievance was in charge of investigating it. He alleged that the agency retaliated against him for his disclosure to Congress by effecting the 14-day suspension. The grievance and his disclosure to Congress were intertwined, and the subject of his disclosure was a grievance process. Under <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, however, this does not preclude IRA jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, with respect to the first criterion for establishing IRA jurisdiction under <span class="Italic">White</span> and <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, we find that the appellant raised below a nonfrivolous allegation that he made a protected disclosure regarding an abuse of authority. In addition, the appellant made nonfrivolous allegations that he met the second and third criteria for establishing IRA jurisdiction under <span class="Italic">White</span> and <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> because the agency took a personnel action against him, i.e., a suspension, after the effective date of the WPA, and he raised the whistleblower issue before the Special Counsel and exhausted Special Counsel proceedings. <span class="Italic">See White</span>, 63 MSPR at 94; <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, 63 MSPR at 16-17. Therefore, we find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation of IRA jurisdiction entitling him to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Mitchell</span>, 68 MSPR at 512.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 504, 509-11 (1995), applied <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> to allegations of abuse of authority made both in an FLRA unfair labor practice complaint and in a public forum--a radio talk show. The whistleblowing allegations made in the public forum were protected under the WPA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1035 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the court found that, when an employee makes a number of related disclosures based upon the same operative facts, some of which are argued to come under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and some under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), those that come under section 2302(b)(8) provide a basis of Board IRA jurisdiction to review allegations of reprisal for whistleblowing. The court held that the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) was enacted for the purpose of protecting federal employees who disclose government illegality, waste, and corruption, and that "it was not intended to discourage employees who are subject to prohibited personnel practices from also seeking redress through other authorized means...." Thus, the court held that the fact that an employee files a grievance in response to a contested personnel action does not in and of itself disqualify him from pursuing corrective action under the WPA based on the same underlying facts. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court emphasized, however, that an employee who has filed a grievance does not make whistleblowing disclosures merely by disclosing the matter through additional channels and alleging that it evidences a violation of the WPA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Rather, the employee's disclosure must establish the type of "government illegality, waste, and corruption protectible under the WPA...." <span class="Italic">Id. See also Bump v. Department of the Interior</span>, 64 MSPR 326, 332 (1994) (the same facts may serve as the basis for a grievance and for a section 2302(b)(8) disclosure if they regard the type of fraud, waste or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the court's holding in <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> with regard to the grievance procedure, we find that the availability of ULP adjudicative proceedings does not in and of itself preclude WPA jurisdiction over whistleblowing based on the same operative facts that provided the basis of a ULP charge/complaint. In other words, if the alleged facts underlying the ULP charge/complaint also would constitute independent violations of section 2302(b)(8), the employee discloses the facts through additional channels in such a way as to advance his whistleblowing claim, and suffers a personnel action which he alleges is retaliation for his whistleblowing disclosure, he may avail himself of the IRA procedures. <span class="Italic">See Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1035. In contrast, if the facts disclosed only evidenced a ULP and did not evidence any other violation of law, rule, or regulation, or gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, the disclosure is not the type which Congress intended to protect by section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Kelsch v. Department of Labor</span>, 59 MSPR 503, 509 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the Board has previously held that filing an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board, availing oneself of a grievance procedure, and lodging a ULP complaint with the FLRA do not constitute protected disclosures under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), but rather are activities protected from reprisal by 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ruffin v. Department of the Army</span>, 48 MSPR 74, 79 (1991) (a Board appeal); <span class="Italic">Crist v. Department of the Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 35, 38 (1991) (a grievance); <span class="Italic">Coffer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 54, 56-57 (1991) (a ULP charge/complaint). Clearly, the court's holding in <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, and our holding here do not affect these cases. The <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> court noted with approval the holding, in <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 978 F.2d 679 (Fed. Cir. 1992), that the filing of an EEO complaint does not constitute a whistleblowing disclosure, but instead is a section 2302(b)(9) activity. <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> also provides the basis for finding that Board appeals and ULP complaints are not whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court's decision in <span class="Italic">Ellison</span> and our holding in the subject case are consistent with <span class="Italic">Kelsch</span>, 59 MSPR 503, 509. There, the Board found that, although disclosures on a CA-1 form submitted to the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) may be protected under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), an employee's claim of sexual harassment on such form is not a protected disclosure under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) because such a claim is more appropriately resolved under the equal employment opportunity process. In creating an IRA appeal right under section 2302(b)(8), Congress expressed its intent to benefit those employees whose "only route of appeal is to the OSC." S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 32 (1988). A claim of sexual harassment is actionable under Title VII, and as such is not a disclosure under section 2302(b)(8). As the Board found, Congress did not include under section 2302(b)(8) matters prohibited under section 2302(b)(1)(A), i.e., discrimination on the bases listed in Title VII. In <span class="Italic">Kelsch</span>, the operative facts disclosed only a violation of Title VII and not an independent violation of section 2302(b)(8); thus, the disclosure was not protected by section 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant filed a ULP alleging collusion between labor and management. The operative facts out of which the ULP charge grew included allegations that the agency, with the aid of the union, was regularly replacing seasonal employees with term employees without regard to the seasonal employees' rights, including those under the labor management agreement, in order to reduce its workforce. Subsequently, the appellant disclosed the operative facts of the ULP charge/complaint by participation on a radio call-in talk show.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, in accord with <span class="Italic">Kelsch</span>, that the appellant's allegations that the agency engaged in ULPs, violations actionable under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7116, the statutory prohibition against ULPs, even if revealed through channels intended to reveal a violation of section 2302(b)(8), are more appropriately resolved under the ULP charge procedures, which were created by Congress to redress violations of the statutes governing labor-management relations. The appellant's allegation of reprisal for revealing through additional channels the alleged personnel abuses with regard to seasonal employees, however, is an allegation of retaliation for whistleblowing over which the Board may have IRA jurisdiction. To engage in such personnel abuses would be an abuse of authority that <span id="Page_3729"></span>would be actionable under section 2302(b)(8) in the absence of union involvement and the prohibitions of section 7116. Thus, because the appellant disclosed facts which constituted violations of section 2302(b)(8), even though these facts were intertwined with the allegations of ULPs, she is not barred from seeking corrective action under the WPA for alleged retaliation for her whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Expanding on <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, <span class="Italic">Williams v. SSA</span>, AT-1221-13-0239-B-1 (NP 12/9/2014), determined that disclosures to agency management of facts constituting potential unfair labor practices, i.e., statutory violations, were within the ambit of 5 USC 2302(b)(8):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We differ with the administrative judge's conclusion, however, that the appellant's disclosure of facts which could form the basis of an unfair labor practice (ULP) charge cannot also serve as the basis for a protected disclosure of a violation of law, rule, or regulation under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and thus we VACATE this portion of the initial decision. In her remand initial decision, the administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 504 (1995), for the proposition that "allegations of facts which only evidence [a ULP] are not the type of disclosure Congress intended to protect under the Whistleblower Protection Act." Although this is an accurate summary of <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, the Board further explained that "if the alleged facts underlying the ULP charge/complaint <span class="Italic">also</span> would constitute independent violations of section 2302(b)(8), the employee discloses the facts through additional channels in such a way as to advance his whistleblower claim, and suffers a personnel action which he alleges is retaliation for his whistleblowing disclosure, he may avail himself of the IRA procedures." <span class="Italic">See Mitchell</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 504, 509-10 (citing <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1035 (Fed. Cir. 1993)) (emphasis added).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;It is possible that this two-step analysis, of whether the underlying facts of an otherwise nonprotected disclosure of a ULP may nonetheless constitute an independent protected disclosure of a violation of section 2302(b)(8), may now be unnecessary following the enactment of the WPEA. <span class="Italic">See Carney v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 446, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the appellant's disclosure of the facts underlying a potential ULP charge--specifically, that he was denied his right to union representation during a formal discussion with the agency--constitutes a disclosure of an independent violation of a law, rule, or regulation under section 2302(b)(8), and may form the basis of an independent claim of whistleblower reprisal. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Loyd v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 684, 688-89 (1996). Similar to both <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> and <span class="Italic">Loyd</span>, where the employees independently disclosed the underlying facts of ULP charges and alleged that they were retaliated against because they made these disclosures, the record here reflects that the appellant disclosed to both a Regional Commissioner and the OIG that his right to union representation under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114 was not honored during a formal discussion with the agency, and that he was suspended for 14 days shortly after making these disclosures. Consistent with these decisions, we find that the appellant made a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). We further find that the appellant has established that his disclosures were a contributing factor in his 14-day suspension because the deciding official knew about his disclosures and because his 14-day suspension was issued within a short period of time after he made them. <span class="Italic">See Schoenig v. Department of Justice</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 13 (2013)....</p>
