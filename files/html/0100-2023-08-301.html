<p class="Body-Text">Civil service appeals are ordinarily lodged by civil servants or applicants for civil service positions. But if a federal agency exercises sufficient control over a contractor and blocks USERRA reemployment rights of an individual to a position with the contractor, the federal agency may bear liability under USERRA, <span class="Italic">Silva v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SILVA_MICHAEL_J_DC_4324_08_0776_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_444083.pdf">112 MSPR 362</a>, 365-71 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-20, 2009 MSPB 189 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With an exception that does not apply in this case, USERRA's standing requirement is straightforward. USERRA provides, in relevant part, that "<span class="Italic">a person</span> may submit a complaint against a Federal executive agency or the Office of Personnel Management under this subchapter directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board" if "<span class="Italic">that person</span>" has chosen not to seek the assistance of DoL, has sought assistance from DoL and exhausted that process, has chosen not to be represented before the Board by OSC, or OSC has chosen not to represent the person before the Board. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b) (emphasis supplied). Additionally, USERRA provides that OSC "may appear on behalf of, and act as attorney for, <span class="Italic">the person</span>" complaining of a violation of his rights under USERRA and may "initiate an action regarding such complaint before the Merit Systems Protection Board." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(a)(2)(A) (emphasis supplied). The decisions cited by the AJ in finding that an individual must be appointed in the civil service or meet the Title 5 definition of "employee," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a), in order to bring a USERRA claim before the Board are either distinguishable or support a finding that the appellant herein has standing to bring a USERRA appeal.[4] Where, as here, there is specific statutory language delineating who may file a Board appeal under USERRA, we will not look to more general language in other statutes to determine USERRA's standing requirements. <span class="Italic">Cf. Lee v. Department of Justice</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-25 (2005) (the remedy for a USERRA violation is controlled by the specific language of USERRA governing remedies, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c); the general language of the Back Pay Act that is directed toward relief for unspecified "unjustified or unwarranted" personnel actions, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1), does not control the remedy in a USERRA case).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 421 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the court held that a former employee of a government contractor was not an "applicant for employment" <span id="Page_504"></span>within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a). The decisions in <span class="Italic">Bevans v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 900 F.2d 1558, 1561 (Fed. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">Watts v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 814 F.2d 1576, 1580-81 (Fed. Cir. 1987), and <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687, 693 (Fed. Cir. 1986), pre-dated the passage of USERRA and involved eligibility for benefits or service credit under the Civil Service Retirement System, 5 U.S.C. ch. 83. In <span class="Italic">Welshans v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 110<span class="Italic"></span> (2007), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 550 F.3d 1100 (Fed. Cir. 2008), a USERRA appeal, the Board held that postal workers do not meet the general definition of "employee" under Title 5 of the U.S. Code, and that as a result they are not covered by the Title 5 military leave provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323. Finally, in <span class="Italic">Jasper v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 367, 368-69 (1997), and <span class="Italic">Petersen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 227, 230 (1996), both USERRA appeals, the Board mentioned that the appellants had been appointed in the civil service, but it did not state or imply that such an appointment was a jurisdictional prerequisite. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Jasper</span>, the Board held that even though the appellant was a probationer who lacked adverse action appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a) &#x0026; 7512, he was a "person" entitled to file a USERRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 369.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the appellant is "a person" who may bring a USERRA appeal before the Board, or in this instance, may have OSC file and prosecute an appeal on his behalf. The initial decision, which found that the appellant lacks standing to appeal, is REVERSED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Parties against whom a USERRA appeal may be pursued before the Board</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, USERRA provides that a person may submit a complaint to the Board "against a Federal executive agency or the Office of Personnel Management." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b). In a similar vein, USERRA provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the Board determines that a Federal executive agency or the Office of Personnel Management has not complied with the provisions of this chapter relating to the employment or reemployment of a person by the agency, the Board shall enter an order requiring the agency or Office to comply with such provisions and to compensate such person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by such person by reason of such lack of compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These provisions state in plain terms that the Board is empowered to adjudicate a USERRA appeal brought against "a Federal executive agency or the Office of Personnel Management," and likewise, that the Board is empowered to order relief against "a Federal executive agency or the Office of Personnel Management." Moreover, USERRA provides for a right of action in federal court against "a private employer" for violation of a person's rights under USERRA. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4323(a), (b). These latter provisions also set forth the remedies in such an action that a court may award against a "private employer." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4323(d), (e). Based on the plain language of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324, as well as the parallel private-sector enforcement mechanism set forth in section 4323, we conclude that the Board lacks authority to adjudicate a claim against a private employer for violation of an individual's rights under USERRA or to order any relief against a private employer for a USERRA violation. Thus, SPS Consulting is not a party to this appeal and the appellant cannot obtain relief against SPS Consulting in this proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Subject matter</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the foregoing, we hold, as detailed below, that the appellant is entitled to pursue his claim that DHS should be considered his "employer" for purposes of determining his right to reemployment following his active military duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA provides that an "employee" whose absence from a "position of employment is necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services shall be entitled to the reemployment rights and benefits" provided by USERRA if he has given advance notice of such service to his employer, the cumulative absence does not exceed 5 years, and he either reports for employment (in the case of an absence of fewer than 31 days) or requests reemployment after completion of uniformed service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(a), (e). USERRA defines "employee" as "any person employed by an employer." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(3). USERRA defines "employer" as "any person, institution, organization, or other entity that pays salary or wages for work performed or that has control over employment opportunities, including--...(ii) the Federal Government." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(4)(A). The appellant argues that although his nominal employer was SPS Consulting, the agency should also be considered his "employer" under USERRA because of the degree of control that it exercised over his personal employment opportunities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that a federal agency <span class="Italic">could</span> be considered an individual's "employer" under USERRA, even when the individual was not appointed in the civil service but instead was formally employed by a government contractor. In so concluding we are mindful of the principle that USERRA should be broadly construed, and any "interpretive doubt" should be "resolved in the veteran's favor." <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 479 F.3d 830, 846 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 128 S. Ct. 375 (2007); <span class="Italic">see also King v. St. Vincent's Hospital</span>, 502 U.S. 215, 221 n.9 (1991) (USERRA's predecessor, the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act, was broadly interpreted because "provisions for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be construed in the beneficiaries' favor"). If, as the appellant alleges, DHS exercised direct control over SPS Consulting to such an extent that DHS effectively prevented his reemployment, then DHS should be considered to be the appellant's "employer" under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our analysis is consistent with a DoL regulation governing USERRA rights in the private sector. The regulation provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Can one employee be employed in one job by more than one employer?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Yes.&#x2003;Under USERRA, an employer includes not only the person or entity that pays an employee's salary or wages, but also includes a person or entity that has control over his or her employment opportunities, including a person or entity to whom an employer has delegated the performance of employment-related responsibilities. For example, if the employee is a security guard hired by a security company and he or she is assigned to a work site, the employee may report both to the security company and to the site owner. In such an instance, both employers share responsibility for compliance with USERRA. If the security company declines to assign the employee to a job because of a uniformed service obligation (for example, National Guard duties), then the security company could be in violation of the reemployment requirements and the anti-discrimination provisions of USERRA. Similarly, if the employer at the work site causes the employee's removal from the job position because of his or her uniformed service obligations, then the work site employer could be in violation of the reemployment requirements and the anti-discrimination provisions of USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.37. The federal-sector USERRA regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management at 5 C.F.R. Part 353 do not contain a similar provision, but neither do they preclude a conclusion that under some circumstances, a federal executive agency could be treated as the "employer" of an individual who is formally employed by a government contractor. Further, the DoL regulation quoted above is based on the same statutory provision that the appellant relies on herein, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(4), and is consistent with the statutory language.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We emphasize that the government will not automatically be deemed to be the "employer" of all contractor personnel under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(4). An executive agency's decision to award or terminate a contract certainly can <span class="Italic">affect</span> employment opportunities for contractor personnel, but such actions, when taken for budgetary, programmatic, or other reasons having nothing to do with any individual employee of the contractor, would not represent government <span class="Italic">control</span> of employment opportunities for any particular "person" seeking to vindicate rights before the Board under USERRA. USERRA speaks in terms of "control" over employment opportunities. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the facts of this case, the undisputed evidence shows that the appellant gave SPS Consulting advance notice of his impending deployment to active military duty with the U.S. Army Reserve in Iraq. After receiving such notice, SPS Consulting, on the appellant's behalf, notified the agency of the appellant's deployment. The appellant entered active duty on May 13, 2006, served honorably, and was released from active duty on August 27, 2007, more than 180 days but fewer than 5 years later. Within 90 days of his release from active duty, <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(e)(1)(D), the appellant informed SPS Consulting of his intention to return to work and applied for reemployment with SPS Consulting both verbally and in writing, indicating that he would be available to work as of October 1, 2007. Further, within 90 days of the appellant's return from active military duty, SPS Consulting gave the agency notice that the appellant had sought reemployment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What happened after that is less clear. The contract between SPS Consulting and DHS provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Prior to changing [the Financial Manager] to other programs for whatever reason, the contractor shall notify the contracting officer reasonably in advance...and shall submit a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitution.... The contracting officer shall evaluate such requests and promptly notify the contractor whether the proposed substitution has been approved or disapproved. No diversion shall be made by the contractor without the written consent of the contracting officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that, when SPS Consulting notified Payne, the Contracts Administration and Team Lead, that SPS Consulting wanted to return the appellant to the Financial Manager position pursuant to the appellant's reemployment rights under USERRA, Payne responded via email, dated October 10, 2007, that DHS did not have the responsibility to reemploy the appellant. Payne's email stated further, however, that Phillip Davis, the agency manager of the program area in which the <span id="Page_505"></span>appellant had worked prior to his deployment, was "very satisfied" with the performance of Pfeifer, the person who replaced the appellant, and did not want a change of personnel in the Financial Manager position. Payne's email stated further, "if there is a change, [Davis] would cancel the contract."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In conflict with Payne's email is an email dated December 12, 2007, from Davis to Payne. In that message, Davis stated that he found "it totally unacceptable that [Payne] would say that [he] said anything to the effect that [he] would 'cancel the contract'" for removing Pfeifer from the Financial Manager position. Davis stated further that he told Payne that DHS could not "direct [its] contractors when comes [sic] to personnel." He stated that it was SPS Consulting's "call" who would serve under the contract in the Financial Manager position. By letter dated February 5, 2008, Diane E. Cafferty, the Director of Compliance for SPS Consulting, notified DHS of its intent to reemploy the appellant as Financial Manager under its contract with the agency.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;This February 5, 2008 action did not moot the appeal because an individual who qualifies for reemployment and makes a proper request for such is entitled to be reemployed "promptly." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a). As noted above, in September 2007 the appellant requested reemployment effective October 1, 2007.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation that DHS exercised control over his reemployment to such an extent that it should be considered his "employer" under USERRA. We therefore find that the appellant has established jurisdiction under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Groom v. Department of the Army</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (the Board has authority to consider a non-frivolous claim that a federal agency violated an individual's reemployment rights under USERRA). The AJ did not resolve the conflicting evidence regarding the degree of control that the agency exercised over the appellant's reemployment in the Financial Manager position. Further, it is unclear whether the parties understood the importance of resolving this conflict because the AJ did not consider DHS to have been the appellant's employer under USERRA. Under these circumstances, the appeal must be remanded. <span class="Italic">Cf. Machulas v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 11 (2008) (it may be appropriate to remand an appeal when the parties are not put on notice of an important issue).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, the appeal is remanded for further proceedings. We note that in a reemployment appeal, ordinarily the agency bears the burden of proving that it met its obligations under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Clavin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 6 (2005). In the ordinary case, however, there is no dispute over whether the respondent agency in a reemployment appeal was the appellant's "employer" prior to his absence to perform uniformed service. Here there is such a dispute, and as detailed above, whether DHS was the appellant's "employer" is an issue that goes to the Board's subject matter jurisdiction as well as to the merits. Under these circumstances, it is appropriate to place the burden on the appellant to show, by preponderant evidence, that DHS was his "employer." <span class="Italic">Cf. Walley v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 279 F.3d 1010, 1017, 1019-20 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (if a merits issue is also jurisdictional, the burden of proof is properly placed on the appellant; this is so, even in the kind of case where jurisdiction is established by non-frivolous allegations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A joint employer relationship was not established when the agency voiced its dissatisfaction with the appellant, a contractor employee who was then removed from the project but not fired by the contractor (he was paid "bench time" while waiting for the next contractor assignment), <span class="Italic">Estes v. MSPB</span>, 658 Fed. Appx. 1029, 1031-32 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Administrative Judge also found that TIAG could have offered Mr. Estes "'bench time' pay" after Mr. Estes was removed from the agency contract and was waiting for another contract opportunity to arise. Mr. Estes even admitted in his testimony before the Administrative Judge that TIAG paid "bench time" pay to employees not working on a specific contract but waiting to be placed into active service on a contract. The Administrative Judge further found that "[n]othing in the evidence suggests that the agency demanded that TIAG fire the appellant altogether." On appeal, Mr. Estes presents no reason for us to conclude these factual findings and credibility determinations were in error, nor are we able to discern any error from our review of the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Any reliance Mr. Estes may place on the April 4, 2013, meeting in which Army personnel discussed Mr. Estes's performance with his supervisor at TIAG is misplaced. As the Administrative Judge determined, "the agency may voice its dissatisfaction with the performance of a contractor employee without creating a co-employer relationship." <span class="Italic">See also Silva v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., No. DC-4324-08-0776-I-1, 2009 WL 3047237, at *369 (M.S.P.B. Sept. 23, 2009) (finding that "the government will not automatically be deemed to be the 'employer' of all contractor personnel under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(4)" as "USERRA speaks in terms of 'control' over employment opportunities").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that, depending upon the circumstances, an agency could exercise sufficient control over an employee's continued employment status that it would become a coemployer. For example, if an agency knows it is the only entity hiring contractors from a third party company and the agency states that a contractor is no longer welcome on any of its contracts, the agency could be deemed to exercise control over the employee's continued employment status because the third party company would have nowhere else to place the contractor and would therefore have no choice but to fire him. Alternatively, an expression of dissatisfaction by an agency could be so powerful and controlling that it forces the third party company to terminate the employee's status at the company. In this case, however, the Administrative Judge made findings of fact that justify the conclusion that no such level of control was exercised with respect to Mr. Estes. The full record demonstrates that TIAG independently decided to terminate Mr. Estes because (1) it could not place him on another contract that met his skill set and salary, and (2) it felt Mr. Estes did not understand what it meant to be a contractor supporting the government.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Johnson v. DHUD</span>, CH-4324-12-0688-I-1 (NP 8/7/2013) ("Further, the appellant alleged that the agency had sufficient control over the contractor's employment decisions and practices to be considered the 'employer' for purposes of USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Silva</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15, 19. In essence, the appellant alleged that the agency, via its contractor, denied him initial employment based upon his performance of duty in the uniformed services by deliberately using nonpublic methods of hiring in order to avoid providing him and other veterans with public notice of the vacancies, given the likelihood that he would have applied for those positions. <span class="Italic">See Weed</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 323, &#x00B6; 10. Such an allegation is enough to establish jurisdiction under USERRA in this case. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.

According to the administrative judge, the testimony and documentary evidence established that the agency merely provided mortgage insurance to Industrial-Stevens.").</p>
