<p class="noindent">5 USC 7111 provides, in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Exclusive recognition of labor organizations</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;If a petition is filed with the Authority--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;by any person alleging--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(A)&#x2003;in the case of an appropriate unit for which there is no exclusive representative, that 30 percent of the employees in the appropriate unit wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by an exclusive representative, or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(B)&#x2003;in the case of an appropriate unit for which there is an exclusive representative, that 30 percent of the employees in the unit allege that the exclusive representative is no longer the representative of the majority of the employees in the unit; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;by any person seeking clarification of, or an amendment to, a certification then in effect or a matter relating to representation;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the Authority shall investigate the petition, and if it has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, it shall provide an opportunity for a hearing (for which a transcript shall be kept) after a reasonable notice. If the Authority finds on the record of the hearing that a question of representation exists, the Authority shall supervise or conduct an election on the question by secret ballot and shall certify the results thereof. An election under this subsection shall not be conducted in any appropriate unit or in any subdivision thereof within which, in the preceding 12 calendar months, a valid election under this subsection has been held.</p>
<p class="noindent">"Showing of interest" is defined at 5 CFR 2421.16 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Showing of interest</span> means evidence of membership in a labor organization; employees' signed and dated authorization cards or petitions authorizing a labor organization to represent them for purposes of exclusive recognition; allotment of dues forms executed by an employee and the labor organization's authorized official; current dues records; an existing or recently expired agreement; current exclusive recognition or certification; employees' signed and dated petitions or cards indicating that they no longer desire to be represented for the purposes of exclusive recognition by the currently recognized or certified labor organization; employees' signed and dated petitions or cards indicating a desire that an election be held on a proposed consolidation of units; or other evidence approved by the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA regulations provide as to a showing of interest, 5 CFR 2422.9 &#x0026; 2422.10 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2422.9 How is the adequacy of a showing of interest determined?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Adequacy.</span> Adequacy of a showing of interest refers to the percentage of employees in the unit involved as required by &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2422.3(c) and (d) and 2422.8(c)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Regional Director investigation of showing of interest and Decision and Order.</span> The Regional Director will conduct an investigation if deemed appropriate. A Regional Director's determination that the showing of interest is adequate is final and binding and not subject to collateral attack at a representation hearing or on appeal to the Authority. If the Regional Director determines that a showing of interest is inadequate, the Regional Director will issue a Decision and Order dismissing the petition, or denying a request for intervention.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2422.10 How do you challenge the validity of a showing of interest?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Validity.</span> Validity questions are raised by challenges to a showing of interest on grounds other than adequacy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Validity challenge.</span> The Regional Director or any party may challenge the validity of a showing of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">When and where validity challenges may be filed.</span> Your challenges to the validity of a showing of interest must be in writing and filed with the Regional Director or the Hearing Officer before the hearing opens, unless you show good cause for granting an extension. If no hearing is held, you must file challenges to the validity of a showing of interest before action is taken under &#x00A7; 2422.30.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Contents of validity challenges.</span> Your challenges to the validity of a showing of interest must be supported with evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Regional Director investigation and Decision and Order.</span> The Regional Director will conduct an investigation if deemed appropriate. The Regional Director's determination that a showing of interest is valid is final and binding and is not subject to collateral attack or appeal to the Authority. If the Regional Director finds that the showing of interest is not valid, the Regional Director will issue a Decision and Order dismissing the petition or denying the request to intervene.</p>
<p class="noindent">The FLRA <span class="Italic">Representation Proceedings Case Handling Manual</span> addresses timing of a showing of interest:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">18.8 <span class="Italic">Timeliness of submission of a showing of interest</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">18.8.1 <span class="Italic">Petitioner's interest</span>: A showing of interest must be submitted by the petitioner no later than the last day a petition might timely be filed. Thus, if a showing of interest is not submitted with the petition, or if a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest is inadequate, the petitioner must be notified immediately.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Application of this rule was discussed in <span class="Italic">North Carolina Army National Guard</span>, 34 FLRA 377 (1990). In that case, the Authority affirmed that a petition for certification of representative must be received by the appropriate Regional Director during the open period of a contract. The Authority also found that the petitioner must submit with the petition evidence of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest based on the approximate number of employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate. However, the Authority found that in the circumstances of that case, where the petitioner miscalculated the number of employees in the claimed unit, the Regional Director allows the petitioner a reasonable period of time after notice of the deficiency to submit any additional showing of interest it has in its possession. The Authority noted that the showing of interest must be dated and signed before the expiration of the open period, but could be submitted after the contract expired.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Exception</span>: If a cross-petitioner fails to submit an adequate showing of interest filed immediately prior to the opening of a hearing, the crosspetitioner is not permitted to participate in the hearing and the petition is processed separately (CHM 17.9.1 and HOG 23).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under earlier regulations, any objection to a showing of interest was to be filed within 10 days after the initial date that the notice of petition was posted. <span class="Italic">Army Health Care Sys. Support Activity and NFFE Local 28</span>, 16 FLRA 1178, 1179 (1984).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Section 7111(b)(1)...states that the Authority shall investigate a petition filed alleging that "30 percent of the employees in the appropriate unit wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by an exclusive representative."...&#8197;The requirement that a showing of interest be made serves an administrative purpose in helping to avoid unnecessary expenditure of time and funds where there is no reasonable assurance that a genuine representation question exists and prevents the parties from abusing the Authority's processes....&#8197;The question of unit support is conclusively decided by the actual secret ballot election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...A Regional Director's determination of the adequacy of the showing of interest is administrative in nature and is not subject to collateral attack at a unit or representation hearing....&#8197;A challenge to the adequacy of a showing of interest is authorized only under limited circumstances....</p>
<p class="noindent">If the union's showing of interest is deficient, the regional director may allow the union an opportunity to correct the deficiency, <span class="Italic">Defense Commissary Agency, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, Cal. and AFGE Local 1482</span>, 50 FLRA 11, 13-14 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, the Union has not shown that the ARD erred in either rejecting the undated signatures on the authorization petitions or failing to notify the Union of the requirement that such signatures must be dated. Section 2421.16 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations expressly <span id="page_118"></span>requires that authorization petitions submitted to establish a showing of interest must be signed by employees and dated....&#8197;The Authority has previously held that parties dealing with the Federal Government are charged with knowledge of, and are bound by, statutes and lawfully promulgated regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3438 and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Decatur, Alabama</span>, 49 FLRA 1145, 1148-49 (1994). Thus, the Union is charged with knowledge of, and is bound by, the requirement that signatures on authorization petitions must be dated....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find that the ARD did not err in notifying the Union of its insufficient showing of interest, allowing the Union 3 days to augment that showing, and denying the Union's request for an extension of time to cure the deficiency.[3] <span class="Italic">See generally U.S. Department of the Navy</span>, <span class="Italic">Naval Station, Ingleside, Texas</span>, 46 FLRA 1011, 1021, n.3 (1992) (regional office followed standard operating procedure set forth in General Counsel's Representation Case Handling Manual)....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The General Counsel's Representation Case Handling Manual, which was promulgated by the General Counsel to provide guidance to regional directors provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-3"><span class="Italic">Section 205.036</span></p>
<p class="noindent-3">Where the check of petitioner's evidence of interest against the payroll list reveals that the thirty percent (30%) requirement has not been met, the procedures set forth in Section 205.027 should be followed in giving notification of insufficiency.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">N.C. Army Nat'l Guard, Raleigh, N.C. and ACT</span>, 34 FLRA 377, 381-83 (1990), addressed when the 30% showing of interest must be established to fall within the open period at the end of a three-year contract. During the 45-day open period, the union filed a petition for certification of representative. That petition was denied for lack of a sufficient showing of interest. The union subsequently filed an amended petition with the requisite number of authorization cards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When there is a collective bargaining agreement having a term of 3 years or less covering employees in the unit specified in the petition, a petition for certification of representative must be filed with the Authority not more than 105 days and not less than 60 days prior to the expiration date of the agreement. 5 U.S.C. 7111(f)(3)(B). The time period specified...is referred to as the "open period." A petition is filed with the Authority when it is "received by the appropriate Regional Director[.]" 5 C.F.R. 2422.2(e)(4) [now 2422.5(c)]. The petition must state that 30 percent of the employees in the unit for which there is an exclusive representative allege that the exclusive representative is no longer the representative of the majority of the employees in the unit. 5 U.S.C. 7111(b)(1)(B). The petition must be "accompanied by a showing of interest of not less than thirty percent (30%) of the employees in the unit[.]" 5 C.F.R. 2422.2(a)(9) [now 2422.1(a) and 2422.3(c)].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with these statutory and regulatory provisions, a petition for certification of representative must be received by the appropriate Regional Director during the open period. The petition must be accompanied by an adequate showing of interest. When authorization cards are submitted as evidence of a showing of interest, the cards must be signed and dated. 5 C.F.R. 2421.16. It follows, therefore, that...the showing of interest must be signed and dated before the expiration of the open period where, as in the instant case, the actual size and composition of the unit is not in dispute. The purpose of the open period is to allow a fixed period during which the existence of a contract will not act as a bar to the filing of a petition for an election in the unit covered by the contract. Thereafter, to enable the parties to reach a new agreement free from challenge, the final 60 days of the existing contract is an "insulated period" during which the existence of the contract bars petitions for election. This prohibition extends to the seeking of a showing of interest in support of any petition filed. The insulated period provides the parties with a period just before the expiration of the contract during which they can negotiate a new contract free from any disruptive effects of an organizing drive at that time and assures stability in their collective bargaining relationship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also agree that the petitioner must submit with the petition evidence of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest based on the approximate number of employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we disagree that, in order to be sufficient, a full showing of interest must in all circumstances be actually received by the Regional Director during the open period. In circumstances such as those present in the instant case, where the petitioner miscalculates the number of employees in the claimed unit, the Regional Office must allow the petitioner a reasonable period of time after notice of the deficiency to submit any additional showing of interest it may have in its possession. For the reasons already stated, however, that additional showing of interest must have been signed and dated before the expiration of the open period.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a union petitions for a unit that is capable of subdivision, for example, a national unit that could also be organized on a regional or district basis, the appropriateness of the unit based on the description in the petition. If the union desires consideration of the propriety of smaller divisions of the unit described in the petition, the union should amend its petition (or file a separate petition) and the union must supply showings of interest tailored to the smaller units. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv. and U.S. Ranger Alliance</span>, 55 FLRA 311, 315-16 (1999) (discussing NLRB precedent).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., Coast Guard Fin. Ctr., Chesapeake, Va. and AFGE Local 22</span>, 34 FLRA 946, 950 (1990), when an agency's operations are expanding, it is appropriate to require a showing of interest only among those employed at the time the petition is filed. If the showing of interest is for a unit that is being consolidated, it is the size of the consolidated unit, not the prior, smaller unit, that determines the number of people required to evidence their interest in an election, <span class="Italic">DLA and AFGE</span>, 63 FLRA 473, 475 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Local 53 contends that the RD's determination that the showing of interest was insufficient is inconsistent with &#x00A7; 2422.9 of the Authority's Regulations, which refers to "one unit" and not "multi-units." We construe Local 53's contention as an allegation that RD failed to apply established law and committed a prejudicial error by determining that the showing of interest submitted by Local 53 was inadequate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7112(d) of the Statute provides that two or more units in an agency and for which a labor organization is the exclusive representative may be consolidated <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">or</span> <span class="Italic">without</span> <span class="Italic">an</span> <span class="Italic">election</span> into a single larger unit if the Authority considers the larger unit appropriate. The Statute requires that a showing of interest be submitted with a petition indicating that an election is desired to be held on the issue of a proposed consolidated unit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(d); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2421.16. As relevant here, the adequacy of a showing of interest refers to the percentage of employees in "the unit involved" as required by &#x00A7; 2422.3(c). 5 C.F.R.&#x00A7; 2422.9. Specifically, the Authority's Regulations require "a showing of interest of not less than thirty percent (30%) of the employees in the unit involved in the petition[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.3(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "unit involved in the petition" in this case, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 2422.3(c) and &#x00A7; 2322.9, is the proposed consolidated unit. Consistent with the regulations, the RD determined that the showing of interest submitted by Local 53 consisting of the signatures of 21 employee of DAPS was inadequate because it was less than thirty percent of the 310 DAPS employees who would be consolidated. Local 53 has not provided any evidence that the RD erred in making that determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that Local 53 has not demonstrated that RD failed to apply established law and committed a prejudicial error by determining that the showing of interest submitted by Local 53 was inadequate.</p>
<p class="noindent">The bases and procedures for challenging a determination concerning a showing of interest were summarized in <span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU</span>, 38 FLRA 952, 956 n.3 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A Regional Director's determination regarding the adequacy of a showing of interest is administrative in nature. Accordingly, a challenge to the showing of interest is authorized only under limited circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> section 2422.2(f)(2) of the Authority's Rules and Regulations. An application for review of a determination regarding the showing of interest may be filed with the Authority only if a regional director dismisses a petition or denies intervention....&#8197;The RD took neither action in this case. Consequently, the Agency's challenge regarding the validity of the showing of interest is not authorized by our Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The more recent edition of the regulation cited in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> is 5 CFR 2422.10 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">How do you challenge the validity of a showing of interest?</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Validity</span>. Validity questions are raised by challenges to a showing of interest on grounds other than adequacy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Validity challenge</span>. The Regional Director or any party may challenge the validity of a showing of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">When and where validity challenges may be filed</span>. Your challenges to the validity of a showing of interest must be in writing and filed with the Regional Director or the Hearing Officer before the hearing opens, unless you show good cause for granting an extension. If no hearing is held, you must file challenges to the validity of a showing of interest before action is taken under &#x00A7; 2422.30.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Contents of validity challenges</span>. Your challenges to the validity of a showing of interest must be supported with evidence.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">N.C. Army Nat'l Guard, Raleigh, N.C. and ACT</span>, 34 FLRA 377, 383-84 (1990), restated the law. A regional director's determination of the adequacy of the showing of interest is administrative in nature, not subject to collateral attack at a unit or representation hearing. The requirement that a showing of interest be made serves an administrative purpose in helping to avoid unnecessary expenditure of time and funds where there is no reasonable assurance that a genuine representation question exists and prevents the parties from abusing FLRA's processes. If a regional director dismisses a petition based on an insufficient showing of interest, an application for review may be filed with FLRA. A ULP charge, as noted later in this section, provides a means of challenging a showing of interest under limited circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Arkansas ANG and ACT</span>, 71 FLRA 612, 612-13 (2020), declined to stay an election and require further proceedings concerning the adequacy of a showing of interest when problems developed concerning the accuracy of the agency's list of employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 14, 2019, ACT filed a petition with the Atlanta Regional Office seeking to represent a bargaining unit of non-supervisory employees currently represented by LIUNA. The RD determined that ACT's petition provided a sufficient <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest. However, after the Agency provided an initial employee list, the RD determined that ACT's initial showing of interest did not include signatures from at least thirty percent of the eligible employees initially identified by the Agency. ACT then provided additional signatures and the RD determined that the showing of interest was adequate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An election was held on September 4 and 5, 2019. On September 5, 2019, the ballots were counted and ACT received 101 votes, LIUNA received eighty-four votes, and five votes were cast for no union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Six days later, LIUNA filed objections to the election, and, on December 5, 2019, the RD ordered a re-run election. Although the Agency subsequently provided the RD with an updated employee list, LIUNA discovered that some employees were missing from the list. The Agency investigated and determined that some employees had been omitted due to a computer error.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency provided a corrected employee list before a January 31, 2020 meeting, at which the parties discussed the employee list and an election agreement. At this meeting, the parties agreed to the corrected employee list and certain election procedures. However, LIUNA refused to sign the election agreement unless the RD retroactively verified that ACT's showing of interest was adequate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 5, 2020, LIUNA filed a Request for Reconsideration of Adequacy with the RD, contending that the Agency should provide a new list of eligible employees for the pay period ending immediately before the petition was filed. LIUNA further argued that the RD should retroactively verify that ACT's showing of interest was adequate based on the new list, and alleged that the Agency had failed to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.15.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Section 2422.15(c) of the Authority's Regulations states that "[a]ll parties are required to cooperate in every aspect of the representation process. This obligation includes cooperating fully with the Regional Director, submitting all required and requested information, and participating in prehearing conferences and hearings." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.15(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 7, 2020, the RD issued the order that is before us. In the order, the RD rejected LIUNA's assertion that the Agency had failed to comply with &#x00A7; 2422.15 of our Regulations, and concluded that there was no reason to review the showing of interest. Accordingly, the RD ordered that the re-run election be held on March 3 and 4, 2020.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">LIUNA filed an Application for Review of the Regional Director's Order (application) on February 15, 2020.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Authority's Regulations, a RD's determination that a showing of interest is adequate is "final and binding," and is "not subject to collateral attack at a representation hearing or on appeal to the Authority."[4] It is a well-established principle that the showing of interest serves an administrative purpose in helping to determine whether there is sufficient employee interest to warrant the expenditure of time, effort, and funds to conduct an election.[5] Accordingly, a challenge to a showing of interest is authorized only under "limited circumstances."[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.9(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., U.S. Coast Guard Fin. Ctr., Chesapeake, Va</span>., 34 FLRA 946, 949 (1990) (further finding that "[t]he question of union support is conclusively decided by the actual secret ballot election") (citing <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Metro-Truck Body, Inc</span>., 613 F.2d 746, 750 (9th Cir. 1979)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., id</span>. ("If a Regional Director dismisses a petition or denies intervention, an application for review of the determination regarding the adequacy of the showing of interest may be filed with the Authority.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its application, LIUNA argues that the RD erred by finding that the Agency had not violated &#x00A7; 2422.15 of our Regulations when it provided incomplete information regarding the eligible employees in the bargaining unit. As a result of this error, LIUNA contends that the adequacy of ACT's showing of interest is "suspect."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">LIUNA acknowledges that an RD's adequacy determination is not subject to challenge "[u]nder normal circumstances." However, it claims that the Authority should order the RD to revisit the adequacy determination in this case based on the Agency's "admission" that it did not provide complete information to the RD, and because failing to review the RD's determination could allow agencies to disregard their obligation to provide accurate employee lists "as a way to manipulate an election petition's adequacy."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In rejecting LIUNA's claims below, the RD found that the Agency "repeatedly provided lists of employees, attended several meetings, and otherwise cooperated throughout the election process." The RD further found that "[t]here is no evidence that the Agency, intentionally or maliciously, omitted employees from the lists." And he found that, "[o]nce LIUNA identified concerns about missing employees, the Agency investigated, discovered the database error, and provided a corrected list."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of LIUNA's application, we find no grounds upon which to disregard our Regulations and established precedent, which provide that RD determinations regarding the adequacy of a showing of interest are not subject to collateral review on appeal to the Authority. Accordingly, we deny the application.</p>
<p class="noindent">A question concerning the validity of a showing of interest may be raised through a ULP charge, <span class="Italic">Gallup Indian Med. Ctr. and NFFE Local 1749</span>, 46 FLRA 1421, 1429 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...An allegation that unlawful activity has taken place, including activity that may affect the validity of a showing of interest, can always be raised by the filing of a timely unfair labor practice charge. Where no such charge is filed, a party wishing to challenge a showing of interest must file a challenge within the time limits set forth in...our Regulations. However, where such a charge is filed prior to an election involving the same parties, the Regional Director must determine in what manner the charge affects the processing of the petition.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gallup Indian</span> <span class="Italic">Med. Ctr.</span>, a showing of interest was invalid when it was presented by a union that was unlawfully assisted by the employer in the union's organizing efforts.
