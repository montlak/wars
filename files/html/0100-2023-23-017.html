<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-18"><span class="space">a.</span> Prior Law</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The law before <span class="Italic">Delorme</span> was simple in its simplest statement, convoluted in practical application: "[B]efore accepting a settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes, the Board must determine whether the agreement is lawful on its face, the parties freely entered into it, and whether the subject matter of this appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction, that is, whether a law, rule, or regulation grants the Board the authority to decide such a matter." <span class="Italic">Pleshaw v. OPM</span>, 98 MSPR 478, 480 &#x00B6; 4 (2005). Settlements of appeals from typical adverse actions, RIFs, and performance actions are routinely accepted by AJs. Difficulties arose as to settlements in cases involving disputed jurisdiction, most commonly constructive adverse action and Individual Right of Action (whistleblower) appeals. The Board's theory was that if it did not have jurisdiction over the underlying action, it lacked jurisdiction to enforce a settlement of that action. In the Board's view of the world, it obtained jurisdiction over a constructive adverse action, e.g., a forced resignation, when the appellant proved that the resignation was forced. If the appellant proved the merits of the appeal, the Board then has jurisdiction. If one had to establish jurisdiction for the Board to accept a settlement in a constructive adverse action case, the appellant would have to prove a winning case to settle it. Since an appellant does not ordinarily settle a Board case after winning it, the Board's approach had no practical appeal, and the approach had little legal support other than through Board decisions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's approach confused its jurisdiction with proof of a claim within its jurisdiction. The Board clearly has jurisdiction over adverse actions. As long as an appellant sets out a nonfrivolous statement that she has been forced into a resignation, the claim is within the Board's appellate jurisdiction. Whether the appellant can prove the elements of the forced resignation is a determination on the merits. The same is true as to whistleblower cases pursued as Individual Right of Action appeals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Recognizing the barrier it created to accepting settlements in constructive adverse action cases, the Board at first permitted the parties to establish a jurisdictional basis for their settlements through allegations of fact that, if accepted, established jurisdiction. The Board then reverted to a requirement of proof, rather than allegations, of facts establishing jurisdiction. If a settlement was accepted by an AJ for purposes of enforcement, and if the AJ had not determined that the Board had jurisdiction over the underlying action, the Board could vacate the settlement based on a mutual mistake of the parties concerning enforceability of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Adkins v. USPS</span>, 86 MSPR 671, 676 &#x00B6; 9 (2000). If the AJ failed to accept a settlement agreement into the record for lack of jurisdiction, the parties were to be informed of the jurisdictional problem. The Board could correct the situation on PFR by accepting the settlement into the record for enforcement if the evidence was clear that the Board had jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Spidel v. USDA</span>, 113 MSPR 67, 70-71 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 n.1, 2010 MSPB 7 (2010) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Pelatti v. Dept. of Navy,</span> 45 MSPR 33 (1990), upholding the AJ's finding that an agreement could not be accepted for enforcement because the jurisdictional issue was not resolved, the parties knew of the AJ's position and did not object to his treatment of the settlement). The evolution of the Board's analysis is briefly recounted in the decisions that follow.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Shaw v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 586, 588-91, 593-94 (1989) (discussed at some length in Chapter 15, "<a href="0100-2023-22-024.html#sec15-25">Jurisdiction to Accept and Enforce Settlement Providing for Fees or Supporting Fee Motion</a>"), spawned the jurisdictional muddle. Mr. Shaw appealed from his resignation, asserting that it was involuntary because his agency should have permitted its withdrawal. The parties then settled through an agreement calling for Mr. Shaw's reinstatement. The AJ accepted the agreement into the record and dismissed the appeal. Shaw's counsel then received an addendum initial decision awarding counsel fees. The agency challenged the fee award, contending that it was not in the interest of justice. The Board decided that fees should not have been awarded because, even though the appellant had made nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction, proof of jurisdiction was not established. The Board declared, as it sent the case back to the regional office to determine whether jurisdiction existed to support a fee award:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board's jurisdiction is not plenary, but is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by statute or regulation....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although that portion of the statute which states that the Board may award attorney fees does not specify that this authority is limited to cases <span id="Page_4766"></span>over which it has jurisdiction, we find that such a limitation is a necessary concomitant to the cited authorities....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 5 MSPB 289, 5 MSPR 248, 250 (1981), the Board noted the long-established public policy favoring settlement agreements in civil actions, which serve to avoid unnecessary litigation and to encourage fair and speedy resolution of issues. In light of that policy, it determined that it would accept into the record and enforce the terms of a settlement agreement that was lawful on its face and freely reached by the parties.... In none of the cases addressing the issue of settlement, however, did the Board indicate that the public policy favoring settlements could, in some manner, override the Board's statutory authority to act only on those cases over which it has jurisdiction, and we find no such authority today.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find no authority for the Board to settle a case over which it has no jurisdiction, we must also find that there is no basis for an award of attorney fees in settled cases where it is not clear that the Board has jurisdiction over the underlying subject matter....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board concludes that it must ascertain that it has jurisdiction over an appeal before it may award attorney fees in that case. Similarly, because taking a settlement into the record may lead to other proceedings as well as to a fee petition, we find that administrative judges should first settle the matter of jurisdiction before accepting a settlement agreement into the record. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Richardson</span>, 5 MSPR at 250, implies that the only prerequisites to taking an agreement into the record are that it be lawful on its face and freely reached by the parties, we hereby modify it to include a requirement that the administrative judge assure that the subject matter of the appeal is within the scope of the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of the instant case show that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation of an involuntary resignation. For the reasons discussed above, however, since the nonfrivolous allegation of an involuntary resignation did not, in itself, constitute proof that the Board has jurisdiction over the case, the administrative judge should have allowed the supplementation of the record on the threshold issue of jurisdiction before admitting the settlement agreement into the record and dismissing the appeal on that basis....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Aside from requiring proof of jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> created other problems. If the Board did not accept a settlement and the agency breached the unfiled settlement, it could prove difficult or impossible to enforce that settlement in federal court through a mandamus action. It could also be tricky to invoke federal jurisdiction under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to enforce the unfiled settlement in a mixed case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blaney v. United States</span>, 34 F.3d 509 (7th Cir. 1994). At least <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> was not applied retroactively to invalidate final compliance decisions involving prior settlements "in the absence of a showing that the parties' substantive rights have been adversely affected[,]" whatever that phrase meant. <span class="Italic">Allard v. DHHS</span>, 43 MSPR 554, 557 (1990). But if jurisdiction was found in error by the AJ, or if another and conclusive Board decision later resulted in a lack of jurisdiction, the settlement could not be enforced even though it was initially accepted by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Chan v.

<p class="Body-Text">Recognizing the morass created by <span class="Italic">Shaw</span>, <span class="Italic">Caveney v. Office of Admin</span>., 64 MSPR 169, 171-72 (1994), modified the <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> rule to permit the Board to accept a settlement of a constructive adverse action when there was sufficient evidence of record to support a finding of jurisdiction that "but for the settlement would place [the] case in a posture ripe for consideration of the merits." <span class="Italic">Caveney</span>, involving an appeal from an allegedly forced retirement, explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, prior to the scheduled hearing, the parties reached an agreement to settle the matter....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties timely submitted the settlement agreement to the administrative judge to be incorporated into the record. The administrative judge issued an order acknowledging receipt of the settlement agreement, but she declined to incorporate it into the record, stating that the Board lacked authority to enforce the agreement. Citing the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 586, 590-91 (1989), she held that: "Because the jurisdictional issue was not resolved, the settlement agreement is not enforceable by the Board."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Shaw</span>, a case involving allegations of an involuntary resignation, a controversy arose regarding the employee's motion for attorney fees. The initial appeal had been dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement that had been accepted into the record, and that specified that the employee was not precluded from filing a motion for attorney fees. The settlement agreement had been reached after the employee made nonfrivolous allegations of the involuntary nature of her resignation, but before it had been determined whether jurisdiction had been established.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The central holding in <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> is that the Board has authority to award attorney fees only in those cases over which it has jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. Shaw</span>, 39 MSPR at 589. Because jurisdiction had not been established, the Board denied the motion for attorney fees. The Board held that "it must ascertain that it has jurisdiction over an appeal before it may award attorney fees in that case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 593. The Board also noted that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[s]imilarly, because taking a settlement into the record may lead to other proceedings as well as to a fee petition, we find that administrative judges should first settle the matter of jurisdiction before accepting a settlement agreement into the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 593-94. The Board held that the administrative judge should have allowed supplementation of the record on the issue of jurisdiction before accepting the settlement agreement into the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The application of <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> produces a different result in this case because at the time the settlement agreement was reached here, the record had already been supplemented on the issue of jurisdiction. After the Board's determination that a nonfrivolous allegation had been made, and its remand for the taking of additional evidence on the issue, but prior to the settlement, the appellant filed a detailed prehearing submission with 17 exhibits, including a deposition transcript, and summaries from depositions that were pending transcription, from former colleagues and supervisors. The appellant's submission includes evidence that the agency reassigned him to a position that left him virtually idle, making his working conditions intolerable. Based on this submission alone, we find that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding of jurisdiction that, but for the settlement, would place this case in a posture ripe for consideration of the merits. <span class="Italic">Cf. Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 687 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (in a probationer's appeal involving allegations of marital status discrimination a factual showing not shown to be unfounded establishes jurisdiction for consideration of the merits of the claim.)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The result in <span class="Italic">Caveney</span> was based on information in a prehearing submission that was probative but not dispositive of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Joyce v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <span id="Page_4767"></span>74 MSPR 112 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Joyce I</span>), involving a counsel fee petition, arose from what amounted to rescission of a constructive adverse suspension and removal. Reversing the fairly elaborate reasoning that it used in <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> to deprive itself of jurisdiction to entertain a counsel fee petition following a settlement, the Board's bottom line in <span class="Italic">Joyce</span>, 74 MSPR at 115-16 (overruled by <span class="Italic">Joyce v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 83 MSPR 666, 672 &#x00B6; 14 (1999), <span class="Italic">post (Joyce II)</span>), was whether appellant raised nonfrivolous allegations of fact relating to jurisdiction that would otherwise entitle him to a Board hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the issue of jurisdiction was "intertwined" with the merits of an appealable action. <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985). By restoring the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, the agency unilaterally rescinded its action before a jurisdictional determination could be made. The agency has refused to concede in this attorney fee proceeding that the Board would have had jurisdiction over the appeal. We hold, in these specific circumstances, that the Board need not make a substantive finding of jurisdiction in order to find authority to grant the appellant attorney fees. Instead, the Board must only determine whether the appellant has set forth a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of jurisdiction, i.e., whether he has raised nonfrivolous allegations of fact relating to jurisdiction that would otherwise entitle him to a hearing before the Board. In so holding, we overrule our decision in <span class="Italic">Shaw.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant case illustrates the virtues of overruling <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> and avoiding, where possible, the necessity of determining whether the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal that has been dismissed based on a return of the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. We find no persuasive reason for the Board and its administrative judges to build a record and engage in a significant expenditure of analytical resources merely for the purpose of determining whether the agency should be spared the expense of attorney fees expended by the appellant in fighting agency practices or policies that the agency ultimately rescinded or modified to the satisfaction of the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At the instance of OPM, acting through a reconsideration petition, the Board overruled its <span class="Italic">Joyce I</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Joyce v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 83 MSPR 666 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Joyce II</span>) (discussed in Chapter 15 under "<a href="0100-2023-22-024.html#sec15-25">Jurisdiction to Accept and Enforce Settlement Providing for Fees or Supporting Fee Motion</a>"). In <span class="Italic">Joyce II</span>, the Board determined that if the agency controverted the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> jurisdictional showing, the AJ must convene a hearing on the jurisdictional issue, essentially a hearing on the merits, so that jurisdiction could be established to take the collateral action desired by the appellant (assuming jurisdiction was demonstrated), i.e., acceptance of a settlement or consideration of a fee motion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Joyce I</span> and <span class="Italic">Joyce</span> <span class="Italic">II</span>, the Board would occasionally avoid discussion of <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> and simply accept the settlement of a constructive adverse action appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Flores v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 50, 51 (1995) ("We find here that the agreement is lawful on its face, that the parties have freely entered into it, and that the underlying subject matter--the appellant's involuntary retirement--is within the Board's jurisdiction."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Van Ee v. EPA</span>, 69 MSPR 194 (1995) (Table) ("We find here that the agreement is lawful on its face, that the parties freely entered into it, and that the underlying subject matter--corrective action and attorney fees in an individual right of action (IRA) appeal--is within the Board's jurisdiction under 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), 1221(a), and 7701(g)."); <span class="Italic">Cruz v. VA</span>, 49 MSPR 74, 75 (1991) (parties' stipulation of facts establishing adverse action jurisdiction permitted the Board to enforce the settlement). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Cimilluca v. DOD</span>, 77 MSPR 256, 258-59 (1998) (noting that a 1994 initial decision properly declined to retain jurisdiction to enforce a settlement of an alleged involuntary retirement appeal "because the issue of jurisdiction was not resolved").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If it was unclear whether a settlement was accepted for enforcement and if no jurisdictional determination was made by the AJ, <span class="Italic">Noverola v. DHS,</span> DA-0353-09-0484-C-1 (NP 8/25/2011), stated that a jurisdictional determination should be made required if a subsequent compliance proceeding was initiated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant pointed out that the initial decision in the underlying appeal, MSPB Docket No. DA-0353-09-0484-I-1, contained contradictory language as to whether the settlement agreement was being accepted into the record for enforcement purposes. Notwithstanding this error, the law is clear that a settlement agreement cannot be accepted into the record for enforcement absent a finding that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Spidel v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 67, &#x00B6; 6 (2010); <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. Veterans Administration</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 534, 537 (1989). Where, as in this case, the parties indicate that they wish a settlement agreement to be accepted into the record for enforcement, but there is a question whether the appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction, the administrative judge should determine whether the agreement can be enforced by determining whether the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Spidel</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 67, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7. When an appeal has been dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement without making a jurisdictional determination, the appropriate action is to adjudicate the issue of jurisdiction in a later proceeding. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A Board remand for the hearing of a constructive adverse action appeal based on nonfrivolous jurisdictional allegations did not establish jurisdiction sufficient to permit enforcement of a settlement; there were to be jurisdictional findings by the AJ--a problem if no hearing is held and the case is settled and dismissed without the agreement being entered into the record, <span class="Italic">Holcomb v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, AT-0752-13-0575-C-1 (NP 9/20/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has the authority to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement that has been entered into the record. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kowalczyk v. Department of the Army</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 616, 623 (1990). However, it is well settled that the Board does not have the authority to enforce a settlement agreement that was not entered into the Board's record for enforcement purposes. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lopez v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 461, 463 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find unavailing the appellant's argument on review that the Board's remand order found jurisdiction over her appeal. The Board did not make a jurisdictional finding; but rather, found that the appellant raised nonfrivolous allegations of Board jurisdiction entitling her to a jurisdictional hearing. Because the parties agreed to postpone the hearing and, instead, settled the appeal, the administrative judge did not make a jurisdictional finding on remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant, who is represented by the same counsel as in the initial proceedings, does not contend that the parties intended for the settlement agreement to be entered into the record for enforcement. Nor does she dispute that the administrative judge informed the parties that the settlement agreement would not be entered into the record for enforcement. The appellant also did not file a petition for review challenging the remand initial decision's dismissal of the appeal as settled without entering the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, when, as here, the parties elected to settle an appeal without entering the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes, the Board lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate a petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Barker v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 6 (2006) (finding that the Board lacked jurisdiction to entertain a petition for enforcement when the parties did not object to the appeal being dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement that was not entered into the record); <span class="Italic">Lopez</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 462, 464 (finding that the Board lacked the authority to adjudicate a petition for enforcement when the parties agreed to settle the appeal without incorporating the agreement into the record for enforcement purposes); <span class="Italic">Pelatti v. Department of the Navy</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 33, 36 (1990) (finding that the Board lacked the authority to enforce a settlement agreement that was not made a part of the record).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ accepted a settlement and compliance proceedings were initiated, the Board could decline to remand for a jurisdictional determination that should have been made if the Board decided that the agency complied with the agreement, because dismissal of the petition was appropriate whether dismissal was based on the merits or on a jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Howe v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 99, 103 (1991) (Chairman Levinson, dissenting from the majority opinion, argued that the jurisdictional issue should have been treated first).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Joyce</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, did not disturb the basic principle that the appellant has the burden of proof to establish jurisdiction if it is not otherwise clear from the nature of the case. <span class="Italic">Hendricks v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 613, 615 (1989) (no showing that a probationer's appeal had been properly placed within the Board's jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Plater v. DOD</span>, 58 MSPR 29, 32 (1993) (Board could not accept a settlement of a probationer's appeal because the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that his termination resulted either from discrimination based upon marital status or partisan political reasons, or from conditions arising before his appointment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Notwithstanding <span class="Italic">Joyce,</span> <span class="Italic">Caveney</span> provided a basis for the Board's acceptance of a settlement in an appeal not clearly within the Board's traditional jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Barton v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 74 MSPR 236, 239 (1997), involving a constructive adverse action appeal, the parties settled on the factual stipulation that the appellant did not voluntarily resign. <span class="Italic">Barton</span> determined the agreement was enforceable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 586, 593-94 (1989), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds, Joyce v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 112 (1997), an administrative judge should settle the matter of jurisdiction before accepting a settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes. Here, the threshold issue is whether the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal underlying this enforcement action. We find that it does.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Caveney v. Office of Administration</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 169, 171-72 (1994), the Board remanded the appeal to the regional office for a jurisdictional hearing, finding that the appellant had made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 170, 172. On remand, the parties reached a settlement agreement prior to the scheduled hearing but after they submitted documentary evidence concerning the threshold jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 171. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal as settled but declined to enter the settlement agreement into the record, finding that "'Because the jurisdictional issue was not resolved, the settlement <span id="Page_4768"></span>agreement is not enforceable by the Board.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board found that the appellant's documentary evidence was sufficient to support a finding of jurisdiction that, but for the settlement, would place the appeal in a posture ripe for consideration of the merits. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 172. After determining that the settlement agreement was lawful on its face and freely entered into by the parties, the Board entered the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes, specifically finding that the Board had jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the agency's stipulation of fact that the appellant did not voluntarily resign is sufficient evidence to support a finding of jurisdiction that, absent reaching settlement, would place this case in a posture ripe for consideration of the merits. <span class="Italic">Caveney</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 172. Therefore, the administrative judge properly entered the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if it was clear from the nature of the case, the AJ was to affirmatively determine jurisdiction before accepting a settlement. <span class="Italic">Kowalczyk v. Dept. of Army</span>, 44 MSPR 616, 622-23 (1990). If the parties settled but the appeal was not within the Board's jurisdiction, the AJ dismissed the case as settled but declined to accept the agreement into the record for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 48 MSPR 86, 91 (1991) (appeal involved an OWCP determination). If the parties desired the settlement to be entered in the record and there was a jurisdictional issue, the parties could place a provision in the settlement stating that the agreement depended upon its acceptance into the record for purposes of enforcement. If the agreement was not accepted, the appeal could not be dismissed as settled, for the effectiveness of the settlement depended on its enforceability. The case would then continue through litigation. If the parties to a settlement agreement made clear to the AJ that they did not desire the agreement to be entered into the record for purposes of enforcement, the AJ need not determine whether the Board had jurisdiction over the appeal and the appeal could then be dismissed pursuant to the agreement. The AJ could not, however, dismiss the appeal without documenting for the record whether the parties agreed that the agreement was to be enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">Sitas v. VA</span>, 41 MSPR 214, 217 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The problems of the settlement agreement accepted by the AJ for purposes of enforcement when there was a jurisdictional issue that was not resolved by the AJ were reflected in an enforcement proceeding involving a settlement that followed an appeal from a coerced resignation appeal, <span class="Italic">Potter v. VA</span>, 111 MSPR 374, 379-80 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 2009 MSPB 92 (2009), leading to the settlement being set aside, and an appeal being reinstated, because of a mutual mistake of law concerning the Board's jurisdiction to accept the settlement for enforcement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we decline to find the settlement agreement invalid on the basis of coercion or duress, we REOPEN this appeal and find the agreement invalid on the basis of a mutual mistake of law. A settlement agreement must be set aside if it is tainted with invalidity by a mutual mistake of law under which both parties acted. <span class="Italic">E.g., Stipp v. Department of the Army</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 415, 418-19 (1994) (setting aside settlement agreement due to mutual mistake as to lawfulness of material provision). In this case, the parties settled under the erroneous impression that the settlement agreement would be entered into the record for enforcement by the Board, a mutual mistake of law that goes to the heart of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Adkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 9 (2000). An administrative judge may not accept a settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes unless she has first made a determination that the Board has jurisdiction over the underlying action. <span class="Italic">See Cimilluca v. Department of Defense</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 256, 258 (1998). Because the administrative judge here never made that determination, in that she failed to make the required finding that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's alleged involuntary resignation, the settlement agreement could not properly be entered into the record for enforcement purposes. <span class="Italic">See Adkins</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 10. Nevertheless, entering the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes was an express term of the settlement agreement. Allowing the parties to include this term in the settlement agreement was clear error, requiring the Board to SET ASIDE the settlement agreement and VACATE the initial decision<span class="Italic">. See Adkins</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Stipp</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 418, 420.</p>

If she determines that the appellant has established board jurisdiction over the matter at issue, she shall adjudicate the appeal on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considers timeliness of an appeal as a jurisdictional prerequisite to the case. But a timeliness problem can be waived or excused.

<p class="Body-Text">There were stratagems to entice an AJ to accept a settlement in the record for purposes of enforcement even if jurisdiction was disputed. The parties could carefully stipulate essential jurisdictional facts for purposes of settlement only. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barton v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 74 MSPR 236, 239-40 (1997) (agency's stipulation in the settlement that the appellant did not voluntarily resign was sufficient evidence to support a finding of jurisdiction allowing acceptance of the settlement agreement for enforcement), <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Cruz v. VA</span>, 49 MSPR 74, 75 (1991) (parties' stipulation of the facts establishing adverse action jurisdiction permitted the Board to enforce the settlement); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Trujillo</span>, 8 MSPR 665, 666 (1981) (a "recommendation by the Chief Administrative Law Judge that the Board grant the Joint Motion for Acceptance of Settlement Agreement, based on a Stipulation of Facts entered into by the parties for purposes of settlement only"). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Mas v. Dept. of Army</span>, 46 MSPR 46, 47-48 (1990) (jurisdiction over a settlement resulting in the employee's appeal from an allegedly involuntary action could not be conferred by the parties' stipulation to the Board's jurisdiction). If the parties settled a case based on a stipulation concerning the facts supporting jurisdiction for the purpose of settlement only, and if that procedure was followed to secure Board acceptance and enforcement of the settlement, the settlement should recite that it would be effective only if it were accepted by the Board for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a settlement was to be accepted on the basis of a jurisdictional stipulation of facts, the stipulation was to be specific and not conclusory, according to <span class="Italic">Heath v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HEATH_STEVEN_E_PH_0752_07_0184_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_301977.pdf">107 MSPR 366</a>, 370-71 &#x00B6; 6, 2007 MSPB 286 (2007) (determining the Board lacked jurisdiction of the appeal on the record before it and remanding the case to provide the parties an opportunity to litigate the underlying alleged constructive suspension or to again attempt to construct a settlement agreement):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit has held that, in constructive adverse action appeals, non-frivolous allegations do not establish jurisdiction; rather, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that the action was involuntary to establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). The parties here attempted to establish Board jurisdiction by stating in the settlement agreement that, "[f]or settlement purposes, the Postal Service and Appellant stipulate that the M.S.P.B. has jurisdiction over this appeal." Parties may stipulate to facts, but the ultimate question of jurisdiction is a legal conclusion not subject to stipulation. <span class="Italic">King v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6; 16 n.2 (2007); <span class="Italic">Granger v. Department of Justice</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 487, 490 (1996), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Hamlett v. Department of Justice</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 674 (2002); <span class="Italic">Mas v. Department of the Army</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 46, 47-48 (1990). While in constructive adverse actions, such as this, subject matter jurisdiction and the merits of the appeal are intertwined, <span class="Italic">see Lloyd v. Small Business Administration</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 24, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 110 Fed. Appx. 127 (Fed. Cir. 2004), a stipulation involving such a mixed question of fact and law is not binding on the Board, <span class="Italic">Ludlum v. Department of Justice</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6; 27 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 278 F.3d 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The apparently conditional stipulation in the settlement agreement lacks any facts concerning the alleged constructive suspension and so, alone, it is insufficient to establish Board jurisdiction by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6; 16 n.2 (stipulation that "[t]he appellant has engaged in whistle blowing [sic] activity on numerous occasions" was too vague to prove Board jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Granger</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 490 (statement that "it now appears that [the appellant] had in fact been appointed to a permanent position" was not sufficiently unambiguous to establish jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Mas</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 47-48 (finding jurisdiction was improper where it was based solely upon the parties' stipulation that "for purposes of the agreement, the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal"). Absent any further stipulation of facts that might establish jurisdiction, we must look elsewhere in the record for evidence of Board jurisdiction.</p>
