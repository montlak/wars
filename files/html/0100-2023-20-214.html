<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board has no formula to assess the strength of the motive of an agency official to take reprisal against a whistleblower, <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 113 MSPR 73, 82-85 &#x00B6; 22-29, 2010 MSPB 8 (2010), considered whether: officials accused of reprisal were named in the whistleblowing disclosure; agency officials properly investigated relevant facts and circumstances underlying the action taken against the appellant; responsible agency officials were linked to the wrongdoing alleged in the disclosures; the disclosures reflected poorly upon them; officials were aware of the particulars of the disclosures; the official or officials most heavily involved in the action had a strong motive to retaliate against the appellant.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Knowles v. VA</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1987.Opinion.1-10-2020.pdf">796 Fed. Appx. 1026</a>, 1032 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP) ("As to the second Carr factor, the Board reasonably found no evidence that the proposing official or the deciding official suffered negative consequences as a result of Ms. Knowles's protected disclosure nor other evidence suggesting the disclosure motivated their decisions."); <span class="Italic">Ginsberg v. VA</span>, AT-1221-21-0116-W-1 (NP 4/15/2022) ("Further, although certain agency <span id="Page_4014"></span>officials did have some motive to retaliate, the appellant's protected disclosures and protected activity did not lead to any negative consequences for the agency and did not implicate any of the officials involved in the personnel actions. Further, the record establishes that those officials acted on the basis of the policy and not retaliatory animus."); <span class="Italic">Easterbrook v. DOJ</span>, 85 MSPR 60, 70-71 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-19 (2000) (safety manager whose program was inspected as result of appellant's disclosures did not have a strong motive to retaliate when the inspection did not reveal any problems or concerns; the fact that the appellant exhausted leave balances was strong evidence of the legitimacy of the agency decision to place appellant on LWOP); <span class="Italic">Rychen v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 179, 184-85 (1991) (although disclosures were contributing factors to a suspension, clear and convincing evidence was produced of the appellant's misuse of government equipment, of his prior counseling for disruptive and unprofessional conduct, and that appellant's superiors were neither harmed nor disturbed by appellant's disclosures of minor discrepancies to the IG); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20161202112">842 F.3d 1252</a> (Fed. Cir. 2016) (some motive to retaliate by a manager who reassigned or detailed appellant with the possible interest in maintaining the appearance of orderliness in his facility's operations); <span class="Italic">Carvalho v. DOJ</span>, SF-1221-15-0208-W-2 (NP 1/10/2023) (considering performance record of the appellant pre-PIP to assess the apparent assertion that the appellant's performance was acceptable prior to the disclosure claimed to be protected); <span class="Italic">Hood v. USDA</span>, 96 MSPR 438, 446-47 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18 (2004) (examining, as to a charge that administrative leave requested by the appellant was denied because of whistleblowing reprisal, agency regulations governing administrative leave and LWOP, motivation of the officials who made the decisions and their efforts to recognize and responsibly deal with the appellant's situation). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-20-208.html#sec13-202">Agency's Clear and Convincing Evidence; <span class="Italic">Carr</span> Factors</a>."]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge failed to recognize Board precedent establishing that a supervisor may have a motive to retaliate based on disclosures that their subordinates have engaged in wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Compare Runstrom v.

Moreover, in assessing the appropriate penalty, they considered the appellant's prior discipline--namely, a January 29, 2015 admonishment from the appellant's supervisor. Therefore, we find that the appellant's supervisor, who had a very strong motive to retaliate against her, influenced the agency's action. There also is ample evidence to find that some of the appellant's disclosures reflected poorly on the agency as a whole, as they alleged, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the agency lost patient information and that a supervisor engaged in improper financial transactions with a patient. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v.

The administrative judge concluded that, given the significant public scrutiny that the agency has been under, it was plausible that the medical center director would be frustrated that a senior-level employee, such as the appellant, would involve the IG without first notifying her."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Butler v.

Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CHAMBERS_TERESA_C_DC_1221_04_0616_M_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_566514.pdf">116 MSPR 17</a>, 34, 49, 55 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 30, 58, 69, 2011 MSPB 7 (2011), considered several factors in the reprisal analysis, including the depth of the investigation by the agency into facts leading to charges against the appellant and an assessment of degree of sensitivity of agency officials to the appellant's disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When examining the strength of the agency's evidence, the Board will look at the evidence the agency had before it when it took the alleged retaliatory action. <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 317, 326 (1997). If the agency fails to investigate a charge sufficiently before bringing an action, such a failure might indicate an improper motive. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Carr</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 313, 335 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 185 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1999). However, if relevant facts are developed on appeal to the Board that the agency had no prior reason to know, the Board will not find that such facts undercut the agency's otherwise sufficiently clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of the action, its decision would have been the same absent the whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It behooves an agency, when faced with the "clear and convincing evidence" standard, to fully explain all of its potentially questionable actions to meet that burden. <span class="Italic">Cosgrove v. Department of the Navy</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 618, 625-26 (1993); <span class="Italic">see also Schnell v. Department of the Army</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-24 (2010) (general statements by agency officials that they did not retaliate insufficient to establish clear and convincing evidence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the factors to consider in ruling on whether the agency met its burden of proof is the strength of any retaliatory motive on the part of the officials who were involved in the decision in question. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1323-24. Because direct evidence of a retaliatory motive is rare, petitioners may rely on circumstantial evidence giving rise to an inference of impermissible intent. <span class="Italic">See Fellhoelter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 568 F.3d 965, 971 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 327 (relying on circumstantial evidence to find a strong motive to retaliate). A proposing official's strong motive to retaliate may be imputed to a deciding official. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 610, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-20 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Any argument that Mr. Murphy and Mr. Hoffman were not implicated in or harmed by the appellant's protected disclosures, or did not have a personal motive to retaliate, ignores the fact that Mr. Murphy was the National Park Service Deputy Director directly responsible for the Park Police, and Mr. Hoffman was a high-level political appointee in the Department of the Interior. The appellant's disclosures clearly reflected on both of them as representatives of the general institutional interests of the agency by addressing the inability of the USPP to effectively perform its mission to protect the public and the failure of the administration to seek sufficient funding for it to do so. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1322-23 (finding motive to retaliate based on criticisms of the management of the office for which the acting official had responsibility). In addition, as set forth above, the appellant's disclosures appeared to indirectly pose a threat to the funding for the USPP and the National Park Service, an issue that we find caused concern for Mr. Murphy and Mr. Hoffman.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smith v. GSA</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-1604.Opinion.7-19-2019.pdf">930 F.3d 1359</a>, 1366-67 (Fed. Cir. 2019), remanded to require further analysis of retaliatory animus:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board further erred by failing to consider <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors 2 and 3 when analyzing whether the agency clearly and convincingly proved that it would have removed Mr. Smith notwithstanding his whistleblowing. Though we have explained that <span class="Italic">Carr</span> imposes no affirmative burden on the agency to produce evidence for each of the three factors, <span class="Italic">see Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1374, the Board cannot ignore record evidence relevant to the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate or the treatment of similar employees. Rather, the Board must "provide an indepth review and full discussion of the facts to explain its reasoning." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1368. This is especially true in a case such as this one, where the record contains ample evidence relevant to these factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board should have considered the evidence relevant to the strength of the agency's motive to retaliate. Mr. Smith made a number of disclosures, most of which the Board failed to address. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., J.A. 818-19 (asserting region was "$47 million behind" in billing in April 2012), 822-956 (providing 134 pages detailing management failures in March 2014), 978-1039 (arguing agency should "[r]eview the consistency in which all regions have applied...national policies and procedures" in July 2014), 1943-44 (describing "the road to ineffective management" in November 2014), 1160-61 (requesting workload review in January 2016), 1988-95 (asserting need for workload reform in February 2016). The agency introduced evidence that it had legitimate concerns regarding the accuracy and tone of these emails, which may cut against a finding of motive. But it is also true that management repeatedly threatened Mr. Smith with discipline if he continued to disclose perceived mismanagement outside of his immediate reporting chain. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 961 ("[A]ny communication...to managers outside of the [group] must be approved by me <span class="Italic">before</span> doing so. Please note that failure to comply with these instructions may result in disciplinary action."). And though Mr. Smith's work evaluations had been generally positive prior to his whistleblowing, his managers in fact suspended him and then placed him on a performance plan because of his communications and disclosures. Further, the record suggests that agency managers were unhappy with Mr. Smith and were embarrassed by his whistleblowing. In response to one of Mr. Smith's disclosures, the deciding official replied to her colleagues:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4015"></span>Oh my gosh! So, what is the status of the action with HR? We need to take action immediately! This is absolutely unacceptable.... I'm embarrassed that he is representing [the group].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In another email, Mr. Augustus "urge[d] [Mr. Smith]...to avoid deviating from or distorting verifiable facts in an effort to advance your subjective motives." The Board erred by failing to address this evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Strong motivation by supervisors to retaliate was discounted in <span class="Italic">Carmichael v. VA</span>, DC-1221-15-0840-W-1 (NP 11/9/2022), when the supervisors were receptive to the appellant's communications:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant next argues that his first-line supervisor should not have had the authority to terminate him because she was the subject of his disclosures. We disagree, as those decisions are within an agency's discretion. However, the Board will consider whether an official was the subject of the appellant's disclosures in determining the strength of an agency official's motive to retaliate. <span class="Italic">See Herman v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 642, &#x00B6; 16 (2013). Here, the administrative judge found that the appellant's first-line supervisor was the subject of only one of the appellant's disclosures, which the administrative judge found was not protected. The administrative judge also found that the supervisor was receptive to his criticism about other issues. For instance, she directed that the IV Room Technician be retrained regarding rules in the IV room after the appellant complained about her noncompliance and also included him on a working group about concerns in the IV room. Thus, we find that she was receptive to at least some of the appellant's comments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered that the appellant's second-line supervisor received disclosures from him, which related to standards that the agency was required to meet. However, there is no basis for finding that these emails caused a strong motive to retaliate. Further, we defer to the administrative judge's conclusion that the Chief of Pharmacy had little motive to retaliate because she testified credibly that she welcomed disclosures and that they provided a means of learning about problems. <span class="Italic">See Purifoy v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 838 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2016).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further consider that the officials taking the personnel action against the appellant did not suffer ramifications as a result of his disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Runstrom v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 169, &#x00B6; 17 (2016). We have found, however, that an appellant's criticisms, which reflect negatively on employees in their capacities as managers, are sufficient to establish retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 285, &#x00B6; 33 (2013); <span class="Italic">see also Whitmore v. Department of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Nonetheless, weighing all evidence, including the testimony of the appellant's first-line supervisor, his second-line supervisor, the Chief of Pharmacy, and the Human Resources Officer, we conclude that the agency did not have a strong motive to retaliate against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Motivation was discounted in <span class="Italic">Mikhaylov v. DHS</span>, ___F.4th___ (4th Cir. 2023), the court following the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> analysis and considering the independent character of the investigation culminating in the challenged disciplinary action and the reduction by the deciding official in the severity of the action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As the administrative judge observed, it was Jaspal's complaint that started the disciplinary ball rolling, not any action by Mikhaylov's supervisors. The disciplinary panel was composed of independent managers who were not part of Mikhaylov's chain of command and had no involvement in the actions outlined in Mikhaylov's protected disclosures. The disciplinary panel member who signed the suspension proposal testified that Mikhaylov's disclosures were not discussed during the panel deliberations. In addition, as previously discussed, the Deciding Official was also outside Mikhaylov's chain of command with no involvement in the protected disclosures, and the Deciding Official testified that he gave no consideration to the protected disclosures when reviewing Mikhaylov's case and deciding the appropriate punishment. When concluding that the officials involved in the personnel action had little reason to retaliate against Mikhaylov, the administrative judge explicitly credited the testimony of the disciplinary panel and the Deciding Official. The administrative judge also noted that the "greatly mitigated penalty [imposed by the Deciding Official] suggests there was no retaliatory motive." Again, our standard of review does not permit us to reject the administrative judge's finding, which rested on significant evidence in the record and the judge's own determinations of witness credibility.</p>
