<p class="Body-Text">An employee who is retaliated against for having filed an appeal with the Board is not returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> when the employee is not where she would have been had the agency not taken the action<span class="Italic">. Williams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 79 MSPR 364, 367 (1998); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ciulla v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 111, 114 n.3 (1989) (allegation of reprisal is cognizable in an enforcement proceeding because an employee who is being retaliated against has not been returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante).</span> If an appellant believes that action subsequent to cancelation of an adverse personnel action constitutes reprisal for the exercise of an appeal right, the employee may petition to the Board for compliance to stop harassing tactics that might not be independently appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Meier v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MEIER_SE075209007_OPINION_AND_ORDER_252890.pdf">3 MSPR 247</a>, 247, 3 MSPB 341 (1980); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Burwell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 78 MSPR 645, 648 (1998) (noting the absence of Board jurisdiction over allegations of harassment on the job without an otherwise appealable action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Anderson v. USDA</span>, 21 MSPR 468, 470 (1984), observed that the Board's enforcement jurisdiction exceeds its appellate jurisdiction. If an agency commits a prohibited personnel practice by an action not directly appealable to the Board, the Board lacks jurisdiction. However, if an appealed action within the Board's jurisdiction results in a Board order directing the agency to take action, and the agency in reprisal for the use of Board appeals procedures then commits a prohibited personnel practice that alone would be outside the Board's jurisdiction, the Board may remedy the reprisal as part of its enforcement authority. The Board remanded <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> for consideration of reprisal allegations concerning an unduly strict performance appraisal, failure of the agency to pay for sick leave legitimately taken, deprivation of training, and restriction of leave. If the appellant alleges that he was not promoted because of reprisal, the Board will examine the claim to determine if reprisal was a factor and, if so, whether the agency can prove that it would not have promoted him to the position irrespective of considerations of reprisal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Noble v. DOJ</span>, 68 MSPR 524, 528 (1995) (remanding for AJ to consider, during enforcement proceedings, the allegation that agency took reprisal against the appellant for exercising successful Board appeal right by proposing his removal once he returned to agency as a result of Board order canceling an earlier removal action); <span class="Italic">Rickels v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 42 MSPR 596, 603 (1989) ("With regard to the appellant's reprisal allegation...the Board has authority to examine an employee's retaliation claim in a compliance case.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reiterated in <span class="Italic">Gaydon v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 276, 279 &#x0026; n.* (1988), that it has jurisdiction over reprisal allegations, and that the allegations are properly raised in an enforcement proceeding. "An employee who is being retaliated <span id="Page_4991"></span>against for having filed an appeal with the Board has not been returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> because the employee is not where he would have been if the agency had not taken the action." A "limited hearing" may be appropriate for taking evidence if the allegations of reprisal are not frivolous. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jimenez v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 520, 525 (1993) (AJ should have analyzed in a compliance decision the appellant's complaints that following a Board order returning him to work, agency gave him inappropriate warnings, failed to follow proper leave procedures, and harassed him in other ways).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unsubstantiated and conclusory allegations of harassment or retaliation do not make out a compliance issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Singletary v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 76, 80 (1998). The allegation of reprisal or harassment should be specific. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 235, 242 (1997) ("We reject the appellant's vague, <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> claim that he has been subjected to ongoing 'harassment,' as well as his apparent request that the agency official responsible for compliance be sanctioned."); <span class="Italic">Reid v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 105, 108 n.4 (1995) ("The appellant has also offered generalized allegations of harassment and reprisal with assertions that the agency's noncompliance with the Board's decisions demonstrated harassing and retaliatory conduct.... The appellant has failed to set forth any clear basis upon which we can determine that he has suffered harassment or retaliation because of his involvement in this appeal. The allegations were raised in conclusory statements which were uncorroborated, unsubstantiated and offered without any supporting argument or evidence.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board distinguished threats of reprisal from acts of reprisal and clarified burdens of proof, <span class="Italic">Baughman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 45 MSPR 580, 587-88 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has authority to examine an employee's retaliation claims in a compliance case. <span class="Italic">Gaydon v. United States Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 276, 279 (1988). An employee who is being retaliated against for having filed an appeal with the Board has not been returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> because he is not where he would have been if the agency had not taken the action.... In order to prevail on a contention of illegal retaliation, an appellant has the burden of showing that: (1) He engaged in protected activity; (2) the accused official knew of the protected activity; (3) the adverse action under review could, under the circumstances, have been retaliation; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rockwell v. Department of Commerce</span>, 39 MSPR 217, 222 (1988)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant contends that his supervisor threatened him with retaliation if he "continued to insist that the 'i's' be dotted and the 't's' crossed on the settlement agreement...." He also contends that another employee harassed him with regard to the settlement and that a third employee may have attempted to entrap him in misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has asserted that he has been threatened with reprisal, but he has not shown that the agency has actually engaged in reprisal. He has not met the criteria for establishing a claim of illegal retaliation because he has not established that the adverse action under review in this case could have been retaliation. Therefore, the administrative judge properly determined that the appellant failed to show that the agency violated the settlement agreement in this regard or that a hearing should be held on this matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allowing for the possibility of a separate IRA case, if the necessary preconditions to that appeal are met, the Board noted that its authority to consider reprisal allegations in a compliance proceeding are limited to determining whether the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> was restored, <span class="Italic">Fuller v. VA</span>, PH-0432-12-0006-C-5 (NP 8/9/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleged that, following the September 2012 final decision in the removal appeal, the agency retaliated against her from 2013 to 2016 for filing her Board appeal and other protected activity. The administrative judge cited to <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 733, and <span class="Italic">Gaydon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 276, 278-79 (1988), for the following proposition: an employee who is being retaliated against for having filed a Board appeal of an agency action that the Board orders canceled has not been returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> because she is not where she would have been if the agency had not taken the action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Navy</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 364, 367 (1998). Further, he analyzed the appellant's retaliation claims under the general reprisal standard described in <span class="Italic">Rockwell v. Department of Commerce</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 217, 222 (1988). <span class="Italic">See Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (establishing the general reprisal standard that was described in <span class="Italic">Rockwell</span>), <span class="Italic">superseded in part by statute as stated in Alarid v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6; 15 (2015). The administrative judge concluded that the appellant failed to establish retaliation under this standard because, among other things, there was no nexus between the alleged retaliatory actions and her Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, <span class="Italic">Gaydon</span>, and the appellant's description of her retaliation allegations, we do not believe that it is appropriate to consider these retaliation allegations in this compliance matter. In <span class="Italic">Gaydon</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. at 279, the Board cited to <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> to support the proposition that it has the authority to examine an employee's retaliation claims in a compliance case stemming from a final Board decision. In <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 733, our reviewing court discussed the Board's broad enforcement authority, which included a "substantive assessment" of whether an employee has been given <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief. As noted by the administrative judge, the Board in <span class="Italic">Gaydon</span> explained its rationale for considering retaliation claims in the context of a compliance matter, that is, an employee who is being retaliated against for having filed a Board appeal has not been restored to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Gaydon</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. at 279. Importantly, <span class="Italic">Gaydon</span> has not been reversed or overruled. We do not read <span class="Italic">Gaydon</span> to authorize the Board to consider any and all retaliation claims raised in a petition for enforcement. Rather, consistent with our reading of <span class="Italic">Gaydon</span> and <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, in order to address the appellant's retaliation claims in the context of this compliance matter, those claims must relate to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the appellant's retaliation claims. The appellant raised approximately fourteen allegations of whistleblower reprisal, including, among other things, a hostile work environment, an October 1, 2014 reassignment, issues regarding her fiscal year 2015 performance appraisal, a January 26, 2016 Letter of Counseling, a March 9, 2016 Letter of Reprimand, an April 8, 2016 proposed 7-day suspension, and a denial of various opportunities. Based on our close review of these allegations, we conclude that none of these allegations are related to the Board's 2012 final order of <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief. Accordingly, because the appellant's retaliation allegations are not related to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief, we do not consider them in the context of this enforcement matter, and we vacate the administrative judge's analysis of these allegations in the compliance initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decision not to consider the appellant's retaliation claims in this compliance matter does not leave the appellant without a remedy to pursue her claims of whistleblower reprisal. Rather, the appellant may seek corrective action regarding her claims of whistleblower reprisal through an individual right of action (IRA) appeal before the Board. However, before seeking corrective action from the Board through an IRA appeal, the appellant must first seek corrective action from the Office of Special Counsel. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3); <span class="Italic">see Miller v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 3, &#x00B6; 6 (2014), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 626 F. App'x 261 (Fed. Cir. 2015). We take no position on whether the Board would have jurisdiction over any subsequent IRA appeal involving the retaliation allegations raised by the appellant in this petition for enforcement or whether any of the appellant's retaliation allegations that predated her earlier enforcement appeals are barred by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, collateral estoppel, or another legal principle.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Fuller v. VA</span>, PH-0432-12-0006-C-5, n.3 (NP 8/9/2022) (compliance proceeding: "Because the appellant raised an affirmative defense of whistleblower reprisal in the underlying removal appeal, her claims of retaliation based on her prior Board appeal fall under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clay v. Department of the Army</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 10 (2016). The appellant also identified 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(D) to support some of her other retaliation claims. Together, these retaliation claims should be analyzed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e), rather than under the general reprisal standard utilized by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Elder v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 12, &#x00B6; 39 (2016) (finding that the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standard is inapplicable to claims that allege reprisal for filing a prior Board appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i)); <span class="Italic">Alarid</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6; 12.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reprisal differs from unhappiness about the appellant's return to work. While congeniality may be a desirable quality in the workplace, it is not required by statute and is not a necessary ingredient of restoration. As long as the employee's work is not impeded and he is offered reasonable assistance, the agency does not exercise bad faith in restoration because some employees or supervisors are cold to the appellant on his return. <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 119, 128 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 79 MSPR 364, 367 (1998) ("While congeniality in the workplace is not statutorily mandated, hostile actions of agency officials directed towards an employee can evidence an agency's refusal to restore a wrongfully separated employee in good faith."). Of one appellant's claim of harassment following her return to work, <span class="Italic">Oates v. DHHS</span>, 64 MSPR 349, 351 (1994), stated that the appellant could raise her treatment upon her return to work in compliance proceedings, but that as to her right to restoration to a position, she was not entitled to a better position than she would have held had the adverse action not occurred. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Wright v. VA</span>, 85 MSPR 358, 364-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-27 (2000) (considering whether the rescission of adverse action was mooted by reinstatement when the appellant claimed that uncorrected conditions, including sexual harassment, precluded her return to work); <span class="Italic">Shamblen v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 620, 627 (1990) (that the agency reinstated the appellant before the finality date of the initial decision was not reprisal; nothing in AJ's order precluded the agency from reinstating appellant at an earlier date).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some issues are raised as reprisal claims that the Board will not treat because of constraints upon Board jurisdiction. The Board would not determine whether an appellant was a victim of reprisal when, after his successful appeal from an indefinite suspension, he was placed on administrative leave pending investigation into his security clearance. The Board "lacks the authority to review the merits of an agency's decision regarding an employee's security clearance, and has taken a limited view of <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedies where security clearances are involved." <span class="Italic">Newbold v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 58 MSPR 532, 536 (1993). [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-15-079.html#sec8-79">Security Clearance Revocation; Sensitive Position</a>" in Chapter 8.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4992"></span>If the appellant did not claim discrimination in an underlying appeal, the Board apparently will not adjudicate a discrimination claim that is joined to an enforcement petition, although the Board will adjudicate a reprisal claim tied to the appellant's use of MSPB procedures, <span class="Italic">Reed v. USPS</span>, 98 MSPR 585, 590 &#x00B6; 11 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claims on PFR that her claim of discrimination was not recognized. Specifically, she argues that she was denied a reasonable accommodation (i.e., her former tour) as a disabled veteran to attend college classes. The Board does not have independent appellate jurisdiction to consider allegations of prohibited personnel practices. <span class="Italic">See Saunders v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1985<span class="Italic">); King v. Department of the Navy</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 341 &#x00B6; 10 (2001)<span class="Italic">; Soto v. Department of the Army</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 353, 354 (1981). In the absence of an otherwise appealable action, the Board may not assert jurisdiction over these claims. <span class="Italic">See King v. Reid,</span> 59 F.3d 1215, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (the Board may not decide a claim of discrimination that is alleged to be a basis in whole or in part for an agency's acts of noncompliance).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the Board has held that, when an appellant raises a claim of discrimination in connection with an appealable agency action, and a claim for compensatory damages in connection with that claim, the agency's complete rescission of the action appealed does not render the appeal moot. <span class="Italic">See Currier v. United States Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 191, 197 (1996). However, the appellant in the instant case did not raise her claim of discrimination in conjunction with an appealable action--namely, her demotion. Instead, she raises it in connection with her change of tour, which is not, in and of itself, an appealable action. Therefore, <span class="Italic">Currier</span> does not control this appeal with respect to the discrimination claim.</p>
