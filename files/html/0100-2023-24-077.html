<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-73"><span class="space">d.</span> Summary Adjudication of EEO Issues; Disposition of Civil Service Issues</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If a jury could believe the appellant's version of his EEO claim, there is a triable issue before the district court. In determining whether a material issue of fact sufficient to require trial exists, all inferences must be resolved in favor of the appellant. Summary adjudication will not lie when the EEO issue involves credibility determinations on material issues of fact. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morales v. MSPB</span>, 932 F.2d 800, 803 (9th Cir. 1991). To avoid summary adjudication, however, there must be a legally sufficient basis to proceed to trial. This point was illustrated in a decision affirming summary judgment against a plaintiff who claimed termination of his civil service appointment was retaliatory, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Rice</span>, 983 F.2d 177, 181 (10th Cir. 1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Plaintiff alleges that summary judgment was improper as to his claim of unlawful reprisal because he had established a <span class="Italic">prima facia</span> case. To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facia</span> case of unlawful reprisal, Plaintiff must prove:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;protected opposition to discrimination or participation in a proceeding arising out of discrimination; (2) adverse action by the employer contemporaneously or subsequent to the employee['] s protected activity; and (3) a causal connection between such activity and the employer's action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Anderson v. Phillips Petroleum Co.</span>, 861 F.2d 631, 634 (10th Cir. 1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Burrus v. United Telephone Co. of Kansas, Inc</span>., 683 F.2d 339, 343 (10th Cir. 1982)). The district court ruled that Plaintiff satisfied the first two elements, but failed to prove a "causal connection" between his filing EEO complaints and his removal from service. The court found that Defendant Janis Wood, the supervisor who made the decision to remove Plaintiff, was not aware that Plaintiff had filed any EEO complaints. We have previously assumed, without deciding, that to establish a "causal connection," plaintiff must show that the individual who took adverse action against him knew of the employee's protected activity. <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 861 F.2d at 635. We embrace the assumption of <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> in our holding today. Plaintiff fails to provide any evidence showing that he even made the complaints, much less that Ms. Wood knew of them. Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to prove a "causal connection" and summary judgment was proper as to the retaliation claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Belfiore v. MSPB</span>, No. 84-3877 (D.D.C. 1986 unpublished), commented:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Defendants misconstrue the relationship between this court's review of the administrative record on the nondiscrimination claims and this court's <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the discrimination claims. The former is a procedural inquiry solely into whether the demotion process was <span id="Page_5278"></span>arbitrary or capricious. The standard is not what the court would believe on a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> appraisal, but whether the administrative determination was supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Brewer v. United States Postal Serv</span>., 647 F.2d 1093, 1096 (Ct. Cl. 1981). By finding that the process was not arbitrary, the court did not find that defendants engaged in legitimate, nondiscriminatory action. Nor did it find that such action was not a pretext for discrimination. Any inquiry into the validity of plaintiff's discrimination claim in a mixed case such as this must grant the employee the right to have the facts subject to trial <span class="Italic">de novo</span> by the reviewing court. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703. In this case, there are differing accounts of the personnel practices which led to plaintiff's demotion. Upon reviewing the record, this court finds that this creates genuine issues of material fact in dispute which must be determined at trial.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there are no triable issues in an EEO case, and if the case can be summarily resolved against the employee, the question remains of what to do with the civil service issues. Prior to <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis, supra</span>, the Fourth Circuit considered what should occur when a district court receives a mixed case appeal from MSPB and the EEO claim is removed from the case early in the litigation. <span class="Italic">Afifi v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 924 F.2d 61, 63-64 (4th Cir. 1991), concluded that the district court has the discretion to decide the remaining civil service issues, transfer the case to the Federal Circuit, or, in some circumstances, dismiss the proceeding with prejudice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What should a district court do with a nondiscrimination claim where an appended discrimination claim, though not sham or frivolous, is quickly disposed of by an affirmative defense? The government argues that the district court lacks jurisdiction as soon as the discrimination claim is dismissed, but we find this argument illogical. Congress explicitly gave the district courts exclusive jurisdiction over mixed cases. In this grant of jurisdiction, Congress must have assumed that some mixed cases might present valid nondiscrimination claims and unfounded discrimination claims. The district court's jurisdiction should not be determined after the merits of the discrimination claim are decided, with the unlucky plaintiff (like Afifi) left with a dismissal without prejudice and a long-expired appeal period to the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, to avoid the pitfalls for unwary plaintiffs created by subject-matter courts, Congress enacted a liberal transfer statute (28 USC 1631) when it created the Federal Circuit....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he language of 28 USC 1631 is broadly drafted to permit transfer between any two federal courts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Senate Report No. 97-275, 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 11, 21. In short, Congress discouraged wasteful parallel appeals by creating a safety net for litigants who might seek review in a single wrong forum. The transfer statute has been applied to reviews of MSPB decisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 715 F.2d at 1491 (transferring mixed case to district court); <span class="Italic">Hays v. Postmaster General</span>, 868 F.2d 328, 331 (9th Cir. 1989) (remanding to determine whether transfer would serve the interests of justice).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our task is to harmonize three indisputable congressional objectives--(1) that the Federal Circuit should be the uniform voice in federal personnel matters, (2) that the district courts throughout the country should hear all claims arising under the antidiscrimination laws, and (3) that judicial resources not be wasted by parallel actions. First, we join those courts that have held that a district court may dismiss an entire mixed case where it finds that a plaintiff has engrafted a sham discrimination claim onto his complaint in order to defeat the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction. On the other hand, we reject the extreme notion that the district court's jurisdiction over the nondiscrimination claim automatically disappears with any dismissal of the discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the middle ground, where the plaintiff's discrimination claim is not brought as a jurisdictional charade but nonetheless quickly evaporates, we leave to the district court's discretion one of two alternatives--(1) retain jurisdiction over the nondiscrimination claim, or (2) transfer the case to the Federal Circuit under 28 USC 1631. In no event should a plaintiff who brings his case in good faith in the district court be deprived of a forum for his nondiscrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">How should the district courts exercise this discretion? A fundamental consideration is the purpose of district court jurisdiction over mixed cases in the first place--judicial economy. This purpose is strikingly similar to the rationale for district court jurisdiction over state-law pendent claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find much guidance in the factors commonly considered by federal courts when deciding whether to retain jurisdiction over pendent claims where the federal claims have been dismissed--judicial economy, convenience, concerns for federalism, and fairness to litigants.... &#8197;In the context of this case, the "concern for federalism" factor translates to a concern for the uniformity in federal personnel policy Congress envisioned when it gave exclusive jurisdiction over nondiscrimination claims to the Federal Circuit. The other factors take into account any prejudice or hardship to litigants, the amount of litigation that has already taken place, and the like.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are sorely tempted to simply perform this analysis ourselves in this case. Relatively little time and expense has been invested by the parties in the district court proceeding; at oral argument, neither side had any particular objection to transfer to the Federal Circuit. Nonetheless, we believe that the decision whether to retain jurisdiction or transfer should be committed in the first instance to the district court, and we should review that decision only for abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Alford v. Leonhart</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20160229973">No. 7:14-CF-00196-F</a> (EDNC 2016), added as to the review duality:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This matter comes to the court in an unusual procedural posture that implicates the standard of review. In particular, the court must act as the trial court in the Civil Action and the reviewing court in the Appeal, deciding the same issue in both. This Order resolves that conflict and places the litigation on track for resolution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, a plaintiff who seeks judicial review of a decision by the MSPB must do so in the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 133 S. Ct. 596, 607 (2012). Where, however, a federal employee's claims before the MSPB include allegations of discrimination, her appeal must be filed in district court. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This is the case regardless of whether the MSPB decided the case "on procedural grounds or instead on the merits." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In mixed cases--those containing both discrimination and nondiscrimination claims--"the district court reviews the discrimination claims <span class="Italic">de novo</span> and the nondiscrimination claims under a deferential standard of review, setting aside the MSPB's decision only if findings or conclusions are found to be '(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.'" <span class="Italic">Alguard v. Vilsack</span>, No. 13-CV-3083-TOR, 2015 WL 5008416, at *2 (E.D. Wash. Aug. 20, 2015) (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an unusual decision, <span class="Italic">Schuck v. Frank</span>, 27 F.3d 194 (6th Cir. 1994), the appeals court determined that if a district court rules only on civil service issues and directs a remand to the Board on issues that will otherwise escape appellate review, appeal by the government lies directly with the reviewing appellate court. In <span class="Italic">Schuck</span>, the district court determined that the AJ failed to consider certain mitigating factors and remanded the case for reconsideration by the Board. The court concluded that the government could appeal the remand order because it could not directly appeal a subsequent decision of the Board. The appeals court then examined the mitigation factors identified by the district court as not having been considered by the Board and agreed with the court on some of those issues. It sent the case back to district court, presumably for remand to the Board. But in <span class="Italic">King v. Lynch</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1994110521f3d10841918">21 F.3d 1084</a> (Fed. Cir. 1994), a route of appeal by the government to the Federal Circuit was foreclosed on EEO issues: OPM cannot appeal MSPB or Special Panel decisions to the Federal Circuit on EEO grounds. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-24-090.html#sec17-86">Review Sought by OPM</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee initiates an adverse action review through EEO procedures and then moves directly to district court, the district court should resolve the EEO as well as the civil service claims, even though the MSPB did not touch the case. The jurisdictional analytical niceties were explained in <span class="Italic">Doyal v. Marsh</span>, 777 F.2d 1526, 1535-36 (11th Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the trial court erred in its dismissal of his civil service claims brought pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> The trial judge dismissed these claims because the appellant failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The appellant argues that the district court had jurisdiction over his mixed case complaint under the plain language of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The doctrine of administrative exhaustion should be applied with a regard to the particular administrative scheme at issue<span class="Italic">. Weinberger v. Salfi</span>, 422 U.S. 749, 95 S. Ct. 2457, 45 L. Ed.2d 522 (1975); <span class="Italic">Parisi v. Davidson</span>, 405 U.S. 34, 92 S. Ct. 815, 31 L. Ed.2d 17 (1972); <span class="Italic">McKart v. United States</span>, 395 U.S. 185, 89 S. Ct. 1657, 23 L. Ed.2d 194 (1969). In this instance, the administrative/judicial procedures created by Congress in the Civil Service Reform Act consist of a number of interlocking and somewhat overlapping relationships between various federal agencies and federal courts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 generally provides that final decisions of the MSPB are reviewable in either the courts of appeals or the Court of Claims. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1). In such cases, the court may set aside an agency action only if arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, procedurally infirm, or unsupported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7703(c). The Act, however, creates an exception for "[c]ases of discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2). Such cases include those in which the employee "alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by... section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000e-16)... " <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B).

Roudebush</span>, 425 U.S. 840, 96 S. Ct. 1949, 48 L. Ed.2d 416 (1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Read together with the rest of the Act, these sections provide two <span id="Page_5279"></span>different types of procedures for employees contesting agency action. If an employee does not allege that "a basis" of the agency action was discrimination, he may appeal an agency decision directly to the MSPB and from the MSPB to the courts of appeals or the Court of Claims. If, however, the employee does allege discrimination, he may either immediately file suit in a district court or pursue an administrative procedure.[5] <span class="Italic">Hayes v. United States Government Printing Office</span>, 684 F.2d 137, 139 (D.C. Cir. 1982). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Christo v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 667 F.2d 882, 884 (10th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Army</span>, 715 F.2d 1485, 1489 (Fed. Cir. 1983). If an agency (i.e., not the MSPB) or the MSPB does not render a decision on an employee's mixed case complaint within 120 days, the employee is entitled "to file a civil action to the same extent and in the same manner as provided in &#x00A7; 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.... &#8197;5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(e)(1). An employee's right to file a civil action on the agency's decision, or lack thereof within 120 days, is circumscribed only if the employee files an appeal with the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702(e)(1)(A) and (B), 7702(e)(2) and 7702(a)(2)(B). Therefore, Congress, through this section, has explicitly given the employee certain rights and options, one of which is to file a civil action based on his mixed case complaint before resorting to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The administrative route consists of an MSPB hearing and decision on the mixed case complaint, followed by a choice between judicial review at that point or review of the discrimination claim before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7707(a)(3).... &#8197;If the employee has elected the administrative route and has pursued his claim before the EEOC, he may seek review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> in the district court 180 days after he files the petition before the EEOC, or when there is a final agency action on the matter. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(c). <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 141 (1978) (Conference report), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, pp. 2723, 2873-74. <span class="Italic">Hayes</span>, 684 F.2d at 139.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are also of the opinion that the trial judge erred by bifurcating the appellant's nondiscrimination claims from his discrimination claims. Several court of appeals have considered the issue of bifurcation in the context of whether bifurcation of an appeal from an MSPB decision in a mixed case complaint between the district court and the court of appeals is either permissible or required. Each of these courts has concluded that, in light of the language and legislative history of the Civil Services Reform Act, mixed cases must be treated as a unit.[6]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">This Court finds that when an employee files a discrimination claim with the district court 120 days after filing an appeal with the MSPB pursuant to &#x00A7; 7702(e)(1)(B), the MSPB retains a continuing obligation to issue an opinion as to agency's termination decision, and if such opinion is issued prior to the termination of the district court discrimination case, the district court may review the MSPB ruling. If the MSPB fails to issue a decision prior to the termination of the district court discrimination case, the final decision of the MSPB should be appealed directly to the Federal Circuit as is contemplated by the statute. To hold otherwise would allow terminated employees to circumvent MSPB review altogether simply by asserting discrimination claims, and would result in district courts conducting reviews of agency decisions under the strictures of &#x00A7; 7701, a task for which district courts are ill-suited. <span class="Italic">See</span>, Peter B.
