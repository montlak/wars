<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-54"><span class="space">A.</span> REGULATORY STRUCTURE</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Our focus starts with the EEOC regulations defining disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. Readers should review current EEOC regulations and guidance affecting their cases. In addition to regulations, readers should review EEOC Interpretation and Guidance, available on the Commission's website, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a> and refer to Davis and Hadley's <span class="Italic">A Guide to Federal Sector Equal Employment Law and Practice</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/22EEO.html">Dewey Publications, Inc</a>. 2023), and to Gilbert's <span class="Italic">Federal Sector Disability Discrimination Law Deskbook</span> (Dewey Publications, Inc. 2023). Refer to the EEOC publication (one of many Commission issuances on disability accommodations), "Policy Guidance on Executive Order 13164: Establishing Procedures to Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable Accommodation," <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/policy-guidance-executive-order-13164-establishing-procedures-facilitate-provision">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/policy-guidance-executive-order-13164-establishing-procedures-facilitate-provision</a>, supplemented by its "Notice Concerning the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) Amendments Act of 2008," <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/notice-concerning-americans-disabilities-act-ada-amendments-act-2008">https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/notice-concerning-americans-disabilities-act-ada-amendments-act-2008</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">EEOC regulations contain a general statement of policy and a regulatory requirement of reasonable accommodation, 29 CFR 1614.203 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Model employer</span>. The Federal Government shall be a model employer of individuals with disabilities. Agencies shall give full consideration to the hiring, advancement, and retention of qualified individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce. Agencies shall also take affirmative action to promote the recruitment, hiring, and advancement of qualified individuals with disabilities, with the goal of eliminating under-representation of individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The EEOC's substantive regulations concerning disability discrimination were moved to and from various segments of the EEOC regulatory system in past years. The operative regulations are now at 29 CFR Part 1630 (2022) (previously they were situated at 29 CFR Part 1614 and, earlier, at 29 CFR Part 1613). The regulations most applicable to cases likely to come before the Board, taken from 29 CFR Part 1630 (2022), are:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1630.2 <span class="Italic">Definitions</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Definition of "disability."</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;In general. <span class="Italic">Disability</span> means, with respect to an individual--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span id="Page_3411"></span>(i)&#x2003;A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;A record of such an impairment; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;Being regarded as having such an impairment as described in paragraph (l) of this section. This means that the individual has been subjected to an action prohibited by the ADA as amended because of an actual or perceived impairment that is not both "transitory and minor."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An individual may establish coverage under any one or more of these three prongs of the definition of disability, i.e., paragraphs (g)(1)(i) (the "actual disability" prong), (g)(1)(ii) (the "record of" prong), and/or (g)(1)(iii) (the "regarded as" prong) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Where an individual is not challenging a covered entity's failure to make reasonable accommodations and does not require a reasonable accommodation, it is generally unnecessary to proceed under the "actual disability" or "record of" prongs, which require a showing of an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity or a record of such an impairment. In these cases, the evaluation of coverage can be made solely under the "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability, which does not require a showing of an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity or a record of such an impairment. An individual may choose, however, to proceed under the "actual disability" and/or "record of" prong regardless of whether the individual is challenging a covered entity's failure to make reasonable accommodations or requires a reasonable accommodation.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(h)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Physical or mental impairment means</span>--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, immune, circulatory, hemic, lymphatic, skin, and endocrine; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Any mental or psychological disorder, such as an intellectual disability (formerly termed "mental retardation"), organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(i)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Major life activities</span>--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In general</span>. Major life activities include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working; and</p>

The operation of a major bodily function includes the operation of an individual organ within a body system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;In determining other examples of major life activities, the term "major" shall not be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for disability. ADAAA section 2(b)(4) (Findings and Purposes). Whether an activity is a "major life activity" is not determined by reference to whether it is of "central importance to daily life."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(j)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Substantially limits</span>--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Rules of construction</span>. The following rules of construction apply when determining whether an impairment substantially limits an individual in a major life activity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The term "substantially limits" shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. "Substantially limits" is not meant to be a demanding standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;An impairment is a disability within the meaning of this section if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population. An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Accordingly, the threshold issue of whether an impairment "substantially limits" a major life activity should not demand extensive analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iv)&#x2003;The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity requires an individualized assessment. However, in making this assessment, the term "substantially limits" shall be interpreted and applied to require a degree of functional limitation that is lower than the standard for "substantially limits" applied prior to the ADAAA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(v)&#x2003;The comparison of an individual's performance of a major life activity to the performance of the same major life activity by most people in the general population usually will not require scientific, medical, or statistical analysis. Nothing in this paragraph is intended, however, to prohibit the presentation of scientific, medical, or statistical evidence to make such a comparison where appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(vi)&#x2003;The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures. However, the ameliorative effects of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses shall be considered in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(vii)&#x2003;An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(viii)&#x2003;An impairment that substantially limits one major life activity need not substantially limit other major life activities in order to be considered a substantially limiting impairment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ix)&#x2003;The six-month "transitory" part of the "transitory and minor" exception to "regarded as" coverage in &#x00A7; 1630.15(f) does not apply to the definition of "disability" under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) (the "actual disability" prong) or (g)(1)(ii) (the "record of" prong) of this section. The effects of an impairment lasting or expected to last fewer than six months can be substantially limiting within the meaning of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Non-applicability to the "regarded as" prong.</span> Whether an individual's impairment "substantially limits" a major life activity is not relevant to coverage under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) (the "regarded as" prong) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Predictable assessments</span>--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The principles set forth in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (ix) of this section are intended to provide for more generous coverage and application of the ADA's prohibition on discrimination through a framework that is predictable, consistent, and workable for all individuals and entities with rights and responsibilities under the ADA as amended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Applying the principles set forth in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (ix) of this section, the individualized assessment of some types of impairments will, in virtually all cases, result in a determination of coverage under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) (the "actual disability" prong) or (g)(1)(ii) (the "record of" prong) of this section. Given their inherent nature, these types of impairments will, as a factual matter, virtually always be found to impose a substantial limitation on a major life activity. Therefore, with respect to these types of impairments, the necessary individualized assessment should be particularly simple and straightforward.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;For example, applying the principles set forth in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (ix) of this section, it should easily be concluded that the following types of impairments will, at a minimum, substantially limit the major life activities indicated: Deafness substantially limits hearing; blindness substantially limits seeing; an intellectual disability (formerly termed mental retardation) substantially limits brain function; partially or completely missing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair substantially limit musculoskeletal function; autism substantially limits brain function; cancer substantially limits normal cell growth; cerebral palsy substantially limits brain function; diabetes substantially limits endocrine function; epilepsy substantially limits neurological function; Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection substantially limits immune function; multiple sclerosis substantially limits neurological function; muscular dystrophy substantially limits neurological function; and major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia <span id="Page_3412"></span>substantially limit brain function. The types of impairments described in this section may substantially limit additional major life activities not explicitly listed above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Condition, manner, or duration</span>--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;At all times taking into account the principles in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (ix) of this section, in determining whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity, it may be useful in appropriate cases to consider, as compared to most people in the general population, the condition under which the individual performs the major life activity; the manner in which the individual performs the major life activity; and/or the duration of time it takes the individual to perform the major life activity, or for which the individual can perform the major life activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Consideration of facts such as condition, manner, or duration may include, among other things, consideration of the difficulty, effort, or time required to perform a major life activity; pain experienced when performing a major life activity; the length of time a major life activity can be performed; and/or the way an impairment affects the operation of a major bodily function. In addition, the non-ameliorative effects of mitigating measures, such as negative side effects of medication or burdens associated with following a particular treatment regimen, may be considered when determining whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;In determining whether an individual has a disability under the "actual disability" or "record of" prongs of the definition of disability, the focus is on how a major life activity is substantially limited, and not on what outcomes an individual can achieve. For example, someone with a learning disability may achieve a high level of academic success, but may nevertheless be substantially limited in the major life activity of learning because of the additional time or effort he or she must spend to read, write, or learn compared to most people in the general population.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iv)&#x2003;Given the rules of construction set forth in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (ix) of this section, it may often be unnecessary to conduct an analysis involving most or all of these types of facts. This is particularly true with respect to impairments such as those described in paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section, which by their inherent nature should be easily found to impose a substantial limitation on a major life activity, and for which the individualized assessment should be particularly simple and straightforward.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Examples of mitigating measures</span>--Mitigating measures include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Medication, medical supplies, equipment, or appliances, low-vision devices (defined as devices that magnify, enhance, or otherwise augment a visual image, but not including ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses), prosthetics including limbs and devices, hearing aid(s) and cochlear implant(s) or other implantable hearing devices, mobility devices, and oxygen therapy equipment and supplies;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Use of assistive technology;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;Reasonable accommodations or "auxiliary aids or services" (as defined by 42 U.S.C. 12103(1));</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iv)&#x2003;Learned behavioral or adaptive neurological modifications; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(v)&#x2003;Psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, or physical therapy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses--defined</span>. Ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses are lenses that are intended to fully correct visual acuity or to eliminate refractive error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(k)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Has a record of such an impairment</span>--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In general</span>. An individual has a record of a disability if the individual has a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Broad construction</span>. Whether an individual has a record of an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity shall be construed broadly to the maximum extent permitted by the ADA and should not demand extensive analysis. An individual will be considered to have a record of a disability if the individual has a history of an impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities when compared to most people in the general population, or was misclassified as having had such an impairment. In determining whether an impairment substantially limited a major life activity, the principles articulated in paragraph (j) of this section apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reasonable accommodation</span>. An individual with a record of a substantially limiting impairment may be entitled, absent undue hardship, to a reasonable accommodation if needed and related to the past disability. For example, an employee with an impairment that previously limited, but no longer substantially limits, a major life activity may need leave or a schedule change to permit him or her to attend follow-up or "monitoring" appointments with a health care provider.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(l)&#x2003;"<span class="Italic">Is regarded as having such an impairment</span>." The following principles apply under the "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability (paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section) above:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Except as provided in &#x00A7; 1630.15(f), an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual is subjected to a prohibited action because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment, whether or not that impairment substantially limits, or is perceived to substantially limit, a major life activity. Prohibited actions include but are not limited to refusal to hire, demotion, placement on involuntary leave, termination, exclusion for failure to meet a qualification standard, harassment, or denial of any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Except as provided in &#x00A7; 1630.15(f), an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" any time a covered entity takes a prohibited action against the individual because of an actual or perceived impairment, even if the entity asserts, or may or does ultimately establish, a defense to such action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Establishing that an individual is "regarded as having such an impairment" does not, by itself, establish liability. Liability is established under title I of the ADA only when an individual proves that a covered entity discriminated on the basis of disability within the meaning of section 102 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12112.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(m)&#x2003;The term "<span class="Italic">qualified</span>," with respect to an individual with a disability, means that the individual satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires and, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 1630.3 for exceptions to this definition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(n)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Essential functions--</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In general</span>. The term <span class="Italic">essential functions</span> means the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires. The term "essential functions" does not include the marginal functions of the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A job function may be considered essential for any of several reasons, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The function may be essential because the reason the position exists is to perform that function;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;The function may be essential because of the limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed; and/or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;The function may be highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The employer's judgment as to which functions are essential;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;The amount of time spent on the job performing the function;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;A covered entity is required, absent undue hardship, to provide a reasonable accommodation to an otherwise qualified individual who meets the definition of disability under the "actual disability" prong (paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section), or "record of" prong (paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section), but is not required to provide a reasonable accommodation to an individual who meets the definition of disability solely under the "regarded as" prong (paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Factors to be considered.</span> In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on a covered entity, factors to be considered include:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;The overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the provision of the reasonable accommodation, the number of persons employed at such facility, and the effect on expenses and resources;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Defenses to an allegation of discrimination under this part may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Disparate treatment charges.</span> It may be a defense to a charge of disparate treatment brought under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.4 through 1630.8 and 1630.11 through 1630.12 that the challenged action is justified by a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Charges of discriminatory application of selection criteria</span>--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In general.</span> It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination, as described in &#x00A7; 1630.10, that an alleged application of qualification standards, tests, or selection criteria that screens out or tends to screen out or otherwise denies a job or benefit to an individual with a disability has been shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity, and such performance cannot be accomplished with reasonable accommodation, as required in this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Direct threat as a qualification standard.</span> The term "qualification standard" may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others in the workplace. (See &#x00A7; 1630.2(r) defining direct threat.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Other disparate impact charges.</span> It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination brought under this part that a uniformly applied standard, criterion, or policy has a disparate impact on an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities that the challenged standard, criterion or policy has been shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity, and such performance cannot be accomplished with reasonable accommodation, as required in this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Charges of not making reasonable accommodation.</span> It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination, as described in &#x00A7; 1630.9, that a requested or necessary accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the covered entity's business.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Conflict with other Federal laws.</span> It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under this part that a challenged action is required or necessitated by another Federal law or regulation, or that another Federal law or regulation prohibits an action (including the provision of a particular reasonable accommodation) that would otherwise be required by this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Claims based on transitory and minor impairments under the "regarded as" prong.</span> It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination by an individual claiming coverage under the "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability that the impairment is (in the case of an actual impairment) or would be (in the case of a perceived impairment) "transitory and minor." To establish this defense, a covered entity must demonstrate that the impairment is both "transitory" and "minor." Whether the impairment at issue is or would be "transitory and minor" is to be determined objectively. A covered entity may not defeat "regarded as" coverage of an individual simply by demonstrating that it subjectively believed the impairment was transitory and minor; rather, the covered entity must demonstrate that the impairment is (in the case of an actual impairment) or would be (in the case of a perceived impairment) both transitory and minor. For purposes of this section, "transitory" is defined as lasting or expected to last six months or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Additional defenses.</span> It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under this part that the alleged discriminatory action is specifically permitted by &#x00A7; 1630.14 or &#x00A7; 1630.16.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the agency's duty to accommodate through reassignment, a topic later discussed, the reassignment obligation is now encompassed in a brief reference in the regulations at 29 CFR 1630.2 (2022) (definitions):</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reassignment</span>. When a nonprobationary employee becomes unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position even with reasonable accommodation due to a handicap, an agency shall offer to reassign the individual to a funded vacant position located in the same commuting area and serviced by the same appointing authority, and at the same grade or level, the essential functions of which the individual would be able to perform with reasonable accommodation if necessary unless the agency can demonstrate that the reassignment would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. In the absence of a position at the same grade or level, an offer of reassignment to a vacant position at the highest available grade or level below the employee's current grade or level shall be required, but availability of such a vacancy shall not affect the employee's entitlement, if any, to disability retirement pursuant to 5 USC 8337 or 5 USC 8451. If the agency has already posted a notice or announcement seeking applications for a specific vacant position at the time the agency has determined that the nonprobationary employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position even with reasonable accommodation, then the agency does not have an obligation under this section to offer to reassign the individual to that position, but the agency must consider the individual on an equal basis with those who applied for the position. For the purpose of this paragraph, an employee of the United States Postal Service shall not be considered qualified for any offer of reassignment that would be inconsistent with the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to drug impairment, Commission regulations, at 29 CFR 1630.3 (2022), exclude drug users who do not undergo rehabilitation from the terms "<span class="Italic">disability and qualified individual with a disability"</span>:</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Favreau v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-12-0547-I-6 (NP 3/9/2023), summarized the regulatory scheme:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ADAAA prohibits discrimination "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a); <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Social Security Administration</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 18 (2010). The ADAAA defines "qualified individual," in part, as "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8). An employer is also required to provide reasonable accommodations to an otherwise qualified individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5). Thus, both a claim of disability <span id="Page_3415"></span>discrimination based on an individual's status as disabled and a claim based on an agency's failure to reasonably accommodate that disability require that the individual be "qualified." <span class="Italic">Haas v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 2022 MSPB 36, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-29.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual may prove that he has a disability by showing that he suffers from a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; has a record of such impairment; or is regarded as having such impairment. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1). An impairment is considered a disability if it substantially limits an individual's ability to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). Major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, eating, lifting, bending, concentrating, communicating, and working. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i)(1)(i). Major life activities also include the operation of major bodily functions. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i)(1)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity requires an individualized assessment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(iv). Although not every impairment will be limiting, an impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity to be considered substantially limiting. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). An impairment that substantially limits one major life activity need not limit other major life activities. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(viii). An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(vii). Determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures other than ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(vi).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the appellant's assertion that the agency failed to grant reasonable accommodations for his conditions, an agency is required to provide such accommodations for the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless the agency can show that an accommodation would create an undue hardship for its business operations. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9(a). Reasonable accommodations include modifications to the manner in which the duties of a position are customarily performed to enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential job functions. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 13 (2014). Even if the appellant had established that he suffered from or had a record of suffering from a substantially limiting impairment to his shoulder, he would not have been entitled to an accommodation under the regulations in effect at the time of his removal because his impairment was not a long-term condition. Under the rules then in effect, individuals with temporary medical restrictions were exempt from the PAT only for the duration of the restrictions. Furthermore, had the agency regarded the appellant as disabled, it would not have been obligated to provide a reasonable accommodation because he did not have a substantially limiting impairment. <span class="Italic">Carter v. Department of Justice</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 641, &#x00B6; 24 (2001); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(4) (a covered entity is not required to provide a reasonable accommodation to an individual who meets the definition of disability solely under the "regarded as" prong).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">EEOC regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act are complex. The ADA regulations are supplemented by an appendix entitled "Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act." EEOC publishes other guidance on the legislation. Commercial publishing services specializing in EEO regulatory guidance should be consulted for the latest and most complete government guidance on the employment provisions of the ADA. EEOC's website <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">www.eeoc.gov</a>, also contains Commission issuances interpreting the ADA. Regulations should be checked for currency on e-CFR.</p>
