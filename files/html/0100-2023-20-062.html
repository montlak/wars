<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-59"><span class="space">7.</span> Discrimination Unrelated to Job Performance; 5 USC 2302(b)(10)</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 2302:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(10)&#x2003;discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others; except that nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit an agency from taking into account in determining suitability or fitness any conviction of the employee or applicant for any crime under the laws of any State, of the District of Columbia, or of the United States[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The proviso that when determining suitability or fitness, nothing shall prohibit an agency from taking into account any conviction of the employee or applicant for any crime under federal or state law, is interpreted to mean that the prohibition extends only to an employee's conduct totally unrelated to job performance. <span class="Italic">Harvey v. MSPB</span>, 802 F.2d 537 (D.C. Cir. 1986). A violation of 2302(b)(10) may not be made on speculation; the AJ's analysis must assess the competing motivations behind agency actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fekete v. DOJ</span>, 8 MSPR 448, 452 (1981). In <span class="Italic">Harvey</span>, the court quoted a Conference Report as to the intent of the section, 802 F.2d at 551-52:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The conferees intend that only conduct of the employee or applicant that is related to the duties to be assigned to an employee or applicant or to the employee's or applicant's performance or the performance of others may be taken into consideration in determining the employee's suitability or fitness. Conviction of a crime which has no bearing on the duties to be assigned to an employee or applicant or on the employee's or applicant's performance or the performance of others may not be the basis for discriminating for or against an employee or applicant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harvey</span>, involving the duties assigned to an SES member, essentially determined that an honest but inaccurate judgment as to the reliability or dependability of an employee is not, even if in error, a prohibited personnel practice under &#x00A7; (b)(10). [Refer to &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) in <a href="0100-2023-14-001.html#sec7-1">Chapter 7</a> on "Nexus and Mitigation."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board added to the definition of 2302(b)(10) in <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Farm Credit Admin.</span>, 51 MSPR 569, 585-86 (1991), involving removal of a financial analyst for unacceptable performance. The removal was reversed when it was motivated by reprisal against the appellant's protected disclosures concerning <span id="Page_3747"></span>deficiencies in the Farm Credit System. As to subsection (b)(10), however, the Board discerned no violation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Department of Justice</span>, 6 MSPR 585 (1981), the Board examined the legislative history of 2302(b)(10). During a mark-up session, Representative Harris, who moved for the adoption of 2302(b)(10), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]his provision...would bar an official from taking action against any employee or applicant for employment as a reprisal for <span class="Italic">non-job related</span> conduct. I think it is clear to prohibit discrimination against activities that have no bearing on one's job. Psychiatry, outside interests, a member of "NOW" or "Taxpayers Alliance" or what have you....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, in <span class="Italic">Garrow v. Gramm</span>, 856 F.2d 203, 207 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the court emphasized that 2302(b)(10) is designed to prohibit personnel practices that are taken in response to an employee's off-duty conduct or interests that are unrelated to job performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is persuaded by the legislative history of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) and by judicial interpretation of that provision that it is intended to apply to off-duty non-job related conduct. Thus, we find that the administrative judge erred in finding a violation of 2302(b)(10) in this case. The conduct for which the agency retaliated against the appellant occurred during the performance of his duties.[16]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[16]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Garrow v. Gramm</span>, 856 F.2d 203, 207 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the court stated "Chapter 23...is designed to prohibit prohibited personnel practices that are taken in response to an employee's off-duty conduct or interests that are unrelated to job performance." This statement is overbroad and in conflict with Board precedent that Chapter 23 prohibits prohibited personnel practices in response to on-duty conduct.... The District Court decision in <span class="Italic">Garrow</span>, however, makes it clear that petitioner was alleging a violation of 2302(b)(10). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garrow v. Phillips</span>, 664 F. Supp. 2, 3 (D.D.C. 1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without mentioning <span class="Italic">Thompson,</span> the Board provided a definition to &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) in <span class="Italic">MacLean v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, the appellant also contends that the agency retaliated against him because of his FLEOA activities, thereby committing a prohibited personnel practice in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10). The relevant statute pertinently provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(10)&#x2003;discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others;....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not previously established the precise elements for proving a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10). Depending on the specific facts and circumstances, the proscription of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) may be analogous to either (1) the prohibition against retaliation for exercising appeal rights, filing grievances, etc., found at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), or to (2) a traditional claim of discrimination governed by the principles of Title VII. We find it unnecessary in this case, however, to decide the specific legal framework that the Board will apply to future &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) claims because the appellant has failed to prove his claim under either standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) applying the (b)(9) framework, the appellant must demonstrate that: (1) He engaged in activity that did not adversely affect his performance; (2) he was subsequently treated in an adverse fashion by the agency; (3) the deciding official had actual or constructive knowledge of the appellant's (b)(10) activity; and (4) there is a causal connection between the (b)(10) activity and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Crump v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 10 (2010); <span class="Italic">Wildeman v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 313, 320 (1984); <span class="Italic">see also Warren v. Department of the Army,</span> 804 F.2d 654 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Where, as here, the agency has already articulated a non-retaliatory reason for its action, i.e., the charged misconduct, it has done everything that would be required of it if the appellant had made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. Thus, our inquiry proceeds directly to the ultimate question of whether, weighing all the evidence, the appellant has met his burden of proving illegal retaliation. <span class="Italic">Crump,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">see U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens,</span> 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If analyzed under the legal framework for traditional Title VII claims, in order to prevail the appellant had to show by preponderant evidence that he engaged in conduct that did not adversely affect his performance and that the agency intentionally discriminated against him for that conduct. In the absence of direct evidence of intentional discrimination, the appellant could meet this burden by introducing evidence giving rise to an inference of disparate treatment because of his conduct unrelated to his performance. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Interior,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 7 (2010), <span class="Italic">citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973). Assuming that he did so, the burden of production shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. If the agency meets this burden, the appellant then must prove that the agency's stated reason is merely a pretext for discrimination prohibited by (b)(10) and the activity unrelated to his performance was the real reason for the disparate treatment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In most adverse action appeals taken pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, the agency has already articulated a nondiscriminatory reason for its action, i.e., the charged misconduct; accordingly, the agency has done everything that would be required of it if an appellant had made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, and whether he in fact did so is no longer relevant. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> &#x00B6; 9 n.3, <span class="Italic">citing Marshall v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 6 (2008). As a result, the inquiry proceeds directly to the ultimate question of whether, upon weighing all of the evidence, the appellant has met his overall burden of proving illegal discrimination. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Strausbaugh v. GPO</span>, 493 Fed. Appx. 61, 64 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), found no violation of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) for the imposition of discipline for a workplace incident involving the employee while he was on military duty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10), Mr. Strausbaugh also contends that it was improper for the GPO to consider his misconduct in an employment decision because the misconduct occurred during a period that he was on military duty and his off-work conduct was not unlawful. Section 2302(b)(10), however, only protects against discrimination "on the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others" and allows agencies to take into account any criminal conviction in determining "suitability or fitness," regardless of the affect on performance. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10). To be clear, section 2302(b)(10) does not prohibit an agency from considering conduct which occurs during an employee's military service, and does not limit the agency to only illegal conduct. Moreover, Mr. Strausbaugh was on a pass from his military service when the conduct occurred.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Further explanation of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) was provided by the FLRA. Under the Authority's view, 5 USC 2302(b)(10) is intended to avoid personnel actions that have no basis in an employee's conduct or performance. But if the agency does have a performance or conduct-related basis for an action, &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) does not furnish jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the personnel action. Reviewing an arbitration award that set aside a reassignment of the grievant out of a position qualifying for Law Enforcement Availability Pay based on difficulties in using the grievant as a witness in criminal prosecutions, the Federal Labor Relations Authority explained, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., NHTSA and AFGE Local 3313</span>, 58 FLRA 333, 336-38 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator erred in finding a prohibited personnel practice under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) and Article 33, paragraph 10</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) indicates that it was enacted to prohibit discrimination against activities that have no bearing on an employee's job performance. <span class="Italic">See</span> House Conference Report No. 95-1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. at 131 ("The conferees intend that only conduct of the employee or applicant that is related to the duties to be assigned to an employee or applicant or to the employee's or applicant's performance or the performance of others may be taken into consideration in determining that employee's suitability or fitness."). The MSPB notes that under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) personnel actions must be job-related and not non-job-related. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Dept. of Justice,</span> 6 MSPR 585, 602 (198 1). In <span class="Italic">Garrow v. Gramm,</span> 856 F.2d 203, 207 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the court emphasized that &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) is designed to prohibit personnel actions that are taken in response to an employee's off-duty conduct or matters that are unrelated to job performance. Accordingly, both the courts and the MSPB refuse to sustain findings of a prohibited personnel practice under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) when the personnel action was in response to matters that were related to an employee's performance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Harvey</span> <span class="Italic">v. MSPB,</span> 802 F.2d 537 (D.C. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Thompson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Farm Credit Admin.</span>, 51 MSPR 569 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant's reassignment was "predicated on [the Agency's] determination that [the grievant's] background contained 'numerous, substantial and credible allegations of misconduct[.] ... After reviewing the grievant's background, he ruled that the disputed allegations would not disqualify the grievant as a witness. Accordingly, he found that the grievant's reassignment constituted a prohibited personnel practice because it was based on conduct that did not adversely affect his performance or the performance of others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reviewing this finding <span class="Italic">de novo,</span> we conclude that the Arbitrator erred. The Arbitrator misconceived the basis on which the grievant was reassigned. We find that the grievant's reassignment was in response to <span id="Page_3748"></span>DOJ declaring him to be an unsuitable witness and that the DOJ actions clearly related to the grievant's ability to perform in the position of a criminal investigator.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reassignment memo to the grievant specifically set forth the Agency's reason for reassigning the grievant. The memo explained that the grievant's supervisor had met with the director and assistant director of the Office of Consumer Litigation to discuss the grievant's background and that both concluded</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">that if you were scheduled to be a witness in an odometer fraud prosecution, some of the [background] material would have to be turned over to defense counsel under the legal principles established in <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> and subsequent cases. Additionally, they concluded that several other items identified in the reports would have to be turned over to the presiding judge so that the judge could decide whether to pass them along to the defense counsel. On the basis of their experience, they believed that most of the judges would give substantially all of those items to defense counsel. Additionally, they stated that in view of the likelihood that defense counsel would be able to seriously undermine your credibility through the use of some of the materials in those background reports, the Department of Justice would not be willing to use you as a government witness in an odometer fraud prosecution. Further, they also stated that they would advise other Federal prosecutors who are not part of the Office of Consumer Litigation not to use you as a government witness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reassignment Memorandum at 2. The memo concluded that in view of these actions, the Agency had determined that "your reassignment to another position within the Office of Safety Assurance is appropriate to ensure the effective operation of the Odometer Fraud initiative within this agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because one of the functions of the grievant's position as a criminal investigator is to appear, as necessary, as a witness in criminal prosecutions of odometer fraud, these actions by DOJ clearly related to the grievant's suitability for continued employment as a criminal investigator.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The timing of the grievant's reassignment further supports that he was reassigned not because of the disputed allegations, but in response to DOJ's refusal to use him as a witness. As the Arbitrator specifically acknowledged, the Agency had investigated the disputed actions in the past and had never before acted on the allegations. It was not until DOJ declared the grievant to be an unsuitable witness that the Agency reassigned him to a position that did not require him to appear as a government witness. Accordingly, we conclude that the Arbitrator erred in finding a prohibited personnel practice under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) and Article 33, paragraph 10. <span class="Italic">See Thompson</span>, 51 MSPR at 585-86 (administrative judge erred in finding a prohibited personnel practice because the agency's action was in response to a matter related to the employee's performance).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we view the reassignment as predicated on the grievant's conduct as the Arbitrator did, the reassignment did not constitute a prohibited personnel practice. As explained by the court in <span class="Italic">Harvey,</span> the focus of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) is narrowly circumscribed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 802 F.2d at 552. The focus on conduct is confined to whether the alleged conduct on which the personnel action was based is performance-related. An action under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) is not available to contest whether the employee actually committed the alleged conduct. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (when the conduct an agency ascribes to the employee is performance-related, it is irrelevant for purposes of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) whether the agency is right or wrong in ascribing the conduct to the employee).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, in adjudicating whether the Agency had committed a prohibited personnel practice under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) by reassigning the grievant on the basis of allegations viewed to be impeachment material subject to disclosure under <span class="Italic">Giglio,</span> the Arbitrator was confined to determining whether allegations viewed to be impeachment material subject to disclosure under <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> related to the grievant's performance. Instead, the Arbitrator improperly converted the proceeding into a review of whether the allegations were substantiated, whether they were impeachment material subject to disclosure, and the impact of the actions by DOJ. We find that allegations determined to be, either rightly or wrongly, impeachment material subject to disclosure under <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> clearly relate to the performance of an employee in a criminal investigator position. Accordingly, the Arbitrator erred by finding a prohibited personnel practice under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) and Article 33, paragraph 10<span class="Italic">. See Harvey,</span> 802 F.2d at 551 (the MSPB's analysis did not permit a holding that the disputed matter constituted a prohibited personnel practice under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10)).</p>
