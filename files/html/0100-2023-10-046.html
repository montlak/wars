<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-46"><span class="space">5.</span> Continuance Denial--Review Standard</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board vests considerable discretion in its AJs, particularly in scheduling hearings, <span class="Italic">Ceja v. DLA</span>, 27 MSPR 531, 534 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In judicial proceedings, the granting or denial of a motion for continuance rests in the discretion of the court to which application is made. Generally, unless there is a clear showing of an abuse of discretion, the court's decision will be upheld on review. <span class="Italic">See e.g.</span> <span class="Italic">Neufield v. United States,</span> 118 F.2d 375 (D.C. Cir. 1941), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 315 U.S. 798, 62 S. Ct. 580, 86 L. Ed. 1199 (1942). The same principle applies to requests for continuances in administrative proceedings. <span class="Italic">See F.C.C. v. WJR, The Goodwill Station, Inc.,</span> 337 U.S. 265, 69 S. Ct. 1097, 93 L. Ed. 1353 (1949).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Courts are not particularly sympathetic to claims that continuances were unreasonably denied. An early decision, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 721 F.2d 361, 364 (Fed. Cir. 1983), pointed out:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1340"></span>...The procedures for obtaining a postponement act not only as a safeguard in a particular case against abuse of the system by one party through unduly lengthening an appeal. They also guarantee that other appellants will have their appeals heard at the earliest possible times and not be left to uncertainty about their future careers. It is essential that parties before the MSPB recognize the Board's rules and abide by its schedules to the extent possible.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hiller v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-1244.Opinion.4-22-2019.pdf">767 Fed. Appx. 957</a>, 962 (Fed. Cir. 2019 NP), advised:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hiller suggests that the Administrative Judge should have postponed her hearing because the Board has granted continuances in similar cases. In <span class="Italic">Bloom v. Department of the Army</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 79 (2006), for example, the Board determined that an Administrative Judge abused her discretion when she refused to grant an appellant's motion for a continuance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 83. The Board found it significant that the Administrative Judge based her denial on a misinterpretation of the rationale behind appellant's request. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Although the Administrative Judge thought the appellant wanted a continuance to investigate, the appellant's request instead pertained to "her need for legal representation to adequately respond to the [court's] showcause order" on jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Bloom</span> is not analogous to these facts. Ms. Hiller moved for a continuance when she learned details related to a set of deadlines that the Administrative Judge had established more than two months earlier. There is no indication that, in denying her motion, the Administrative Judge misunderstood the rationale behind her request or that he otherwise failed to give her request adequate consideration. Indeed, the fact that he partially granted her motion suggests that he seriously considered the substance of her arguments and need for an extension. Thus, even if we adopted the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Bloom</span>, we would not find that the Administrative Judge abused his discretion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The denial of a hearing continuance will not be overturned without a showing of abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Ceja v. DLA</span>, 27 MSPR 531, 534 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Matosian v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 689, 698 (1993) (when denying a requested continuance, the AJ may consider the time that the appeal has been pending and a prior continuance or dismissal without prejudice to refile). The denial of a continuance results in a remand only upon a showing of harm; if the appellant, under <span class="Italic">Pendergraft v. TVA</span>, 6 MSPR 512, 514, 6 MSPB 430 (1981), asserts only that his review of documents or ability to secure witnesses was inconvenienced by a denial of a continuance, no remand is granted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. DHHS</span>, 38 MSPR 648, 653 (1988); <span class="Italic">Malizia v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 3 MSPR 513, 514 (1980) (no harm through denial of a continuance to secure testimony from the appellant's physician when the agency stipulated the work-relatedness of the appellant's injury and agreed it would not dispute medical evidence in the record from the doctor; the appellant expressed no dissatisfaction with the stipulation and made no objection to proceeding without the physician's testimony). If a continuance is denied and the hearing proceeds with appellant and his representative, the continuance denial is harmless without a demonstration that the appellant could not introduce proof at the hearing. <span class="Italic">Biberstine v. DODDS</span>, 37 MSPR 248, 254 (1988); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Friedrick v. DOJ</span>, 52 MSPR 126, 131 (1991) (no harm when the AJ stated that he relied on evidence in the form of the appellant's admissions rather than on testimony of a witness whose presence prompted a continuance request).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Typical of the Board's analysis of a belated continuance request is <span class="Italic">Boles v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 27 MSPR 686, 687-88 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has failed to show that the presiding official abused her discretion in failing to grant a continuance. Appellant was notified shortly after the filing of his appeal that postponements of hearings are not routinely granted. Appellant was further notified by Order dated December 9, 1983, of the January 3, 1984 hearing date, and admitted receiving the notice on December 12, 1983. However, neither appellant nor his attorney requested a postponement until an oral request of December 27, 1983, and a written motion on December 30, 1983. Under these circumstances, we find appellant has failed to show he exercised due diligence in requesting a postponement so as to establish that the presiding official erred in denying a continuance....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The failure to obtain a copy of a hearing order was not a sufficient basis to challenge the denial of a continuance when the appellant, registered as an e-filer, did not have access to a computer, <span class="Italic">Koo v. GPO,</span> DC-0432-11-0069-I-1 (NP 9/30/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the appellant's request to postpone the hearing. Even taking as true the appellant's allegation that she did not receive the hearing notice because she lacks computer access, the appellant is responsible for her own non-receipt of that document because she should not have registered as an e-filer if she lacked access to her e-mail. The appeal form expressly notified the appellant that by registering as an e-filer, she consented to receive Board-issued documents at her e-mail address of record, and the record shows that the regional office properly sent the hearing notice to the e-mail address that the appellant provided in the initial appeal form.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The need to demonstrate harm was carried to an extreme in <span class="Italic">Cortez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 25 MSPR 237 (1984). The Board concluded that an AJ improperly denied a continuance to the appellant so that she could attend her own hearing. But, the Board determined, because the appellant did not show that her testimony as to the merits and EEO defenses would alter the result, there was no harmful error and therefore no reason to either reverse or remand the case to the regional office. Considering that a hearing is convened for the appellant as a matter of statutory right, the Board's position was illogical. At the very least, the decision disregarded the critical importance of the presence of the appellant at a hearing, if only to offer assistance to a representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Starkey v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 3 MSPR 289, 3 MSPB 377 (1980) (emphasizing the value of the appellant's presence at the hearing to provide guidance to his representative).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 313, 318-19 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2000), determined that an AJ erred in denying a continuance. A prehearing conference was set for Monday and the hearing was set for Friday of the same week. The AJ could not convene the prehearing. By Wednesday the parties were unable to reschedule the prehearing conference without postponing the hearing, although the appellant's representative suggested that the hearing be rescheduled and that the prehearing conference be held on Friday, the day originally set for the hearing. The AJ decided that the prehearing conference and the hearing would be held on Friday. Appellant objected because he would not be able to duplicate approved exhibits and make travel arrangements for witnesses approved by the AJ if the conference and hearing took place on the same day. The AJ canceled the hearing when he learned that the appellant would not attend the hearing. The Board remanded for a hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find that the AJ should have granted the appellant's request to continue the hearing to another date<span class="Italic">. See Smith v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army,</span> 41 MSPR 110, 114 (1989) (scheduling conflicts can establish good cause for granting requested postponement). The delay in holding the prehearing conference was not the appellant's fault, and it was not unreasonable for him to want the prehearing conference to be held at least one day <span class="Italic">prior</span> to the day of the hearing. As the appellant's representative explained to the AJ, he needed to know ahead of time which witnesses and exhibits would be approved so that he could make travel arrangements and prepare the witnesses to testify and the exhibits for introduction at the hearing....[2] Moreover, this was the appellant's first request for a continuance, it was not made for purposes of harassment, and there is no indication in the record that his proposed schedule would have been an undue burden or caused an unwarranted delay for the AJ or the agency. Therefore, the request should have been granted<span class="Italic">. See Wildberger v. Small Business Administration,</span> 63 MSPR 338, 343 (when request for continuance presents good cause and relates to matter material to the appeal, request should be granted absent showing that it would be unduly burdensome, harassing, or cause unwarranted delay), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 36 F.3d 1114 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We do not find that there must be a prehearing conference in every case, or that it must always be held on a date different from the date of hearing. On the facts of this case, however, since a prehearing conference had been scheduled in advance on a date prior to the hearing, the parties were travelling, and the appellant had a reasonable expectation that he would have time after the prehearing conference to prepare his case, we find that the AJ should have arranged the schedule so that the appellant had sufficient time between the prehearing conference and the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that the facts in this case are different from those in <span class="Italic">Hutton or Callahan</span> in one significant respect: in those cases, each appellant simply failed to show up at the hearing-Hutton due to car trouble, Callahan because he was lost--and then tried to reschedule the hearing afterward. 37 MSPR at 69-70; 748 F.2d at 1557. In the instant case, the appellant notified the AJ ahead of time that he would not appear at the hearing, told the AJ why he would not appear, and indicated where and how the AJ could reach him on the originally appointed hearing date. In addition, as discussed above, the appellant should have been granted a continuance. Although we do not condone the appellant's refusal to attend the hearing, nor do we condone his intransigence, as evidenced by his motions to strike valid orders issued by the AJ, we find that the appellant's failure to appear for the hearing was excusable under the circumstances particular to this case, and that therefore the AJ should have rescheduled the hearing. <span class="Italic">See Wildberger,</span> 63 MSPR at 346.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the AJ may have considered the appellant's actions to be a waiver of the hearing that the Board had ordered, the fact that the appellant indicated at all times that he <span class="Italic">did</span> want a hearing belies such a conclusion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schnugg v. Department of Defense,</span> 60 MSPR 510, 512 (1994) (waiver of hearing only implied by clear, unequivocal, and decisive action). Moreover, in view of the importance of an appellant's right to a hearing, that right should not be denied as a sanction absent extraordinary circumstances, which were not present here. <span class="Italic">Wildberger,</span> 63 MSPR at 346.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One can argue prejudice as a result of a continuance, but the threshold demonstration of error will likely be considerable. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <span id="Page_1341"></span>4 MSPR 427, 430, 4 MSPB 479 (1980), concluded that the agency was not prejudiced through a continuance: although the military officers who were needed to testify might be transferred and unavailable for later testimony, there were alternate means of presenting their testimony through depositions or affidavits. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Markland v. OPM</span>, 73 MSPR 349, 354-57 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Markland v. OPM</span>, 140 F.3d 1031 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (appellant effectively abandoned a Board hearing when, as a result of discovery disputes that might have been resolved, the appellant declined to proceed with the Board hearing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a practical matter, if the AJ is truly unreasonable in scheduling, one can follow the suggestion of the Board in its comments to regulatory revisions in 2012, 77 Fed. Reg. 62349, 62355 (Oct. 12, 2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, a commenter reported that in his experience judges have displayed poor judgment by scheduling hearing and prehearing deadlines far before the completion of discovery, unilaterally setting hearing dates for personal convenience, and denying unopposed motions to reschedule hearings. This commenter also suggested that the MSPB has seemingly taken the approach of cutting short discovery to meet the prehearing dates selected by the judge. Parties may request a suspension under 1201.28 when additional time is needed for discovery. Concerns that a judge is improperly managing a particular case should be directed to the appropriate Regional Director or Chief Administrative Judge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A note: if one complains to higher Board authority, opposing counsel should be copied in the complaint (or included in the phone call) to avoid the reality or appearance of an prohibited <span class="italic">ex parte</span> communication.</p>
