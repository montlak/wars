<p class="noindent">5 USC 7112(b)(7) exempts from unit coverage:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]ny employee primarily engaged in investigation or audit functions relating to the work of individuals employed by an agency whose duties directly affect the internal security of the agency, but only if the functions are undertaken to ensure that the duties are discharged honestly and with integrity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Dept. of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs and NFFE Local 1998</span>, 68 FLRA 657, 661 (2015) (Member Pizzella concurring in part, dissenting in part) (overruled as to personnel office employees by <span class="Italic">VA Kansas City Med. Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 70 FLRA 465 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">VA Kansas City Med. Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 70 FLRA 960 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally, the Authority has found that &#x00A7; 7112(b)(7) applies where individuals "perform[&#8197;] internal investigations of employee wrongdoing and fraud," with the potential for uncovering "employee fraud, misuse of funds, or malfeasance,"[45] as well as where individuals investigate "fraud, waste, and abuse."[46] However, this standard is not limited to employees who perform investigations or audits relating to "fraud, waste, or abuse," but includes any audit or investigation that relates to the "honesty and integrity" of particular types of employees.[47]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[45]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Small Bus. Admin</span>., 34 FLRA 392, 402 (1990).</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic"><span id="Page_70"></span>Dept. of Labor, OIG, Region I, Boston and Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, AFGE Local 948</span>, 7 FLRA 834, 834-836 (1982), considered unit inclusion through examination of duties of the employees and primacy of those duties related to investigation of unit employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">National Council of Field Labor Locals, American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (Council) holds exclusive representation rights for a unit, as stipulated by the parties, consisting of:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">All professional and non-professional employees stationed throughout the nation in field duty stations of the Department including field duty stations located within the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area, except non-clerical employees of the Labor Management Services Administration, employees serving in temporary appointments of less than one year's duration, or employees excluded under the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Local 948, a Local that is part of the Council, filed the instant petition, which seeks to clarify the above unit by including all non-supervisory employees of the Office of Audit (within the Office of Inspector General, herein OIG) located in Region I (Boston, Massachusetts).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity opposes this petition on several grounds. It contends, first, that the audit professionals would be exempt from inclusion in any bargaining unit under section 7112(b)(7) of the Statute because their duties directly affect the internal security of the agency. Secondly, the Activity contends that the audit professionals are exempt from inclusion under section 7112(c) of the Statute because their duties include the administration of a law relating to labor-management relations. Thirdly, the proposed unit is contended to be inappropriate because the employees in the Office of Audit in OIG Region I do not possess a community of interest separate and distinct from other OIG employees in Region I and other OIG employees across the country, and because the proposed unit would not promote the efficiency of agency operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OIG is a division of the Department of Labor responsible for: Conducting audits and investigations relating to internal Department of Labor operations, as well as "external" program grantees; promoting economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of Department of Labor operations; and preventing and detecting fraud, waste and abuse in such operations. Included in the OIG is the Office of Audit. The employees in the Office of Audit are responsible for the conduct of audits of Department of Labor programs and the employees who run these programs, potentially auditing to uncover employee fraud, misuse of funds, or malfeasance. These internal audits review such employee information as travel vouchers, payroll records, time and attendance records and GSA car vouchers. Employees of the Office of Audit also have had audit functions related to matters external to Department employees, i.e., program grantees, but the record reflects that such assignments are being phased away from the Office of Audit, which will then exclusively deal with internal audits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to audit functions relating to the work of Department of Labor employees, section 7112(b)(7) of the Statute precludes the inclusion in an appropriate unit of:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(7)&#x2003;any employee primarily engaged in investigation or audit functions relating to the work of individuals employed by an agency whose duties directly affect the internal security of the agency, but only if the functions are undertaken to ensure that the duties are discharged honestly and with integrity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear from the record that employees of the Office of Audit are engaged in investigation and audit functions relating to the work of individuals employed by the Department of Labor, and such functions are within the scope of section 7112(b)(7) exclusion. The sole issue raised by the Council concerns whether these employees are "primarily" engaged in these functions, rather than matters related to external audits. While the record reflects that external audits have occupied a significant portion of the time of employees of the Office of Audit, the record demonstrates that with the conclusion of the shift in assignments, the "primarily" test will be met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, as the clarification sought by the petition herein seeks to include employees who it is found are excluded by section 7112(b)(7) of the Statute, the petition will be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SBA and AFGE Local 2532</span>, 34 FLRA 392, 400-02 (1990), confirmed exclusion of auditors within the IG office from a unit of professional and nonprofessional employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to excluding OIG employees in general because they have a community of interest separate and distinct from employees in the existing unit and because their inclusion would create an inherent conflict of interest...[t]he Regional Director found that the auditors of the OIG must be excluded on the specific ground that their investigation and audit functions relating to the work of individuals employed by the Agency are within the scope of the section 7112(b)(7) exclusion, covering duties which affect the internal security of the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that to exclude auditors of the OIG would be a departure from precedent because the section 7112(b)(7) exclusion has been applied only to investigative employees of an Inspector General office....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The argument...is incorrect on its face, because that section by its specific language applies to employees "...engaged in investigation or audit functions...." Further...the Authority has previously excluded Inspector General employees other than investigators based on section 7112(b)(7). <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, OIG, Region I, Boston</span>, 7 FLRA 834 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the specific finding that the auditors are sufficiently engaged in the functions described in section 7112(b)(7) to require their exclusion from the unit, the Regional Director noted that the mission of the OIG includes determining whether the Agency is properly performing its mission; performing internal investigations of employee wrongdoing and fraud; and preventing fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement in the Agency's programs. To this end, the employees at issue perform audits of Agency programs, contracts, operations and program participants. Among their duties are audits which have the potential of uncovering employee fraud, misuse of funds or malfeasance. Further, audit functions related to matters external to Agency employees may result in investigation of Agency employees.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, USP Marion, Ill. and AFGE</span>, 55 FLRA 1243, 1243-44, 1247-49 (2000), remanded for factual development whether a legal assistant was excluded by 5 USC 7112(b)(2) through the duty of investigating tort claims of inmates confined to a federal penitentiary:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Office of the Senior Attorney (the Legal Department) at the Activity is staffed by the Senior Attorney, another attorney, and the legal assistant. The Legal Department coordinates the litigation that arises out of the institution's operations. It coordinates tort and other claims that are filed by inmates and staff and provides general legal advice to the Warden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Legal Assistant's chief responsibility is to investigate tort, administrative remedy, and other claims, including civil rights claims, that are brought by inmates against the staff. Inmate claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act are claims for specified monetary damages for loss or injury due to the negligence of staff. Claims for under $500 are decided at the Activity level by the senior attorney, who determines whether to offer settlement. Larger claims are referred to the Warden and then to the Regional Counsel. The Legal Assistant also investigates claims for damages brought under other statutes. Inmates' civil rights claims, which are made against staff members in their individual capacity, involve allegations of injury or loss due to unconstitutional acts by staff. The Legal Assistant investigates the merits of the claim and makes a recommendation as to whether the staff member should be represented by the Justice Department in any ensuing litigation. The claims are numerous--60 to 80 tort claims are filed each year at the Activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Legal Assistant receives investigation assignments from the Regional Counsel or from the U.S. Attorney's Office. The Legal Assistant conducts investigations by interviewing inmates and staff, including correctional officers, unit management, and other staff such as medical staff. The Legal Assistant also reviews relevant records and documents and prepares an investigative report and recommendation as to whether a case has merit, whether a staff member was acting within the scope of his or her employment, and similar matters. The Legal Assistant also prepares requests to the Justice Department that a staff member be represented by the Department. When a case proceeds to litigation, the Legal Assistant is usually responsible for preparing initial responses to interrogatories and subpoenas.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Legal Department has no role in the discipline of employees or in making recommendations for discipline. The Legal Assistant's investigations could potentially include a finding of staff wrongdoing <span id="Page_71"></span>of a serious enough nature that the Warden would refer it to the Office of Internal Affairs. However, no such action had occurred at the Activity in recent years. The Legal Department may also be required to research personnel information and garnishment actions, and the Legal Assistant is privy to such information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Senior Attorney has not been a participant in any labor-management negotiations at the Activity, nor has he had any direct or decision-making responsibility regarding grievances, arbitrations, disciplinary actions, or unfair labor practice charges. The Senior Attorney may be present at a meeting where a labor topic arises, but he characterized this involvement with labor issues as "peripheral." On occasion, the Senior Attorney has asked the Legal Assistant to research a labor issue, but the Legal Assistant has not been aware of the Senior Attorney's involvement in any negotiations with the Union or in any grievance, arbitration, or disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Legal Assistant Is Not a Confidential Employee and Should Not Be Excluded from the Bargaining Unit under Section 7112(b)(2)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Activity has not supported its assertion that the Legal Assistant should be excluded as a confidential employee based on her relationship with the Senior Attorney. As noted above, to exclude an employee from a bargaining unit on the basis that the employee is a confidential employee, the employee must be one who acts in a confidential capacity with respect to an individual who formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor-management relations. <span class="Italic">Red River, </span>2 FLRA at 660. The Senior Attorney's duties, on which the Activity relies to support its claim, do not constitute the type of responsibilities that the Authority has found are aspects of the formulation or effectuation of management policies in labor relations. The RD concluded that the Senior Attorney is not significantly involved in formulating or effectuating management policies in the field of labor relations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VA</span>, <span class="Italic">Waco</span>, 50 FLRA at 111-12. Moreover, the research and review tasks assigned the Legal Assistant regarding adverse action files and files related to complaints and suits against employees do not constitute labor relations work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has not established that the RD committed a "clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter" and, therefore, there is no basis to exclude the Legal Assistant from the bargaining unit on the ground that the incumbent is a confidential employee under section 7112(b)(2) of the Statute. Accordingly, we deny the application for review on this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;A Remand Is Necessary to Determine Whether the Legal Assistant Should Be Excluded from the Bargaining Unit under Section 7112(b)(7)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7112(b)(7) of the Statute provides that a bargaining unit is inappropriate if it includes:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">any employee primarily engaged in investigation or audit functions relating to the work of individuals employed by an agency whose duties directly affect the internal security of the agency, but only if the functions are undertaken to ensure that the duties are discharged honestly and with integrity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the precedent developed to apply section 7112(b)(7) reveals that most of the cases relate to employees engaged in audit functions.[7] <span class="Italic">See U.S. Small</span> <span class="Italic">Business Administration, </span>34 FLRA 392, 399 (1990) <span class="Italic">(SBA); U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector</span> <span class="Italic">General, Region 1, Boston, Massachusetts, </span>7 FLRA 834, 835 (1982) <span class="Italic">(Labor, Inspector General). See also</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Audit Service,</span> <span class="Italic">Southeast Region, </span>46 FLRA 512 (1992) <span class="Italic">(Naval Audit). </span>The Statute, however, applies to both audit and investigative functions, and is not limited to audit work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SBA, </span>34 FLRA at 401. In these cases, the Authority found employees to fall with the exclusion of individuals investigating particular employees' honesty and integrity in situations where these individuals were found to "perform internal investigations of employee wrongdoing and fraud," with the potential for uncovering "employee fraud, misuse of funds, or malfeasance," <span class="Italic">Id., </span>34 FLRA at 402, as well as where the individuals investigate "fraud, waste, inefficiency, and related improprieties." <span class="Italic">Naval Audit, </span>46 FLRA at 516<span class="Italic">. Cf. United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Francis Marion and Sumter National Forests,</span> 2 A/SLMR 597, 601 (1972) (criminal investigator who investigated actions of local residents and visitors to forest, but not bargaining unit employees, was included in bargaining unit).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The legislative history of section 7112(b)(7) contains only a brief discussion differentiating subsection (b)(7) from subsection (b)(6), relating to national security work. <span class="Italic">See Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management</span> <span class="Italic">Relations Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of</span> 1978, Committee Print, Nov. 19, 1979, at 994.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7112(b)(7) of the Statute clearly excludes from bargaining units employees engaged in audit or investigative work whose functions are undertaken to ensure that the duties of the individual employees being audited or investigated are discharged "honestly and with integrity." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(7). Based on the discussion above, we find that there is not, as the Activity suggests, an absence of precedent regarding what standard should be applied to determine whether the position of the Legal Assistant should be excluded from the bargaining unit on the basis of section 7112(b)(7) due to the performance of investigative work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the Agency had not established that the incumbent was called upon to investigate or uncover instances of fraud, waste, or abuse. Rather, the RD found that the Legal Assistant was engaged in investigations of tort, civil rights, and administrative remedy claims brought against the staff and/or the penitentiary, usually by inmates: (a) to determine whether the inmate has a legitimate claim that should be resolved; (b) to prepare for litigation of such claims, and (c) to prepare for the defense of the employee and/or the Activity against such claims. The RD found that the work performed by the Legal Assistant does not constitute the type of investigative and audit work contemplated by section 7112(b)(7) of the Statute and concluded that the Legal Assistant position should not be excluded from the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While it is not entirely clear, it appears that the RD would only have found the employee at issue to fall within the section 7112(b)(7) exclusion if the Agency established that she performed investigations relating to "fraud, waste, and abuse" similar to the investigations conducted by employees in the Authority cases discussed above. <span class="Italic">SBA, </span>34 FLRA at 399; <span class="Italic">Labor, Inspector</span> <span class="Italic">General, </span>7 FLRA at 835. The section 7112(b)(7) standard is not, however, limited to that type of employee, and includes any audit or investigation that relates to the "honesty and integrity" of particular types of employees. The standard applied by the RD may, therefore, be narrower than the statutory "honest and integrity" standard. While the various findings of the RD do not indicate that he applied the appropriate standard, they may also constitute factual findings that are consistent with the proper standard. Because we cannot determine exactly what standard the RD applied and findings he made, we remand the case for further processing, consistent with this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, the RD should make findings that correlate to section 7112(b)(7), such as: (a) whether the employee is "primarily engaged" in investigation or audit functions; (b) whether the duties of the employees under investigation by the Legal Assistant, directly affect the internal security of the Agency; and (c) whether the investigation functions are undertaken to ensure that the duties are discharged honestly and with integrity. In this regard, the RD should consider whether the Legal Assistant's investigations of allegations that employees have used excessive force or have violated the civil rights of inmates constitute investigation of whether such employees have performed their duties honestly and with integrity).</p>
<p class="noindent">Another Bureau of Prisons case, <span class="Italic">DOJ, USP Pine Know and AFGE Local 614</span>, 63 FLRA 153, 154, 155-56 (2009), determined that six Special Investigative Support Technicians were within the bargaining unit because, despite their occasional involvement in investigations finding employee misconduct, their primary work was investigating inmate security issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found, based on the statement of the SIA, that eighty percent of SIS investigations involve inmate misconduct, requests for protective custody, and injuries. This type of investigation requires interviews of inmates and staff, searches of inmate property, and monitoring of inmate telephone calls and mail. The remaining twenty percent of investigations conducted by the SIS office involve allegations of staff misconduct ranging from failure to follow policy to bringing contraband into the facility. Although the Activity's Office of Internal Affairs has primary responsibility over staff misconduct, it refers many such allegations to the SIS office for investigation. The SIS office conducted 63 staff investigations in 2006 and 58 in 2007.<span class="Italic"> </span>The RD found, in accordance with the statement of the SIS Technician, that the disputed employees spend approximately ten percent of their duty time working on staff investigations. Staff investigations involve mail and telephone monitoring, video surveillance, property searches, and inmate and staff interviews. SIS Technicians prepare reports of their staff investigations for the SIA, who personally oversees all such investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity argues that Authority precedent requires employees to be excluded from bargaining units if they perform audits or investigations with the "potential for uncovering employee fraud, misuse of funds, or malfeasance. Contrary to the Activity's argument, Authority precedent demonstrates that the "potential for uncovering employee fraud, misuse of funds, or malfeasance" has been considered only in cases involving audits or investigations of agency programs or employees. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Labor</span>, 7 FLRA at 835 ("potential" considered where auditors conducted audits of agency "programs and the employees who run these programs");<span class="Italic"> SBA</span>, 34 FLRA at 401-02 ("potential" considered where auditors performed audits of agency "programs, contracts, operations and program participants"). Here, the Activity alleges that the potential for discovering staff misconduct arises in the context of <span id="Page_72"></span>inmate investigations, not employee investigations, as the precedent requires. Consistent with the recommendation above, the Activity has not established that inmate investigations are investigations of Activity employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the SIS Technicians are not excluded from the bargaining unit under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(7) because the amount of time that they spend on staff investigations does not satisfy the "primarily engaged" element of the Statute. We note, initially, that "the word 'primarily' is capable of a range of meanings extending from 'first' or 'chief' to 'substantially.'" <span class="Italic">Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp. v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n</span>, 903 F.2d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Bd. of Governors v. Agnew</span>, 329 U.S. 441, 446-47 (1947)). We further note that the term "primarily engaged" is not explained in the legislative history of the Statute and was not interpreted by the Authority prior to <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the absence of arguments to the contrary, we apply<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Local 3529, </span>where the Authority found that quality assurance auditors were not excluded from a bargaining unit, even though they performed some audits that fell within the scope of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(7), because the "the preponderance" of their duties did not involve such audits. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 57 FLRA at 638. <span class="Italic">Cf. Obremski v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 699 F.2d 1263, 1270 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (court interpreted OPM statute to find that an employee who spent thirty percent of his time doing work related to detention "would not be 'primarily' engaged" in detention). The Authority found that the facts in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529</span> were different from those in <span class="Italic">Naval Audit</span>, where "<span class="Italic">every audit</span>...was undertaken to ensure that duties were discharged honestly and with integrity." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 637-38 (emphasis in original). <span class="Italic">See also Dep't of Labor</span>, 7 FLRA at 835-36 (finding that the "primarily engaged" test would be met where employees would "exclusively deal with internal audits" which fell under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(7)). The RD's conclusion comports squarely with the "preponderance" interpretation of "primarily engaged" adopted in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529</span> because he found that only ten to twenty percent of SIS Technicians' time involves investigations of staff members. Consistent with the recommendation above, the Activity has failed to establish that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error in this regard. Therefore, based on the foregoing, we find that the Activity has not established that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, FCI Seagoville and AFGE Local 1030</span>, 65 FLRA 239, 240-41 (2010), presented an application to review the regional director's determination that the unit included a Special Investigative Support Technician, whose duties involved staff investigations, although they were not his primary duty. Clarifying <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 164,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span> ("<span class="Italic">McCreary</span>"), FLRA denied review on a record that was in conflict as to the amount of time the employee spent on staff investigations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity argues that, even assuming that the RD correctly found that up to forty-five percent of the SIS's duties consist of staff investigations, the "position should still be excluded...because it satisfies the 'preponderance' standard." In <span class="Italic">McCreary</span>, [<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Penitentiary, McCreary, Pine Knot, Ky.</span>, 63 FLRA 153, 155 (2009)], the Authority held that where the RD found that "only ten to twenty percent of SIS Technicians' time involves investigations of staff members[,]" his conclusion that SIS Technicians' duties did not meet the "primarily engaged requirement" of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(7) "comport[ed] squarely with the 'preponderance' interpretation of 'primarily engaged' adopted in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529</span>[, 57 FLRA 633, 637-38 (2001).]" 63 FLRA at 156. Although the Authority has not defined what percentage of an employee's duties constitutes a "preponderance" in this context, the Authority has interpreted "preponderance" to mean "a majority" in the context of interpreting the term as it appears in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute.[3] <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Army, Parks Reserve Training Ctr., Dublin, Cal., </span>61 FLRA 537, 541 (2006) (citing <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Fayetteville, N.C</span>., 8 FLRA 651, 660 (1982)). There is no basis on which to define "preponderance" differently in the context of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(7) than it is defined in the context of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10). The RD found that, at most, forty-five percent of the SIS Technician's duties involved staff investigations, and we have found no factual error. Consistent with the definition of "preponderance" as "a majority," <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, we find that forty-five percent does not constitute a preponderance, and conclude that the RD did not fail to apply established law in this regard<span class="Italic">. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute states, in pertinent part: "[T]he term 'supervisor' includes only those individuals who devote a preponderance of their employment time to exercising such authority[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the preponderance standard is met in this case because the percentage of time spent by the SIS Technician investigating staff members is even greater than fifty percent, given that he conducts inmate interviews that "always have the potential to result in staff investigations." In this regard, the Agency argues that the Authority has held that &#x00A7; 7112(b)(7) "applies where individuals 'perform internal investigations of employee wrongdoing and fraud[&#8197;]' with the potential for uncovering 'employee fraud, misuse of funds, or malfeasance[.]'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 4 (citing <span class="Italic">SBA</span>, 34 FLRA at 399-402). However, in response to an identical argument, the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">McCreary </span>that "Authority precedent demonstrates that the 'potential for uncovering employee fraud, misuse of funds, or malfeasance' has been considered only in cases involving audits or investigations of agency programs or employees." 63 FLRA at 155 (citing <span class="Italic">SBA</span>, 34 FLRA at 401-02 ("potential" considered where auditors performed audits of agency "programs, contracts, operations and program participants"); <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, 7 FLRA at 835 ("potential" considered where auditors conducted audits of agency "programs and the employees who run these programs")). The Authority also held in M<span class="Italic">cCreary </span>that "the potential for discovering staff misconduct ar[ose] in the context of inmate investigations, not employee investigations, as the precedent requires." <span class="Italic">McCreary</span>, 63 FLRA at 155. Further, with respect to the Agency's arguments that <span class="Italic">McCreary </span>is distinguishable from the instant case, neither the differences in record evidence between the cases nor the testimony in this case indicating that the potential for discovering staff misconduct always arises during inmate investigations provides a basis for finding that the RD erred as a matter of law. Accordingly, insofar as the RD failed to consider the potential for uncovering staff misconduct during the course of inmate investigations, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
