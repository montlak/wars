<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit may require the Board to remand to the agency for a penalty redetermination when some but not all charges are sustained and when it is unclear if the agency originally would have sustained the penalty on the charges that were ultimately sustained, <span class="Italic">Modrowski v. VA</span>, 252 F.3d 1344, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having sustained all the charges, the Board determined that the agency's penalty of removal is "within the tolerable bounds of reasonableness." Because we are reversing as to the charges concerning Modrowski's refusal to cooperate, the appropriateness and reasonableness of the penalty must be reconsidered by the respective authorities, the agency as to the former, and the Board as to the latter. We note that the testimony before the Board suggests that perhaps the two charges relating to the sale of the houses to Perzanowski might not be seen by the Deciding Official as sufficiently serious to warrant removal. Therefore, we vacate the part of the Board's decision affirming the agency's penalty of removal, with instructions for the AJ to remand the case to the agency to re-determine an appropriate penalty in light of our decision. <span class="Italic">See LaChance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1259 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("[t]he Board may not independently determine penalties."). On remand, the agency may choose to propose further charges against Modrowski if it is found that he persisted in refusing to cooperate with the agency's investigation in the period after August 6, 1997.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Modrowski</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Guise v. DOJ</span>, 330 F.3d 1376, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases in which this court has upheld fewer than all the charges against an employee, the court has not invariably remanded for a new penalty determination. Instead, the court has considered the number and seriousness of the charges sustained as compared to the number and seriousness of those that have not been sustained. When we have invalidated most of the charges against the employee, or the invalidated charges are the most serious charges, we have vacated the penalty and remanded for reconsideration of the penalty in light of the significant change in the number and seriousness of the sustained charges. <span class="Italic">See Grafton v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 864 F.2d 140, 144 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Southers v. Veterans Admin</span>., 813 F.2d 1223, 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Moreover, when there is some indication that the agency would have regarded the sustained charges as insufficient to justify the penalty imposed, we have vacated the penalty and remanded with directions that the Board remand the case to the agency for redetermination of the appropriate penalty. <span class="Italic">See Modrowski v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 252 F.3d 1344, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2001). However, when the majority of the charges are sustained and the charge or charges that are not sustained are relatively minor compared to the sustained charges, and when there is no indication that the agency would have adopted a different penalty in the absence of the unsustained charge, we have upheld the penalty without the need for a remand. <span class="Italic">See Kumferman v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 785 F.2d 286, 291-92 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The inquiry in such cases is akin to a harmless error inquiry, under which an appellate court is required to uphold the decision of a lower tribunal if the court is satisfied, "with fair assurance," that "the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error." <span class="Italic">Kotteakos v. United States</span>, 328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S. Ct. 1239, 90 L. Ed. 1557 (1946).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 602 F.3d 1370, 1375-82 (Fed. Cir. 2010), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances we think that the most appropriate course is to remand to the Board for further consideration. As to the reasonableness of the penalty, the Board must consider on remand whether the agency's penalty of removal was reasonable in light of the three remaining sustained charges--charges 3, 5, and 6. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Admin.,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305 (1981). Here, the deciding official's testimony is ambiguous as to whether he would or would not have taken the same <span id="Page_2341"></span>action if charge 2 had not been sustained.[10] The resolution of such ambiguities is a matter for the Board in the first instance. If the Board determines that the deciding official would have removed Chambers based only on charges 3, 5, and 6, the Board itself must determine whether the penalty was reasonable. However, if there is "some indication that the agency would have regarded the sustained charges as insufficient to justify the penalty imposed," the Board must remand the case to the agency for redetermination of the appropriate penalty in the first instance. <span class="Italic">Guise v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 330 F.3d 1376, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">see Modrowski v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 252 F.3d 1344, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Referral of a disciplinary determination back to the agency occurred in <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081, 1084, 1086-87 (Fed. Cir. 1984), albeit with a dissent from Judge Bennett, whose view was the Board should make that redetermination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of our holding that the penalty imposed constituted an abuse of discretion, it is necessary to remand the case to the MSPB for a determination by the agency of an appropriate lesser penalty....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the facts of this case, the penalty of removal amounted to an abuse of discretion which failed responsibly to balance all of the relevant factors, and the final order of the MSPB sustaining the removal is therefore reversed. The agency charge of unauthorized possession of government property is supported by substantial evidence, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7703(c) (1982). However, some lesser penalty than discharge is appropriate. We therefore remand the case to the MSPB for a determination by the agency of what lesser penalty is appropriate, taking into consideration the agency's denial of petitioner's right to union representation. Petitioner should also be given the opportunity, if she wishes, to offer evidence regarding mitigation in light of the agency's loss of the documents relating to her response to the notice of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Judge Bennett, concurring and dissenting favored redetermination of the penalty by the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB has jurisdiction to mitigate agency penalties it finds to be unreasonably harsh. The effect of harmful error in the agency determination of penalty, before the MSPB, must be that the agency determination is entitled to no deference. The only obvious alternative for the MSPB would be to declare the adverse action illegal in its entirety and this would be an instance of overkill that the Civil Service Reform Act did not intend. A <span class="Italic">de novo</span> determination of penalty by the MSPB is adequate to take the harmfulness out of the error and make it harmless. I therefore believe it was error on the part of the MSPB to accord the usual deference in face of a manifestly harmful agency error. This error can be and should be completely corrected by the MSPB without a re-remand. Of course, the Army can be heard by the MSPB as to what the penalty should be.</p>

Dep't of Justice,</span> 384 F.3d 1342, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Where, as here, the agency "gave no indication that it would have imposed a lesser penalty" if fewer than all charges were sustained, <span class="Italic">id</span>., it is our responsibility to consider "the number and seriousness of the charges sustained as compared to...those that have not been sustained,"<span class="Italic"> Guise v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 330 F.3d 1376, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Because half of the charges have now been invalidated, <span class="Italic">see supra</span> Section II.C, we find a remand necessary to reconsider whether a penalty less than a two-grade demotion should apply, <span class="Italic">see Hathaway,</span> 384 F.3d at 1353 (collecting cases remanding to the MSPB); <span class="Italic">see also Lachance v. Devall,</span> 178 F.3d 1246, 1258 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board may follow suit by remanding to the agency when the outcome is unclear, from the perspective of the deciding official, when fewer than all charges are sustained. <span class="Italic">See Ransom v. VA</span>, CH-0752-11-0748-I-1 (NP 5/24/2013) (appellant's PFR from an initial decision sustaining removal, following remand by the AJ to the agency, and following the agency determination, subsequently sustained by the AJ, to remove the employee based on one charge that the deciding official had not originally decided would alone support termination); <span class="Italic">Minor v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 307, 312 &#x00B6; 13, 2010 MSPB 236 (2010) ("When the Board sustains fewer than all of the agency's charges, and when the agency has indicated, either in its final decision or in proceedings before the Board, that it would have imposed a lesser penalty if not all the charges were sustained, remanding the case to the agency is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Laycock v. Department of the Army</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 597, &#x00B6; 13 (2004). Here, Hulme testified that he would not have decided to remove the appellant based solely on Charge 1. Thus, we find it appropriate to remand the case. <span class="Italic">See Lock v. General Services Administration</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 219, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-5 (2007)."); <span class="Italic">Lock v. GSA</span>, 107 MSPR 219, 220 &#x00B6; 3, 2007 MSPB 264 (2007) (remanding for redetermination of penalty, as ordered by the AJ, when two of the six charges were sustained; noting that "[n]either party has contested the administrative judge's decision to remand the case to the agency for a new penalty determination").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may infer from the structure of the agency charges and decision whether the agency would sustain the adverse action when fewer than all the charges are sustained, <span class="Italic">Zwagil v. GSA</span>, 103 MSPR 63, 67-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13, 2006 MSPB 235 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In remanding this case, the court instructed us to determine whether there was any indication in the record as to whether the deciding official would have imposed a penalty short of removal based only on the sustained charge. <span class="Italic">Zwagil</span>, 167 Fed. Appx. at. at 805. In this regard, we note that the decision letter briefly discusses the factors that the deciding official took into account in arriving at the conclusion that the penalty of removal was reasonable. Specifically, after outlining the appellant's repeated failure to properly perform his duties, as exemplified by the sustained charge at issue in this case along with the appellant's record of prior discipline and poor performance for the same conduct, the deciding official stated, "[m]ore importantly,...for you to make a threatening comment in the workplace is so entirely contrary to our mission and values that I cannot possibly have you continue as a representative of this agency."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This statement would seem to reflect that the agency viewed the second charge, which was not sustained, as more serious than the first charge, which was sustained. However, the deciding official offered no hearing testimony whatsoever concerning the second charge. All of his testimony pertained solely to the first charge and how serious the appellant's failure to perform his duties was to the mission of the agency. Neither the agency's representative nor the appellant's representative asked the deciding official any questions about the second charge, and the deciding official volunteered no comments concerning it. From this, we infer that, contrary to this single sentence in the decision letter, the agency did not necessarily view the second charge as more important than the first. Additionally, it is clear from the deciding official's testimony that, in light of the appellant's failure to learn from his past record of discipline and poor performance, the agency would have removed the appellant based on the single sustained charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The foregoing demonstrates that the deciding official considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors most relevant to this case and that the agency reasonably exercised its management discretion. Accordingly, we find that the penalty of removal was within the tolerable limits of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Inferential analysis occurred in <span class="Italic">Barkis v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> DA-0752-10-0579-I-1 (NP 8/19/2011), examining carefully the deciding official's testimony on how that official would have responded based on the outcome of a principal charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the deciding official testified at the hearing that if the threatening conduct charge "was not there or was not sustained then the decision to remove would not have been the agency final decision, based upon the other lesser charges." Thus, the appellant asserts that the Board should provide the agency with the opportunity to impose a lesser penalty because the administrative judge did not sustain the charge of Engaging in Threatening Conduct by Initiating a Verbal and Physical Confrontation with a Co-worker, but did sustain the charges of Defiance of Authority/Refusal to Comply with Orders/Instructions and Deliberate Failure to Observe Safety Practices. The appellant also contends that the administrative judge should have mitigated the penalty because the more serious charge was not sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board sustains fewer than all of the agency's charges it may mitigate the agency's penalty to the maximum reasonable penalty so long as the agency has not indicated in either its final decision or in proceedings before the Board that it desires that a lesser penalty be imposed on fewer charges. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 1999). If the Board discerns from the record or proceedings that the agency desires imposition of a lesser penalty the Board must accord the agency an opportunity to institute such a penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge asked the deciding official during the hearing, "so if he [the appellant] had gone into that door that wasn't marked but not had an altercation with Mr. Farris would a removal still have been appropriate?" The deciding official responded "no," then clarified that "if he had gone through that door and Mr. Farris said 'Hey, you can't come in here,' and he said 'copy that,' and left, we wouldn't be sitting here today." We find that this testimony does not indicate that the deciding <span id="Page_2342"></span>official would have imposed a lesser penalty in this case if the <span class="Italic">charge</span> of Engaging in Threatening Conduct by Initiating a Verbal and Physical Confrontation with a Co-worker were not sustained. Rather, understood in the context of the words used by the administrative judge in her question and the deciding official's clarification after his "no" response, we find that the testimony shows that the deciding official would have imposed a lesser penalty, or not disciplined the appellant at all, if there had been no <span class="Italic">altercation</span> with Mr. Farris, i.e., if the appellant had improperly come through the door but then left without, for example, throwing water and mud on Mr. Farris. Here, the administrative judge found that the appellant did engage in an altercation with Mr. Farris but that the appellant's actions simply did not rise to the level of threatening conduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Remands are not required for further penalty analysis. In some appeals, if the agency did not indicate that it wanted a lesser penalty if fewer than all charges were sustained, the AJ errs by remanding the case to the agency for a redetermination of the penalty, that function remaining with the Board. <span class="Italic">See Myers v. USDA</span>, 88 MSPR 565, 573-74 &#x00B6; 27 (2001) ("[U]nless the agency has indicated that it desires a lesser penalty to be imposed on fewer charges, the Board may mitigate to the maximum reasonably penalty if a careful balancing of the mitigating factors warrants, or the Board may impose the same penalty imposed by the agency based on a justification of that penalty as the maximum reasonable penalty after balancing those factors."); <span class="Italic">Mancini v. VA</span>, 84 MSPR 70, 75 &#x00B6; 15 (1999) (where the record established that the agency would not have removed the appellant for one sustained charge, but the agency did not indicate that it would impose less than the maximum reasonable penalty for that charge, the Board will determine the maximum reasonable penalty for a sustained offense), <span class="Italic">following judicial review</span>, 89 MSPR 169 (2001).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Starks v. Dept. of Army</span>, 94 MSPR 95, 99 &#x00B6; 10 (2003), allowed the agency to state as late as the PFR stage of the case that it did not wish a lesser penalty even if a particular charge were not sustained. <span class="Italic">See Coleman v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/COLEMAN_LARRY_D_DA_0752_05_0208_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_250964.pdf">100 MSPR 574</a>, 578 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2005) (noting without additional commentary at n.2 of the decision: "on petition for review, the agency submitted a sworn statement from the deciding official confirming that he finds no reason to mitigate the removal penalty on the basis of the sustained charges and specifications"); <span class="Italic">Laycock v. Dept. of Army</span>, 97 MSPR 597, 601-02 &#x00B6; 13 (2004) (Board's treatment of the remand issue was cryptic: "we need not determine whether...the administrative judge acted properly in remanding the case;...remand is no longer appropriate, since the agency has now indicated that it considers the reasons sustained by the administrative judge to be sufficient to support removal, and since we have found no error in the administrative judge's findings on the merits of those reasons"). <span class="Italic">Ransom v. VA</span>, CH-0752-11-0748-I-1 (NP 5/24/2013), noted the AJ's award of interim relied pending the remand to the agency and return of the case to the AJ for consideration of the ultimate penalty determination.</p>
