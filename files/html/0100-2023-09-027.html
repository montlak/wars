<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-27_1"><span class="space">9.</span> Department of Veterans Affairs; 38 USC 714; Mixed Cases; Equitable Tolling</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The time for filing a Board appeal from an action under 38 USC 714 is ten business days. The judge may raise the timeliness issue <span class="italic">sua sponte.</span> Misinformation about the time limit from VA does not excuse failure to comply with the statutory deadline, although it could contribute to equitable estoppel or tolling to waive the deadline, but that did not occur in <span class="italic">Ledbetter v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 41, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-14 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective November 8, 2017, the agency removed the appellant from his Housekeeping Aid Supervisor position in its Pittsburgh Healthcare System under the authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 (VA Accountability Act), Pub. L. No. 115-41, &#x00A7; 202(a), 131 Stat. 862, 869-73 (2017) (codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714). In its decision letter, the agency advised the appellant that he could file an appeal with the Board challenging the removal decision no later than 30 calendar days after the effective date of the action or 30 calendar days after his receipt of the decision, whichever was later. The appellant acknowledged receipt of the decision on November 8, 2017, the same day as the effective date of his removal. The appellant filed the present appeal on December 22, 2017. 
After holding the requested hearing on the merits of the removal action, the administrative judge issued a show cause order, indicating that it appeared that the appellant did not timely file his appeal. She acknowledged that the agency incorrectly advised the appellant that he had 30 calendar days--as opposed to the 10 business days set forth in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714--to file his Board appeal. She noted, however, that the appellant filed the appeal 14 days after the incorrect later deadline set by the agency. As a result, she afforded the appellant an opportunity to demonstrate good cause for the delay in filing. The appellant responded to the show cause order, and the agency submitted a reply to the appellant's response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_902"></span>After consideration of the pleadings, the administrative judge issued an initial decision, dismissing the appeal as untimely filed. She found that the issue of Board jurisdiction, including the timeliness of an appeal, is always before the Board and may be raised by either party, or <span class="italic">sua sponte</span> by the Board, at any time. She also found that, based on the language of the statute, it did not appear that the time limit for filing an appeal under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 could be waived upon a showing of good cause for the delay. She further found that an agency's incorrect statement concerning appeal rights does not confer jurisdiction over an appeal, and that, even if equitable estoppel could apply to allow the filing within the 30 calendar days provided by the agency, his appeal was filed 14 days beyond that incorrect deadline. She dismissed the appellant's arguments that the timeliness requirement should be waived because neither the agency, nor the Board, raised the timeliness issue until the hearing and because the agency was not prejudiced by his late filing. She found that, other than his <span class="italic">pro se</span> status, the appellant offered no justification for his untimely filing and that, even using a 30-day filing period, his 14-day delay was not minimal. Accordingly, she dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(a)(1), "[t]he Secretary [of the Department of Veterans Affairs] may remove, demote, or suspend a covered individual...if the Secretary determines the performance or misconduct of the covered individual warrants such removal, demotion, or suspension." A "covered individual" is an individual occupying a position at the agency, with four exceptions not relevant here. <span class="italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(h)(1)(A)-(D). Such individual may appeal to the Board any removal, demotion, or suspension of more than 14 days. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(A). However, an appeal "may only be made if such appeal is made not later than 10 business days after the date of such removal, demotion, or suspension." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(B). 
Here, the effective date of the appellant's removal was November 8, 2017. Under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(B), his appeal was due on or before November 24, 2017[2] The appellant filed his appeal on December 22, 2017, and, thus, his appeal was untimely filed by 28 calendar days. <span class="italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(B). The remaining question, therefore, is whether the Board may waive or toll this statutory deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In calculating the deadline, we excluded weekends and the following two holidays that fell within the filing period: Veterans Day and Thanksgiving Day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">There is no basis to waive or toll the filing deadline.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has enumerated the following three bases for waiving a filing deadline prescribed by statute or regulation: (1) the statute or regulation <span id="Page_903"></span>itself specifies circumstances in which the time limit will be waived; (2) an agency's affirmative misconduct precludes it from enforcing an otherwise applicable deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, unless the application of equitable estoppel would result in the expenditure of appropriated funds in contravention of statute; and (3) an agency's failure to provide a mandatory notice of election rights warrants the waiver of the time limit for making the election. <span class="italic">See Blaha v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 8 (2007); <span class="italic">Speker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 380, 385 (1990), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 928 F.2d 410 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table), and <span class="italic">modified by Fox v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 602, 606 n.4 (1991). The Board also has recognized that the doctrine of equitable tolling may be available under certain circumstances to toll a statutory deadline in an untimely filed appeal. <span class="italic">See Wood v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 587, 593 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the first and the third bases for waiving the deadline are controlled by the language of the statute itself. As to the first basis for waiver, under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(B), an appeal of a removal, demotion, or suspension of more than 14 days must be made "not later than 10 business days after" the effective date of the action. In setting this deadline, Congress made no provision for the acceptance of late filings. Appeals filed under section 714, therefore, are unlike petitions for review of initial decisions, in which Congress specifically provided for an extension of the time limit "for good cause shown." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1). Thus, we find that the statutory time limit for filing an appeal under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 cannot be waived under the first basis because Congress did not provide for it. <span class="italic">See Wood</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 592 (concluding that the time limit for filing an individual right of action (IRA) appeal cannot be waived for good cause shown because the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) did not provide for the acceptance of late filings).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the third basis for waiver, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 does not require the agency to notify its employees of their election rights or any filing deadlines associated with those elections. Moreover, the Board has not promulgated regulations governing appeals under the VA Accountability Act and, thus, there is no regulatory notice requirement. Therefore, because the agency was under no obligation to provide the appellant with a notice of election rights, the third basis for waiver is inapplicable here. <span class="italic">See Speker</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. at 385-86 (finding that the Office of Personnel Management's failure to notify an appellant of her right to elect an alternative annuity did not form a basis for waiving a filing deadline when the applicable statute and regulations in effect at the time did not require it to provide such notice).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the statutory filing deadline prescribed by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 cannot be waived under the first or the third basis, the deadline potentially could be subject to equitable estoppel (the second basis for waiver) or equitable tolling. <span class="italic">See Wood</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 592-93. Both doctrines allow a statutory deadline to be excused based on equitable considerations. <span class="italic">See, e.g., id</span>.; <span class="italic">Speker</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. at 385. However, the application of equitable relief to excuse a statutory deadline may not always be available against the Government. <span class="italic">See Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 479 F.3d 830, 836-37 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (<span class="italic">en banc</span>); <span class="italic">Frazer v. United States</span>, 288 F.3d 1347, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="italic">RHI Holdings, Inc. v. United States</span>, 142 F.3d 1459, 1461 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Supreme Court has held that there is a rebuttable presumption that the doctrine of equitable tolling can be invoked in certain circumstances to excuse an untimely filed lawsuit against the Government. <span class="italic">See Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 95-96 (1990). Such circumstances include situations in which an appellant "has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period" or when the appellant "has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the deadline to pass." <span class="italic">Id</span>. at 96; <span class="italic">see Heimberger v. Department of Commerce</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 10 (2014). The requirements for equitable estoppel are "even more stringent," requiring affirmative misconduct by the Government. <span class="italic">Frazer</span>, 288 F.3d at 1353-54; <span class="italic">see Perez Peraza v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 9 (2010) (explaining that, to prove a claim of equitable estoppel, a party must show affirmative misconduct and reasonable reliance on the misconduct to that party's detriment). Given that the requirements to establish equitable tolling are less stringent than the requirements to establish equitable estoppel, we analyze whether the appellant meets the lower burden of establishing that equitable tolling is warranted under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The doctrine of equitable tolling does not extend to mere "excusable neglect." <span class="italic">Wood</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 593 (quoting <span class="italic">Irwin</span>, 498 U.S. at 96). Moreover, equitable tolling is a rare remedy that is to be applied in unusual circumstances and generally requires a showing that the appellant has been pursuing his rights diligently and some extraordinary circumstances stood in his way. <span class="italic">Heimberger</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 10. Here, the appellant cannot meet this burden. On review, he argues that an equitable exception should apply to excuse the untimely filing of his appeal because of the significant burden he assumed in pursuing his appeal through a hearing on the merits of his removal. However, he has not alleged either that he pursued his rights diligently during the statutory filing period or that he was induced or tricked by the agency's misconduct into allowing the deadline to pass. <span class="italic">See Heimberger</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 10. Indeed, he has not set forth any explanation for his untimely filing. We note that, although the agency provided the appellant an incorrect statement of the deadline to file a Board appeal--advising him that he had 30 calendar days as opposed to the 10 business days prescribed by the statute--he filed his appeal 14 days beyond the incorrect date set by the agency. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant has not demonstrated that he acted with due diligence in pursuing his appeal or that any extraordinary circumstances stood in the way of his timely filing. <span class="italic">See Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 381, &#x00B6; 12 (2009) (finding the application of equitable tolling unwarranted when the appellant's failure to file a timely complaint was a result of his own lack of due diligence in preserving his legal rights). Thus, even if equitable relief is available under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714, the appellant would be ineligible to receive it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the availability of equitable relief to excuse an untimely filed appeal under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714, we are inclined to believe that equitable tolling is available under appropriate circumstances given our reviewing court's analysis in <span class="italic">Kirkendall</span>, 479 F.3d at 836-43, which concluded that appeals filed under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 are subject to equitable tolling. However, as set forth above, the appellant here has alleged no facts that would bring him within the doctrine of equitable tolling. Therefore, we need not, and do not, decide whether equitable exceptions may be invoked in appropriate circumstances to excuse an untimely filed appeal under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714. <span class="italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h) (providing that the Board is prohibited from issuing advisory opinions); <span class="italic">see also Wood</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 593 (concluding that the Board need not decide whether the doctrine of equitable tolling could be applied in IRA appeals brought under the WPA because the appellant did not allege any facts to bring him within the doctrine).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Equitable estoppel was applied to excuse an appeal filed after the ten-day limit under 38 USC 714 when the decision notice to the appellant stated the time to appeal was 30 days and the appellant met the latter deadline, <span class="italic">Hemann v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="italic">Ledbetter</span>, the Board concluded that the first and third bases discussed above did not apply to an appeal of an action taken under section 714. <span class="italic">Ledbetter</span>, 2022 MSPB 41, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10. Specifically, regarding the first basis for waiver, the filing deadline cannot be waived because 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 does not provide for waiver. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. Regarding the third basis, the statute does not require the agency to notify its employees of their election rights or any associated filing deadlines. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. However, the Board concluded in <span class="italic">Ledbetter</span> that the deadline set forth in section 714 could be subject to equitable estoppel or equitable tolling and that it was inclined to believe that equitable tolling is available in appeals of actions taken under section 714 under appropriate circumstances. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11, 14.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Supreme Court has held that there is a rebuttable presumption that the doctrine of equitable tolling can be invoked in certain circumstances to excuse an untimely filed lawsuit against the Government. <span class="italic">See Irwin v.

As it must, the Board has followed the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in this area. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Ledbetter</span>, 2022 MSPB 41, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="italic">Heimberger v. Department of Commerce</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 10 (2014); <span class="italic">Wood</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 593.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge observed that "the statute makes clear it provides for an expedited appeal process," and he concluded that equitable tolling should not apply in the instant case. In arriving at this conclusion, he reasoned that the decision notice "mistakenly cited the wrong information with regard to the filing deadline" but that there was no evidence to suggest that the mistake was "intentional or rose to the level of affirmative misconduct on the agency's part to reach the high bar required under principles of equitable tolling." He also noted the agency's argument that language in the decision notice referred the appellant "to the MSPB website for information regarding the appeals process and procedures that must be followed." He stated that the information at the Board's website at the hyperlink provided in the decision notice specifies that an appellant has 10 business days to file an appeal following an adverse action taken under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714. Lastly, the administrative judge also considered that the appellant was represented by legal counsel at the outset of his appeal, but he reasoned that an appellant is personally responsible for the diligent prosecution of his appeal, even if he is represented. ID at 4-5 (citing <span class="italic">Taylor v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 27, 28-29 (1992)). Although he acknowledged "the confusion attributable to the erroneous information regarding filing deadlines contained in the decision letter," the administrative judge ultimately concluded that the case did not present facts that would "serve to excuse strict adherence to the 10-day filing deadline required under &#x00A7; 714."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted previously, in his petition for review, the appellant reiterates his argument that equitable tolling should apply. He argues that the administrative judge ignored the fact that he complied with the 30-day deadline set forth in the decision notice and that the administrative judge's finding that the appellant should have known the deadline was incorrect because the statute provides for an expedited process "falls well outside any reasonable expectation of due diligence on [the] [a]ppellant's part." The appellant also claims that he "made every effort to actively pursue his [remedies before the Board] based on the information contained in the [decision notice]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we acknowledge that equitable tolling is a "rare remedy," <span class="italic">Heimberger</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="italic">see Irwin</span>, 498 U.S. at 96, we agree with the appellant that its application is appropriate under the circumstances of this case. We have considered the administrative judge's reasoning that the incorrect appeal rights provided by the agency were the result of an "inadvertent mistake" and that the unintentional error did not constitute affirmative misconduct sufficient to invoke equitable tolling. However, the administrative judge does not cite any legal authority to support the proposition that maliciousness or ill intent is required to invoke equitable tolling based on a claim that a party was "induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass." <span class="italic">See Irwin</span>, 498 U.S. at 96. Nor does the agency cite to any authority to support such a proposition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, our research has not revealed such a requirement, and the limited jurisprudence is, at a minimum, silent on the question of motive. For example, in setting forth the scenarios to which equitable tolling applies, the Supreme Court in <span class="italic">Irwin</span> relied on its prior decision in <span class="italic">Glus v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal</span>, 359 U.S. 231 (1959). <span class="italic">See Irwin</span>, 498 U.S. at 96 n.4. In <span class="italic">Glus</span>, the petitioner alleged that an employer's representative either "fraudulently or unintentionally" misled him to believe that he could bring an action within 7 years after the cause of action "accrued," despite a statutory filing deadline of 3 years. <span class="italic">Glus</span>, 359 U.S. at 231-32 &#x0026; n.2. Silent on the employer's representative's motive, the Court stated that "[t]o decide the case we need look no further than the maxim that no man may take advantage of his own wrong." <span class="italic">Id</span>. at 232. The Court held that the petitioner was entitled to have his case tried on the merits if he could prove his allegations that he was "justifiably misled into a good-faith belief that he could begin his action at any time within [7] years after it had accrued." <span class="italic">Id</span>. at 235. Thus, in <span class="italic">Glus</span>, equitable tolling was applied without regard to the opposing party's motive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other cases, our reviewing court and the Board have discussed what might trigger the application of equitable tolling without any discussion of the motive behind opposing parties' actions, even when the application of equitable tolling was ultimately denied. In <span class="italic">Frazer v. U.S</span>., 288 F.3d 1347, 1349-50 (Fed. Cir. 2002), our reviewing court considered whether equitable tolling should be applied when former shareholders and directors of a defunct financial institution brought suit against the United States approximately 9 months after the applicable statute of limitations ran. However, the appellants did not allege any misconduct on the part of the Government, and the court ultimately did not apply equitable tolling. <span class="italic">Id</span>. at 1353-54. The court remarked, without mention of motive, that equitable tolling "is available only when the lateness is attributable, at least in part, to misleading [G]overnmental action." <span class="italic">Id</span>. at 1353-54. Notably, the court distinguished equitable tolling from equitable estoppel, concluding that "the requirements for equitable estoppel are even more stringent; equitable estoppel requires affirmative [G]overnmental misconduct." <span class="italic">Id</span>. at 1354.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="italic">Heimberger</span>, after the statutory period for filing an individual right of action (IRA) appeal had passed, the appellant filed a request to reopen her case with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), OSC denied the request, and the appellant filed an IRA appeal with the Board, arguing that she filed a timely appeal because timeliness should be calculated from the date of OSC's denial of her request to reopen, rather than from the date of OSC's initial close-out letter. 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4. The Board examined the language in the original OSC close-out letter, noting that it notified the appellant of her Board appeal rights and the time limit for pursuing them, and invited her to seek reconsideration directly from OSC. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12. Because the OSC letter appeared to have given the appellant two options for further action, but did not inform her of the consequences of electing one versus the other, the Board acknowledged that a reasonable person might have been affirmatively misled by this language into seeking reconsideration from OSC while the filing period with the Board continued to run. <span class="italic">Id</span>. Without regard to OSC's motive in drafting the close-out letter, the Board reasoned that such a circumstance would constitute a t least an arguable basis for equitable tolling. <span class="italic">Id</span>. Nonetheless, because the appellant in <span class="italic">Heimberger</span> resigned herself to the close-out decision for over a year before she started to pursue the matter again with OSC, the Board concluded that the appellant failed to show a sufficient basis to toll the filing deadline. <span class="italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">None of the above-discussed cases, or any others identified by the Board, suggest that an opposing party's misconduct or misleading language must be committed or provided with maliciousness or ill intent in order to trigger equitable tolling. Rather, they simply suggest that when a party takes an action or provides language that misleads an adversary, that party may not benefit from that action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it cannot be reasonably disputed that the agency's language informing the appellant that he had 30 calendar days from the effective date of his removal or 30 calendar days from his receipt of the removal notice, whichever was later, to appeal his removal to the Board misled him into believing that a 30-day filing period was permitted. The agency's inclusion of a reference to the Board's website, which included accurate information on the filing period, or the appellant's reliance on counsel does not change this analysis. As such, we find that the underlying facts establish that the agency "induced or tricked" the appellant into allowing the statutorily required 10-day filing deadline to pass. <span class="italic">See Irwin</span>, 498 U.S. at 96. Accordingly, we find that the circumstances of this case warrant the equitable tolling of the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_904"></span>Further, it appears undisputed that the appellant filed his appeal within the 30-day period provided to him by the agency, and the evidence suggests that he actually had attempted to file his appeal several days before the 30-day period was set to expire, but was not able to do so because the Board's e-Appeal system was down. Thus, we find that the appellant acted with due diligence within the filing period that he reasonably believed to be correct. <span class="italic">Cf. Ledbetter</span>, 2022 MSPB 41, &#x00B6; 13 (declining to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling even when the agency provided incorrect appeal rights because the appellant failed to show that he filed his appeal within the incorrect timeframe provided by the agency). Based on the foregoing, we find that the appellant is entitled to have the statutory 10-day filing deadline equitably tolled. <span class="italic">See Irwin</span>, 498 U.S. at 96; <span class="italic">Heimberger</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For a mixed case, the time for a direct Board appeal under 38 USC 714 is 30 (calendar) days, <span class="italic">Davis v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 45, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-19 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="italic">Wilson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5, 25, the Board held that when an individual covered by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714[5] files a mixed-case appeal after filing a formal discrimination complaint with the agency, the appeal is governed by the procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 and the Board's implementing regulations, regardless of whether the adverse action was taken pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714. In this appeal, the appellant did not file a formal discrimination complaint with the agency, but rather raised allegations that the agency violated EEO statutes for the first time in his Board appeal. As discussed below, we expand upon the holding in <span class="italic">Wilson</span> and find that the principle articulated in that decision applies regardless of whether the individual filed a formal complaint of discrimination with the agency or raised allegations that the agency violated EEO statutes for the first time in his Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;A "covered individual" includes all individuals occupying positions at the agency, except for individuals who are in the Senior Executive Service, appointed under the authority of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7306, 7401(1), 7401(4), or 7405, still serving in a probationary or trial period, or political appointees. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(h)(1). Nothing in the record suggests that the appellant occupies a position that falls under one of these exceptions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">The appellant's mixed-case appeal is subject to the procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702.</span></p>

Thus, pursuant to the plain language of the statute, because the agency effected the appellant's removal on January 31, 2020, an appeal under section 714(c)(4) was due on February 14, 2020. The appellant's March 2, 2020 appeal was thus untimely filed if section 714(c)(4) applied.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The CSRA provides at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) that when an employee "has been affected by an action which the employee...may appeal to the [Board], and alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination," as described within various anti-discrimination statutes, "the Board shall, within 120 days of the filing of the appeal, decide both the issue of discrimination and the applicable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701] and this section." The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) as "[d]efining the [Board's] jurisdiction in mixed-case appeals that bypass an agency's EEO office." <span class="italic">Perry v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 137 S. Ct. 1975, 1981 (2017).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As correctly observed by the appellant, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 is silent as to the procedures that apply when an appeal of a removal action taken under the statute includes an allegation of discrimination or reprisal for the exercise of EEO rights. Thus, the material issue here is whether the procedures and timelines set forth in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714, or 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154 apply when an appellant files an appeal directly with the Board of an adverse action taken under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 and alleges violations of EEO laws.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously addressed the relationship between 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 and 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714. In <span class="italic">Wilson</span>, the Board reviewed whether an appellant had timely filed an appeal of his demotion taken under the VA Accountability Act when he first filed a formal EEO complaint with his agency, and then subsequently appealed his demotion to the Board after the agency failed to issue a final decision within 120 days. <span class="italic">Wilson</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-25. Specifically, in that case, the Board had to determine whether the 10-business-day deadline contained within 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(B) applied, or whether 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(e)(2) applied, which allows appellants to file a Board appeal after filing a formal EEO complaint if the agency does not issue a final agency decision within 120 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After noting that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 was silent on the issue of procedures and filing times for appeals alleging discrimination or retaliation in violation of EEO statutes, the Board looked to the CSRA, which expressly included procedures for processing mixed cases in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. <span class="italic">Wilson</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13. We observed that Congress specifically delegated to the Board the authority to decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's procedures under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 14; <span class="italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). The Board in <span class="italic">Wilson</span> took special note of a Senate Report at the time the Board was created, which explained that "[a]ny provision denying the Board jurisdiction to decide certain adverse action appeals because discrimination is raised as an issue would make it impossible for the Government to have a single unified personnel policy which took into account the requirements of all the various laws and goals governing Federal personnel management." <span class="italic">Wilson</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, &#x00B6; 14 (quoting S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 53 (1978), <span class="italic">as reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N 2723, 2775). Thus, the Board found that the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702, coupled with the Senate's language stressing the importance of the Board's authority to review discrimination claims in adverse action appeals, confirmed that an employee who first elects to file an EEO complaint retains his right to later Board review of the agency's adverse action and any associated discrimination claims. <span class="italic">Wilson</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted by the Board, <span class="italic">Wilson</span> was not the first time that a tribunal confronted how a newly enacted statute affects related laws that it does not reference. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 15. In <span class="italic">Wilson</span>, the Board relied on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <span class="italic">Morton v. Mancari</span>, 417 U.S. 535, 537-39, 545 (1974), in which the Court declined to find that a new statute repealed a preexisting statute by implication despite alleged inconsistencies between the statutes. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16. The Court stated in <span class="italic">Morton</span> that repeals by implication are disfavored and that congressional intent to repeal a statute "must be clear and manifest." <span class="italic">Morton</span>, 417 U.S. at 549-51 (quoting <span class="italic">United States v. Borden Company</span>, 308 U.S. 188, 198 (1939)); <span class="italic">see Wilson</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, &#x00B6; 15. Further, "[w]hen there are two acts upon the same subject, the rule is to give effect to both if possible." <span class="italic">Morton</span>, 417 U.S. at 551 (quoting <span class="italic">Borden Company</span>, 308 U.S. at 198). The Court continued that "when two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective." <span class="italic">Morton</span>, 417 U.S. at 551; <span class="italic">see Wilson</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in <span class="italic">Wilson</span> observed that the Court has recognized factors that might lead to repeal by implication, although it found them inapplicable in <span class="italic">Morton</span>. <span class="italic">Wilson</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, &#x00B6; 16; <span class="italic">see Morton</span>, 417 U.S. at 550-51. These included when the statutes at issue are "irreconcilable," or when the older statute is broader in scope than the newer, more specific statute. <span class="italic">Morton</span>, 417 U.S. at 550-51; <span class="italic">see Todd v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 55 F.3d 1574, 1577-78 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (stating that repeal by implication is appropriate only when statutes are irreconcilable or "the enactment so comprehensively covers the subject matter of the earlier statute that it must have been intended as a substitute"; a statute addressing a "narrow, precise, and specific subject is not submerged by a later enacted statute covering a more generalized spectrum"); <span class="italic">Bergman v. Department of Transportation</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 6 (2006) (holding that specific statutory language aimed at a particular situation ordinarily controls over general statutory language).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Guided by the relevant precedent, the Board in <span class="italic">Wilson</span> determined that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 does not repeal, either explicitly or implicitly, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; <span id="Page_905"></span>7702. <span class="italic">Wilson</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-19. First, the Board explained that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 does not expressly repeal 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702, as it is silent regarding the procedures and time limits applicable to mixed-case appeals. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 17. Next, the Board determined that the factors that would render a repeal by implication appropriate were not present, as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 was the more specific statute regarding the processing of mixed cases. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17. Further, the Board found 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 and 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 were capable of co-existing, explaining as follows: if an appealable action is taken pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714, and the covered individual has not filed a formal complaint of discrimination with the agency, then the 10-business-day deadline set forth at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(B) would apply. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 19. If however, such an individual has first filed a formal discrimination complaint with the agency from such an adverse action, then the time limit set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(e)(2) would apply to any subsequent Board appeal, which allows an appellant to file an appeal with the Board at any time after the 120th day following the filing of the formal complaint if an agency decision on that complaint has not been received. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 19. Accordingly, the Board applied 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(e)(2), and found that the appellant was timely in filing his mixed-case appeal with the Board. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 25.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board in <span class="italic">Wilson</span> specifically declined to address whether 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 would apply if a "covered individual" directly filed a Board appeal alleging that an action taken pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 was based on discrimination. <span class="italic">Wilson</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, &#x00B6; 19 n.5. These are the circumstances present here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant statutory subsections in <span class="italic">Wilson</span> were 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(2) and (e)(2), which provide for a Board appeal following the filing of a mixed-case complaint with an employing agency. In this matter, the relevant statutory subsection is 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), which the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted as "[d]efining the [Board's] jurisdiction in mixed-case appeals that bypass an agency's EEO office." <span class="italic">Perry v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 137 S. Ct. 1975, 1981 (2017); <span class="italic">see Austin v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 136 F.3d 782, 783 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) for the proposition that "[a]n employee may initiate a mixed case directly with the Board and seek a decision on both the appealable action and the discrimination claim"). In interpreting statutes, "each section of a statute should be construed in connection with every other section so as to produce a harmonious whole." <span class="italic">King v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 22, 29 (1996) (citing 1A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction &#x00A7; 46.05 (5th ed. 1993)). Additionally, it is well settled that the provisions of a unified statutory scheme should be read in harmony, leaving no provision inoperative or superfluous. <span class="italic">Holley v. United States</span>, 124 F.3d 1462, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="italic">Styslinger v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 17 (2007), <span class="italic">overruled on other grounds by Oram v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2022 MSPB 30. As part of the CSRA's unified statutory scheme and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 as a whole, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) must be read in harmony, and treated consistently, with the remainder of that statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, for the same reasons as those set forth in <span class="italic">Wilson</span>--the silence of the VA Accountability Act regarding its relationship to the mixed-case procedures set forth in the CSRA, the absence of any clear and manifest intent by Congress in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 to repeal the mixed-case provisions of the CSRA, the strong preference against repeal of a statute by implication and in favor of reading statutes together, and the fact that the statutes can co-exist--we find that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) continues to govern mixed-case appeals filed directly with the Board. In other words, an appellant who files an appeal of an adverse action taken pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 and alleges violations of EEO statutes in the first instance before the Board has filed a mixed case, which is governed by the procedures and the timelines established by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 and its implementing regulations, and not 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714. To find otherwise would be to treat the continuing applicability of the various subsections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 differently and to render section 7702(a)(1) inoperative when an action is taken under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714. This would be contrary to well-established principles of statutory construction. <span class="italic">See Holley</span>, 124 F.3d at 1468; <span class="italic">Styslinger</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In so finding, we recognize that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 does not make it impossible for an appellant to raise issues of discrimination in a direct Board appeal and follow the timelines set forth in that statute. Nevertheless, as discussed above and in <span class="italic">Wilson</span>, nothing in section 714 supports a finding that it repeals, either expressly or by implication, any of the mixed-case procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. Thus, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) remains applicable to mixed-case appeals of actions taken under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 when discrimination is raised for the first time before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">The appellant's mixed-case appeal was timely filed and, accordingly, this matter must be remanded to the administrative judge for further adjudication.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant filed an appeal directly with the Board alleging, among other things, that his removal was the result of race discrimination and retaliation for prior EEO activity. Because the appellant filed a mixed-case appeal, the procedures contained within 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 and the Board's implementing regulations apply. Those regulations provide that mixed-case appeals must be filed within 30 days of the effective date of the agency's action or 30 days after the date of the appellant's receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(a). The agency removed the appellant effective January 31, 2020, and the time period for filing began at that time. The appellant filed his mixed-case appeal on March 2, 2020, and thus it was timely filed. Accordingly, we remand the appeal for further adjudication.</p>
