<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-341"><span class="space">24.</span> Fiduciary Responsibility; Employee Debt</h4>
<p class="noindent">At least through 2021, and the <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> decision, <span class="Italic">post</span>, the law did not preclude an arbitrator from reviewing the application of management's plan to prevent loss or damage to agency property, i.e., particular assessments of pecuniary liability against an individual employee. That 10 USC 9835 (now repealed) made determinations of the Air Force Secretary as to pecuniary liability "final" did not overcome &#x00A7; 7121 of the Statute. Title 10 applied to Air Force statutory procedures and was not meant to displace negotiated grievance procedures established under the Reform Act. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 214 and Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 21 FLRA 244, 251 (1986). In a grievance concerning responsibility for government property, the arbitrator could properly determine that no liability existed as to the grievant and bar the government from reopening proceedings. <span class="Italic">IBEW and Army Support Command, Hawaii</span>, 14 FLRA 680, 682 (1984). In an extensive discussion of decisions of the Comptroller General, FLRA concluded in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 15 and IRS</span>, 33 FLRA 229, 234-37 (1988), that an arbitrator may consider whether an employee is negligent relative to a finding of fiduciary responsibility against an accountable officer who loses funds entrusted to him or her. The Comptroller General's involvement in recovery and waiver cases arises only after an employee is found negligent by the agency head. Nothing in the statute, 31 USC 3527(a), placing in the agency head responsibility for determining negligence of an accountable employee, clearly and specifically prevents that employee from challenging the management determination of negligence.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator could consider a grievance contesting a liability determination under the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended. 5 USC 5514 provides the government with the authority to take offsets against the salaries of employees to collect debts owed to the United States under regulations of the OPM at 5 CFR 550 subpart K (2022). Internal agency procedures for appealing those claims are replaced by the negotiated grievance procedure, although statutory appeal procedures denominated as exclusive would preclude use of a grievance procedure. But there was no exclusive statutory procedure. That nonunit employees did not have the advantage of the grievance procedure did not preclude its use; the Reform Act specifically contemplated that result. <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 22 FLRA 142, 146 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">Without much analysis of precedent, and over the dissent of Chairman DuBester, who pointed out the majority decision's shortcomings, <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRBU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-25.html">72 FLRA 133</a> (2021) (Chairman DuBester dissenting), decided that <span id="page_2341"></span>an arbitrator could not review an agency's decision "whether there is fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee requesting the waiver" of a debt created by salary overpayment. We provide the majority and the dissent's analysis, and it is likely that when FLRA membership changes the <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> result will be overruled. From the majority opinion, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, 72 FLRA at 135:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584(b)(1), governing waiver of debt as a result of salary overpayment, because the Agency has the discretion to evaluate any indication of fault by the grievant. The Agency also argues that under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584(b)(1), once the Agency's authorized official finds that the grievant is at fault, the official <span class="Italic">must</span> reject any request for a debt waiver.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that if a law indicates that an agency's discretion over a matter is intended to be sole and exclusive, or exercised only by the agency, then, under the Statute, the agency is not required to exercise discretion on that matter through collective bargaining and the matter may not be grieved.[21] In determining whether discretion is sole and exclusive, the Authority examines the plain wording of the relevant law.[22]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA 815, 816 (2004).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584(a) states that an authorized official may properly waive a debt arising from an erroneous payment if, as relevant here, the collection of that payment would be "against equity and good conscience."[23] However, the authorized official's discretion is limited. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584(b)(1), in granting such a waiver, the authorized official "may not exercise his authority...to waive any claim...if, in his opinion, there exists, in connection with the claim an indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee...[requesting] a waiver of the claim."[24] Because &#x00A7; 5584 prohibits the Agency from granting a waiver if the authorized official believes there is fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the requesting employee, &#x00A7; 5584 also prohibits an arbitrator from second guessing such an agency determination through the negotiated grievance process.[25]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">This conclusion reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the doctrine upon which it is based.&#x2003;It is true enough that &#x00A7; 5584 grants the Agency discretion, acting through its authorized official, to grant or deny a debt-waiver request. But that does not answer the question of whether Congress intended this discretion "to be sole and exclusive"--in other words, "that it is intended to be exercised <span class="Italic">only by the agency</span>."[34]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Until now, the Authority has answered this question by engaging in a thorough examination of the pertinent statute's language and legislative history to determine if it contains language "excluding or limiting the application of other laws" to the discretion afforded the agency.[35] And while the Authority has held that a law "need not use any specific phrase or words in order to confer sole and exclusive discretion,"[36] it has found that the absence of wording expressly preempting application of other laws to the agency's discretion is a "strong indication that Congress did not intend the [agency] to have unfettered discretion" over the matter at issue.[37] At a bare minimum, we have consistently required <span class="Italic">some</span> expression of legislative intent to afford an agency unfettered discretion over the matter in question.[38]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Such an expression is absent from &#x00A7; 5584.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the grievance is not substantively arbitrable because under &#x00A7; 5584, "Congress has precluded the Arbitrator and the Authority from reviewing th[e] Agency's decision <span class="Italic">not</span> to compromise or waive [the g]rievant's debt."

<p class="noindent-1">Substantive arbitrability involves questions as to whether the dispute's subject matter is arbitrable.[27] When an arbitrator's substantive-arbitrability determination is based on law, the Authority reviews that determination <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.[28] In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law.[29] In making this assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings.[30] When an arbitrator's substantive-arbitrability determination is based on an interpretation of the parties' agreement, the Authority reviews that determination under the deferential "essence" standard.[31]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The issues before the Arbitrator included the existence and amount of the grievant's debt, and whether the Agency's decision not to waive the debt violated the parties' agreement or law. We find that the Arbitrator did not err by finding the grievance arbitrable. We arrive at that conclusion for three reasons: (1) the language of &#x00A7; 5584 does not expressly prohibit review of an agency's debt-waiver decision; (2) the Authority has reviewed awards involving &#x00A7; 5584 and has found the issue substantively arbitrable;[33] and (3) the Arbitrator determined that the parties' agreement encompasses the resolution of grievances such as the one underlying this case, and the Agency does not except to the Arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' agreement on essence grounds.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 66 FLRA 888, 890-91 (2012) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>) (finding claims that arose under &#x00A7; 5584 may be properly waived when an agency erroneously overpaid employees by under-deducting taxes from their salaries); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of VA, Charles George VA Med.

<p class="noindent-1">Section 5584 does not prohibit review of an agency's debt-waiver decision through a negotiated grievance procedure (NGP). Section 5584(a)(1) provides that an erroneous payment "may be waived in whole or in part by" an "authorized official."[34] The Arbitrator focused his analysis on the Agency's claim that the word "may" under &#x00A7; 5584(a) allowed it unreviewable discretion. Rejecting "the Agency's claim that the decision to waive or not waive a debt is...exempt from any review," the Arbitrator found that "[t]he word 'may' [under] &#x00A7; 5584...is far too slender a reed upon which to rest a conclusion that the Agency enjoyed unreviewable discretion to decline to waive a debt, even when collection of the debt would be against equity and good conscience." We agree with the Arbitrator's reading of &#x00A7; 5584. Thus, the Agency has not demonstrated that &#x00A7; 5584 excludes its debt-waiver decision from the NGP.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[34]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Authority has reviewed arbitration awards involving agency actions under &#x00A7; 5584 and has found such actions to be substantively arbitrable.[37] The Agency has not identified any precedent to the contrary. As the Agency has not shown that the grievance is prohibited by &#x00A7; 5584, the Arbitrator's determination that the grievance is substantively arbitrable is not contrary to law.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The dissent relies on several cases to support its claim that an agency's discretion in making a &#x00A7; 5584 debt-waiver determination is "exclusive." However, this reliance is misplaced. <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. United States</span>[39] does not address whether an agency's discretion to waive a debt under &#x00A7; 5584 is reviewable by an arbitrator under an NGP. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Lawrence</span>, the Court of Federal Claims (Claims Court)--recognizing its limited jurisdiction--explained that it had neither "general federal question jurisdiction,...nor the right generally to review final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act [(APA)]."[40] Because of its general lack of jurisdiction, the Claims Court in <span class="Italic">Lawrence</span> did not specifically hold, as the dissent claims, that "an agency's exercise of its discretionary authority under &#x00A7; 5584 is not subject to judicial review." Instead, in <span class="Italic">Lawrence</span>, quoting <span class="Italic">Krug v. United States</span>,[42] the Claims Court noted that "it is an <span class="Italic">open question</span> whether an agency's denial of a discretionary award is reviewable at all" under the APA.[43] And <span class="Italic">Krug</span> does not even concern &#x00A7; 5584.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We note that opinions of the Comptroller General are not binding on the Authority,[56] but that the Authority has stated that those opinions serve as "expert opinion[s] that should be prudently considered."[57] There is no apparent basis for declining to rely on the Comptroller General's opinion on this issue, particularly as it is consistent with the Arbitrator's award and not challenged by the parties.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator considered whether the grievant was at fault for the overpayment, and concluded that the grievant "honestly and reasonably believed that she was entitled to be paid at the GS-14[/9] rate." Applying &#x00A7; 5584, he found that the grievant was not at fault for the overpayment because: (1) the grievant "understood...from her interviews...that there was sufficient [hiring] flexibility to encompass the increase in pay"; (2) consistent with her honest and reasonable belief, "the [g]rievant...thanked...[her immediate supervisor]...both orally and in writing" for the pay increase; and (3) the grievant did not "remain secretive and silent about her pay increase." Based on these factual findings, to which the Agency does not except, the Arbitrator concluded that the evidence presented by the Union supports the conclusion that the grievant would not have known that the Agency erred when it hired her at the GS-14/9 level. Thus, the Agency has not shown that the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law in finding that the grievant was entitled to have part of her debt waived because she was not at fault under &#x00A7; 5584.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator's determination that an agency need not waive an overpayment, or portions of it, was sustained, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3615 and SSA OHA, Falls Church</span>, 57 FLRA 19, 22 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The federal government may waive monetary claims against its employees when collection would be "against equity and good conscience and not in the best interests of the United States." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584(a). "Generally, these criteria will be met by a finding that the erroneous payment occurred through administrative error and that there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee." 4 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 91.5(b). However, whether waiver is granted "must necessarily depend upon the facts existing in the particular case<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the overpayment should be waived because the grievant paid taxes on it at "a large financial...loss" as a result of the Agency's mistakes, misinformation, and failure to respond to his inquiries. We reject this argument because the grievant could have returned the overpayment, thus avoiding paying taxes on it, without forfeiting his right to seek waiver. <span class="Italic">See</span> 4 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 92.6. <span class="Italic">See also United States Pub. Works Ctr.</span>, 27 FLRA 156, 157-58 (1987). Moreover, the Agency promptly notified the grievant that he had been overpaid, and informed him that he would be liable for taxes on the overpayment if he failed to return it. The Union does not argue, and the record does not suggest, that the grievant paid taxes on or made other use of the overpaid funds prior to being notified that he had been overpaid. Given these considerations, the Union has not demonstrated that the Agency's collection of the overpayment would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our conclusion that the Union has not established that the standard for waiver has been met is consistent with decisions of the Comptroller General.&#x2003;The Comptroller General has found that, even when an employee is not at "fault" under 4 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 91.5(b) with regard to the receipt and retention of an erroneous payment, "where an agency's prompt notification of an overpayment to an employee precludes him from relying on the accuracy of the payment to his detriment, waiver is not appropriate since collection of the payment would not be against equity and good conscience<span class="Italic">." In re John Wessels</span>, No. B-265874, 1996 WL 276406, at *2, (Comp. Gen. May 22, 1996) (citation omitted) (<span class="Italic">Wessels</span>). In the present case, as in <span class="Italic">Wessels</span>, the grievant was notified approximately three weeks after receiving the payment that he had been overpaid, and, as noted above, there is no evidence that he used the funds to his detriment prior to that notification. Moreover, the Comptroller General has held that the tax consequences to an employee of an overpayment do not permit waiver of a debt that does not otherwise meet the requirements for waiver. <span class="Italic">In re Richard C. Clough</span>, 68 Comp. Gen. 326, 328 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator considered the grievant's payment of taxes, and the Union's allegations of Agency mistakes, misinformation and failure to respond to the grievant's inquiries, in concluding that waiver of the overpayment was not warranted. The Union has not shown that the Arbitrator's determination that the standard for waiver had not been met is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584 or its implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may apply a provision of a contract to waive pecuniary liability for damage to government property by a unit employee. The award does not abrogate the agency's right to determine its internal security practices if it leaves undisturbed management's right to impose damages for willful, disobedient, or certain negligent conduct. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Blue Grass Army Depot and IAM Local Lodge 859</span>, 38 FLRA 1232, 1237 (1990) (remanding for consideration of impact of agency rule defining negligence). Expanding on the authority of an arbitrator to resolve issues pertaining to responsibility for damaged federal property, <span class="Italic">FOP New Jersey Lodge 173 and Dept. of Army, Army Garrison Ft. Monmouth</span>, 58 FLRA 384, 386 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that grievance procedures negotiated under &#x00A7; 7121 of the Statute are "exclusive for resolving all grievances which come within their coverage." <span class="Italic">Council 214, </span>21 FLRA at 247. In order for a statute to remove a matter from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure, there must be "clear[,] specific indications that the statutory procedures were intended to be exclusive<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 249. <span class="Italic">Accord AFGE,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 3258, </span>53 FLRA 1320, 1325-26 (1998). This requirement is met, for example, by wording that an administrative review procedure "does not authorize an appeal outside the agency or judicial review" and that "the procedure and the decision upon appeal may not be subject to negotiation, arbitration, or agreement." <span class="Italic">United States Dept of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA, </span>996 F.2d 1246, 1249 (D.C. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With particular regard to the matter in dispute here, the Authority has stated that "[u]nless it can be shown that [an a]gency's procedures for determining pecuniary liability are intended to be the exclusive procedures for resolving that issue, such matters are within the scope of the negotiated procedure." <span class="Italic">Council 214,</span> 21 FLRA at 248. Further, the Authority has found that statutes providing a particular individual with "final" authority to decide issues of employee liability do not preclude arbitrators from resolving grievances involving such liability. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 251; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3258</span>, 53 FLRA at 1328-330.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the Authority has held that &#x00A7; 4835 does not preclude arbitral review of financial penalties against Agency employees. <span class="Italic">See Int'l</span> <span class="Italic">Bhd. of Elec. Workers, </span>14 FLRA 680, 681-82 (1984). While &#x00A7; 4835 states that action taken against an employee based on destruction to government property "is not final until approved by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee," it does not contain "clear[,] specific indications" that the negotiated grievance procedure is intended to be barred or that the statutory procedures in &#x00A7; 4835 are intended to be exclusive. <span class="Italic">Council 214,</span> 21 FLRA at 249.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As &#x00A7; 4835 does not preclude arbitral review of financial penalties against Agency employees, the Arbitrator misinterpreted &#x00A7; 4835. Thus, his determination that the grievance is not substantively arbitrable is contrary to &#x00A7; 4835.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was sustained that denied a grievance complaining that the agency was acting as a debt collection agency against employees. The agency's request <span id="page_2344"></span>to employees to resolve derogatory debt information obtained through the pre-employment process and a five year reinvestigation did not violate the Fair Debt Collection Act of 1977, because the agency did not act as a collection agency. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prison Locals, Local 171 and DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, FCI El Reno</span>, 49 FLRA 525, 528 (1994). An arbitrator's award that precluded the agency from pursuit of debt collection under a particular set of circumstances did not interfere with the right of the agency to determines its mission, since it did not prevent the agency from determining that recoupment of the debt was necessary to the mission. The award required the agency to recoup the costs consistent with provisions of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, Rocky Flat Field Office and AFGE Local 1103</span>, 59 FLRA 159, 163 (2003).</p>
