[T]he Arbitrator's order that the Agency promote the grievant to the GS-9 level does not interfere with the Agency's right under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute to determine its organization."). Implementation of a prior decision to select an individual for the promotion is not an appointment. An arbitrator does not interfere with management's appointment authority by directing a career ladder promotion. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 17 and VA Cent. Office</span>, 24 FLRA 424, 426 (1986). An award correcting a procedural error in the implementation of a career promotion does not interfere with the agency's right to assign work or to direct employees. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA Jacksonville Ctr. and PASS</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-039.html">60 FLRA 165</a>, 167 (2004). An award directing a career ladder promotion does not interfere with the right of the agency to establish its organization; interference could involve negotiability of a proposal to establish the career ladder in the first place. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Customs Serv., Pac. Region</span>, 32 FLRA 1141, 1148-49 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">"[A] violation of collective bargaining agreement provisions setting career ladder requirements can constitute an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action for purposes of the Back Pay Act." <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 3342</span>, 51 FLRA 1700, 1705 (1996). A noncompetitive promotion scheme need not by called a "career ladder" to permit an award directing promotion. <span class="Italic">See Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA,</span> 64 FLRA 76, 78 (2009) (MOU between parties establishing program for noncompetitive procedures for promotion from level 1 engineer to journeyman level 3; backpay was properly awarded when arbitrator found arbitrary failure of agency to have promoted or recommended promotion of grievant, who was qualified for promotion under negotiated criteria).</p>

Instead, such a promotion merely implements a decision to assign work that was made when the agency initially selected the employee for the career ladder position<span class="Italic">. See HHS</span>, 51 FLRA at 751. "Once an employee is selected into a career ladder position, the intention of the career ladder is,...to prepare the employee for successful noncompetitive promotions when the conditions prescribed by agreement or regulation are met<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. We find no basis for applying a different principle in connection with management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. Cf.

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency acknowledges that an arbitrator may examine a collective bargaining agreement in order to determine whether the requisite conditions for promotion are met, the Agency argues that the parties' contract does not contain any such conditions, and thus, that the Arbitrator had no basis for finding that a promotion was warranted. However, as discussed previously, the Arbitrator implicitly found that the contract does contain such conditions--performance of GS-13 work and a fully successful performance appraisal--and the Agency has not demonstrated that this finding fails to draw its essence from the agreement. As such, we find that the award does not affect management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute, and we deny the exception.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Because the award does not affect management rights, it is unnecessary to apply the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>analysis<span class="Italic">. See Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>, 57 FLRA at 277-78.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, a supervisor's appraisal of an employee does not necessarily constitute a decision to promote the employee. However, nothing in &#x00A7; 4302 precludes an arbitrator from finding that, under a collective bargaining agreement, a successful performance appraisal (along with performance of higher-graded duties) entitles an employee to a promotion. Accordingly, the Agency provides no basis for finding the award contrary to &#x00A7; 4302, and we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;The Back Pay Act, 5 U.<span class="Italic">S.C. &#x00A7; 5596.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, an award of backpay is authorized only where an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the employee's pay, allowances, or differentials<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Def., Def. Commissary Agency, Fort Lee, Va.</span>, 56 FLRA 855, 859 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first requirement, a breach of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action<span class="Italic">. See GSA</span>, 55 FLRA 493, 496 (1999). An arbitrator's finding of a contract violation satisfies this requirement even if the arbitrator fails to specify what contract provision was violated<span class="Italic">. See United States DOD, Army &#x0026; Air Force Exch. Serv., Dallas, Tex.</span>, 49 FLRA 982, 991-93 (1994) (finding that agency violated "law, regulations, and the collective bargaining agreement" sufficient); <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 42 FLRA at 1347 (finding that agency "violated the Labor Contract"). Applying this precedent, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency violated the parties' agreement satisfies the first Back Pay Act requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the second requirement, the Authority has found that a direct causal connection may be "implicit from the record and the award." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins <span id="page_2028"></span>Air Force Base, Ga.</span>, 52 FLRA 938, 942 (1997) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 31</span>, 41 FLRA 514, 519 (1991)). The Authority has found this requirement met where an arbitrator found that an agency violated an agreement's promotion provisions and it was not disputed that the failure to be promoted resulted in a loss of pay to the grievant<span class="Italic">. See id. </span>at 518<span class="Italic">. See also NFFE, Local 2030</span>, 56 FLRA 667, 673 (2000) (award satisfied Back Pay Act where arbitrator found agency failed to comply with agreement by failing to initiate nondiscretionary process to give grievant timely career-ladder promotion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the denial of the promotion violated the parties' agreement, and he directed that the grievant "be made whole for all losses caused by the failure to promote her to GS-13...." It is undisputed that this failure to promote resulted in a loss of pay to the grievant. In these circumstances, we conclude that the award and the record provide a sufficient basis for finding that the unjustified and unwarranted personnel action directly resulted in the loss of pay to the grievant and, thus, that the award satisfies the second Back Pay Act requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2030 and Dept. of Interior, BLM, Idaho Falls</span>, 56 FLRA 667, 672-73 (2000), reviewed the requirements for an award of a career ladder promotion and a remedy of back pay:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of backpay is authorized under the Back Pay Act only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or the reduction of an employee's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 54 FLRA 1210, 1218-19 (1998) (Authority clarified that a requirement that the pay loss would not have occurred but for the unwarranted action is not a separate, independent requirement of the Act but merely amplifies the causal connection requirement of the Act). A violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Act. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Defense, Department of Defense Dependents Schools and Federal Education Association</span>, 54 FLRA 773, 785 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the grievant was employed in a career ladder position, that he satisfied the three major requirements for a career ladder promotion under the Agreement, and that he was therefore entitled to a retroactive promotion. The Agency disagrees and argues that the award of retroactive promotion is contrary to the Back Pay Act because the delay in approving the grievant's promotion preceded an approval by the properly authorized official.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the award is not contrary to the Back Pay Act.&#x2003;In this regard, a career-ladder promotion is the direct result of an agency's decision to select an employee and place the employee in a career-ladder position in the agency. The agency's selection of an employee and the placement of that employee in a career-ladder position also constitutes the agency's decision to promote that employee noncompetitively at appropriate stages in the employee's career up to the full performance level of the position, once the requisite conditions have been met. <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R2-98 and Department of the Army, Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, New York</span>, 29 FLRA 1303, 1310 (1987); <span class="Italic">see also Local 3342</span>, 51 FLRA at 1705-06. The Arbitrator found that provisions in the parties' Agreement, including Article 15.6B, require management to initiate the "nondiscretionary" process whereby an employee is promoted to the next higher grade once the employee has satisfied all the requirements for a career ladder promotion, and that the Agency failed to comply with these provisions. The Arbitrator further found that the grievant had not only satisfied all the requirements for promotion from GS-5 to GS-6, as indicated by his PIPR, but was actually working at the full performance level of GS-7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Arbitrator's findings establish that the grievant occupied a career ladder position and, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, was entitled to a nondiscretionary career ladder promotion when the requisite conditions were met. <span class="Italic">See Local 3342</span>, 51 FLRA at 1706. Further, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency failed to comply with the Agreement by failing to initiate the nondiscretionary process to timely promote the grievant satisfies the requirement under the Back Pay Act for an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action but for which the grievant would have been promoted to GS-6 as of April, 1998.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Authority cases relied on by the Agency--<span class="Italic">SSA [American Federation of Government Employees, San Francisco Region and Office of Program Operations Field Operations, Social Security Administration, San Francisco Region</span>, 7 FLRA 622 (1982)] and <span class="Italic">Fort Bliss [U.S. Army Air Defense Center, Fort Bliss, Texas and National Association of Government Employees, Local R-14-22</span>, 10 FLRA 161 (1982)]--are inapposite because, unlike this case, those cases concerned discretionary promotions rather than a nondiscretionary career ladder promotion, and in the case of <span class="Italic">Fort Bliss</span> involved a situation where a dispute existed as to whether the grievant met the requirements for promotion. Further, <span class="Italic">Federal Correctional Institution [American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2502 and U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Prison System, Federal Correctional Institution</span>, 17 FLRA 382 (1985)] is also distinguishable in that the arbitrator there found employees were not automatically promoted on meeting eligibility requirements, while in the instant case the Arbitrator did not make such a finding. The Comptroller General's decision, <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, is also inapposite because, unlike this case, it did not involve "nondiscretionary" action. <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, 58 Comp. Gen. at 53.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although a career-ladder promotion may be characterized in some contexts as a ministerial act, nothing in OPM regulations or statute requires a career ladder promotion, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3810 and Dept. of Commerce, EDA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-122.html">61 FLRA 631</a>, 632-33 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) does not compel an arbitrator or an agency to promote an employee in a career ladder position. In this regard, the Authority has stated "an arbitrator's enforcement of a career ladder provision in a CBA, when the grievant is in a career ladder position and has fulfilled all the requirements of the career ladder, does not affect management's right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C)." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Education</span>, 59 FLRA 820, 824 (2004). That does not, however, address or resolve whether an arbitrator or an agency is required to promote employees in career ladder positions. Therefore, the Union has failed to show how &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) requires an agency to promote a career ladder employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we reject the Union's claim that an employee in a career ladder who meets the requirement under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.104 must be promoted. In this respect, we have previously stated that there is no provision of the Code of Federal Regulations or Authority precedent that requires a career ladder promotion when an employee receives a successful performance evaluation and works 52 weeks at a lower grade.<span class="Italic"> See NTEU</span>, 60 FLRA at 228 (citing<span class="Italic"> Local 2206</span>, 59 FLRA 30 (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.104, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.604 or C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.203 do not require a career ladder promotion when employees received a successful performance evaluation and worked 52 weeks at a lower grade)). Accordingly, despite the Union's contrary claim, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.104 does not in itself require an agency to make a career ladder promotion.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.104 specifically states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">No employee shall receive a career ladder promotion unless his or her current rating of record under part 430 of this chapter is "'Fully Successful'" (level 3) or higher. In addition, no employee may receive a career ladder promotion who has a rating below "Fully Successful" on a critical element that is also critical to performance at the next higher grade of the career ladder.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Union misinterprets <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R2-98</span>, where the Authority stated "a career ladder promotion is merely a ministerial act implementing the agency's earlier decision to select and to place the employee involved in a career ladder position, with the intention of preparing the employee for successful noncompetitive promotions <span class="Italic">when the conditions prescribed by agreement or regulations are met</span>." <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R2-98</span>, 29 FLRA at 1310 (emphasis added). While parties may agree to require career ladder promotions when certain circumstances have been met, that is not the case here. In this respect, the Union cites to no "previously established conditions" between the parties by either contract or regulation that would automatically entitle the grievant to a promotion and, as such, promoting the grievant is not a mere "ministerial" act. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev., Greensboro, North Carolina</span>, 33 FLRA 81, 85 (1988) (<span class="Italic">HUD</span>);<span class="Italic"> FERC</span>, 58 FLRA at 599-600; s<span class="Italic">ee also, NTEU</span>, 60 FLRA at 228 (where no collective bargaining agreement existed specifically pertaining to promotions at the time of the alleged infraction, an employee was not entitled to a career ladder promotion simply because the employee met the necessary criteria to be eligible for such promotion under OPM regulations). As such, the Union has not shown that Arbitrator's award is deficient on this ground.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that in <span class="Italic">FERC</span> the arbitrator specifically found that the Agency had violated the parties' agreement and that the grievant was performing higher-graded work as required by the contract. <span class="Italic">FERC</span>, 58 FLRA at 597;<span class="Italic"> See NTEU</span>, 32 FLRA 1141, 1148 (1988). By contrast, here the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency's failure to promote the grievant violated the parties' agreement, noting that the parties agreed "the Collective Bargaining Agreement does not include a provision on promotions. As set forth above, the Authority has determined that in the absence of an agreement or agency regulation, an agency is not obligated to promote an employee in a career ladder position. Accordingly, in the absence of the Union showing that either a contract violation or a regulation required the Agency to promote the grievant, the award is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">The contract provisions relied on by an arbitrator who directs a career ladder promotion must support a finding that in the absence of a contract violation the remedy awarded would have been the same management action. In <span class="Italic">VA Cleveland Reg'l Office and AFGE Local 2823</span>, 59 FLRA 248, 251 (2003), the grievants claimed career ladder promotions from GS-9 to GS-11. The agency instituted a GS-10 after the grievants were hired, but the arbitrator concluded <span id="page_2029"></span>that the agency did not properly negotiate changes in the career ladder promotion system under the procedures identified in its contract. FLRA set aside an award that directed promotion to GS-11 because the arbitrator did not make the requisite finding that the GS-11 levels would have been achieved in the absence of the contract violations involving changes to the career ladder promotion system:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award and record do not reflect that the grievants' failure to be promoted to the GS-11 level is attributable to the Agency's failure to follow the procedures of the agreement. To the extent that the Arbitrator found that the Agency failed to follow the procedures of the agreement, his opinion addresses only why he concluded that the Agency did not fully meet its obligations <span class="Italic">under the procedure</span>. The award does not address what would have happened if the Agency had met its obligations. In particular, nothing in the award establishes that if the Agency had met its contractual obligation to notify the Union and bargain, the grievants would have been promoted to GS-11. Similarly, nothing in the Arbitrator's findings or the record demonstrates, explicitly or implicitly, that the grievants would have been promoted to GS-11 if the Agency had not violated the master agreement by failing to provide the grievants with a position description or a career ladder plan.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, nothing in the Arbitrator's findings or the record supports a causal connection between an unwarranted personnel action of the Agency and the grievants' failure to be promoted to GS-11<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Soc. Sec. Admin., Office of Hearings and Appeals, Orlando, Fla.</span>, 54 FLRA 609, 614 (1998) (arbitrator's award did not reflect any connection between the failure to follow promotion procedures and the failure of the grievant to be selected for promotion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because of the nature of the contractual provisions involved in this case, this case is different from other Authority decisions holding that the requirements of the Back Pay Act are satisfied when an arbitrator finds that an agency violated an agreement by failing to initiate the nondiscretionary process whereby an employee is promoted once the employee satisfies all the requirements for a career ladder promotion<span class="Italic">. See NFFE, Local 2030</span>, 56 FLRA 667, 673 (2000); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 51 FLRA 1700, 1706 (1996). In contrast to those cases, the Arbitrator here enforced contractual provisions that simply required the Agency to notify the Union at the local level and bargain on a change in career ladder position, and to provide the grievants with a position description and a career ladder plan. These provisions do not mandate a promotion. Moreover, as noted, the award and record do not reflect that the grievants would have received the career ladder promotion sought if the Agency had complied with these provisions of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the award of backpay is deficient as contrary to the Back Pay Act<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Army, Army Missile Command, Multiple Launch Rocket Sys. Project Office, Redstone, Ala.</span>, 56 FLRA 388, 391 (2000). As the remedy awarded is contrary to the Back Pay Act, it must be set aside<span class="Italic">. See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The career ladder promotion may be awarded if all the preconditions, including recommendation for the promotion, are met and the promotion is denied as a result of an administrative error. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Customs Serv., Pac. Region</span>, 32 FLRA 1141, 1149 (1988). But the conditions for promotion through the career ladder must be met. For an arbitrator properly to award a career ladder promotion to an employee who would have received it during the period covered by an unjustified removal, there must be evidence that the employee's production or performance would have been appraised at a level justifying the promotion. <span class="Italic">OPM and AFGE Local 32</span>, 9 FLRA 676, 681 (1982). In dispute may be whether there is a sufficient amount of work to justify promotion to the next level of the ladder. That issue is one of fact for the arbitrator's determination. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 24 FLRA 435, 439 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 1568</span>, 33 FLRA 308, 313-14 (1988) (appropriate for arbitrator to determine whether all conditions for meeting career ladder promotion have been met, including determination of whether sufficient work exists to justify promotion); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 3294</span>, 59 FLRA 243, 246 (2003) (if several similarly situated employees claimed career ladder promotions, but there was not enough work for all of them, arbitrator must determine who among the group was entitled to promotion; arbitrator cannot award back pay relief to them all if there was not enough work to warrant promoting them all).</p>
<p class="noindent">Nothing in the OPM regulations governing career ladder promotions precludes an arbitrator from concluding that, under a negotiated agreement, progressing satisfactorily in a position is a criterion an employee must satisfy to be entitled to promotion. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2206 and SSA Southeastern Program Serv. Ctr.</span>, 59 FLRA 30 (2003). Entitlement to a career ladder promotion may depend on the arbitrator's evaluation of the ability of the grievant to perform higher-level duties, <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, HRSA</span>, 60 FLRA 226, 228 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A career-ladder promotion "is the direct result of an agency's decision to select an employee and place the employee in a career ladder position in the agency." <span class="Italic">Local R2-98</span>, 29 FLRA at 1310. "The agency's selection of an employee and the placement of that employee in a career ladder position also constitutes the agency's decision to promote that employee noncompetitively at appropriate stages in the employee's career up to the full performance level of the position, once the requisite conditions have been met." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator determined that, even though the grievant had received favorable performance appraisals, the grievant was not entitled to a career-ladder promotion because she did not satisfy the promotion criteria of the collective bargaining agreement. In its exceptions, the Union contends that the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant was not entitled to a career-ladder promotion in 1998 is contrary to Authority precedent. The Union relies on <span class="Italic">Local 2030</span>. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument that the grievant satisfied requirements for a career-ladder promotion set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations by receiving a successful performance evaluation and working 52 weeks at a lower grade is without merit. The Union has not specified any provision of the Code of Federal Regulations or Authority precedent that requires a career-ladder promotion when, as in this case in 1998, employees received a successful performance evaluation and worked 52 weeks at a lower grade. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 2206</span>, 59 FLRA 30 (2003) (Local 2206) (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.104, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.604 or C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.203 do not require a career-ladder promotion when employees received a successful performance evaluation and worked 52 weeks at a lower grade).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also has not specified any provision of the Code of Federal Regulations or Authority precedent that precludes an arbitrator from finding that the performance of the majority of the more difficult job duties that are unique to the next higher grade or the performance of such duties with the requisite degree of independence are criteria an employee must satisfy to be entitled to a promotion under a career-ladder. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 32 FLRA 1141, 1148 (1988) (a career-ladder promotion can occur "when the conditions prescribed by agreement or regulation are met"); <span class="Italic">cf. Local 2206</span>, 59 FLRA 30 and <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, 33 FLRA 81 (Authority denied exceptions to an award in which the arbitrator found that the conditions for a career-ladder promotion had not been satisfied).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Local 2030</span> is misplaced. In that case there was no dispute, as here, over whether the grievant met the requirements of promotion nor does that decision address the requirement for a career-ladder promotion under the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of State, Passport Serv. and NFFE Local 1998</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-40.html">73 FLRA 201</a> (2022) (arbitrator properly directed career-ladder promotion to employee whose performance was well rated when the agency failed to follow its contract by assigning complex work that, in part, justified contractual career-ladder promotion criteria).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator did not err by denying a career promotion to an employee on a part-time schedule when the contract called for a 36 months of service for the grade sought and the arbitrator resolved that time accrued on a part-time schedule is prorated when calculating an employee's qualifying experience. Even if it served as a government-wide regulation, an OPM "Part-Time Employment and Job Sharing Guide," stating that the agency "cannot prorate an employee's work time for purposes of meeting...time-in-grade requirements" does not prohibit the proration of an employee's part-time scheduled service for the purpose of calculating an employee's qualifying experience. <span class="Italic">NLRB Union and NLRB Detroit Reg'l Office,</span> 64 FLRA 311, 314 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent">A grievance and an arbitration award involving a career ladder promotion does not concern the classification of any position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12,</span> 24 FLRA 435, 437-37 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760 and DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Region II</span>, 37 FLRA 1193, 1198-99 (1990) ("A grievance and an award which pertain to whether a grievant is entitled to a career ladder or noncompetitive promotion do not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Customs Service, Pacific Region</span>, 32 FLRA 1141, 1147 (1988)."). An award does not concern a classification issue if the grievant becomes entitled to a career ladder promotion but that promotion is denied because later the agency reclassifies the position to a lower grade. <span class="Italic">DHHS, NIOSH, Cincinnati and AFGE Local 3840</span>, 52 FLRA 217, 222 (1996). <span class="Italic">DHHS, Div. of Audit Resolution and NTEU Chap. 229</span>, 51 FLRA 747, 748-50 (1996), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 51 FLRA 982 (1996), provides an example of an award granting a career promotion that involved no violation of the Classification Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency selected several individuals in 1988 as GS-13 accountants under a vacancy announcement for "Accountant GS-510-12/13/14" positions. The announcement stated that "GS-12/13 may have promotion potential to GS-14." After serving at least 1 year at the GS-13 level, one of the selectees was non-competitively promoted to the GS-14 level. In 1992, the Union filed a grievance on behalf of three other selectees, each of whom had also served at least 1 year at the GS-13 level, alleging that the Agency had improperly failed to grant them career ladder promotions to the GS-14 level. The grievance was submitted to arbitration on the following issue:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Did the Agency violate any contractual provisions or applicable regulations when it decided not to promote [the grievants] from their positions as Accountants GS-510-13, to Accountants GS-510-14[?]</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2030"></span>The Arbitrator found that the grievants were in career ladder positions to the GS-14 level, and that the parties' agreement provided that an employee in such a position will be promoted in the first pay period after: (1) the employee meets the minimum time-in-grade and qualifications requirements; (2) the employee is capable of performing at the next higher level; (3) the employee's most recent performance rating of record, as well as his or her rating on all critical elements that are also critical elements at the next higher grade level, is fully successful or better; and (4) the additional salary cost is within budgetary limitations. The Arbitrator found that each of the four criteria were met. He also found that, although the grievants had performed more complex, higher-level assignments usually performed by GS-14 employees, the sufficiency of available higher-level work was not a factor under the parties' agreement to be considered when granting career ladder promotions. The Arbitrator concluded that the grievants were entitled to promotions under the parties' agreement retroactive to 1 year from their dates of employment in their GS-13 positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Classification Act governs the classification and grading of general schedule positions.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. "Classification" of a position is defined in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c) as "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by OPM [Office of Personnel Management] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 476</span>, 47 FLRA 1053, 1060-61 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award does not analyze or identify a position or place it in a class under OPM's position-classification plan. It finds only that the Agency had previously established a career ladder for the position at issue. As such, we reject the Agency's argument that, by finding that a career ladder exists which includes the GS-14 level, the award conflicts with the Classification Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument that the award violates the Classification Act because sufficient work does not exist at the GS-14 level also does not demonstrate that the award is deficient. The Agency has not shown, and it is not apparent, how the Classification Act precludes the Arbitrator from determining that the grievants should receive career ladder promotions to GS-14, based on his finding that the grievants were performing complex, GS-14 level work.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;The Union "does not argue that availability of work at the higher grade level is not required by the Classification Act." Rather, it "asserts that when the Agency determined that the...positions were career ladder positions it necessarily determined that there was sufficient work at the grade 14 level; to discontinue the grievants career ladder the Agency must follow its own procedures[.]" This case concerns whether the grievants were in career ladder positions, not whether the Agency followed established procedures to discontinue a career ladder. Because this latter issue is not before us in this case, we do not address it here.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 7121(c)(5)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), a grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee" is removed from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, Nw. Div., Portland, Or.</span>, 59 FLRA 443, 445 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Army</span>). The Authority interprets "classification" under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) in the context of 5 C.F.R. chapter 511, which defines classification of a position as "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by [the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c). Thus, classification entails the identification of the appropriate title, series, grade, and pay system of a position. <span class="Italic">See Army</span>, 59 FLRA at 445 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.701(a)). Accordingly, where the essential nature of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties performed by the grievant in his or her permanent position, the grievance concerns classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of HUD</span>, 65 FLRA 433, 435 (2011). In contrast, a grievance concerning whether a grievant is entitled to a career-ladder promotion does not concern classification. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Army, Womack Army Med. Ctr., Fort Bragg, N.C.</span>, 65 FLRA 1017, 1020 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Womack</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. DOL</span>, 24 FLRA 435, 436-37 (1986) (<span class="Italic">DOL</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the Agency has established career ladders under which employees are converted noncompetitively from Deputy Marshal positions in one job series to Criminal Investigator positions in another job series upon meeting certain requirements.&#x2003;The Agency does not contend that the award improperly addressed the conversion of employees from one position/series to another. Rather, the Agency's classification argument is that the Arbitrator improperly addressed the grade level at which employees were converted and, in so doing, ignored the Agency's "'specialized experience' requirement for GS-1811-11 promotion."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the standard set forth above, the grievance did not challenge the appropriate title, series, grade, or pay system of either the Deputy Marshal or the Criminal Investigator position. Instead, the grievance alleged that, <span class="Italic">within the Agency's already-established career ladders</span>, GS-09 Deputy Marshals should have been converted to Criminal Investigator positions at the GS-11 level if they had satisfied the time-in-grade requirement (without regard to whether they met specialized-experience requirements). As such, the grievance did not involve "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by OPM under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Reg'l Office, Winston-Salem, N.C.</span>, 66 FLRA 34, 39 (2011) (grievance that did not involve the grievant's title, series, grade, or pay system did not involve classification). Instead, it challenged only how employees advance within the established career ladder. Thus, it is analogous to a grievance arguing that a grievant is entitled to a career-ladder promotion, which does not involve classification. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Womack</span>, 65 FLRA at 1020; <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, 24 FLRA at 436-37.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the Agency's claim that, to the extent the grievants are challenging the Agency's change in the number of years spent between grades in the career ladder in 2009, "that too is barred from grievance arbitration as a classification matter." But there is no basis for finding that the grievance challenged this change. As such, we reject the Agency's claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the grievance did not involve classification as alleged, and deny the Agency's &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Back Pay Act </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of backpay is authorized under the Back Pay Act when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 54 FLRA 1210, 1218-19 (1998) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>). In connection with the first requirement, the Authority has held that a violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Act. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In connection with the second requirement, the Authority examines whether the arbitrator has found that, but for the unjustified or unwarranted action, the loss of pay, allowances, or differentials would not have occurred. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that an employee "must meet the minimum qualification requirements prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management" for a higher-graded position in order to receive a temporary or permanent promotion to that position. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Indian Head Div., Indian Head, Md.</span>, 58 FLRA 498, 500 (2003). Specifically, the Authority has held that an employee must meet both "time-in-grade requirements and specialized experience requirements." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def., Def. Commissary Agency, Fort Lee, Va.</span>, 56 FLRA 855, 859 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Def. Commissary Agency</span>). (Member Wasserman concurring). Thus, the Authority has set aside awards of backpay to grievants who did not possess specialized experience required for promotion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, Headquarters Fort Dix, Fort Dix, N.J.</span>, 49 FLRA 730, 736-37 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined that the Agency's 2009 policies violated Article 40 of the parties' agreement. Thus, the Arbitrator found that the Agency committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See HHS</span>, 54 FLRA at 1218-19. We have denied the Agency's essence exception challenging that determination. Accordingly, we find that the award meets the first requirement of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the second requirement, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's 2009 policies "resulted in a delayed promotion that in essence, was a clear reduction or loss in pay." The Agency contends, without dispute, that employees are required to have one year of post-training-program specialized experience performing Criminal Investigator duties before they can be promoted to the GS-11 level. However, the Arbitrator did not address this issue and made no relevant findings as to any of the grievants. Without this finding, we are unable to determine whether, but for the Agency's violation of the agreement, any of the grievants would have met the qualifications for promotion to the GS-11 level. As such, we cannot determine whether the award satisfies the second requirement of the Back Pay Act as to any of the grievants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the Authority finds that an arbitration award is contrary to law in whole or in part, and is able to determine how it may be modified to <span id="page_2031"></span>bring it into compliance with law, the Authority modifies it. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Complex, Tucson, Ariz.</span>, 66 FLRA 355, 356 (2011) (modifying award to exclude, among other things, unlawful award of interest); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 987</span>, 66 FLRA 143, 148 (2011) (modifying award to require payment to grievant to which he was legally entitled). By contrast, where the Authority is unable to determine whether an arbitration award is contrary to law, the Authority remands for further findings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, Headquarters, III Corps &#x0026; Fort Hood, Fort Hood, Tex.</span>, 56 FLRA 544, 547 (2000) (Authority could not determine whether award was consistent with Back Pay Act). Thus, the Authority repeatedly has remanded arbitration awards granting promotions or backpay where the record was insufficient for the Authority to determine whether the grievants met the qualification standards for those promotions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Def. Commissary Agency</span>, 56 FLRA at 859-60; <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr.

State Office, New Orleans, La.</span>, 53 FLRA 1611, 1620-21 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we are unable to determine whether the award of backpay to <span class="Italic">any </span>grievant is consistent with the Back Pay Act. As such, we cannot determine whether the award can be modified in a way that will render it consistent with law. Consistent with the foregoing, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for further findings.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may award a retroactive promotion with back pay to an employee when the arbitrator determines that the agency violated its collective bargaining contract and that the violation resulted in the denial of a promotion that the aggrieved employee would otherwise have received. Or the promotion obligation may arise from past practice, as, for example, the practice of promoting an employee into a career ladder position to the highest level supported by his qualifications. <span class="Italic">Council of Dist. Office Locals, AFGE, San Francisco Region and Office of Program Operations, Field Operations, SSA, San Francisco Region</span>, 5 FLRA 759, 761-62 (1981). <span class="Italic">DHHS, NIOSH, Cincinnati and AFGE Local 3840</span>, 52 FLRA 217, 223-24 (1996), discussed an arbitration award involving a career ladder promotion tied to past practice:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, an award of backpay is authorized if: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials; and (3) but for such action, the grievant otherwise would not have suffered the withdrawal or reduction. <span class="Italic">E.g., Local 3342</span>, 51 FLRA at 1705 (1996). A violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Agency contests only whether the first requirement is met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award of backpay is consistent with Authority case law.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Council of District Office Locals, American Federation of Government Employees, San Francisco Region, AFL-CIO and Office of Program Operations, Field Operations, Social Security Administration, San Francisco Region</span>, 5 FLRA 759 (1981) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). In <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the grievant was appointed to a GS-4 position and contended that the agency abridged a past practice that placed a promoted employee at the highest grade level for which he or she qualified. The arbitrator found that such a past practice concerning promotions existed and that, for the purpose of formulating a remedy consistent with the Back Pay Act, an established past practice is as much a part of the collective bargaining agreement as the actual written provisions. The arbitrator concluded that the promotion benefit at issue, "although an unwritten policy, is still an integral part of the parties' agreement and as such constitutes a 'non-discretionary obligation' which the Activity failed to meet<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 760. Accordingly, the arbitrator awarded the grievant a promotion with backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In denying the agency's exceptions to the award, the Authority agreed with the arbitrator and found that the past practice was incorporated in the collective bargaining agreement even though it was not so expressly stated<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 762 (citing <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1429</span>, 5 FLRA 272 (1981) (citing <span class="Italic">Steelworkers v. Warrior and Gulf Navigation Co.</span>, 363 U.S. 574, 582 (1960)). Thus, the award met the first requirement under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had a policy, established by past practice, that it violated by failing to promote the grievant when she became eligible for that promotion. This practice created a nondiscretionary policy concerning a term or condition of employment that became incorporated into the parties' agreement. Thus, the first requirement under the Back Pay Act has been met. The Agency does not allege, and there is no basis for concluding, that the other requirements under the Back Pay Act or any other law have not been met. Accordingly, the award is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was appropriate that required, pursuant to contract, that a delayed career ladder promotion be made retroactive to the date it should have been granted, <span class="Italic">DHS, CIS and AFGE Local 3928</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-19.html">73 FLRA 82</a>, 82-86 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a June 18, 2021 award, the Arbitrator framed the issue as "[d]id the Agency violate Article 43 of the CBA by failing to timely and retroactively process nondiscretionary [CLPs]?" The Arbitrator noted that Article 43 provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[CLPs] shall be processed in a timely manner once an employee has met the criteria for promotion eligibility. Once the criteria are met, the promotion will be made effective at the beginning of the following pay period. If the determination is delayed, and that determination is that the employee met the criteria on the date of eligibility, the promotion will be retroactive where allowed by law. Promotions will be processed retroactively if a delay occurs after the supervisor's determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 250.101 directs agencies to comply with OPM's GPPA, and that the GPPA instructs that no personnel action, including CLPs, can be made effective prior to the date on which the duly-designated appointing officer authorized the action.<span class="Italic"> </span>According to the Agency, the promotions at issue here could not be made effective prior to August 30, 2020--the date when the appointing officer approved them--and, therefore, the Arbitrator's award directing the promotions be made retroactive is contrary to a government-wide regulation and several Comptroller General and Authority decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an exception involves an award's consistency with regulation, the Authority reviews any questions of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority determines whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable legal standard. In making that determination, we defer to the arbitrator's underlying findings of fact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously stated that decisions of the Comptroller General are not binding on the Authority.[31] The Authority has noted that although a Comptroller General opinion serves as an expert opinion that should be prudently considered, it is not one to which the Authority must defer.[32] However, in cases where the parties and the arbitrator have examined Comptroller General precedent to address legal questions raised by a grievance, the Authority has assumed the applicability of that precedent when assessing contrary-to-law exceptions to the resulting arbitral award.[33] Here, the parties extensively cited Comptroller General precedent to the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator cited Comptroller General precedent and relied on Authority cases analyzing Comptroller General precedent, and the Agency and Union both cite Comptroller General precedent in the exceptions and opposition, respectively. Accordingly, we will examine and apply the relevant decisions of the Comptroller General in resolving the Agency's contrary-to-government-wide-regulation exception to the award.[35]</p>

In its exceptions, the Agency does not challenge the Arbitrator's finding that Article 43 makes CLPs nondiscretionary or dispute the CLP eligibility of any potentially affected employee.

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to retroactively promote the grievant to a career-ladder GS-9 Loan Analyst position.

Therefore, an arbitrator's enforcement of a career ladder provision in a CBA, when the grievant is in a career-ladder position and has fulfilled all the requirements of the career-ladder, does not affect management's right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">HUD, </span>59 FLRA at 247.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that had the Agency instructed the grievant on the steps and criteria for a career-ladder promotion, as required under Article 18, and had the supervisor not been so antagonistic, the grievant would have successfully completed her proficiency package by June 10, 2002 and been promoted at that time, rather than August 12, 2002, when completion was actually achieved as a result of meaningful steps to comply with Article 18. Accordingly, as the award enforces the career-ladder provision in the parties' CBA, and as the factual findings conclude that the grievant would have successfully fulfilled all the requirements of the career-ladder by June 10, 2002 had the Agency complied with the CBA, the award does not affect the Agency's right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute.

<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Award Is Not Contrary to the Back Pay Act</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, the Authority reviews questions of law raised by a party's contentions <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. An award of a retroactive promotion with backpay is authorized under the Back Pay Act only when: (1) the aggrieved employees were affected by an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action resulted in a loss of pay by the employees because of a failure to be promoted.<span class="Italic"> See United States Dep't of Health and Human Services</span>, 54 FLRA 1210, 1218-19 (1998) (clarifying that a requirement that the pay loss would not have occurred "but for" the unwarranted action is not a separate, independent requirement of the Act, but merely amplifies the Act's causal connection requirement). A violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified personnel action under the Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2030, </span>56 FLRA 667, 673 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the grievant was employed in a career-ladder position and that had the supervisor properly instructed the grievant on the steps and criteria for a career-ladder promotion, as required under Article 18, and not been so antagonistic toward her, the grievant would have successfully completed the core proficiencies. The Arbitrator found that "but for the [Agency's] failure to comply with Article 18 of the CBA, the [g]rievant would have successfully completed her proficiency package by June 10, 2002 and [would have been] eligible for promotion at that time." The Arbitrator found, therefore, that the grievant was entitled to a retroactive promotion at the beginning of the first pay period following June 10, 2002.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's assertion, the Arbitrator specifically found that but for the Agency's failure to comply with the career ladder provision of the parties' CBA-Article 18, the grievant would have completed her proficiency package by June 10, 2002 and would have been eligible for promotion at that time. Therefore, the Arbitrator's award of backpay is authorized under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the Agency asserts that the record does not support the Arbitrator's conclusion that the contract violation resulted in a delay of grievant's eligibility for promotion, this assertion is construed as nonfact exception and is addressed below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;The Award is Not Based on a Nonfact</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that an award is deficient as based on a nonfact, the appealing party must demonstrate that a central fact underlying the award is clearly erroneous, but for which the arbitrator would have reached a different result. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Co.</span>, 48 FLRA 589, 593 (1993). Moreover, the Authority will not find an award deficient on the basis of an arbitrator's determination on any factual matter that the parties disputed at arbitration. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Health and Human Serv., Denver, Co.</span>, 56 FLRA 133, 135 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2033"></span>The Agency's assertion that the record does not support the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agency's contract violation resulted in a delay of the grievant's eligibility for promotion because the grievant did not satisfy the requirements until August 12, 2002, provides no basis for finding the award deficient. This issue was disputed at the hearing. Therefore, the Agency has not established that the Arbitrator based his award on nonfacts, and we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the timing of a career ladder promotion, an arbitrator may determine that the agency has established a policy to promote individuals when they have demonstrated full performance at the higher level. Once that condition is met, the ministerial act of promotion cannot be withheld without a lawful reason. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R2-98 and Dept. of Army, Watervliet Arsenal</span>, 29 FLRA 1303, 1309-10 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2145 and VAMC, Richmond</span>, 39 FLRA 1045, 1046-50 (1991), noted that restrictions inherent in performance-based actions did not apply to career-ladder promotions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant, a GS-5 dietetic technician, filed a grievance over the Agency's failure to provide the grievant with a career-ladder promotion to GS-6 dietetic technician position....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued before the Arbitrator that there were two reasons for failing to promote the grievant: (1) the grievant made more errors in her work than did other dietetic technicians, and (2) the grievant had not demonstrated the ability to perform at the GS-6 level. The Arbitrator rejected both of the Agency's arguments. The Arbitrator stated that...the Agency had failed to prove to the Arbitrator's satisfaction that the quality of the grievant's work differed from that of the other GS-6 dietetic technicians.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the Arbitrator denied the grievance. The Arbitrator concluded that, consistent with the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Horner v. Bell</span>, 825 F.2d 382 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">Bell</span>), he was not authorized to "substitute [his] opinion about [the] grievant's promotion potential for that of her supervisors."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Bell</span>, the United States Court of Appeals reversed an arbitration award involving the demotion of an employee from a GS-10 position to a GS-5 position. As relevant here, the arbitrator determined in <span class="Italic">Bell</span> that the affected employee's performance was unsatisfactory but, on the basis of a provision in the parties' agreement, directed the agency to reassign the employee to another position at the GS-10 level. The court held that an arbitrator could not modify a penalty imposed by an agency in a performance-based action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302. The court also held that the award was "based on an erroneous interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement...." <span class="Italic">Bell</span>, 825 F.2d at 385. The court noted that the applicable agreement provision provided only that a supervisor "may" propose to reassign an employee whose performance was unacceptable, and stated that the provision could not "fairly be read as requiring the agency" to effect such reassignment.... The court also stated, in this regard, that the arbitrator "was not justified in substituting his judgment for that of the agency regarding the grade level position and work that [the affected employee] could perform."... Finally, as relevant here, the court held that even if the agreement provision could be read as requiring a reassignment of the affected employee, that provision was not enforceable because it did not constitute either a negotiable procedure or an appropriate arrangement under section 7106 (b) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency acknowledges, the case now before us does not involve a performance-based action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 and is not one which otherwise would be within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. As such, the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Bell</span> does not apply directly here. More importantly, however, the rationale used by the court in <span class="Italic">Bell</span> does not apply here. We note two things.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, as noted previously, the court held in <span class="Italic">Bell</span> that the arbitrator's interpretation of the applicable collective bargaining agreement was erroneous. In this case, by contrast, we have no basis on which to disturb the Arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' agreement. That is, there is no contention that the award fails to draw its essence from the agreement and no other basis on which to find that the Arbitrator's interpretation of the agreement is irrational or implausible so as to be deficient on that basis. As such, the court's discussion of the disputed contractual provision, and arbitral authority thereunder, does not apply here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, there is no assertion, and no basis on which to conclude, that the portion of the parties' agreement in dispute here is not enforceable. Consistent with long-standing Authority precedent, agreement provisions addressing career-ladder promotions, similar to the one now before us, are enforceable....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Arbitrator's conclusion that he was constrained to deny the grievance based on <span class="Italic">Bell</span> is inconsistent with law. As such, the award is deficient under section 7122(a) of the Statute. We will, therefore, grant the Union's exception and remand the dispute to the parties for resubmission to an arbitrator of their choice for resolution of the grievance in accordance with this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may not award placement into a career ladder position, any more than he can direct back pay, without a finding that a contract violation directly resulted in the loss of the opportunity granted in the award. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 24 FLRA 134, 135 (1986). In the context of a career promotion case, involving a finding that about 90% of employees were promoted, a finding that a supervisor's failure to recommend promotion was arbitrary did not constitute the requisite determination that but for the unwarranted or unjustified action the grievant would definitely have been promoted. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and POPA</span>, 21 FLRA 397, 399-400 (1986). For an arbitrator to award a retroactive career ladder promotion, the arbitrator must find that had career ladder been properly implemented, management would have promoted the grievant. FLRA set aside an award by an arbitrator who failed to credit management's evidence that a career ladder promotion would not have been awarded because of performance deficiencies. It was unclear whether FLRA was rejecting the arbitrator's view of the evidence, or his view of the criteria for career promotion, or whether FLRA concluded the arbitrator had to accept management's opinions of worthiness for career advancement without evaluating conflicting evidence pertaining to performance or promotion criteria. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2811 and Gov't Dist. Office, SSA, St. Paul</span>, 7 FLRA 618, 620-62 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA made clear its dissatisfaction with the arbitrator's incomplete analysis of a career promotion grievance, setting aside an award in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2502 and DOJ, Fed. Prison Sys., FCI</span>, 17 FLRA 382, 383-84 (1985):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In terms of this case, the Authority concludes that the Arbitrator has not made the findings necessary to a proper award of retroactive promotion and back pay. The Arbitrator's findings that the failure to recommend the grievant's career-ladder promotion was arbitrary and that in the Arbitrator's judgment the grievant was worthy of promotion do not constitute the requisite finding that but for the arbitrary action of the grievant's supervisor, the grievant would definitely have received a career-ladder promotion on her eligibility date. In view of the Arbitrator's acknowledgment that employees in career ladders are not automatically promoted when they meet the eligibility requirements for the higher-grade position, the Arbitrator's finding that the failure to recommend the grievant for promotion was arbitrary plainly does not constitute the requisite finding that the grievant was affected by an unwarranted action that directly resulted in the denial of a promotion that the grievant otherwise would definitely have received.... Likewise, the Arbitrator's finding that in his judgment the grievant was worthy of promotion plainly does not constitute the requisite finding that but for the unwarranted action, the responsible agency officials would have considered the grievant worthy of promotion and would originally have promoted the grievant, especially in view of the testimony that the grievant's deficiencies were more extensive than writing ability alone....</p>
<p class="noindent">Although there is supposed to be a causal connection between management action involving a promotion and a grievant's failure to obtain promotion, the proof of causation may depend upon indirect factors. In <span class="Italic">NLRB Union Local 19 and Office of Gen. Counsel, NLRB</span>, 7 FLRA 21, 25-26 (1981), the grievant failed to obtain a promotion from GS-11 to GS-12 because of a writing deficiency. The arbitrator concluded that the agency violated the contract by not remedying the deficiency and awarded back pay after determining that, had the training been provided, the grievant would have obtained the promotion. His other work was satisfactory. FLRA sustained the award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Activity appears to be arguing that the agreement provision found to be violated must contain specific language therein mandating a promotion before one can be given and backpay paid under the Back Pay Act. However, there is nothing in either the Back Pay Act or its implementing regulations to support such an assertion. Thus, where an arbitrator has found that the agreement mandates that a particular action be taken (as in this case, providing an employee with training in a particular area) and that the failure to take that action directly resulted in an employee not receiving a promotion the employee otherwise would have received, then an arbitrator's award directing the promotion and corresponding backpay is clearly consistent with the employee's entitlement "to receive for the period for which the [unjustified and unwarranted] personnel action was in effect...an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee would normally have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred...."</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA decisions concerning career ladder promotions do not control an award involving an initial selection into a position, even if the selection is pursuant to a memorandum of understanding that defines the conditions of a career ladder promotion after the employee has been selected for the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, San Francisco Region and AFGE Council 147</span>, 48 FLRA 293, 302 n.2 (1993).
