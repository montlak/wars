<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-189"><span class="space">a.</span> Balloting Requirements</h5>
<p class="noindent">FLRA addressed the procedures to disaffiliate a local union from its parent in <span class="Italic">Union of Fed. Employees and NFFE Local 405</span>, 41 FLRA 562, 584-88 (1991). The regional director determined that the procedures followed by the NFFE local to disaffiliate from NFFE did not comply with the <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> procedures. As a result, the region refused to amend the certification and FLRA was asked to review the regional result. FLRA granted the application for review to determine when steps taken concerning a proposed change of affiliation must meet the <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> requirement that a vote be taken by "secret ballot," and what constitutes a "secret ballot." The case should be read for its discussion concerning the clarity of the notice of the election on disaffiliation. As to the nature of a secret ballot, FLRA explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the Regional Director, the Authority has not specifically addressed the issue of what standard is to be applied when determining whether a vote on a proposed change of affiliation meets the <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> requirement that such a vote be taken by "secret ballot." Accordingly, the Regional Director examined the private sector standard in such cases, as well as the U.S. Department of Labor standard used in internal union officer elections under the LMRDA. She concluded that the LMRDA standard is appropriate, and that, under that standard, the vote taken in this case did not qualify as a vote by secret ballot as required by <span class="Italic">Montrose</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we find that a substantial question of law or policy is raised by the absence of case precedent on this issue, we grant the application for review of this part of the Regional Director's decision. We conclude that the standard used in LMRDA elections is more restrictive than necessary in the circumstances of an affiliation vote. We find that under the standard discussed below, the vote herein was conducted in a manner sufficient to comply with the <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> requirement that it be conducted by secret ballot.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we agree with the Regional Director that, in view of the precedent developed since <span class="Italic">Montrose</span>, we should not adopt the private sector standard that examines only whether "procedures used were so substantially irregular as to negate the validity of the election." <span class="Italic">East Dayton Tool &#x0026; Die Company</span>, 190 NLRB 577, 579 (1971)....&#8197;This broadly stated standard has permitted the NLRB, on occasion, to validate affiliation elections conducted with no semblance of secrecy....&#8197;In contrast to the development of the law in the private sector, the Authority and the Assistant Secretary of Labor and Federal Labor Relations Council before it have consistently required that such a choice be conducted by "secret ballot."...&#8197;We see no reason to change this requirement. However, we must now define the term "secret ballot" in the context of a vote governed by <span class="Italic">Montrose</span>. We do so in a way that will preserve the integrity of internal union election processes without creating unreasonable procedural barriers to the self-expression of a union membership that is seeking to make an affiliation decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the LMRDA standard, adopted by the Regional Director in this case, places too great a restriction on union members who are attempting to voice their desires with regard to an internal union affiliation issue. We recognize, in this regard, that section 2421.15 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations defines "secret ballot" in almost identical language as the LMRDA and its regulations.[3] <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 402(k); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 452.97(a). Further, we recognize, as noted by the Regional Director, that two United States courts of appeals have interpreted the LMRDA as requiring an assurance of absolute secrecy to the voter who is choosing internal union officers. Nonetheless, we do not believe that level of assurance to be required in evaluating whether a decision for or against affiliation or disaffiliation has properly been made.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Section 2421.15 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Secret ballot" means the expression by ballot, voting machine or otherwise, but in no event by proxy, of a choice with respect to any election or vote taken upon any matter, which is cast in such a manner that the person expressing such choice cannot be identified with the choice expressed, except in that instance in which any determinative challenged ballot is opened.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In large part, our decision is based on the fact that the Authority has no statutory mandate to conduct or assure the validity of elections concerning a union's internal structure or affiliations. In contrast, the Department of Labor is specifically mandated by the LMRDA to enforce the requirements of the election requirements of that Act. Similarly, the Authority is mandated by the Statute to supervise or conduct representational elections by secret ballot before it can certify that a labor organization should be accorded exclusive recognition. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b). With regard to a petition to amend an existing certification, however, the Authority is required only to investigate the petition and, in certain circumstances, to hold a hearing to determine whether a question of representation exists. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2). A secret ballot is required in such circumstances only if the Authority finds the existence of a question of representation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. There is no statutory requirement that the evidence presented at the representational hearing regarding the desires of union members on an affiliation issue reflect the same degree of secrecy as was required in the original Authority-conducted election. In this regard, we note that the Supreme Court has stated that an affiliation that does not raise a question of representation does not implicate the election procedures of the NLRB. <span class="Italic">Financial Institution Employees</span>, 475 U.S. at 203. Further, in that case the Court stated that "Congress has expressly declined to prescribe procedures for union decisionmaking in matters such as affiliation."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this and future cases involving affiliation issues, we will consider the appropriate level of secrecy to have been preserved under <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> where the evidence establishes that: the members have voted by individual ballots; reasonable precautions have been taken to ensure the secrecy of those ballots; and no voter has objected and demonstrated that his or her privacy or free choice was compromised by the conduct of the election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, all the circumstances of the balloting must be taken into account to determine whether the arrangements reasonably satisfy the requirement that voters be able to cast their ballots without revealing their choices. We reject as unnecessary the suggestion that all voters must cast their ballots in a booth or private room to fulfill this requirement. As noted above, the test is whether voters had the opportunity to mark their ballots in a manner that preserves the secrecy of their choice. If the procedures reasonably gave that opportunity, we will be satisfied that the secret ballot requirement of <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> has been met, absent evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the record reveals that written, individual ballots were cast by 29 people in a large cafeteria. Representatives of the League of Women Voters, a disinterested third party, conducted the election. Before receiving their ballots, all voters were told that when they got their ballots they were to "...just step to an area in private and vote."...&#8197;They were further informed that the Union had not been able to obtain voting booths because of a local election scheduled the next day, but that a nearby unoccupied private room was also available for their use. The record discloses that not more than 4 or 5 voters were marking their ballots at the same time. Voters dispersed in the cafeteria to vote as they received their ballots. The Regional Director found that voters who testified as UFE witnesses at the hearing "indicated that the small number of voters, taken together with the size of the cafeteria and the large number [of] tables in the room, provided them with sufficient privacy to mark their ballots, even though no voting booths or partitions of any sort were available for the balloting."...&#8197;Accordingly, we conclude that reasonable precautions were taken to ensure the secrecy of the ballots.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that there was no evidence of any coercion placed on any voter to vote in a particular way, and no voter has objected that his or her privacy or free choice was compromised in any way by the conduct of the election. Thus, although one witness testified that voters on their way to mark their ballots passed by voters who were already seated and marking ballots, there was no evidence that anyone in fact observed how any other member actually voted. A witness called by NFFE indicated that there were people around her when she marked her ballot and that she had observed voters with ballots engaging in unspecified conversations. Nevertheless, when asked on cross examination if she was "concerned about other people seeing how you were voting[,]" she answered, "No, I wasn't."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the conditions surrounding the election sufficiently safeguarded the voters' right to mark their ballots in secret and to preserve the secrecy of their choice. Accordingly, contrary to the Regional Director, we conclude that the <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> requirement of a secret ballot has been met in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Rock Island Arsenal and NAGE Local R7-72</span>, 46 FLRA 76, 77-79, 83-84 (1992), also elaborated on the election requirements in a change of affiliation case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 19, 1991, a notice of a special meeting was mailed to all <span id="page_179"></span>members of NAGE Local R7-72, including employees in both the GS and the NAF units. The notice stated that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss and vote, by secret ballot, on the question of whether NAGE Local R7-72 should change its affiliation from NAGE to NFFE for both the GS and NAF units. The notice contained a list of the "essential impacts of the affiliation vote," including matters concerning dues assessments, terms and conditions of employment, local officers, representation at national conventions and the constitution that would govern the local's affairs....&#8197;The special meeting was scheduled for Monday, October 7, 1991, at 4 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> in the room where NAGE Local R7-72 held its regular monthly meetings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Six members of Local R7-72 attended the meeting. Two of the employees who attended are in the unit at issue. The remaining four are in the NAF unit. During the meeting, members discussed the proposed affiliation change. The discussion concerned such matters as dues and the lack of certain benefits from NAGE, and lasted for approximately 30 minutes. Following the discussion, all six NAGE Local R7-72 members present were given a ballot marked with two choices: "Yes, I vote to change the affiliation to National Federation of Federal Employees" and "No, I vote to keep the affiliation with National Association of Government Employees."...&#8197;Each was accompanied by a list of the "inherent choices" of the vote, including matters concerning dues assessment, terms and conditions of employment, local officers, representation at national conventions and the constitution that would govern the Local's affairs....&#8197;The ballot included information indicating that the proposed affiliation involved both the GS unit and the NAF unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The voters separated themselves into various areas of the room and marked the ballots in secret and individually.&#x2003;The ballots were folded, placed together, and counted in view of those present. All six ballots were cast in favor of affiliation with NFFE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Regional Director's decision is consistent with the standards established in <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> and applied in numerous Authority decisions. First, we agree with the Regional Director that the meeting was held at a time that was convenient to unit members and with adequate advance notice. As the Regional Director noted, there is no requirement that a specific number or percentage of members must cast ballots in order for an affiliation change to be effective....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the absence of any complaints from members of NAGE Local R7-72 that they were denied the opportunity to vote, the fact that only two unit members voted establishes neither that the meeting place and time were inconvenient nor that the vote does not reflect the wishes of the employees in the unit. We note in this regard that although NAGE argues that three unit members could not attend the meeting, there is no evidence that those individuals have complained that the scheduling of the meeting was unfair. As there is no contention that notice of the meeting was not given sufficiently in advance or that it was improperly delivered, and there is no allegation that the mechanics of the election were unfair in any other respect, we conclude that the application provides no basis for granting review of the Regional Director's decision in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further conclude that the Regional Director did not depart from Authority precedent in determining that, in the circumstances of this case, prospective voters in the GS unit were advised with sufficient clarity about the choices inherent in the proposed affiliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAGE argues that eligible voters did not have sufficient information to cast an adequately informed vote, as required by <span class="Italic">Union of Federal Employees</span>, because the prospective voters were not informed that the result of a vote to affiliate with NFFE would be the amendment of the certification of only the GS unit. Specifically, it is argued that "[h]ad the NAF employees known that the AC petition would only be covering the GS employees, they might have voted to keep the whole affiliation of [the] NAGE Local R7-72 with NAGE."...&#8197;We agree with the Regional Director that, as the petition in this case does not seek a change in certification with regard to the NAF unit, considerations concerning that unit are not relevant to this decision. As the Regional Director stated, "[w]hile the change in affiliation herein was accomplished in conjunction with another unit, such fact, standing alone, was not shown to be inconsistent with the <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> procedures."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Montrose</span> requires that both the notice of a special meeting for an affiliation vote and the ballot itself accurately specify the full scope of the proposed change in affiliation. Further, the ballot must clearly state the "choices inherent" in the proposed change. <span class="Italic">Union of Federal Employees</span>, 41 FLRA at 575. In this case, those requirements were met insofar as the notice and the ballot discussed the effects of affiliation on the members' dues, local officers, terms and conditions of employment, and other representational and internal union matters. The fact that the NAF unit has not, to date, filed a petition to amend its certification does not affect the Regional Director's determination that the procedures followed for the special meeting and ballot did not result in procedural unfairness to the employees in the GS unit. Accordingly, the application provides no basis for granting review of the Regional Director's decision in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, Navajo Area Indian Health Serv. and NAGE Local R14-146</span>, 54 FLRA 330, 331-37 (1998), pointed out that the change of affiliation can be accomplished with relative ease if the fundamental requirements of <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> are met and if the initiator of the change holds exclusive recognition:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On March 28, 1988, Local R14-146 was certified as the exclusive representative of a unit of health care employees at the U.S. Public Health Service, Indian Health Service Hospital, Shiprock, New Mexico, including employees who work at the Teecnospos Clinic in Arizona. There are approximately 332 members in the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 21, 1997, a notice to all Local R14-146 members was posted throughout the Northern Navajo Medical Health Center (Health Center) advising them of a special meeting. The notice stated that the purpose of the special meeting was to discuss and vote on changing the Local's affiliation. Thereafter, the special meeting was held and the members who were in attendance voted unanimously (23-0) to change the unit's affiliation from Local R14-146 to LIUNA. A petition to effect the change in certification from Local R14-146 to LIUNA was filed by its Chief Steward.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Regional Office conducted an investigation of the petition.&#x2003;As a result of the investigation, the RD concluded that the change in affiliation met the procedural requirements of <span class="Italic">Montrose</span>. Specifically, the RD found that: notices of a special meeting were posted on bulletin boards throughout the Health Center and stated that all unit members were invited to an important meeting for the sole purpose of discussing and voting on a proposal to change the Local's affiliation; the ballot clearly set forth the choices inherent in the proposed change in affiliation and did so in accurate and neutral language; adequate opportunity for presentation and discussion of the agenda was provided; the secrecy of the ballots was maintained at all times; and the meeting was held at a place and time convenient to the members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the RD found that the change in affiliation would not affect the continuity of representation because the Local's officers, Constitution, autonomy and day-to-day operations would remain unchanged and the collective bargaining agreement would remain in effect. The RD also noted that the Activity had indicated its willingness to recognize and deal with the union that unit members selected. Based on these findings, the RD granted the petition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application for Review</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAGE seeks review of the RD's decision under section 2422.31(c) of the Authority's Regulations and urges the Authority to reverse the RD. In support of this position, NAGE sets forth two grounds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, NAGE claims that the <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> requirements were not followed. In this connection, NAGE argues that the notice advising unit members of the meeting regarding a change in Local R14-146's affiliation did not specifically state that it was a "special meeting" or include any reference to LIUNA. In addition, NAGE maintains that adequate advance notice was not provided to the entire Local membership because the minutes of the meeting state that another voting session was needed "to allow union members who were ill, on a day off, or on annual leave a chance to vote."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAGE also maintains that in the petition to amend certification, Local R14-146 advised the RD that "during this process, members were given an opportunity to discuss the issue of affiliation by talking to the Union officers."...&#8197;However, according to NAGE, there was no opportunity because none of the Local's officers was present. NAGE, accordingly, submits that the <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> criteria mandating that there be adequate time for discussion of the proposed change was not met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second ground advanced by NAGE is that Local R14-146 lacked standing to file the petition. According to NAGE, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Reserve Command, 88th Regional Support Command, Fort Snelling, Minnesota</span>, 53 FLRA 1174 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Fort Snelling</span>), the Authority held that a petition to amend a certificate to reflect a union's change in affiliation may be filed only by the organization that is the exclusive representative. NAGE contends that Local R14-146 did not have standing to file the petition because Local R14-146 is not the exclusive representative, but is "merely an arm" of the national organization. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAGE explains that in 1988, before the representation petition resulting in Local R14-146's certification was filed, "a request was submitted to NAGE's National President (in accordance with NAGE's Constitution and By-laws) for assignment of a local number."...&#8197;NAGE submits that the representation petition was then filed on behalf of the Health Center's employees by a staff member of NAGE. As the petition was not filed by a Health Center employee, NAGE asserts that it was the national organization that was certified and not Local R14-146.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the national organization is not the exclusive representative, NAGE submits, based on <span class="Italic">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C.</span>, 52 FLRA 772 (1996) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>), that the Chief Steward of Local R14-146 did not have the authority to act on its behalf. NAGE explains that Article VI of the NAGE By-laws defines the Chief Steward's <span id="page_180"></span>duties and nowhere in this article is the Chief Steward given the authority to act on behalf of the Local except in the grievance arena. Nor, NAGE asserts, did the Local's President or the Vice-President authorize the Chief Steward to act on its behalf. According to NAGE, review must be granted on this basis alone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that NAGE has not established that compelling reasons exist for granting its application for review under section 2422.31(c) of the Authority's Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">There is No Genuine Issue as to Whether the RD Failed to Apply Established Precedent with Respect to the Montrose Criteria</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously noted, the RD in this case examined the circumstances culminating in the petition to amend the certification of Local R14-146 and concluded, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Montrose</span>, that the requisite procedural requirements had been met. Despite the contentions advanced by NAGE, we find that the RD's decision is consistent with that decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we find that under <span class="Italic">Montrose</span>, there is no requirement that the notice of the "special meeting" be explicitly designated as such or that it explicitly reference the union with which affiliation is proposed. Rather, <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> mandates only that the notice of the special meeting clearly and adequately inform members of the incumbent union of the nature of the proposed change. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Union of Federal Employees</span>, 41 FLRA 562 (1991)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject NAGE's claim that the RD failed to apply established precedent because adequate advance notice of the meeting was not provided to unit members as <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> specifically requires. There is no requirement that any specific number or percentage of members must cast ballots in order for an affiliation change to be effective. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rock Island</span>, 46 FLRA at 83. Moreover, NAGE has provided no evidence to indicate that unit members believed they were denied the opportunity to vote, that the meeting place or time was inconvenient, or that the vote does not reflect the wishes of unit members. In the absence of such evidence, there is no basis on which to conclude that adequate notice was not provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, NAGE argues that the RD erred in finding that the <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> requirements had been met because unit members were not provided an opportunity to discuss the proposed affiliation with Local R14-146's officers. We note, however, that <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> requires only that "adequate time for discussion of the proposed change should be provided, with all members given an opportunity to raise questions within the bounds of normal parliamentary procedures[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 858. As such, this argument must be rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">There Is No Genuine Issue as to Whether the RD Failed to Apply Established Precedent With Respect to Local R14-146's Standing to File the Petition</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a labor organization has complied with the procedural requirements set forth in <span class="Italic">Montrose</span>, it must file a petition to amend its certification to reflect the change in its affiliation. The petition at issue in this case was filed by the Chief Steward of Local R14-146. In its application for review, NAGE maintains that the RD's decision must be reversed because Local R14-146 was not the exclusive representative and, therefore, did not have standing to file the petition. NAGE further submits that, even assuming that it was, the Chief Steward of Local R14-146 did not have authority to act on its behalf.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As NAGE correctly observes, a petition to amend a certificate to reflect a union's change in affiliation may be filed only by the organization that is the incumbent exclusive representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fort Snelling</span>, 53 FLRA at 1177; <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 52 FLRA at 782. For example, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau, New York National Guard, Division of Military and Naval Affairs, Latham, New York</span>, 46 FLRA 1468, 1473-74 (1993), the Authority held that a local union did not have standing to file a petition to amend its certification where its parent national union was certified as the exclusive representative. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, the Authority held that petitions to amend certification may only be filed on behalf of an incumbent union by one who has authority to act for it. 52 FLRA at 782.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the certification of the exclusive representative is contained in the record. The certification establishes that Local R14-146 was certified as the exclusive representative of the employees in the bargaining unit on March 28, 1988. In addition, NAGE does not allege and there is no evidence to indicate that Local R14-146 amended its certification after it was issued or that any other action was taken to cause NAGE to become the exclusive representative. Consequently, we find that the RD's decision is consistent with our precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject NAGE's claim that the Chief Steward of Local R14-146 did not have the authority to act on its behalf. We note in this connection that the record contains a document signed by the President of Local R14-146 stating that he had authorized the Chief Steward to file the petition in order to effect a change in the Local's affiliation from NAGE to LIUNA. We further note that NAGE does not dispute the authority of the Local President to act on its behalf. As such, we find that the RD's decision is consistent with our precedent as enunciated in <span class="Italic">Fort Snelling</span> and <span class="Italic">EPA</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Balloting is among the members of the incumbent labor organization. Separate balloting need not be conducted among employees holding professional and nonprofessional positions, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, BLM and NFFE Fed. Dist. 1</span>, 66 FLRA 435, 436 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity claims that <span class="Italic">Montrose </span>was not satisfied because none of those who voted in the special election encumbered non-professional positions. Contrary to the Activity's claim, and as indicated <span class="Italic">supra </span>note 3, <span class="Italic">Montrose </span>addresses only the procedural prerequisites for a change in affiliation. <span class="Italic">See Montrose</span>, 4 A/SLMR at 860. And, as relevant here, all that <span class="Italic">Montrose </span>requires is that those who vote be members of the incumbent labor organization. <span class="Italic">Id.; U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Navajo Area, Gallup, N.M.</span>, 34 FLRA 428, 445 (1990)). Accordingly, <span class="Italic">Montrose </span>does not support a conclusion that the RD erred by granting a change in affiliation based solely on the votes of members who encumbered professional positions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Los Angeles, Cal. and NFFE Local 777</span>, 56 FLRA 973, 977 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Montrose</span> requirements were not met when ballot allowed for vote for one of two named unions, but had another choice for "other" that was not identified on the ballot and was not identified through minutes of a meeting preceding the vote to change affiliation).</p>
