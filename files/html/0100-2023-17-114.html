<h5 class="h5" id="sec10-115"><span class="space">i.</span> Sham, Paperwork Reorganization: Old, New Position Identical; Delayed Reorganization</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If an abolished position and the one offered to the appellant are identical, there is no reorganization affecting the appellant and it is improper to invoke RIF procedures to accomplish a downgrade. <span class="Italic">Kanner v. Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 130, 132, 4 MSPB 215 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bieker v. VA</span>, 22 MSPR 217, 219 n.3 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Justice v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 218, 9 MSPB 469 (1982) (in the context of a constructive demotion appeal, a finding that the new position was not significantly different from the old position warrants the conclusion that the old position was not abolished)). If there is evidence that a position has been restructured under another name, the Board pierces the veil of the action abolishing the position to determine the legitimacy of the reason stated for the RIF. <span class="Italic">Hoffman v. DHUD</span>, 22 MSPR 564, 566 n.1 (1984) (RIF was set aside when the function performed by the appellant was not abolished but was being performed by another employee at the same grade level in the same organization).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Belton v. DHHS</span>, 31 MSPR 414, 419 (1986), summarized the distinctions between a proper and improper reorganization:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Losure</span> and <span class="Italic">Ritter</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Strauss</span>, 261 F.2d 767 (D.C. Cir. 1958)], the employees affected by the reduction-in-force actions presented evidence that their agencies had invoked the reduction-in-force regulations in order to replace them with other employees. <span class="Italic">Losure</span>, 2 MSPR at 197-98; <span class="Italic">Ritter</span>, 261 F.2d at 769. The Board and the court found that such a use of the reduction-in-force regulations was improper, and that the agencies had failed to show any proper basis for invoking those regulations. <span class="Italic">Losure</span>, 2 MSPR at 202; <span class="Italic">Ritter,</span> 261 F.2d at 772. The cases now before the Board are clearly distinguishable from those cited by the appellants. In these cases, there is no doubt that there were more CSA employees than OCS could accommodate, and that the use of reduction-in-force procedures to determine which employees were to be assigned to the available OCS positions therefore was appropriate. In addition, the appellants have not argued specifically that the detailed employees were performing the duties of their (the appellants') former positions; they have argued only that the detailed employees were performing functions transferred from CSA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board examines all the record evidence, particularly position descriptions, in making the determination. <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Dept. of Army</span>, 41 MSPR 612, 615-17 (1989), considered the effects of a reorganization on the appellant's position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reorganization is one of the bases for invoking the RIF regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2). It is defined as "the planned elimination, addition, or redistribution of functions or duties in an organization." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.203. The agency's failure to use the term "reorganization" in the RIF notice does not conclusively determine whether, in fact, a reorganization occurred. Rather, the Board will look to the evidence in the record to determine whether the agency's action met the definition of reorganization. <span class="Italic">See Waksman v. Department of Commerce,</span> 37 MSPR 640, 645 n.8 (1988). <span class="Italic">See also Blalock v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 28 MSPR 17, 20-21 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Huber v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 793 F.2d 284 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 479 U.S. 1043, 107 S. Ct. 907, 93 L. Ed.2d 857 (1987) (reorganization is a term broad enough to cover a multitude of legitimate management considerations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency witnesses testified that the restructuring was an ongoing process over the course of several years, not a dramatic change that happened on a particular date. Furthermore, despite the administrative judge's finding that the written evidence indicated that no reorganization was scheduled until FY 1989, Kenneth Roberts, the Director of Resource Management, testified that he understood that the Standard Installation Accounting Organization (SIAO), the basis for the reorganization, was to be in place by October 1988.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that a valid reorganization affecting the appellant's position did not occur because the GS-10 and GS-11 positions were not significantly different. When an appellant asserts that an alleged reorganization is really a classification action, the agency must show that the appellant's position was actually abolished and not just continued under a different title and grade. <span class="Italic">See Stechler v. Department of Energy,</span> 20 MSPR 23, 25, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 758 F.2d 666 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The Board will examine all of the record evidence, particularly the position descriptions, in making this determination. <span class="Italic">See Willson v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army,</span> 25 MSPR 167, 170 (1984); <span class="Italic">Kanner v. Department of the Army,</span> 19 MSPR 502, 505 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our comparison of the position descriptions for the GS-10 and GS-11 positions reveals a significant difference in the scope and character of the positions. To begin with, the descriptions indicate that the GS-11 position supervises approximately ninety people, thirty more than supervised by the GS-10 position. Contrary to the administrative judge's finding that this was not a significant difference, the Board has held that an increase in the number of supervised personnel, even if the job duties of the two positions remain the same, may be significant enough to show that the agency properly invoked the RIF procedures in affecting a reorganization. <span class="Italic">See Stechler</span>, 20 MSPR at 24-25.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, other differences between the two position descriptions reflect the management considerations that led to the reorganization. For example, the GS-11 position description stresses the services to be provided to the agency's other activities by the Pay and Examination Branch, a priority highlighted by Mr. Roberts. In addition, the position description emphasizes the incumbent's responsibility for the new automated systems. These systems were not identified in the GS-10 position description. Although the administrative judge found that the four automated systems involved were in place in the appellant's branch as early as 1985, the evidence shows that only two of these systems were implemented at that time and that additional new ones were to be implemented in the future....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the GS-11 position description reflects that the new position would be more professional, as contrasted with technical, in nature. Indeed, Mr. Roberts characterized the situation prior to the reorganization as a "glorified bookkeeping operation." The evidence shows that the increased professionalism required in the GS-11 position was a management goal leading to the reorganization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we conclude that the agency properly invoked the RIF regulations because of a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> reorganization. The fact that work that the appellant previously performed continues to be done by others is not inconsistent with a finding that a reorganization occurred. The record does not show that her former GS-10 position continued after the reorganization. <span class="Italic">See Waksman,</span> 37 MSPR at 646. Because we find that the agency properly invoked the RIF regulations, and the appellant has not challenged the application of the RIF regulations, we find no error in the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In determining the legitimacy of a challenged reorganization, the duties of the jobs will be reviewed to determine whether there was a material change. <span class="Italic">Decker v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 119, 131 (1989); <span class="Italic">Ryba v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 18 MSPR 472, 474 (1983) ("In evaluating whether the agency has properly invoked the RIF regulations due to a change in duties, our concern is whether a change in duties has in fact occurred."). The issue is not whether the two positions are identical in every detail, but whether they are substantively the same, particularly as to the major or essential duties and responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Decker v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 119 (1989); <span class="Italic">Dziedzic v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 24 MSPR 673 (1984) (evidence showed that another individual was preselected for the position held by the appellant and abolished in name only); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, 8 MSPR 377, 379 (1981) (WG-10 Mobile Equipment Mechanic and WG-8 Automotive Worker positions differed because the latter job did not require the appellant to tear down and rebuild components and assemblies for engines, transmissions, and differentials; the change in duties was "major").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3121"></span>The term "reorganization" is not an enchanted blanket used to cover improper agency action. <span class="Italic">Cobb v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 774 F.2d 475, 477-78 (Fed. Cir. 1985). In <span class="Italic">Cobb</span> the RIF abolished two part-time regional administrator positions. One full-time regional administrator position was created, allegedly to decrease the costs and to remove the management problems associated with the job-sharing arrangement. The appellant was separated. Reversing the Board, the court noted the usual: an agency bears the evidentiary burden of proving that RIF regulations were properly invoked due to management considerations of the character appropriately committed to agency consideration. An agency is allowed wide discretion in conducting a reduction in force; unless there is a clear abuse of discretion, a substantial departure from applicable procedures, or a misconstruction of governing statutes, a court will not upset a final agency decision. Going beyond the incantation of deference to agency reorganization decisions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the term "reorganization" is defined broadly enough to cover a multitude of management considerations, it is not an enchanted blanket that can be used to cover improper agency action....&#8197;Cobb argues that the improper agency action occurred when the Bureau failed to consider the public policy goals stated in the Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978 and thereby abused its managerial discretion in conducting the RIF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since RIFs are not aimed at removing particular individuals, but at eliminating positions...it is clear that a change in organizational structure such as in this case was not a...reorganization; that is, there was no elimination, addition, or redistribution of functions or duties in the organization. The Bureau made no changes in the description of the Regional Administrator position when eliminating this position as one available for job sharing. The education and experience requirements as well as the duties and responsibilities of the full-time position were identical to those of the job shared position....&#8197;To do no more than assert that changing a job sharing arrangement to a single full-time position is a proper reorganization, is to circumvent the established merit principles of 5 USC 2301.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the proper grade of a position is not an issue in the course of a RIF appeal, a grade level issue may be examined to determine whether the RIF is <span class="Italic">bona fide.</span> <span class="Italic">Perlman v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 591, 593 (1984). A downgrading resulting from a RIF was improper after the agency failed to show that any significant changes in the major duties of the appellant's position resulted from the RIF. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chavez v. GSA</span>, 5 MSPR 341, 343, 5 MSPB 366 (1981). There was no reorganization--or an improper RIF--when jobs were shifted from Schedule A to Schedule C without a change in the real duties performed. <span class="Italic">Blalock v. USDA</span>, 28 MSPR 17, 21-22 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd on other grounds sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Huber v. MSPB</span>, 793 F.2d 284 (Fed. Cir. 1986). <span class="Italic">Brandon v. Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 38, 40, 4 MSPB 129 (1980), determined that a reorganization was legitimate when: "the duties of the position abolished were genuinely redistributed to other employees in the personnel office. The position was not, in effect, transferred to another person in order to get rid of appellant. Certainly such a reorganization is a permissible reason for a reduction in force...."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A valid reorganization did not occur when an appellant was demoted as a result of retreat rights that were exercised only on paper; the individual who was to displace the appellant never took his job or duties. Another individual was apparently given those duties through reassignment, but not through a RIF. Because the appellant was not legitimately displaced through anything other than a reorganization that occurred only on paper, the appellant's RIF was reversed. <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 603, 606-08 (1994). If an agency manipulates positions before a RIF to slip certain duties "under the shell" of another position description, precluding retreat rights by an employee to a position held earlier, the RIF is invalid if the employee could, without undue disruption, perform the responsibilities of the newer position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 487, 490 (1994) (relying on <span class="Italic">Evans v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 492, 496-97 (1994)); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Ritter v. Strauss</span>, 261 F.2d 767, 772 (D.C. Cir. 1958) (the employment of another employee in the plaintiff's competitive level when no vacancy existed, causing the release of the plaintiff, did not constitute a valid reorganization or RIF).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Evans v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 492, 496 (1994), admonished agencies against manipulating assignments of duties in position descriptions to defeat retreat rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also held that before an agency can invoke the RIF regulations based on the abolishment of a job, it must establish that an appellant's position was actually abolished and that it did not continue under a different grade or title. <span class="Italic">See Simonton</span> [62 MSPR 30 (1994)] at 33; <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Department of the Army</span>, 41 MSPR 612, 616 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 914 F.2d 271 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table). Thus, an agency cannot deprive an employee of retreat rights by slipping his prior duties under the shell of a new position with no substantive changes. <span class="Italic">Simonton</span>, at 33. Rather, the inquiry centers on whether the relevant evidence shows that the jobs at issue truly are "essentially identical." Toward this end, we found in <span class="Italic">Simonton</span> at 32-33, that while only positions in the same grade may be in the same competitive level, that is only "one usual indication" of similarity, and should not be dispositive of an appellant's rights where he seeks to retreat to a position that, but for a difference in grade, is essentially identical to one from which he was promoted. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">McDonald v. United States Postal Service</span>, 42 MSPR 148, 152 (1989) (although positions that are "the same or similar" for purposes of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511 appeal rights will generally be in the same competitive level, "competitive level is simply one consideration in making that determination").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the parties stipulated that the appellant is fully qualified to fill a PNUC position with no additional experience, training, or certification. In addition, it is undisputed that while he occupied a Journeyman Pipefitter (Nuclear) position, the appellant performed nuclear pipefitter duties at least 25% of the time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the duties performed by the appellant in his prior position appear to have been slipped under the shell of a new position with no substantive changes and that the PNUC position is essentially identical to the appellant's previous Journeyman Pipefitter (Nuclear) position. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(c)(3). We therefore find the appellant is entitled to retreat to a PNUC position if his standing on the PNUC retention register would otherwise entitle him to such a position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Markham v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 559 (1995) (agency improperly denied retreat rights from a pipefitter foreman job to a PNUC pipefitter position that was essentially identical to the appellant's previous journeyman pipefitter position; appellant was fully qualified to perform work on nuclear systems); <span class="Italic">Magill v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 497, 500 (1994) (another PNUC case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although position descriptions may be relied on to determine whether there are distinctions between reorganized positions, <span class="Italic">Kanner v. Dept. of Army</span>, 19 MSPR 502, 505 (1984), the critical focus is on actual duties assigned on an ongoing basis. It is immaterial that other duties are assigned on an acting basis or that the employee may have taken on other duties on the basis of his own initiative. <span class="Italic">Sinha v. VA</span>, 21 MSPR 681, 686 n.2 (1984). <span class="Italic">Whitehurst v. TVA</span>, 43 MSPR 486, 490 (1990), illustrates the analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency conceded, and the administrative judge found, that the appellant's former position of shift Captain and the new Security Shift Supervisor position shared generally corresponding duties and responsibilities. The official descriptions and the parties' testimony showed, however, that the grade, educational requirements, and reporting relationships of the positions were distinguishable....&#8197;The shift Captain position description, furthermore, has no specific skill or knowledge requirements, whereas the Security Shift Supervisor position descriptions requires 7 years' experience in nuclear security activities, including at least 2 years' supervisory experience in this area, and a college education background in criminal justice or law enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we concur with the administrative judge's determination that the agency established that a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> reorganization of the management functions of its security forces occurred that resulted in the abolishment of the shift Captain position and the creation of the new Security Shift Supervisor position. <span class="Italic">See Stechler,</span> 20 MSPR at 25; <span class="Italic">Kanner v. Department of the Army</span>, 19 MSPR 502, 505-06 (1984). <span class="Italic">See also Farmer v. Department of Transportation</span>, 11 MSPB 622, 13 MSPR 384, 387 (1982) (abolishment of two positions and combination of their duties into a single new position was a planned management action which met the definition of a "reorganization" for RIF purposes).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a decision short on factual analysis, <span class="Italic">DePascale v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 59 MSPR 186, 189 (1993), stated that "[t]he mere fact that work previously performed by an employee prior to a reorganization continues to be performed by others does not establish that a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> reorganization did not occur." <span class="Italic">Salazar v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 60 MSPR 633, 641-42 (1994), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find no merit to appellant Salazar's allegation that the duties of his former WC position continue to be performed. He has not asserted that his former WC position continues to exist as a different position under a different title or grade<span class="Italic">. See Whitehurst v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 43 MSPR 486, 489 (1990); <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Department of the Army</span>, 41 MSPR 612, 616 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 914 F.2d 271 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table). The administrative judge, therefore, correctly determined that appellant Salazar's former WC position does not continue to exist merely because the duties of that position continue to be performed<span class="Italic">. See Waksman v. Department of Commerce</span>, 37 MSPR 640, 646 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Harris v. Department of Commerce</span>, 878 F.2d 1447 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table). Thus, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that appellant Salazar's WC position was abolished during the RIF.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Differences in the number and methods of employees supervised significantly alters management responsibilities of a job to permit a RIF through reorganization. <span class="Italic">Johns v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 23 MSPR 146, 148 (1984). It is "well settled" that the elimination of supervisory duties alone constitutes a substantial change from a former position. <span class="Italic">Decker v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 119, 128 (1989). The agency's burden is to prove that the appellant's position was actually abolished and is not continuing under a different title or grade. A reorganization is valid if jobs before and after the RIF have the same duties, but in the pre-RIF position the incumbent supervised a staff of 12 (including specialists, clerks, and professionals) through two teamleaders, but after the <span id="Page_3122"></span>RIF the appellant supervises a staff of six specialists. <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Dept. of Army</span>, 41 MSPR 612, 616 (1989) (new position supervised 30 more people than were supervised under the old position); <span class="Italic">Stechler v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 20 MSPR 23, 25 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 758 F.2d 666 (Fed. Cir. 1984). A reorganization is valid if the ultimate responsibility for performing significant work shifted to team leaders under whom the appellants were assigned, even though the tasks the appellants performed did not substantially change. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Renning v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 28 MSPR 430, 431 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an appellant asserts that the alleged reorganization is really a classification action, the agency must show that the appellant's position was actually abolished and not continued under a different title and grade. <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Dept. of Army</span>, 41 MSPR 612, 616 (1989). The classification of the position may be reviewed when the RIF is challenged; the analysis becomes important if the employee alleges that a newly assigned position is a new description for duties previously assigned to a more secure position that he lost through RIF. <span class="Italic">Phelps v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 4 MSPR 349, 351, 4 MSPB 410 (1980). [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-20-158.html#sec13-150">Classification Issue</a>" earlier in this chapter.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency takes no action to truly reorganize, the stated reason for a RIF becomes a sham, <span class="Italic">Disney v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 563, 567-71 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.403(a), an agency must establish competitive levels consisting of all positions in a competitive area which are of the same grade (or occupational level) and classification series and which are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions so that the incumbent of one position could successfully perform the critical elements of any other position upon entry into it, without any loss of productivity beyond that normally expected in the orientation of any new but fully qualified employee. <span class="Italic">See Bateman</span>, 64 MSPR at 466.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proper application of this RIF regulation is a substantive right, not a procedural one. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id.; Schroeder v. Department of Transportation</span>, 60 MSPR 566, 577 (1994). The Board will not reverse a RIF when the agency shows that its error in not precisely complying with the RIF regulations had no adverse effect on the employee's substantive entitlements. The agency bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that its error had no such adverse effect. <span class="Italic">See Bateman</span>, 64 MSPR at 466; <span class="Italic">Schroeder</span>, 60 MSPR at 577.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In October and November 1992, the agency reorganized the P &#x0026; E Department at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, where the appellants were employed, to align the P &#x0026; E subcomponents with the Engineering Department, resulting in the reassignment of a number of supervisors and employees to different subcomponents with new or different code numbers. Before the reassignments, all supervisors had occupied positions designated "General" and had supervised employees in a variety of crafts. After the reassignments, most of the positions the supervisors occupied received a new designation of Supervisory P &#x0026; E within a specific craft such as Boilermaker or Sheet Metal Mechanic. The agency wrote new position descriptions for the trade-specific Supervisory P &#x0026; E positions that included a requirement of expertise in the trade being supervised. Each trade-specific Supervisory P &#x0026; E position occupied its own competitive level for RIF purposes. A few of the Supervisory P &#x0026; E positions, including the position occupied by appellant Disney, retained the "General" designation. All of the Supervisory P &#x0026; E (General) positions were placed in the same competitive level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants argued that all of the Supervisory P &#x0026; E positions should have been on the same competitive level because the distinction that the agency made in the position descriptions, making them trade-specific, was never effectuated. According to the appellants, if the agency had established the competitive level to include all P &#x0026; E supervisors, Supervisory P &#x0026; E Sam Bass, rather than Disney, would have been reached for RIF action. Appellant Schumm argues that he was demoted when Disney retreated into his position because of the incorrectly drawn competitive level and that Bass had no retreat rights to Schumm's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for positions to occupy the same competitive level, anyone who qualifies for one position must be able to qualify for all<span class="Italic">. See Bateman</span>, 64 MSPR at 467; <span class="Italic">Estrin v. Social Security Administration</span>, 24 MSPR 303, 307 (1984). The position descriptions for the Supervisory P &#x0026; E positions after the reorganization indicate that the positions differ, i.e., a Supervisory P &#x0026; E (Boilermaker) who supervises Boilermakers must have expertise as a Boilermaker and a Supervisory P &#x0026; E (Marine Machine Mechanic) must have expertise as a Machinist. A Supervisory P &#x0026; E (General), in contrast, supervises a variety of trades and must have expertise in only one of them. Thus, based on the position descriptions alone, all of the Supervisory P &#x0026; E positions could not be on the same competitive level because each of the supervisors could not have qualified for every Supervisory P &#x0026; E position. <span class="Italic">See Bateman</span>, 64 MSPR at 467; <span class="Italic">Kline v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 46 MSPR 193, 195-200 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part</span>, 805 F. Supp. 545 (E.D. Tenn. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the official position description constitutes the primary evidence of the propriety of the competitive level, it is not the only evidence that the Board will consider. <span class="Italic">See Bateman</span>, 64 MSPR at 468; <span class="Italic">Simonton v. Department of the Army</span>, 62 MSPR 30, 35-36 (1994). In support of their argument that the position descriptions do not reflect what actually happened during the reorganization and that the trade/craft qualifications are not an actual part of the position because the supervisors are continuing to supervise the same employees as before the reorganization, the appellants offered the testimony of co-workers Arnold Beard and Kenneth Brimer. Beard, a Boilermaker, testified that he received an SF-50 documenting his reassignment from Code Section 268M, Surface Ship Mechanical Planning, in November 1992 to Code Section 243a, Waterfront Support, but that he continued to work in Code Section 268M and never worked in Waterfront Support. He testified that his supervisor was Harry Lee throughout and that Lee made work assignments, approved leave, and gave him his performance ratings. Beard also testified that Sam Bass, who, according to the SF-50 documenting his reassignment, was reassigned to the Supervisory P &#x0026; E (Boilermaker) position in Code Section 243a in November 1992, never supervised him. He further testified that he worked in Code Section 268M with Allie Smith and C.K. Smith, who were also Boilermakers. The SF-50s of record indicate that Allie Smith was reassigned in November 1992 from Nuclear Planning Branch 23011 to Code Section 243a and that C.K. Smith was reassigned from Code Section 268M to Code Section 243a. Beard also testified that all types of trades worked in Waterfront Support. The retention register lists Beard as working in Waterfront Support at the time of the RIF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only distinction between the Supervisory P &#x0026; E (Boilermaker) position and the Supervisory P &#x0026; E (General) position was the Boilermaker expertise requirement and the types of employees supervised. Therefore, the propriety of assigning the Supervisory P &#x0026; E (Boilermaker) position to a separate competitive level was based on the fact that that position description required an expertise in the Boilermaker trade because the incumbent supervised Boilermakers. If, in fact, as Beard and Brimer testified, the Supervisory P &#x0026; E (Boilermaker) position did not supervise Boilermakers but a variety of trades, the agency has not shown why that position should not be in the same competitive level as the Supervisory P &#x0026; E (General) position. While Baker testified that workers might have continued to work in a similar fashion to their earlier assignments because of ongoing projects, Baker did not deny that, or explain why, Beard and Brimer were assigned work, granted leave, and given performance ratings by their previous supervisors and not by their new supervisors of record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the fact that the agency had not yet utilized the distinctions among the supervisors at the time of the RIF does not invalidate the competitive levels. <span class="Italic">See Coleman v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 23 MSPR 670, 674-75 (1984). Beard and Brimer, however, testified that the agency had not effected the changes at the time of the hearing, some 6 months after appellant Disney received his June 16, 1993 RIF notice. We further note that Baker testified that Raymond Hoskie, who had been reassigned to a Supervisory P &#x0026; E (Pipefitter) position in November 1992, supervised Code Section 243a at the time of the hearing....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find that the agency did not meet its burden to show that the competitive levels were properly drawn because it did not establish that the distinguishing feature of the Supervisory P &#x0026; E (Boilermaker) position description was an actual part of the position. We cannot determine from the record whether appellant Disney and Bass could both qualify for the Supervisory P &#x0026; E position supervising Code Section 243a or whether all of the Supervisory P &#x0026; E (General) positions belong in the same competitive level. Nevertheless, the agency bears the burden of proving that the competitive level was properly drawn, but we find that it did not do so in these appeals. <span class="Italic">See Bateman</span>, 64 MSPR at 466; <span class="Italic">Schroeder</span>, 60 MSPR at 577.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question remains whether the appellants' substantive rights were affected by the improper competitive level. The appellants argue that Bass and not Disney should have been reached for RIF. Appellant Schumm argues that the RIF action demoting him was incorrect because, if Bass and not Disney was affected by RIF, Bass had no retreat rights to Schumm's position. On remand in these appeals, we advised the agency of its burden of showing that any error in applying RIF regulations did not adversely affect the appellants' substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Bateman</span>, 64 MSPR at 466, 470. The agency on remand did not submit any evidence or argument on this issue as to appellants Disney and Schumm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency has failed to carry its burden of proof on remand to show that any error in establishing the competitive level did not adversely affect the appellants' substantive rights, we reverse the RIF actions demoting appellants Disney and Schumm. We thus distinguish these appeals from <span class="Italic">Jicha v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 73, 78 (1994), in which we remanded that appeal for a determination of the effect of an improperly drawn competitive level.</p>
