<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-134"><span class="space">e.</span> Unemployment Compensation Award</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">After an employee is fired, he may apply for unemployment compensation, a benefit generally granted under state law if the basis for discharging the employee does not amount to fairly egregious misconduct. Benefits may be granted if there is no contest to the claim or, if contested, benefits may be granted after a compensation hearing provided to evaluate testimony of witnesses. What are the consequences of a compensation award concluding that sufficient cause for dismissal was or was not lacking?</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board law generally appears to provide little or no little or deference to unemployment compensation decisions. The rule is that the decisions are not given collateral estoppel effect. <span class="Italic">Herring v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 342, 346 (1989). A decision of the Texas Unemployment Commission (presumably determining whether the appellant was discharged for good cause or willful misconduct) did not bind the Board. <span class="Italic">Ahr v. DOJ</span>, 23 MSPR 238, 242 (1984) (Board did not provide the reasoning supporting this result); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Pamintuan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 802 Fed. Appx. 561, 567 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP) ("Similar to what this court and the Merit Systems Protection Board have found before, we do agree with the Government that the CUIAB decision does not have preclusive effect on the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Wade v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 212 Fed. Appx. 995, 997 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ('The CUIAB decision is based on California state law and is not binding upon the Board.'); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Herring v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 40 M.S.P.R. 342, 346 (1989) ('decisions by state unemployment tribunals are not given collateral estoppel effect'). We therefore find no error in the AJ's decision to not give the CUIAB decision preclusive effect."); <span class="Italic">Melendez v. VA</span>, 314 Fed. Appx. 310, 311-12 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) ("The Board noted that 'apparently no witnesses testified on behalf of the agency before the Commission.' The Board is not bound by factual findings or legal conclusions of the Texas Workforce Commission."); <span class="Italic">Mahnken v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 1, 5 n.2 (1987) (unemployment compensation decision was entitled to little weight because "there were no reasons given in support of that finding and it appears to be based solely on the appellant's submissions"). Other cases provide no collateral estoppel effect to the state employment commission's findings, but allow that the decisions be entitled to some consideration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Army</span>, 121 MSPR 189, 199 n.5, 2014 MSPB 38 (2014) ("[w]hile unemployment compensation decisions are worthy of consideration, they are not dispositive. <span class="Italic">Cirella v.

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 108 MSPR 474, 481 &#x00B6; 19, 2008 MSPB 79 (2008) ("Although unemployment compensation decisions are worthy of consideration, they are not dispositive."); <span class="Italic">Mengine v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 123, 126 &#x00B6; 4 (1999) ("[D]ecisions of state unemployment tribunals, although they constitute evidence worthy of consideration, are not given collateral estoppel effect."); <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 31, 35 (1987) (determination of Maryland Department of Employment and Training were not binding on the Board), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. USPS</span>, 865 F.2d 235 (Fed. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Benoist v. DOD</span>, 40 MSPR 418, 426 (1989), elaborated on the effect of unemployment compensation decisions:</p>

Dept. of Labor</span>, 38 MSPR 1, 2 (1988). The state tribunal findings at issue here consist largely of conclusory statements whose basis is not clear. We find nothing in those findings that provides a proper basis for invalidating the administrative judge's contrary findings. [<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2-3.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board provided a plausible rationale for its approach to state unemployment compensation decisions, <span class="Italic">Fontes v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 51 MSPR 655, 662 n.4 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The state agency decision here has little probative value because the statutory standard applied by the state agency--whether the employee was discharged for deliberate misconduct in willful disregard of the employer's interest--is very different from the statutory standard applicable to the Board's decision--whether the removal action was for such cause as would promote the efficiency of the service. In addition, the state decision contains very little factual or legal analysis. We therefore find that it does not warrant a different outcome than the one reached by the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A favorable decision granting unemployment compensation was not material evidence for the purpose of granting a PFR: the decision was not directly relevant to the charge against the appellant, nor was it of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that ordered by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 58, 59 n.2 (1985). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Willis v. DOD</span>, 105 MSPR 466, 471-73 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-16, 2007 MSPB 108 (2007) (unemployment compensation decision that postdated an initial decision was new evidence that should have been considered for purposes of a petition for review and it was material because it concerned the jurisdictional issue of whether the employee breached a last chance agreement by a leave infraction or whether the agency improperly failed to grant leave for the time period in question). If the unemployment compensation decision is received after the record closes with the AJ and is then submitted to the Board with a PFR, it will be reviewed as new evidence; its weight may be minimal without an explanation of the applicable standard of proof or evidentiary rules before the state unemployment appeals tribunal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCain v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 604, 608 (1993) ("The CDET found, in a conclusory fashion, that the appellant did not commit a 'volitional' act that would render him ineligible for unemployment benefits. There is no explanation of the applicable standard of proof or evidentiary rules before the CDET, nor is it clear what constitutes a 'volitional' act under Colorado law."). An unemployment compensation award favorable to an appellant and issued after the initial decision sustaining his removal was not of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that ordered by the AJ. The Board cryptically noted that the "decision impairs neither the credibility determinations of the presiding official nor the case developed by the postal inspectors against the appellant." <span class="Italic">Henscheid v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 422, 425 (1983). Another award submitted after the close of the Board's record and favoring the appellant was disregarded because it may have turned on the refusal of the examiner to admit hearsay evidence that was admissible in a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Perry v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 425, 429 n.3 (1990); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Santana v. USPS,</span> SF-0752-14-0801-I-1 (NP 4/14/2015) ("The California agency decision granting employee unemployment benefits is of little probative value in this case because the standard applied by the state agency, whether a reasonable, good faith and honest fear of harm to one's health or safety from the work environment and conditions of employment constitutes good cause for quitting, differs from that applicable to proving an involuntary retirement before the Board."); <span class="Italic">Laughlin v. USPS</span>, 12 MSPR 183, 185 (1982) (unemployment decision was "irrelevant" to an appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit noted, <span class="Italic">Tarr v. MSPB</span>, 469 Fed. Appx. 867, 870 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Tarr points to a decision by the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, which concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support a determination of fault regarding his termination and therefore ruled that he was entitled to unemployment benefits. That decision, he contends, should be given preclusive effect in this case, and the fact that the DVA did not exercise its right to respond in the Colorado unemployment benefits proceeding forecloses it from defending its action in removing him. Those contentions lack merit. The DVA's failure to appeal in a separate state unemployment proceeding does not abrogate any appeal rights it has before the Board. Moreover, the claims, issues, and burdens in the two proceedings are sufficiently different that the outcome of the unemployment case would have no preclusive effect in the Board proceedings in any event.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The effect through collateral estoppel of an unemployment compensation decision was considered by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 84-1664), involving an individual removed for assaulting a Postal Service police officer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot agree with Mr. Jones that the findings made by the New York state administrative agency should be accorded collateral estoppel effect by the MSPB. In particular, we are not convinced that the Postal Service was given a full and fair opportunity to be heard on the adjudicated issue in the New York proceeding. We note from the record that the decision by the ALJ in the New York proceeding gives few details of the standard of proof which governed his decision, which witnesses were heard or whether they were subject to cross-examination, the evidentiary standards imposed, and on what basis he found in favor of Jones. We further note that while Mr. Jones was represented by counsel at the New York proceeding, the Postal Service, whose representative was a member of management, did not have an attorney present. We conclude that in these circumstances, the Postal Service lacked a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues which Mr. Jones <span class="Italic">seek</span>s to preclude. The doctrine of collateral estoppel, therefore, cannot be appropriately applied. Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact of the Postal Service's lack of incentive to vigorously litigate at the New York proceeding. Put another way, invoking the doctrine of collateral estoppel can be unfair if the party to be bound lacked an incentive to litigate in the first trial, especially in comparison to the stakes in the second trial. <span class="Italic">Otherson v. Dept. of Justice, INS</span>, 711 F.2d 267 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The amount in controversy in the state administrative proceeding, that is, the amount of employment compensation to be paid to a former employee if he prevails, is much less than in the MSPB proceeding where reinstatement is considered and where back pay could conceivably constitute a large sum. Mr. Jones has failed to demonstrate the propriety of applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel to this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mother's Restaurant, Inc. v. Mama's Pizza, Inc.</span>, 723 F.2d 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A state unemployment compensation decision did not collaterally estop the government. The agency was not represented by counsel during the proceeding. A labor relations specialist who did no more than act as a messenger or witness at the hearing did not qualify as counsel. <span class="Italic">Romero v. IRS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 87-3543). In <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. USPS</span>, 865 F.2d 235, 239-40 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the Federal Circuit said of the effect of a state unemployment compensation award on subsequent Board proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1576"></span>First, the issue before the [Maryland Dept. of Employment and Training], the right to compensation under state law, was not identical with that before the board, and the latter was not litigated before the MDET. Second, collateral estoppel has been deemed unfair when the party that would be bound lacked incentive to litigate the issue in the first proceeding because its stake in that proceeding was minimal in comparison with its stake in the second.... The Service had little, if any, stake in the MDET proceeding. Kroeger's receipt of unemployment benefits would not affect rights and liabilities between Kroeger and the Service, and his unemployment compensation would come from state funds. In contrast, the Service had a much greater incentive to defend its removal action. Exclusion of the MDET decision in this case was neither error nor arbitrary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pierce v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 253 Fed. Appx. 946, 949 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), determined that a favorable finding of an unemployment compensation tribunal did not establish that contrary factual findings by the Board in a misconduct case involving credibility determinations lacked substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At times the Federal Circuit recognizes some evidentiary weight in an unemployment compensation decision. Consider the appeal of an employee claiming an involuntary resignation who asserted that the agency threatened him with a dismissal it knew, or should have known, it could not sustain, <span class="Italic">Bryant v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3377):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bryant, acting <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, sustained his burden of proof on this issue. As an attachment to his appeal, he submitted the decision of the Industrial Commission of Utah, Department of Employment Security, which based on a full-blown evidentiary hearing including credibility determinations, found that Bryant's resignation was involuntary. Although this decision is not binding on the Board, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ahr v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 23 MSPR 238, 242 (1984), it constitutes record evidence. In the decision, the Utah Commission found:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The claimant...has offered a reasonable explanation of what happened.... The employer appears to have acted hastily in apprehending the claimant instead of observing him to <span class="Italic">see</span> if he was in fact on his way to deposit the coins as he has stated.... It is felt the employer has failed to offer any substantial evidence to show the claimant committed any illegal act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision, which was not based on a hearing, totally ignored this finding by the Commission even though the Commission's factual findings are record evidence and were uncontroverted by the agency. Considering the record as a whole and particularly the Commission's finding, the agency knew, or should have known, that the reason for the threatened adverse action could not be substantiated and thus, the threatened action by the agency was purely coercive....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another case reviewing a Board decision concerning the extent of injuries suffered in a scuffle, declared serious by the Board, concluded that the Board had not properly considered the evidence. The court referred to contrary findings of an appeals referee on an unemployment claim. <span class="Italic">Faucher v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3261).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The evaluation of unemployment compensation awards as evidence is a difficult problem. Some unemployment compensation cases are vigorously prosecuted and defended. There are important interests involved for the employee, and the government has an obligation to avoid meritless claims on the public purse. The presence of an attorney may be a factor to consider in determining the weight to give a contested proceeding, but MSPB cases are frequently presented by nonlawyers for both employees and management; it cannot be said that a Board appeal prosecuted or defended without counsel would lack subsequent preclusive effect. Perhaps the Board is concerned about the adequacy of adjudication or about what it perceives to be a bias toward employees--or neutrality toward the employer (resulting from an absence of deference to management)--in unemployment compensation determinations. The Board does not state the potential real reason for failing to provide unemployment compensation determinations preclusive effect, so the Board treats the results of unemployment compensation cases in an oblique, case-by-case fashion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board essentially threw up their hands in <span class="Italic">Allen v. USDA</span>, 37 MSPR 234, 239 n.3 (1988), declaring as to the evidentiary value of an unemployment compensation award that "the administrative judge may give this submission, and any response to it that...the agency...provides, as much evidentiary weight as the administrative judge deems appropriate." More collective hand throwing was evidenced in <span class="Italic">Shelton v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 38 MSPR 1, 2-3 (1988), declaring that, in the Board's view, decisions by state unemployment tribunals are not binding on the Board; the decisions are, however, record evidence "worthy of consideration by the Board." What consideration do they merit? As to the effect of the unemployment decision before it: "Absent a showing of material evidentiary conflict or clearly erroneous legal conclusions, mere inconsistency in result between the VEC's reconsideration decision and the decision rendered earlier by the Board's administrative judge constitutes no persuasive basis for further review under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Yartzoff v. EPA</span>, 38 MSPR 403, 408 n.3 (1988), refused to give any effect to an unemployment compensation award, stating that "[W]e have considered that the appellant received a favorable decision concerning unemployment benefits, but we find that there is a preponderance of the record evidence before the Board, including the testimony at the hearing and the appellant's admissions in the response to the notice of proposed removal, that the appellant was insubordinate...." Unfortunately, the Board neglected to say why the unemployment compensation award lacked weight. In a subsequent decision concerning an insubordination case, the Board advised that an unemployment compensation decision favoring an employee was not significant to the Board because the state's definition of insubordination did not follow the definition used by the Board. <span class="Italic">Combs v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 304, 307 (1989); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bonanova v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 49 MSPR 294, 306 (1991) (same); <span class="Italic">Honeyman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 136, 142 (1990) ("The unemployment decision, however, merely sets forth the disputed facts and finds that the appellant did not act with willful and wanton disregard of the agency's interest. There is no 'material evidentiary conflict or clearly erroneous legal conclusions' in the state unemployment decision and the initial decision, and 'mere inconsistency in result between' these decisions does not constitute a basis for further review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shelton</span>, 38 MSPR at 2-3.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After <span class="Italic">Yartzoff</span>, the Board stated it "has held that state unemployment tribunal decisions are not binding on the Board...but that such decisions constitute evidence that the Board should consider." <span class="Italic">Christopher v. DLA</span>, 44 MSPR 264, 272 (1990). We can find decisions such as <span class="Italic">Ward v. USDA</span>, 60 MSPR 306, 309 (1994), announcing that "[T]he Board has held that a state unemployment compensation determination constitutes evidence worthy of consideration," relying on <span class="Italic">Lucas v. VA</span>, 52 MSPR 267, 270 (1992). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Krzewinski v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 353, 360 (1996) (unemployment compensation award was evidence, supporting a requested jurisdictional hearing, that the agency may have breached a last chance agreement by firing the appellant for misconduct). A difficulty with the citation to <span class="Italic">Lucas</span> was that the decision stated: "The Board is not bound by the decisions of state unemployment commissions.... Thus, the findings of the Illinois Department of Employment Security are not relevant to this proceeding." <span class="Italic">Glenn v. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 76 MSPR 572, 581-82 (1997), credited a state unemployment decision with sufficient weight to conclude that the appellant should have been given a jurisdictional hearing on her allegation that, because the agency knew or should have known it could not sustain an action against her, appellant's resignation was coerced.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What does <span class="Italic">Shelton</span> mean? Does <span class="Italic">Yartzoff</span> tell us that unemployment compensation awards are really of no evidentiary weight? The language employed in these decisions is so opaque as to be worthless as precedent. For whatever it is worth, when an employee receives a decision of an unemployment compensation commission, he must bring it to the attention to the Board if he intends to rely upon it through collateral estoppel (or another reason), or the right to raise the issue on appeal is waived. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3176).</p>
