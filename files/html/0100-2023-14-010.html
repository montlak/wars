<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-11"><span class="space">a.</span> Shooting; Killing</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">For a time even an off-duty shooting was not so egregious that nexus could be irrebuttably presumed. The nexus that was presumed to arise when the appellant, a painter, shot another individual during a fight following a poker <span id="Page_2288"></span>game, was rebutted when there was no connection found between the incident and appellant's work. The appellant had no public contact; the supervisor said he was not afraid of being with the appellant; and the appellant continued to work after imprisonment without difficulty. <span class="Italic">Abrams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 12 MSPR 515, 519 (1982). A turning point in the law occurred when <span class="Italic">Abrams</span> was reviewed by the Third Circuit in <span class="Italic">Abrams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 714 F.2d 1219 (3rd Cir. 1983). <span class="Italic">Abrams</span> was exceptional. The case was appealed to the Third Circuit after the Board sustained the appellant's discharge for absenteeism. Without so much as a cross-appeal from the government, the court rewrote the law of nexus on criminal infractions, an issue unrelated to the bases for appellant's judicial petition for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Abrams</span>, the court recognized the principles established in <span class="Italic">Merritt v. DOJ</span>, 6 MSPR 585, 605, 6 MSPB 493 (1981): if the nature and gravity of misconduct are egregious, nexus is presumed; the employee may rebut the presumption by showing an absence of adverse effect and shifting the burden to the agency to establish by a preponderance of the evidence nexus between the off-duty misconduct and service efficiency. The court determined although this presumption might not suffice for certain nonviolent criminal conduct or acts implicating moral turpitude, in cases of federal employees convicted of violent criminal conduct, the conviction of a crime casts doubt on the reliability, trustworthiness, and ethical conduct of the employee. The court, considering suitability issues and rewriting the Board's analysis in the process, declared that if a federal employee commits a violent crime during off-duty hours, a strong and secure presumption arises that the employee's misconduct adversely affects the efficiency of the service. The employee rebuts the presumption only if he can show that his off-duty misconduct will not impede the agency's achievement of its goals, directly or indirectly, through its other employees or interfere with the overall accomplishment of the agency's duties and responsibilities. Of nexus <span class="Italic">Abrams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 714 F.2d 1219, 1222-23 (3rd Cir. 1983), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he House Conference Report, No. 95-1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> [1978] U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2723, 2864, captioned "Conduct Unrelated to Job Performance," states in pertinent part that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"...it is a prohibited personnel practice to discriminate for or against any employee or applicant on the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others. The bill also provides, though, that nothing in the paragraph shall prohibit an agency from taking into account any conviction of the employee or applicant for any crime of violence or moral turpitude when determining suitability or fitness."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This reference in the House Conference Report to violent criminal misconduct reflects the truism that "an employee's conviction of a crime casts grave doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and ethical conduct, all of which naturally affect the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Gueory v. Hampton</span>, 510 F.2d 1222, 1226 (D.C. Cir. 1974), <span class="Italic">citing Embrey v. Hampton</span>, 470 F.2d 146 (4th Cir. 1972), and <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Seamans</span>, 150 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 463 F.2d 837 (D.C. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. dismissed</span>, 409 U.S. 1094, 93 S. Ct. 704, 34 L. Ed.2d 678 (1972). Continued employment of persons convicted of violent criminal conduct diminishes public respect for the agency and undermines its efficacy by dissuading qualified job applicants who prefer not to work with or near a co-employee who has been convicted of shooting a human being. Therefore, where a federal employee commits a violent crime during off-duty hours, a "strong and secure" presumption arises that the employee's misconduct adversely affects the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Gueory v. Hampton</span>, 510 F.2d at 1226.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The employee may rebut this presumption by showing not only that his off-duty conduct will not interfere with or adversely affect his performance of his job but also that his off-duty misconduct will not interfere with or adversely affect his co-employees' performance of their jobs and the overall accomplishment of the agency's duties and responsibilities. An employee may remain at his post only if he can show that his off-duty misconduct will not impede the agency's achievement of its goals directly or indirectly through its other employees while preserving the agency's exercise of discretion in making personnel management decisions. <span class="Italic">See Vance v. Chester County Board of School Trustees</span>, 504 F.2d 820, 825 (4th Cir. 1974) ("government must have wide discretion and control over the management of its personnel and internal affairs...[a]nd this necessarily includes the ability to remove those employees whose conduct hinders efficient operation.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gueory v. Hampton</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Postal Service removed an employee who had committed manslaughter. The district court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and held, as a matter of law, that the agency needed to show specifically how the manslaughter conviction adversely affected the plaintiff's suitability for employment. The Court of Appeals, reversing, held that the violent nature of his misconduct formed a "strong" nexus between the conviction and the efficiency of the service. Therefore, the agency did not need to offer additional evidence of impact.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case at bar, the petitioner shot another individual during a poker game. A jury convicted the petitioner in state court of possession of an instrument of crime, possession of a concealed weapon, simple assault, aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person. Conviction of these offenses raised a "strong and secure" presumption that the efficiency of the service would be adversely affected by the petitioner's continued employment with the agency. In rebuttal the petitioner offered his own testimony, during which he stated that his fellow employees were "glad" to see him return to work and that his position did not entail any public duties. In addition, he offered the testimony, elicited during cross-examination, of his supervisor, John Stull, who stated that the petitioner had never been disciplined for any violent conduct and that his conviction had not impaired his ability to perform his work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that the petitioner's presentation of this evidence showing that his conviction had not impaired his ability to paint ships successfully rebutted the presumption of nexus. However, the Board did not consider whether the petitioner's conviction would adversely affect or interfere with the agency's overall achievement of its responsibilities and its other employees' performance of their jobs. The Board's omission erroneously relieved the petitioner of part of his burden of rebutting the presumption of nexus and, as a consequence, incorrectly imposed upon the agency the burden of introducing evidence in addition to the petitioner's conviction to establish nexus.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand the Board shall decide whether the petitioner introduced sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of nexus in light of this opinion. Specifically, the Board should consider whether the petitioner's evidence showed that his conviction did not adversely affect or interfere with his performance of his own job, the performance of his co-employees' jobs and the overall achievement of the agency's goals and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although in <span class="Italic">Abrams</span> the Board received testimony that the appellant's coworkers were not fearful of him and were glad to have him back on the job after the shooting incident, the court concluded that the Board should have considered the adverse effect of the conviction on the agency's overall responsibilities and the ability of the appellant and other employees to perform their jobs. Factors pertinent included fears by supervisors of future violent conduct, the degree of public contact involved in the appellant's job, and the consequences of the appellant's unavailability for periods when involved in the criminal proceeding. On remand from the Third Circuit's decision, the Board sustained removal, Abrams v. Dept. of Navy, 22 MSPR 480, 488 (1984): the agency was justified in refusing to admit the appellant into a work release program and dismissing him for the underlying criminal misconduct and the unexcused absence resulting from his involvement in criminal proceedings and incarceration. Abrams returned to court, this time to the Federal Circuit (as a result of realignment of review authority following the Federal Courts Improvement Act). The Federal Circuit affirmed on the basis of the Third Circuit decision, characterized as the law of the case, and on the basis that the Board's second analysis was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Abrams v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-733).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gueory v. Hampton</span>, 510 F.2d 1222, 1227 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cited in <span class="Italic">Abrams</span>, involved a Postal Service employee removed following an off duty incident that resulted in a manslaughter conviction. <span class="Italic">Gueory</span> rejected an irrebuttable presumption of nexus:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellee also argues that in applying the interpretive regulations against him, the Service invoked an unconstitutional irrebuttable presumption against him. In support of that contention, he cites cases including the Supreme Court's recent decisions in <span class="Italic">Vlandis v. Kline</span>, 412 U.S. 441, 93 S. Ct. 2230, 37 L. Ed.2d 63 (1973), and <span class="Italic">Stanley v. Illinois</span>, 405 U.S. 645, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed.2d 551 (1972). It is true that the Court has condemned certain statutory presumptions as violative of due process. Appellee, however, woefully misconstrues the scope of these holdings. The Court strongly indicated that procedural due process is violated when these statutory presumptions are irrevocably applied against an individual who receives <span class="Italic">no opportunity for refutation</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 412 U.S. at 446-447, 93 S. Ct. 2230; 405 U.S. at 657-658, 92 S. Ct. 1208. <span class="Italic">See also Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. LaFleur</span>, 414 U.S. 632, 94 S. Ct. 971, 39 L. Ed.2d 52 (1974). Here, no such irrebuttable presumption was employed against appellee. As amply demonstrated in Part I <span class="Italic">supra</span>, even if the interpretive regulation set up a presumption, Gueory was given opportunity after opportunity, hearing after hearing to rebut it. We find no due process violation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Honeycutt v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 22 MSPR 491, 495 (1984), involved a mine inspector placed on emergency suspension, and then removed, for an off-duty shooting. Even though there was apparently provocation for the shooting, the Board sustained the removal because the appellant was in a job involving occasional confrontation. The Board concluded that there was both a reckless disregard for the victim and some publicity involving the incident. Reviewing that decision, the Federal Circuit declared, <span class="Italic">Honeycutt v. Dept. of Labor</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-692):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The seriousness of the act of shooting another person in a manner which is not accidental is so shocking as to undermine public trust in <span id="Page_2289"></span>the federal workforce, in itself creating a presumed nexus with the efficiency of the service....&#8197;In response to the attempt by Honeycutt to rebut this presumption, his agency offered substantial additional specific evidence regarding the lost confidence of Honeycutt's supervisors, the sensitive nature of his job-related responsibilities and public contacts, his public drunkenness, and his incarceration for two days for the incident in issue. This, in combination with the life-threatening nature of his conduct, constitutes the substantial evidence which requires affirmance of the finding of the board that a nexus was shown.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Backus v. OPM</span>, 22 MSPR 457, 461 (1984), involved another off-duty shooting. There was evidence that some coworkers had no apprehension about the appellant's return to the workplace. But the Board explained that as long as there was some apprehension, nexus was not rebutted. <span class="Italic">Faint v. USPS</span>, 22 MSPR 495, 497-98 (1984), followed, involving an off-duty shooting by a supervisor of collections of an individual who had beaten the appellant's daughter. The Board said that assault with a deadly weapon is a circumstance warranting a rebuttable presumption of nexus, a presumption that may be overcome only if the appellant shows an absence of adverse effect on service efficiency. The Board relied on management's concerns about newspaper publicity and a lack of confidence by managers in Faint's conduct, as well as "the possible reaction of employees he would be called upon to supervise." The removal was sustained because the appellant "took the law into his own hands." Removal was also sustained of a mine inspector who, while off duty, used a pellet gun to shoot a neighbor's child. <span class="Italic">Buffalow v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 23 MSPR 280, 283 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ's mitigation of removal to a suspension was reversed as to an employee convicted of manslaughter after an argument led to the shooting and killing of her boyfriend. <span class="Italic">Gueory</span> and <span class="Italic">Abrams</span> established a "strong and secure" nexus, <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 34 MSPR 132, 135 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The most important <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor in this case is the nature and seriousness of the offense....&#8197;An employee's conviction of a crime casts grave doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and ethical conduct, all of which naturally affect the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Gueory</span>, 510 F.2d at 1226. Continued employment of a person convicted of violent criminal conduct can diminish public respect for the agency and undermine its efficacy by dissuading qualified job applicants who prefer not to work with or near a co-employee who has been convicted of shooting a human being. <span class="Italic">Abrams</span>, 714 F.2d 1219, 1223....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown</span> did not limit its nexus or mitigation analysis to reciting only the possibility of future difficulties involving job applicants. <span class="Italic">Brown</span> evaluated the reactions of peers and supervisors to the appellant's workplace return after the shooting incident, 34 MSPR at 136:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge found that the apprehension felt by the appellant's coworkers was not as severe as claimed by the agency and that there was no credible evidence that the appellant presented a safety risk. He acknowledged, however, that the appellant's direct supervisor testified that she was apprehensive when the appellant returned to work, that her apprehension increased after the appellant was convicted, and that the appellant's return to work was a factor in her request to be transferred to another section. The supervisor also testified that some of the appellant's coworkers had expressed similar apprehension--testimony confirmed by one of these coworkers. In addition, two employees submitted affidavits expressing their concern about the appellant's presence at work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the record contains evidence of past verbal incidents between the appellant and other employees and a complaint from another employee concerning treatment received from the appellant....&#8197;[T]he employee stated that the appellant had a reputation for being high strung and having a temper....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We find that the administrative judge simply evaluated the evidence and factors differently and improperly substituted his judgment for that of the deciding official concerning the appropriate penalty....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown</span> also mentioned the Board's view on evidence of the facts involved in a crime when the basis for removal is a conviction, 34 MSPR at 135 n.1:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's removal was based on the conviction, and not the underlying conduct resulting in the conviction, the administrative judge correctly refused to receive evidence from the agency on this conduct. Similarly, however, the administrative judge should not have drawn any conclusions regarding this conduct. Although we do not agree with the agency that statements in the initial decision necessarily show that the administrative judge adopted the appellant's self-defense argument, we stress that the Board will not delve into the circumstances behind the fact that the appellant was convicted by a jury of intentionally killing her boyfriend.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Given the <span class="Italic">Abrams</span> and <span class="Italic">Brown</span> results, it will be a long time before the Board reverses the discharge of an individual involved in an off-duty homicide. The Board makes it impossible to rebut the presumption of nexus, or, alternatively, the Board makes it easy for management to rebut evidence that the presumption has been overcome, e.g., by reliance on supervisors' subjective fears about the effects of the appellant's return to work. In <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 438, 443 (1987), nexus was established because supervisors lost their confidence in the judgment of the appellant to perform her duties as a GS-3 Clerk Typist after the appellant received a three-year suspended sentence for involuntary manslaughter involving the death of her young child. In response to the attempt to rebut the "nexus" by testimony of a probation officer who said the appellant was unlikely to commit similar conduct in the future, the Board brushed the evidence aside in <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> with the statement that "a good prognosis for the appellant's future behavior does not alone outweigh the agency's legitimate apprehension as to her continued employment." <span class="Italic">See Banks v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3227) (off-duty non-fatal shooting during a domestic relations dispute supported the removal of a food service worker; conduct "conflicted with the VA Medical Center's mission of providing medical care to sick and injured veterans"; further, "[w]here a crime is so egregious that 'it speaks for itself,' there is a rational basis for the agency to find the necessary connection between the employee's conduct and the disciplinary employment action taken for the efficiency of the service" (citing <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 727 F.2d 1535 (Fed. Cir. 1984)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A well-advised appellant, with the backing of a good union, may achieve a different result by turning to arbitration rather than the Board. Arbitrators more realistically assess the impact on the job of off-duty problems. In an appeal reviewed in court, it was determined that an off-duty killing was subject to a nexus presumption that could be overcome and that whether a nexus presumption has been overcome is a factual question properly within the province of an arbitrator. Declining to set aside an arbitration award directing reinstatement, over the objections of OPM and the dissent of Judge Davis, the court suggested in <span class="Italic">Horner v. Hardy and AFGE Local 1395</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3125), that OPM was only arguing the facts of the case rather than positing some fundamental misinterpretation of civil service law, rule, or regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator noted that: Hardy's killing of his girl friend's paramour was one of passion in his personal life and was entirely unrelated to his job; Hardy's contact with agency clients was solely on the telephone; Hardy's relationship with co-workers was one of distance; Hardy had never threatened anyone on the job; Hardy performed his stressful job well and without discipline following his indictment and throughout his employment; Hardy acted with restraint when physically attacked in an unrelated matter by an aggressive co-worker; office efficiency had not been adversely affected; there had been no increase in requests for sick leave and no request for transfer; there was no loss of office productivity; the agency did not suspend Hardy, but permitted him to work for the two years pending his indictment; the testimony about co-worker attitude reflected subjective fears insufficient to overcome the objective evidence indicating that Hardy's continued employment would not adversely affect the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's and Hardy's conflicting conjectures on how the Board would have decided the present case do not facilitate review of the arbitrator's decision. Each conjecture and each case cited in its support rests on selected portions of the evidence. Further, that the arbitrator and the Board must apply the "same substantive rules," <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 660-61 (1985), means that each must apply the same principles of civil service law, not that each must reach the same conclusion whenever an employee is convicted of a particular type of crime. OPM's assertion that forum shopping will result because Hardy will be returned to work when others guilty of the same or a lesser crime were not is an inappropriate exercise in result-orientation, in disregard of the entire evidence, including that indicating the presence here and the absence in other cases of evidence rebutting the presumption of nexus with the efficiency of the service. Finally, this court has held that arbitrators' decisions will not be reversed on the mere premise that the Board might have drawn a different conclusion from the evidence. <span class="Italic">Devine v. NTEU</span>, 737 F.2d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Devine v. Sutermeister</span>, 724 F.2d 1558, 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (reversing an arbitrator's finding of lack of nexus involving a drug-related offense), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
