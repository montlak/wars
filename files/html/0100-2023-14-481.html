<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-482"><span class="space">4.</span> Profit Sharing; Gainsharing</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">FEMTC of Charleston and Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>, 32 FLRA 102, 107 (1988) (Proposals 1 and 2), determined that provisions were negotiable concerning a profit-sharing plan established by the shipyard (competing with private sector shipyards for various projects). FLRA rejected the notion (described by the agency as "sovereign immunity") that because the profit-sharing plan involved expenditure of government funds it was nonnegotiable; also rejected was the argument that the proposals, involving financial effects that could be measured to some degree, were barred because they constituted control over the agency budgetary process. FLRA noted that it is expected that some proposals will require expenditure of funds; a proposal does not determine the agency budget if it does not require the agency to establish any particular program or specified level of funding in its budget.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_966"></span>FLRA's position concerning negotiability of profit-sharing programs was rejected by the Fourth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard v. FLRA</span>, 885 F.2d 185, 187-88 (4th Cir. 1989), as infringing the agency's right to determine its own budget. The Fourth Circuit reaffirmed its position on that score in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA v. FLRA</span>, 983 F.2d 578, 582-83, 584-85 (4th Cir. 1992), a decision that in turn partially set aside an FLRA ruling in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Council 220</span>, 41 FLRA 224 (1991), that determined an arbitrator erred when he found management committed no unfair labor practice by denying a grievance protesting management's refusal to negotiate over a profit-sharing plan. The 1992 Fourth Circuit decision implied that, at a minimum, the employer may be obliged to bargain with the union over the impact and implementation of a profit-sharing program. The Fourth Circuit decisions in <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span> and <span class="Italic">DHHS</span> are discussed Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-13-046.html#sec5-47">Determination of Agency Budget</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">Another profit-sharing proposal was approved as negotiable in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-52 and Dept. of Army, Red River Army Depot</span>, 41 FLRA 1057 (1991), <span class="Italic">remanded for clarification</span> (on arguments concerning the impact of the proposal on the agency budget), <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Red River Depot v. FLRA</span>, 977 F.2d 1490, 1492 (D.C. Cir. 1992). FLRA provided analysis of agency objections to the proposal, 41 FLRA at 1060-67:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Statute, parties are obligated to bargain over proposals concerning conditions of employment, provided that the proposals do not violate law, Government-wide regulation, or an agency regulation for which there is a compelling need. Conditions of employment are defined as personnel policies, practices, and matters whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14). However, matters that are specifically provided for by Federal statute are excluded from the definition of conditions of employment. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14)(C).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that where an agency has discretion under applicable law and regulation over a matter affecting conditions of employment, the agency is obligated under the Statute to exercise that discretion through bargaining unless the governing law or regulation specifically requires that only the agency may exercise that discretion.... Thus, it is only where law or applicable regulation vests an agency with exclusive authority or unfettered discretion over a matter that the agency's discretion is not subject to negotiation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Authority has rejected any interpretation of section 7103(a)(14)(C) that would hold that reference to a particular matter in a statute is sufficient to except that matter from the definition of conditions of employment.... Rather, where a statute specifically provides for, or establishes, a particular aspect of a matter, <span class="Italic">that aspect</span> of the matter is not included within the conditions of employment about which an agency is obligated to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's assertion that the proposal concerns a matter that is specifically provided for by Federal statute centers on a claim that the proposal interferes with the discretion vested in it by chapter 45 of title 5 of the U.S. Code to establish incentive programs such as that proposed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the analytical structure that is set out above, we reject this assertion. Chapter 45 authorizes agencies to pay cash awards to employees; however, it does not prescribe the particulars of agency incentive awards programs. Thus, we conclude that the productivity gainsharing program that is proposed is not a matter that is specifically provided for by Federal statute. Rather, it is a matter that is within the Agency's discretion under Chapter 45. The Agency makes no claim, nor is it otherwise apparent to us, that anything in Chapter 45 forecloses the exercise of that discretion through negotiations....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's argument that the proposal is inconsistent with section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute because it concerns pay, a matter which the Agency claims does not come within the ambit of negotiable conditions of employment. As the Agency acknowledges, the Authority previously has rejected arguments that incentive pay constitutes wages or salary. <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS</span>, 27 FLRA 132. However, even assuming that productivity gainsharing does concern pay, the Agency's argument is flawed in another respect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority applies the basic analytical framework that is set forth above to negotiability questions that are presented to it, including those that concern pay and fringe benefits. Applying this framework, the Authority has rejected arguments that pay and fringe benefits, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, do not concern "conditions of employment" within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While this case was pending, the Supreme Court upheld the Authority's conclusion that proposals concerning pay and fringe benefits concern "conditions of employment" in circumstances where pay and fringe benefits are not specifically provided for by statute. <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA</span>, 110 S. Ct. 2043 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>). In <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>, the Court held that the Authority's conclusion that a proposal concerning pay related to "conditions of employment" within the meaning of the Statute was a permissible construction of the Statute. The Court rejected contentions that (1) the term "conditions of employment," which is contained in the Statute, does not encompass pay and (2) statements in the legislative history of the Statute warrant a conclusion that pay and fringe benefits are not "conditions of employment" under the Statute. Thus...matters concerning pay and fringe benefits that are not specifically provided for by statute, but are left to the discretion of the agency, are conditions of employment within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's assertion that the proposal directly interferes with management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work. The reasoning offered by the Agency in support of its argument is essentially that because the purpose of the productivity gainsharing program is to motivate employees to work better, the program amounts to a methods and means of performing work within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. This reasoning is analogous to reasoning that has been rejected in two circuits of the United States Court of Appeals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In one case, the Ninth Circuit rejected a conclusion that the manner of distributing employee paychecks constituted a method or means of performing work. The premise for that conclusion had been that the agency involved needed a committed work force to accomplish its mission and that such was assured only if employees were paid. In rejecting the conclusion the court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This line of reasoning proves too much. Because any benefit to employees is a means of retaining a stable and committed workforce, [this] reasoning would imply that all wages, hours, and working conditions are within the means and methods exception. To take the exception this far stretches the plain meaning of words to the breaking point. Nothing related to retaining the workforce would be subject to bargaining. Had Congress meant the exception to extend that far, it would not have adopted the [Statute].</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">FEMTC v. FLRA</span>, 778 F.2d 1429, 1431 (9th Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In another case, the D.C. Circuit rejected a conclusion that levels of incentive pay constituted an exercise of management's rights to direct employees and assign work because such pay directly related to the potential success of the incentive in motivating the performance of particular job tasks. The court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If the latter principle were applied consistently, it is difficult to imagine <span class="Italic">any</span> agency prescriptions regarding terms and conditions of work for particular classes of employees that would remain bargainable, since (unless the agency is squandering its resources) they all have the same ultimate objective as assignment and direction, <span class="Italic">viz.</span>, increased production by those employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 371, 374-75 (D.C. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the courts that management's rights are not so all-encompassing as to include everything that contributes generally to employee motivation. In our view, in order for a matter properly to come within the ambit of methods and means under section 7106(b)(1) there must be a more specific relationship to the performance of work than the general motivation of employees. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Division of Military and Naval Affairs, State of New York, Albany, New York and New York Council, ACT</span>, 15 FLRA 288 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">New York Council, ACT v. FLRA</span>, 757 F.2d 502 (2d Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 106 S. Ct. 137 (1985) (requirement that civilian technicians wear the military uniform constituted a methods and means of performing work within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute where the purpose of the requirement was to instill military characteristics in employees who performed military functions in a military organization).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we reject the Agency's argument that the productivity gainsharing program is brought within the ambit of section 7106(b)(1) based simply on its role in motivating employees to work more productively.... To the extent that the analysis relied on in the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>, 32 FLRA at 115 (1988), can be read to suggest that the establishment of a gainsharing program constitutes an exercise of management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work, it will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Now we turn to the Agency's assertion that this proposal, by requiring the continuation of the gainsharing program and specifying the distribution formula for gainsharing, is nonnegotiable under the first prong of the Authority's test for determining whether proposals directly interfere with management's right to determine its budget that was set forth in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, 2 FLRA at 607-08.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we note that we have not adopted the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span> on which the Agency relies. In fact, we have specifically rejected the court's conclusion that an agency's "discretion and control over an agency's funding decisions" equates to management's right to determine its budget pursuant to section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. DHHS, SSA, Baltimore, Maryland and AFGE, Council 220</span>, 41 FLRA 224 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>). In <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span> we stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, the Authority noted that whether a proposal <span id="page_967"></span>directly affects an agency's determination of its budget depends upon the definition of "budget" as used in the Statute. The Authority stated that, in the absence of a definition in the Statute or its legislative history, it was appropriate to give the term its common or dictionary definition. Accordingly, the Authority adopted the dictionary's definition of "budget" as "a statement of the financial position of a body for a definite period of time based on detailed estimates of planned or expected expenditures during the period and proposals for financing them." 2 FLRA at 608. From this definition, the Authority developed its two-prong test for determining whether a proposal directly interferes with management's right to determine its budget.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Under the first prong of this test, in order for an agency to demonstrate that a proposal directly interferes with management's right to determine its budget, the agency must show either that the proposal prescribes the programs and operations to be included in the agency's budget or prescribes the amount to be allocated for them. We adhere to the interpretation and application of the first prong of the budget test and the established meaning of the term "budget," as interpreted and applied by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">41 FLRA at 231-32.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's contentions that the proposal prescribes a program, i.e., gainsharing, for inclusion in the Agency's budget and mandates a specific dollar amount to be allocated in the budget for that program do not accord with other information and statements in the record. The Agency itself describes gainsharing as dependent on the existence of cost savings generated by productivity increases. For example, in describing the gainsharing program that the Union proposes to continue, the Agency states, "the gain sharing [sic] program provided...that cost savings generated...would be split between management and the employees on a 50/50 basis."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union describes the proposal as having no impact on the budget or the budget-making process.... Rather, according to the Union, the gainsharing program operates based on a budget that already has been established and simply entails the distribution of the savings that accrue from productivity increases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we note that in issuing guidance to agencies concerning such programs, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has defined "productivity gainsharing program" as "an agency's program to share monetary savings with employees when their achievements above agency established levels of productivity result in measurable savings to the government." Federal Personnel Manual Letter 451-6 (April 10, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the concept underlying productivity gainsharing, i.e., the distribution of savings resulting from gains in productivity, it is unclear to us how a proposal requiring that a gainsharing program be established and specifying the distribution formula to be used prescribes the programs and operations to be included in the agency's budget or prescribes the amount to be allocated for them, as the Agency claims. Rather, it appears that the proposal is limited to a matter that occurs within the context of, and reflects, a budget that already has been formulated.</p>
<p class="noindent">Following remand from the D.C. Circuit, FLRA issued another decision, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-52 and Dept. of Army, Red River Depot, Texarkana</span>, 48 FLRA 1198 (1993), again determining to be negotiable the gainsharing proposal under the first prong of the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> budget interference test. [The 1993 FLRA decision is discussed in Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-13-046.html#sec5-47">Determination of Agency Budget</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite the negotiability of proposals calling in general terms for productivity gainsharing, proposals may become nonnegotiable as they become more specific in defining what resources will be devoted to the negotiated program. A proposal requesting 1.5% of base salaries as the maximum funding level for a performance awards pool was ruled a nonnegotiable infringement on the right of management to establish its budget. By imposing a ceiling on what the agency's budget could contain by way of funds for incentive awards, the proposal went "directly to the budget <span class="Italic">per se</span>." <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local No. 1 and Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 38 FLRA 1589, 1596 (1991) (Proposal 1) (not considered under arrangements test); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">SSA Inland Empire Area and AFGE</span>, 46 FLRA 161 (1992) (ULP case: management unlawfully discriminated against union officials whose official duty time was not counted toward distribution in "gainsharing" program).</p>
