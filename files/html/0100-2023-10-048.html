<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-48"><span class="space">1.</span> Change of Venue</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The regional office for filing an appeal is established in 5 CFR 1201.4(d) (2022) as the region in the area encompassing the appellant's duty station at the time the agency action was taken (the Board region where the appellant lives has jurisdiction over appeals from OPM reconsideration decisions and adverse suitability determinations). The regulation does not prevent the Board from transferring adjudication of the case to another regional office to facilitate case processing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although equitable principles of fairness and justice mandate that a AJ give consideration to a request for transfer of an appeal from the appropriate regional office for filing to another office for adjudication, the AJ's determination on the request is a matter of substantial discretion. <span class="Italic">Haptonstahl v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 506, 508 (1983). In determining a hearing site, considerations of convenience and expense for the employee and his witnesses should weigh heavily. <span class="Italic">Jahn v. USDA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 88-3358). The Board's principal case on venue is <span class="Italic">Pope v. Dept. of Transp</span>., <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/POPE_SE07528210074_OPINION_AND_ORDER_256077.pdf">12 MSPR 93</a>, 98-100, 10 MSPB 645 (1982), describing the considerations involved in determination of a hearing site.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pope</span> involved witnesses to be called from both Washington, D.C., and Seattle, Washington, where the appeal was filed following the reassignment of the appellant to Seattle from Washington, D.C., and his subsequent discharge for unacceptable performance. The appellant claimed the reassignment and discharge were reprisals for whistleblowing in Washington, D.C. The Board assigned the case to its Office of Administrative Law Judges in Washington, D.C., in the belief that hearings, depositions, and other conduct of the case could, in the reasonable discretion of the ALJ, be best conducted in part in Washington, D.C. and in part in Seattle, to balance the equities of cost and convenience between the appellant and the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pope</span> noted that Board regulations do not provide for a change of venue, but the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 USC 554, describes procedural rights applicable in every case of administrative adjudication required by statute. Section 554(b) provides that "[i]n fixing the time and place for hearings, due regard shall be had for the convenience and necessity of the parties or their representatives." This provision means, under judicial construction, that in scheduling an application for a hearing, the convenience of all parties concerned, including the agency, must be considered.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pope</span> explained that although it considers itself generally exempt from the requirements of 5 USC 554 [subsection (a)(2) specifically exempts from the APA's requirements administrative adjudications required by statute concerning the selection or tenure of an employee], equitable principles of fairness and justice require that a determination by an AJ to transfer a case from the appropriate regional office to another regional office be made after careful consideration of the interests of all parties to prevent inconvenience, waste of time, energy, and money. The AJ must reasonably exercise judgment to determine whether the facts presented by the moving party warrant a transfer, and the AJ must explain the decision. Relevant <span class="Italic">Pope</span> factors, discussed at 12 MSPR at 99-100, include but are not limited to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;The timeliness of the motion to transfer, which should usually be made prior to the completion of discovery;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;The convenience of all of the parties;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;The convenience of all of the witnesses, considering the number of witnesses proffered by the parties, the substance and materiality of the proffered testimony, the location of the witnesses, the susceptibility of witnesses to subpoena by the Board, the willingness of witnesses not subject to the Board's subpoena authority to attend the hearing, the expense of obtaining the attendance of the witnesses, the length of time the witnesses will be required at the hearing, and whether the affidavit or deposition of a witness can suffice in lieu of live testimony;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;The relative ease of access to sources of proof such as records, documents and exhibits, and the difficulty and expense in transporting such sources of proof;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;The probability of a speedier adjudication in the transferee regional office;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1342"></span>6.&#x2003;The pendency of similar or related actions appealable to the Board in the transferee regional office;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">7.&#x2003;The reduction of the expenses of the parties;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">8.&#x2003;The location of the permanent residence of the parties;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">9.&#x2003;The convenience or availability of counsel to the parties to travel to the transferee regional office, or to a party to retain local counsel;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board emphasizes that these factors should be carefully examined and weighed, considering the interests of all of the parties, including the agency. While these factors are not exhaustive and in some way overlap or have less relevance than others under the particular facts and circumstances of a case, they serve as useful guidance for determining whether to permit the transfer of a case to another regional office upon the motion of a party.[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;Of course, the parties may, by joint motion, consent or stipulation of all parties, request the transfer of a case to another regional office, in the reasoned discretion of the presiding official. Further, nothing in this opinion prohibits the transfer of a case to another regional office for adjudication in order to facilitate processing where a hearing is not requested by the parties and no prejudice to their substantive rights will result. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.4(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The moving party or parties should submit a memorandum in support of a motion to transfer, setting forth all considerations relied upon to show that a transfer is warranted, substantiated by affidavits or other documentary evidence wherever there is a question of fact to be resolved. The opposing party or parties should likewise set forth in response all considerations relied upon in opposition to the motion, including affidavits or other documentary evidence pertaining to contested facts relevant to the motion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A Board Regional Office Memorandum of January 10, 1983, advised that normally the location of the hearing site will be that closest to the appellant's duty station with the respondent agency. The factors to be taken into account in the choice of a hearing site at a place other than the one where it would normally be scheduled are those described in <span class="Italic">Pope</span>, elaborated on by the Board in its Notice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;Convenience of the parties: As a general rule the parties should not be expected to travel more than 100 miles to attend an MSPB hearing....&#8197;Convenience is not, however, measured solely by distance. The availability of adequate transportation, ease of access to the fixed site, and the anticipated length of the hearing must also be taken into account.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;Cost to the parties: Because of the large number of fixed sites designated by the Board and their proximity to the areas that historically have generated most of our appeals, the cost to the parties of attending hearings should not as a general rule be prohibitive or unduly burdensome. Cost is nevertheless a factor that must be considered if raised by the parties. An exception to the policy would be warranted for example if an appellant were able to demonstrate that the expenses necessary to his/her attendance at a particular fixed site would create a severe financial hardship. Agencies may on occasion similarly claim that their financial situation prevents them from traveling to a hearing. If substantiated by adequate documentation, such a contention may well justify selection of an alternative hearing location.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our experience over the last year shows, however, that agencies concerned with the expense of traveling to a hearing will frequently argue that the cost to the government as a whole would be less if the Board were to send its presiding official to hold a hearing at their location. Cost-effectiveness is a valid concern, and may be the basis for an exception to the fixed site policy. Several determinations must be made, however, before granting an exception for this reason. First, because the cost of producing witnesses will almost always be the greatest agency expense, the substance and materiality of the expected testimony, the necessity of the witnesses' appearances, and the extent to which an affidavit or deposition might be used in lieu of live testimony should be examined. Second, as a general rule, only the travel and per diem expenses necessary to assure the appearance of essential witnesses should be considered in evaluating an agency's costs. Employees' salaries for the hours they are involved in the hearing, and other expenses that would be incurred regardless of where the hearing is held, should not be taken into account. Finally, an exception should be granted only if the agency's expense is excessively disproportionate to the additional cost to the Board of sending a presiding official to the agency location or to a more convenient neutral location. There is no set dollar amount at which expenses automatically become excessive. That figure will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, the decision whether to grant an exception because of the agency's costs may be influenced by the absence or presence of the other factors listed in this memorandum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;Cost to the Board: The effective utilization of its available funding was a primary consideration of the Board in adopting this fixed site policy. In deciding whether to grant exceptions to this policy, regional directors must be ever attentive to the resultant cost to the Board. That cost may be prohibitive in some cases and therefore itself constitute a basis for denying an exception. On the other hand, travel to an alternative site may be desirable if the cost is no greater and the location is more convenient to the parties. In assessing Board expenses, close attention will have to be given to court reporter costs. Under the new contracts, reporters will be entitled to travel and per diem expenses only for hearings held at locations other than the approved sites.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;Travel Time: The hearing policy is also intended to conserve on the amount of time spent traveling to and from hearing locations. The additional travel time required by an exception as well as the increased number of hours that a presiding official will be absent from the office must therefore be taken into account.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(5)&#x2003;Timely Processing: Travel to an alternative site may be authorized by a regional director if he/she determines that under the circumstances of a particular case such action is necessary to meet the Board's 120-day time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(6)&#x2003;Disruption of Agency Operations. If any agency is able to demonstrate that the production of certain witnesses at an approved site would require it to close down or seriously restrict an essential operation, an alternative hearing site that is more convenient may be used. When an agency raises an issue of this kind, the presiding official should first attempt to minimize the disruption by regulating the order of witnesses and the time of day at which they are to appear. If these efforts are unsuccessful or unduly prolong the hearing, an exception should be granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(7)&#x2003;The claimed inability of an appellant to travel to a fixed site because of his/her medical condition may justify an exception to the hearing policy. If the condition is adequately documented and if a continuance for a reasonable period of time would not resolve the problem, the hearing may properly be scheduled at a location that would permit the appellant's attendance.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will exercise reasonable judgment in determining whether there has been an articulation or presentation of facts by the moving party which warrants the transfer of a case to another regional or field office for adjudication, and articulate a rational explanation for the determination on the motion. <span class="Italic">See Pope v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 10 MSPB 645, 12 MSPR 93, 98 (1982). In fixing the time and place for hearings, due regard shall be had for the convenience and necessity of the parties or their representatives. <span class="Italic">See Pope,</span> 12 MSPR at 97. In scheduling an appeal for hearing, the convenience of all the parties concerned, including the convenience of the agency, must be accorded due recognition. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Factors for consideration in deciding whether to grant a motion to transfer a case to another Board office include the timeliness of the motion, the convenience of all the parties and witnesses, the relative ease of access to sources of proof, the probability of speedier adjudication in the transferee office, the pendency of similar or related actions appealable to the Board in the transferee office, the reduction of the parties' expenses, the location of the parties' permanent residence, the convenience or availability of counsel, the lack of inconvenience to a party resulting from the transfer, and the nature of the interest of the parties and of the public in the proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Pope,</span> 12 MSPR at 98-100.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's petition-for-review motion to transfer was timely filed. Also, the decision that the appellant could not provide counseling services was issued by a Texas activity. The decision on the appellant's qualifications for the GS-11 position, however, appears to have been made in Seoul. On May 10, 1996, the appellant filed an appeal of the agency's demotion action with the Dallas Field Office. Thus, a similar or related action is pending in Dallas. The appellant's expenses would be reduced if the action were heard in Dallas, nearer to her permanent residence than Seoul, and there is no indication that the agency expenses would be increased by bringing witnesses from Seoul to Dallas rather than by bringing witnesses from Dallas to Seoul. Dallas would also provide the appellant easier access to her chosen counsel, and there is no evidence that it would limit the agency's access to counsel. We note that the appellant was in the process of leaving Seoul for Texas when she filed her appeal, and she chose counsel after she returned from Seoul to Texas. We find that there was no reason therefore for her to seek local counsel in Seoul. <span class="Italic">Cf. Brumley v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 46 MSPR 666, 676-78 (1991) (motion for transfer properly denied where, among other things, employee did not indicate whether he attempted to secure local counsel to represent his interests)....</p>
