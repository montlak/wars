<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-49"><span class="space">8.</span> Transportation Security Agency</h4>
<p class="noindent">Deserving separate treatment is TSA. In <span class="Italic">DHS, TSA and AFGE</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-53.html">65 FLRA 242</a> (2010), FLRA undertook the novel approach of permitting a representation proceeding to be conducted for a unit that, through the date of the decision, was precluded from engaging in collective bargaining under the Authority decision in <span class="Italic">DHS TSA and AFGE</span>, 59 FLRA 423, 423-24, 427-30 (2003), <span class="Italic">post.</span> The representation proceeding, if it resulted in a union being selected (AFGE and NTEU being the contestants), would place the unit in the position of being the exclusive representative for purposes of providing representation in labor relations matters other than collective bargaining, e.g., representation in <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> interviews, processing of grievances under the administrative grievance procedure, representation in adverse action or EEO cases or at formal meetings (presumably not involving aspects of collective bargaining). FLRA's decision, in part recognizing what had become informal recognition of unions within TSA, was issued over the dissent of Member Beck, who argued that by statute representation proceedings are for the purpose of selecting unions to engage in collective bargaining, and without that statutory test being met, there could be no basis under law to conduct a representation proceeding. The majority and dissenting opinions are set out, 65 FLRA at 242-51:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is before the Authority on applications for review filed by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) under &#x00A7; 2422.31 of the Authority's Regulations. The Agency filed responses to AFGE's and NTEU's applications, and AFGE filed a response to NTEU's application. In addition, pursuant to &#x00A7; 2429.9 of the Authority's Regulations, the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation (the Foundation) requested, and received, permission to file an <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> brief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE and NTEU filed petitions under &#x00A7; 7111(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute). AFGE's petition seeks "an election for exclusive recognition" of the Agency's transportation security officers (TSOs). NTEU's petition "requests that a representation election be held[.] The Regional Director (RD) found that the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">United States Department of Homeland Security, Border and Transportation Security Directorate, Transportation Security Administration,</span> 59 FLRA 423 (2003) (then-Member Pope dissenting) (<span class="Italic">TSA),</span> precluded him from processing the petitions. Accordingly, he dismissed the petitions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In two separate orders issued following the filing of the applications for review, the Authority granted the respective applications and deferred action on their merits. In the second order, the Authority also consolidated the cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we reverse the RD's Decision and Order dismissing the petitions and order the RD to take appropriate action consistent with this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Background</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In November of 2001, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), which created the Agency. As relevant here, in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935 Note, Congress stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security [Under Secretary] may employ, appoint, discipline, terminate, and fix the compensation, terms, and conditions of employment of Federal service for such a number of individuals as the Under Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out the screening functions of the Under Secretary under section 44901 of title 49, United States Code. The Under Secretary shall establish levels of compensation and other benefits for individuals so employed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to this statutory authority, in 2003, the Under Secretary issued a memorandum (the Memo) that states, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I hereby determine that individuals carrying out the security screening function under section 44901 of Title 49, United States Code, in light of their critical national security responsibilities, shall not, as a term or condition of their employment, be entitled to engage in collective bargaining or be represented for the purpose of engaging in such bargaining by any representative or organization.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">TSA,</span> 59 FLRA at 424.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, AFGE filed petitions seeking an election to determine whether the TSOs wished to be represented by AFGE for the purpose of collective bargaining. In <span class="Italic">TSA, </span>59 FLRA 423, the Authority found that &#x00A7; 7111 of the Statute permits employees to select an exclusive representative "for the purpose of collective bargaining[,]" and that "a union obtaining exclusive representative status under &#x00A7; 7111 obtains the full range of exclusive representative rights established by" the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 428. Further, the Authority found that there was "no support for the argument that the Under Secretary meant to permit the creation or recognition of an exclusive representative having less than the full rights accorded to exclusive representatives under" the Statute, and that the Memo "precludes the recognition of an exclusive representative for any and all representational activity permitted by" the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 429. Moreover, the Authority held that there was no evidence of Congressional intent to give the Authority power to determine an appropriate unit and conduct an election for any purpose other than to determine a representative for collective bargaining, or to create "some sort of hybrid exclusive representative[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Finally, the Authority determined that, even if it agreed that a union could utilize the procedures encompassed by &#x00A7; 7111 to become recognized as a "hybrid exclusive representative having less than the full rights accorded by" the Statute, "the Under Secretary's exercise of his sole and exclusive discretion precludes such an outcome[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Later, AFGE and NTEU filed the petitions at issue here. As stated previously, AFGE seeks "an election for exclusive recognition" of the Agency's TSOs, while NTEU "requests that a representation election be held[.]" AFGE Petition (Feb. 22, 2010); NTEU Petition (March 17, 2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;RD's Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the decision in <span class="Italic">TSA </span>required him to dismiss AFGE's and NTEU's petitions. In this connection, the RD determined that the ATSA, the Memo, and <span class="Italic">TSA</span> "remain in full force and effect[,]" and that he was "bound to follow and apply" <span class="Italic">TSA </span>because it is "the established precedent of the Authority."<span class="Italic"> </span>In addition, the RD rejected an argument by AFGE that the Memo violates the United States Constitution.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VI.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed previously, in <span class="Italic">TSA,</span> the Authority found, among other things, that there was "no support for the argument that the Under Secretary meant to permit the creation or recognition of an exclusive representative having less than the full rights accorded to exclusive representatives under" the Statute, and that the Memo "precludes the recognition of an exclusive representative for any and all representational activity permitted by" the Statute. 59 FLRA at 429.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that, since <span class="Italic">TSA, </span>the Agency has recognized AFGE and NTEU as representatives of some employees for purposes of non-collective-bargaining activity. In fact, as noted previously, the Agency expressly states that it does not oppose an election for an exclusive representative, as long as the election is not for the purposes of certifying a union that could engage in collective bargaining. Thus, the premise of the decision in <span class="Italic">TSA</span>--that the Memo "precludes the recognition of an exclusive representative for any and all representational activity permitted by" the Statute, 59 FLRA at 429--is inconsistent with all parties' interpretations of the Memo as well as their current practice. Accordingly, we find it appropriate to reconsider <span class="Italic">TSA</span> and reassess whether &#x00A7; 7111 of the Statute precludes processing election petitions with respect to TSOs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to that issue, &#x00A7; 7111 provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If a petition is filed with the Authority...by any person<span class="Italic"> alleging</span>...in the case of an appropriate unit for which there is no exclusive representative, <span class="Italic">that 30 percent of the employees in the appropriate unit wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by an exclusive representative</span>...the Authority <span class="Italic">shall </span>investigate the petition, and if it has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, it <span class="Italic">shall</span> provide an opportunity for a hearing (for which a transcript shall be kept) after a reasonable notice. If the Authority finds on the record of the hearing that a question of representation exists, the Authority <span class="Italic">shall</span> supervise or conduct an election on the question by secret ballot and shall certify the results thereof.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In other words, in order for the Authority to be obligated to process a representation petition seeking an election, the petition must include an allegation that thirty percent of employees in an appropriate unit "wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by an exclusive representative[.]"<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>The plain wording of &#x00A7; 7111 focuses on the wishes of <span class="Italic">employees</span>, not the wishes or intentions of <span class="Italic">employers</span>. Therefore, nothing in the plain wording of &#x00A7; 7111 indicates that the Authority may refuse to meet its statutory obligation to process representation petitions solely because an employer does not intend to accord its employees' exclusive representative the full range of collective-bargaining rights.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Nothing in the wording of AFGE's or NTEU's petitions precludes the Authority from processing those petitions. In this regard, as stated previously, AFGE's petition seeks "an election for exclusive recognition" of the TSOs, AFGE's Petition (Feb. 22, 2010), and NTEU's petition "requests that a representation election be held[.] We construe these broad statements as expressing an interest by TSOs to have the respective labor organizations represent them for purposes including, but not limited to, collective bargaining. In <span id="page_74"></span>addition, although the parties argue that it would be appropriate to conduct an election for non-collective-bargaining purposes, they do not concede that they are seeking an election solely for such purposes. Thus, there is no basis for the dissent's assertion that, if an election is conducted, then employees will have selected an exclusive representative "for very limited purposes having nothing to do with collective bargaining[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In fact, such an interpretation of &#x00A7; 7111 would be inconsistent with the fact that the Authority consistently recognizes labor organizations as exclusive representatives even where those representatives have less than full collective bargaining rights under the Statute<span class="Italic">. E.g., NAGE, Local R1-187, SEIU, </span>64 FLRA 627, 628-29 (2010) (under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422, Secretary of Veterans Affairs or designee has unreviewable discretion to determine that a matter concerns or arises out of professional conduct or competence and, thus, is not subject to collective bargaining); <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>61 FLRA 871, 877 (2006) (then-Member Pope writing separately) (sole and exclusive discretion of Comptroller of the Currency barred negotiation over some, but not other, matters);<span class="Italic"> U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, S.W. Indian Polytechnic Inst., Albuquerque, NM,</span> 58 FLRA 246, 248-50 (2002) (agency had sole and exclusive discretion to determine whether to bargain over a demonstration project prior to its implementation); <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Tex. Lone Star Chapter 100, </span>55 FLRA 1226, 1228 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 250 F.3d 778, 784 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (National Guard technicians may not bargain concerning military aspects of civilian technician employment); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 884, </span>47 FLRA 884, 893-98 (1993) (Member Talkin dissenting in part), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. AFGE, Local 3295 v. FLRA, </span>46 F.3d 73, 76 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (under 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1462a(g), Director of Office of Thrift Supervision has sole and exclusive discretion to set pay and benefits, subject to a limited exception).[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;We acknowledge that the cited decisions are not representation decisions. Nevertheless, they demonstrate that labor organizations may be exclusive representatives under the Statute even if they have limited collective-bargaining rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the instant case is distinguishable from the above-cited decisions, in that the TSOs at issue here currently lack any right--rather than a limited right--to engage in collective bargaining, we find this to be a distinction without a meaningful difference in terms of whether the election petitions should be processed. In this regard, even if one of the labor organizations is certified but precluded from engaging in collective bargaining, the Statute provides exclusive representatives with several rights separate from negotiating collective bargaining agreements.[10] For example, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) provides exclusive representatives with not only the right to "negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering" unit employees, but also a separate right to "act for[&#8197;]" those employees. Additionally, &#x00A7; 7117(d)(1) gives certain exclusive representatives the right to "consultation rights[,]" separate and apart from the right to engage in collective bargaining. Further, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) entitles the exclusive representative to be represented at certain "formal discussion[s]...concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practices or other general condition of employment[.]" In this connection, the Authority has held that the definition of "grievance" is not dependent on the scope of a negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See Luke Air Force Base, Ariz., </span>54 FLRA 716, 730 (1998), <span class="Italic">rev'd, </span>208 F.3d 221 (9th Cir. 1999). As such, the right of an exclusive representative to attend formal discussions under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) does not require the existence of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;We agree with the dissent that there is a difference between "<span class="Italic">some collective</span> bargaining and no collective bargaining." However, in our view, there is an even more critical difference between being represented for all statutory purposes (including collective bargaining) and being unable to be represented for <span class="Italic">any statutory purposes at all</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) entitles the exclusive representative to be represented at any agency representative's examination of a unit employee <span class="Italic">(Weingarten </span>discussion) if "the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action" and "the employee requests representation." In this regard, the Authority has held that the rights regarding <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>discussions under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) "are not tied to collective bargaining." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Jackson, Miss., </span>48 FLRA 787, 793 (1993), <span class="Italic">recons. denied, </span>49 FLRA 701 (1994). Thus, the fact that an exclusive representative lacks collective bargaining rights does not nullify <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, a certified, exclusive representative has several rights under the Statute that are not dependent on the right to negotiate collective bargaining agreements. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Wash., D.C. v. FLRA, </span>1 F.3d 19, 21 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (although certain employees of the Veterans Administration "had no statutorily-protected right to negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or to administer such agreements through grievance arbitration procedures, they had and retain other rights protected by the [Statute], including 'the right to form, join, or assist a labor organization without fear of penalty or reprisal.'" (citation omitted)). The existence of these rights supports a conclusion that the Statute does not preclude the Authority from processing AFGE's and NTEU's election petitions merely because the Under Secretary exercised his statutory discretion to decline to accord exclusive representatives the right to engage in collective bargaining. Thus, we find no statutory basis for declining to process the petitions in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the Foundation's <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief supports a contrary conclusion. With regard to the Foundation's security-related concerns, even if AFGE or NTEU ultimately is certified as the TSOs' exclusive representative, that would not alter the Under Secretary's authority under the ATSA to set TSOs' conditions of employment and to decide whether and how to conduct collective bargaining. With regard to the Foundation's discussion of members of the military and employees of the FBI, CIA, and Secret Service, Congress specifically exempted "member[s] of the uniformed services" from the definition of "employee" under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Statute, and specifically exempted the FBI, CIA, and Secret Service from the definition of "agency" under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(3)(B), (C), and (H) of the Statute. The fact that Congress could have, but did not, specifically exempt TSOs or the Agency from the coverage of the Statute supports, rather than undercuts, a conclusion that Congress intended the Statute--including &#x00A7; 7111--to apply to TSOs.<span class="Italic"> See AFGE, Local 3529, </span>59 FLRA 619, 622 (2004) (noting that Congress expressly exempted one agency from coverage of a law and stating that, "had Congress intended to exclude [another agency], it would have done so"). With regard to the Foundation's argument that granting the petition would "force 75% of the proposed bargaining unit to be represented by" a labor organization, that argument ignores the fact that, if that percentage of employees votes for no labor organization, then no labor organization will be certified. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(a) (to be entitled to exclusive recognition, labor organization must be chosen by "a majority" of unit employees who vote). Finally, with regard to the Foundation's claim that processing the petition would violate TSOs' "fundamental right" to resolve workplace disputes without relying on an exclusive representative, the Foundation does not explain how the Statute's election procedures do not adequately protect the alleged right. As such, the Foundation's arguments are misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the decision in <span class="Italic">TSA</span> warrants reconsideration, and, on reconsideration, we overrule <span class="Italic">TSA</span> and reverse the RD's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so finding, we acknowledge NTEU's and the Agency's argument that, in directing an election, we should explain what exclusive representation means absent the right to engage in collective bargaining. To the extent that this argument suggests that we should articulate all of the details regarding how the Agency would be required to deal with AFGE or NTEU should either of those labor organizations be certified, it is neither necessary nor prudent to do so here. In this regard, although issues have been raised and questions posed, the record does not include the parties' arguments on these matters.[13] Moreover, although the parties' positions on these issues and questions could be obtained, doing so at this point would delay the election, and such delay is contrary to the purposes of the Statute. In this connection, the Authority has held that there is a "public interest[&#8197;]" in "allowing employees to vote for the representative of their choice, without undue delay or the possible influence of extraneous factors caused by the passage of time[.]" <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army, U.S. Army Aviation Missile Command (AMCOM), Redstone Arsenal, Ala.,</span> 55 FLRA 640, 645 (1999) (Member Wasserman dissenting in part).<span class="Italic"> Accord Nat'l Ass'n of Agric. Emps., </span>61 FLRA 545, 548 (2006), <span class="Italic">review dismissed, </span>473 F.3d 983 (9th Cir. 2007) (denying request for stay of election). Thus, we reject NTEU's and the Agency's argument in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;We note that the dissent also poses several questions regarding what will occur if the petitions are processed, and asserts that the questions "demonstrate that our Statute does not countenance the election of an exclusive representative that has no collective bargaining rights." However, the dissent's questions do not have such far-reaching implications. They simply "demonstrate" that recognizing an exclusive representative with less than full collective bargaining rights has the potential to raise complex legal issues--the type of issues that the Authority frequently is faced with under the Statute. We may not abdicate our statutory responsibility to effect statutory rights merely because doing so may raise additional, complex questions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also acknowledge the Agency's statement that we should await the outcome of the Agency's review of labor relations, including the issue of collective bargaining among TSOs and, potentially, the Memo. However, the Agency does not indicate how long this review will take. Thus, granting the Agency's request could indefinitely preclude the TSOs from exercising the important statutory right discussed above, and we find it inappropriate to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with regard to the Agency's request to provide further briefing, the Agency has had an opportunity to, and did, provide full briefing. In <span id="page_75"></span>addition, granting the Agency's request also would unnecessarily delay the TSOs from exercising their statutory right to vote. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's request to provide additional briefing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we reconsider and overrule <span class="Italic">TSA,</span> reverse the RD's decision, and remand to the RD to process AFGE's and NTEU's petitions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Member Beck, Dissenting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question presented in this matter is not whether transportation security officers (TSOs) <span class="Italic">should</span> enjoy collective bargaining rights, nor whether TSOs <span class="Italic">should </span>be represented for certain purposes by one or more labor organizations. These are questions of policy that fall, in the first instance, to the Congress. When it created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in 2001, Congress left it to the Executive Branch, in the person of the TSA Administrator (formerly known as the "Under Secretary"), to answer these questions. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 111(d) of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, Pub. L. No. 107-71, <span class="Italic">codified as </span>49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935 Note 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The crucial question presented by AFGE's and NTEU's petitions here is strictly a legal question: Does our Statute authorize the Authority to conduct an election through which employees may select an exclusive representative that is prohibited from engaging in any collective bargaining on their behalf? I conclude that it does not. Therefore, I disagree with my colleagues that the circumstances of this case require us to overrule <span class="Italic">United States Department of Homeland Security, Border and Transportation Security Directorate, Transportation Security Administration, </span>59 FLRA 423 (2003) (then-Member Pope dissenting)<span class="Italic"> (TSA)</span> and to reverse the Regional Director's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our Statute sets forth three propositions that are relevant to this question:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--The sole purpose of an election is to determine whether employees will be represented by an "exclusive representative." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(B). The Authority is not authorized to conduct an election for any other purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--An election is held only to determine whether employees wish to select an exclusive representative "for the purpose of collective bargaining." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7111(b)(1)(A), 7111(f)(2). An election to select a representative that will engage in no collective bargaining is not contemplated by the Statute, and therefore is not authorized.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--The principal attribute of an "exclusive representative" is its ability to "negotiate collective bargaining agreements" for employees in the unit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1). The Statute mandates that "any agency and any exclusive representative...<span class="Italic">shall meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement." </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4) (emphasis added). Collective bargaining is the <span class="Italic">sine qua non</span> of any exclusive representative. A labor organization that is unable to engage in any collective bargaining on behalf of the employees whom it purports to represent cannot be considered an "exclusive representative" within the meaning of our Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In other words, the Authority may conduct an election only for the purpose of permitting employees to select an entity to act as their exclusive representative. An exclusive representative must be able to engage in collective bargaining. Consequently, the Authority may not conduct an election for the purpose of permitting employees to select an entity to represent them in some fashion that entirely excludes collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To this extent, I agree with the central holding of <span class="Italic">TSA</span>--that "[t]here is no evidence of Congressional intent to confer on the Authority the power to determine an appropriate unit and to conduct an election for any purpose other than to determine a representative for collective bargaining." 59 FLRA at 429.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Majority correctly notes that exclusive representatives of employees in certain other agencies, such as the Comptroller of the Currency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Office of Thrift Supervision, have "less than full collective bargaining rights." However, these exclusive representatives are able to engage in at least some collective bargaining on behalf of employees. There is not only a quantitative difference, but also a critical qualitative difference, between some collective bargaining and no collective bargaining. So long as a labor organization is able to engage in <span class="Italic">some</span> collective bargaining on behalf of employees, it is carrying out the core function and responsibility of an "exclusive representative" within the meaning of our Statute. The same cannot be said of a labor organization that is able to engage in zero collective bargaining, which is the case for any labor organization seeking to represent TSOs as long as the Under Secretary's 2003 Memo is in effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Majority also correctly notes, as do the Unions in their respective Applications, that the Statute grants to exclusive representatives some rights and entitlements that are in addition to collective bargaining, such as the right to be present at formal discussions and, in certain circumstances, national consultation rights. However, the existence of such secondary rights enjoyed by an exclusive representative sheds no light on the question raised by the petitions. These rights are ancillary to--not instead of--collective bargaining, and they arise only if there is a collective bargaining relationship in place between the exclusive representative and the agency. A labor organization must first be an exclusive representative before it can enjoy these ancillary rights. As explained above, a labor organization cannot be an exclusive representative if it cannot engage in collective bargaining on behalf of the employees whom it purports to represent.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The Majority relies on <span class="Italic">United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, D.C. v. FLRA, </span>1 F.3d 19 (D.C. Cir. 1993) <span class="Italic">(VA)</span> to support the proposition that "a certified, exclusive representative has several rights under the Statute that are not dependent on the right to negotiate collective bargaining agreements. However, in that case, there was, nevertheless, an ongoing collective bargaining relationship between the union and the agency, and the historical circumstances underlying that relationship make it anomalous as a practical matter, and certainly inapposite to the question presented here. Long before the enactment of our Statute in 1978, the Veterans Administration voluntarily engaged in collective bargaining with, and entered into collective bargaining agreements with, various unions representing medical professionals. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3884 v. FLRA,</span> 930 F.2d 1315, 1318 (8th Cir. 1991). This pre-1978 bargaining occurred, and these agreements were put in place, without the benefit of an election to select an "exclusive representative" within the meaning of our Statute. In stark contrast to the situation that evolved at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the instant petitions present the question of whether, under our Statute, we may hold an election to certify an exclusive representative that currently has no collective bargaining relationship with the agency, has no collective bargaining agreements in place, and is prohibited from engaging in any collective bargaining whatsoever.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unprecedented and insuperable questions would flow from holding an election that results in the selection of a so-called "exclusive representative" that is completely prohibited from engaging in collective bargaining on behalf of employees. For example:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Suppose an election were held and it resulted in one of the petitioning unions becoming the "exclusive representative" of TSOs. In the circumstances as they currently stand, the employees who voted in favor of that union would have done so understanding that they were voting for a union that lacks the status and legal authority to bargain collectively on their behalf. Thus, one could hardly conclude that employees either expected or wanted that union to represent them in collective bargaining.[4] If and when the new TSA Administrator reverses the extant Memo and grants collective bargaining rights to TSOs, what then is the status of this union? Should it be presumed that, because employees selected this union as their "exclusive representative" for very limited purposes having nothing to do with collective bargaining, these employees would also want the union to represent them in collective bargaining? What would be the basis for indulging in this assumption? Why would it be appropriate to assume that an entity selected by employees for certain very limited purposes would be selected by employees for different--and much broader and consequential--purposes?</p>
<p class="noindent-3">[4] There is no basis for the Majority's decision to "construe" the petitions as "expressing an interest by TSOs to have the respective labor organizations represent them for purposes of...collective bargaining." Majority at n.8. Despite our Statute's explicit requirement that a petition must allege that employees in the affected unit "wish to be represented <span class="Italic">for the purpose of collective bargaining"</span> (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added)), these petitions pointedly omit such an allegation. More importantly, as all parties and my colleagues in the Majority agree, so long as the 2003 Memo is in effect, it is a legal impossibility for TSOs to be represented for purposes of collective bargaining. Therefore, the Majority's casual assumption that the petitions signify anything about TSOs' wishes with respect to collective bargaining can only be characterized as a profound misreading of both the petitions and the legal landscape in which the petitions are presented.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--Suppose that an election results in one of the petitioning unions becoming the "exclusive representative" with no authority, and therefore no apparent mandate from employees, to engage in collective bargaining. If and when the new TSA Administrator reverses the extant Memo and grants collective bargaining rights to TSOs, may a different union petition for a new election to determine which labor organization should represent employees for purposes of <span class="Italic">collective bargaining</span>? What would be the Authority's response to such a petition? Would we treat the unit as one that is not currently represented for the purpose of collective bargaining (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b)(1)(a)), or would we treat the unit as one that is currently <span id="page_76"></span>represented for purposes of collective bargaining (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b)(1)(b))? Would the election of an exclusive representative with no collective bargaining rights constitute a "valid election" for purposes of the 12-month election bar (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2))?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To pose these questions is to demonstrate that our Statute does not countenance the election of an exclusive representative that has no collective bargaining rights.&#x2003;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because, as a matter of law, there can be no exclusive representative that is entirely bereft of collective bargaining rights and responsibilities, the Authority is not permitted to conduct an election for such an entity. Accordingly, I disagree with the determination of my colleagues to overrule <span class="Italic">TSA</span> and to reverse the Regional Director's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">On February 4, 2011, TSA Administrator John Pistole issued a determination providing guidance for an election concerning representation and setting the parameters for union representation and collective bargaining.The portions of that directive involving collective bargaining and dispute resolution were:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Essential Components of this Determination</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">I.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Legal authority for Determination</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;I have determined that an election conducted by the FLRA under the principles and conditions set forth in this Determination, for the purposes described in this Determination, does not pose an actual conflict between my statutory authority over unit employees' terms and conditions of employment under &#x00A7; 111(d) of ATSA (49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935 note). I have further determined that ATSA &#x00A7; 111(d) supersedes the Federal Services Labor-Management Relations statute (5 U.S.C. Chapter 71) in all other respects and therefore Chapter 71 shall not apply, or afford any rights, to management, unions, or covered employees that are not expressly provided in this Determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;I have further determined, in the exercise of my discretion under ATSA &#x00A7; l11(d), to establish an integrated labor-management framework built on principles of interest based, collaborative, and binding collective bargaining accompanied by a resolution process including both interest-based and rights-based options that creates solutions that are fair, transparent, and timely. Inasmuch as exclusive union representation and collective bargaining would be new to TSA, adjustments to this system can and should be made in light of our experience with it. My intent is that this framework will continue to evolve and improve through an ongoing collaborative process, consistent with the principles set forth within this Determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;To the extent that any existing policies or TSA Management Directives are inconsistent with this Determination with regard to covered employees, they are amended or superseded by this Determination. Changes to written policies and directives will be codified as relevant provisions of this Determination become applicable.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Employees included in the national unit for an election for the purposes of exclusive representation, also referred to as "covered employees" or "unit employees," are the following full- and part-time non-supervisory personnel carrying out screening functions under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44901, as that term is used in ATSA &#x00A7; l11(d):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Transportation Security Officers;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Lead Transportation Security Officers;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Master Transportation Security Officers (which include Behavior Detection Officers, Security Training Instructors, and Equipment Maintenance Technicians); and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;Expert Transportation Security Officers (which include Behavior Detection Officers, Security Training Instructors, and Equipment Maintenance Technicians).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Employees who otherwise would be covered by this Determination will be excluded if: they are supervisors or part of management; confidential employees; perform personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity; or engage in intelligence work, provided that merely possessing a security clearance and having occasional access to classified information will not be deemed as engaged in intelligence work. For purposes of this Determination, confidential employees will include any employee whose job duties include acting in a confidential capacity with respect to a supervisor or management official who formulates or effectuates management policies in employment or labor relations matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;All covered employees are free to join or support any union without fear of coercion or retaliation. No covered employee is or may be required to join a union or pay dues or similar remittances to a union if they are not members of that union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Scope of representation and coverage</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Representation for purposes other than collective bargaining after the election process is concluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of personal representation in resolution processes provided in this Determination or under TSA Management Directives authorizing personal representation, any unit employee may designate a personal representative without fear of coercion or retaliation. Personal representatives selected by unit employees need not be union representatives and the union is not obligated to provide personal representation for employees who are not union members. However, if a union is certified by the FLRA as the exclusive representative, unit employees may not select any other union to represent them. Personal representatives, if not TSA employees, will be required to sign a Sensitive Security Information (SSI) nondisclosure agreement and to comply with the security requirements at airports and other TSA work locations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Representation for purposes of collective bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;General requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;Collective bargaining under this Determination will be conducted using interest based processes and consistent with the principles of interest-based negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;Any collective bargaining agreement will be binding on TSA, the union, and all covered employees if approved by referendum held among all unit employees under &#x00A7; III(B)(l)(e) below.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">c.&#x2003;The collective bargaining agreement will be national in scope and will cover all unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">d.&#x2003;Collective bargaining shall occur only at the national level; local level bargaining and local level agreements are prohibited. e. Referendum on collective bargaining agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-4">i.&#x2003;A collective bargaining agreement negotiated between TSA and an exclusive collective bargaining representative will be binding on the parties and unit employees after it has been presented to unit employees, voted on in a referendum among all unit employees, and affirmatively supported by a majority of unit employees voting in the referendum. The referendum will be conducted electronically by TSA and will provide unit employees with the opportunity to vote on the collective bargaining agreement and, if the vote is not to support the collective bargaining agreement, to provide information on which provisions were not supported and why. TSA will promptly provide the results of the referendum and any information gathered through it to the exclusive collective bargaining representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-4">ii.&#x2003;If the collective bargaining agreement is not approved, TSA and the exclusive collective bargaining representative will recommence negotiations during the 45 calendar day period beginning on the day that the result of voting in the referendum is announced. If a revised collective bargaining agreement is agreed upon during this period, it will be submitted to all unit employees for an up or down vote. If a majority of unit employees voting support the revised collective bargaining agreement, that agreement will be binding on the parties and unit employees. If a majority of unit employees do not affirmatively support the revised collective bargaining agreement, TSA and the union will collaboratively decide on next steps in the bargaining process. If a collective bargaining agreement approved by a majority of voting unit employees is not in place, TSA will continue to manage unit employees' terms and conditions of employment and the exclusive representative will provide representation for purposes provided under this Determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Issues subject to collective bargaining: The establishment, determination, or adjustment of the following matters shall be subject to collective bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;The performance management process to the extent not otherwise excluded under &#x00A7; III.B.3. below;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;Awards and recognition process;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">c.&#x2003;Attendance management process;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">d.&#x2003;Shift and annual leave bid process (excluding shift start times and types of shifts, numbers, days off, and guarantee of consecutive weeks);</p>
<p class="noindent-3">e.&#x2003;Shift trade policy;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">f.&#x2003;Transfer policy;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">g.&#x2003;Process for work status change from full time to part time and vice versa;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">h.&#x2003;Uniforms and uniform allowances not including relevant security requirements;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">i.&#x2003;Selection process for special assignments;</p>
<p class="noindent-3"><span id="page_77"></span>j.&#x2003;Parking subsidies; and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">k.&#x2003;Facilities and services within the control of TSA management.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3. Issues excluded from collective bargaining: The establishment, determination, or adjustment of the following matters concerning covered employees shall be decided by TSA's Administrator and neither these matters nor the impact and implementation of decisions concerning them shall be subject to collective bargaining or grievable. Moreover, the matters listed below shall have the broadest possible interpretation as to scope, meaning, and interpretation:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;Pay and policies affecting pay, including without limitation pay upon appointment, promotion, reassignment, demotion, or based on any other consideration or personnel action;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;Security policies and procedures, including without limitation standard operating procedures, directives, instructions, training, and means and methods of implementing such procedures;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">c.&#x2003;Deployment of security personnel;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">d.&#x2003;Deployment of equipment and technology, including without limitation source selection, investigation, testing, modification, selection, and maintenance;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">e.&#x2003;Job descriptions, qualifications, fitness for duty standards, performance standards and staffing, numbers, and types of employees (including covered employees);</p>
<p class="noindent-3">f.&#x2003;Annual certification requirements, testing, and consequences of failure to certify or recertify;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">g.&#x2003;Means and methods of covert testing and use of results;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">h.&#x2003;Any action deemed necessary by the Administrator or his or her designee to carry out the agency mission during emergencies;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">i.&#x2003;Disciplinary standards and penalties; and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">j.&#x2003;Internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;The collective bargaining agreement will expire at the end of its stated term and will not rollover or otherwise remain in effect after that date.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;The term of the collective bargaining agreement will not be less than three (3) years or more than five (5) years.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.&#x2003;Bargaining for any new collective bargaining agreement will begin 120 calendar days before the expiration date of the existing collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">7.&#x2003;The parties will agree on ground rules for collective bargaining within 30 calendar days of commencing negotiations on ground rules. If agreement on ground rules is not reached within 30 calendar days, outstanding issues will be put before the rights based process established under &#x00A7; V below for final resolution of these issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">8.&#x2003;Collective bargaining will begin within 30 calendar days after ground rules are agreed upon or decided through the resolution process and will continue for no more than 90 calendar days.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">9.&#x2003;The period of collective bargaining may be extended for one period, if TSA and the union agree to this extension. There will be no additional extension of the period for collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">10.&#x2003;If, at the end of the period for collective bargaining, agreement is not reached on any issues that have been subject to the collective bargaining process and are within the subjects deemed appropriate for collective bargaining under this Determination, those issues will be put before the rights based process established under &#x00A7; V below for final resolution of issues pertaining to or arising from collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">11.&#x2003;The parties to and participants in collective bargaining negotiations will attend joint training on interest-based negotiation prior to commencement of bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">12.&#x2003;Collective bargaining negotiations will be facilitated by one or more facilitators/mediators from the Federal Mediation &#x0026; Conciliation Service (FMCS) or other mutually agreed upon entity. If either party objects to a proposed facilitator/mediator, he or she will not be selected to provide facilitation or mediation services.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">13.&#x2003;Collective bargaining negotiations will take place in proximity to TSA Headquarters.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">14.&#x2003;Should an exclusive representative be elected and certified consistent with this Determination, a future election may be conducted by the FLRA for the purposes described in this Determination provided the election is conducted under the principles and conditions set forth in this Determination and subject to the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;A collective bargaining agreement between TSA and the exclusive representative agreed to as provided for under this Determination has been in effect for more than three (3) years and the FLRA has not conducted an election for the unit employees within the previous 12 calendar months.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;A petition may be filed with the FLRA for a new election if 30 percent of the employees in the unit allege that the exclusive representative is no longer the representative for the majority of employees in the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">c.&#x2003;Any labor organization which has been designated by at least 10 percent of the employees in the unit specified in any petition filed under section (b) above may intervene with respect to the petition filed under section (b) above and shall be placed on the ballot of any election as determined by the FLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Rights, roles, and responsibilities</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Covered Employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;All covered employees are free to join, support, or request representation, consistent with this Determination, by any union without fear of coercion or retaliation. No covered employee is or may be required to join or support a union or pay union dues or fees if not a member of that union.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Prohibition of Retaliation: Consistent with operational requirements and agency policies, all unit employees may use and participate in the representational framework set forth in this Determination. While TSA encourages employees to engage in problem-solving within their chain of supervision, TSA prohibits any form of reprisal or retaliation for raising a concern or complaint through other avenues of redress, practices, and processes provided by TSA or for serving as a representative of a co-worker in these processes. Retaliation or threats of retaliation against covered employees for participating in this framework or against supervisory or management employees for acting in a manner consistent with the principles and requirements of this framework will constitute grounds for corrective or disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Covered employees may designate any individual, whether or not that person is employed by, a member of, or a representative of a union, to be his/her personal representative in the resolution process set forth below in &#x00A7; V or under TSA Management Directives providing for personal representation if that person is willing and available to serve in that capacity and is not disallowed for any of the reasons set forth in TSA IVID 1100.63.3, &#x00A7; C, and its successors. However, if a union is selected as the exclusive representative of the unit employees, no other union may provide personal representation to covered employees. The designation of a personal representative must be in writing and signed by the covered employee requesting representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;Covered employees who request representation will have a right to representation by a personal representative during an examination or investigation by the Agency which the employee reasonably believes may result in discipline provided that such representatives are not disallowed for any reason set forth in TSA MD 1100.63.3, &#x00A7; C; if a union is selected as the exclusive representative of the unit employees, no other union may provide this representation; and provided that securing such representation does not unreasonably delay the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;All covered employees will have the right to vote in a referendum on whether or not to support any collective bargaining agreement negotiated by TSA with a duly elected exclusive representative before such agreement becomes binding and effective.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.&#x2003;Official time:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;The parties will agree on a reasonable number of unit employees who may serve on the bargaining committee of the union for the national collective bargaining agreement, if a union is certified by the FLRA as the exclusive representative of unit employees, and these employees will be afforded reasonable amounts of official time to perform this function consistent with mission requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;An employee serving as a representative of a co-worker in the resolution process at &#x00A7; V of this Determination or under TSA Management Directives and employees serving as union representatives in formal meetings or fulfilling other union responsibilities as set forth in this Determination will be entitled to reasonable amounts of official time consistent with operational needs and the scale and duration of the matter at issue but in no instance will official time for a given matter or meeting exceed eight (8) hours without written justification submitted to management and written approval <span id="page_78"></span>from the Federal Security Director (FSD) to whom the covered employee ultimately reports or the FSD's designee.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">7.&#x2003;Employees are responsible for maintaining respectful and constructive communication on work issues and concerns with co-workers as well as management, and for acting in a manner characterized by cooperative problem solving approaches to raising and seeking resolution of issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Unions:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Unions participating in the election shall have the right to engage in campaign activities consistent with the conditions in this Determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;If a union is certified by the FLRA as the exclusive representative for purposes consistent with the provisions of this Determination, such union shall have the right to:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;At the national level, engage in good faith, interest-based collective bargaining with respect to such terms and conditions as are national in scope and within the ambit of &#x00A7; 111(B)(2);</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;Enter into a collective bargaining agreement reached as a result of good faith collective bargaining if approved by covered employees in a referendum as provided in &#x00A7; 111(B)(l)(e);</p>
<p class="noindent-3">c.&#x2003;Request and receive from TSA information maintained by TSA in the normal course of business, reasonably available, and relevant and necessary to understanding subjects within the scope of bargaining as defined in &#x00A7; III(B)(2) consistent with TSA's requirements for Sensitive Security Information (SSI);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;If a union is certified by the FLRA as the exclusive representative for purposes consistent with the provisions of this Determination, such union shall have the right to represent covered employees in the Resolution Process set forth below in &#x00A7; V or in any proceeding recognized in TSA Management Directives as appropriate for personal representation (e.g., the Disciplinary Review Board or EEO proceedings) provided as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;A covered employee has requested, in writing, that that union represent him or her.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;A union certified as an exclusive representative by the FLRA must represent a covered employee who is a dues paying member of the union or covered employees who are dues paying members of the union if that employee or group of employees request representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">c.&#x2003;A union may represent a covered employee who is not a dues paying member of the union or covered employees who are not dues paying members of the union but is not obligated to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">d.&#x2003;An individual acting as a representative under these provisions must, unless he or she is a TSA employee, sign a SSI non-disclosure agreement and will be considered a covered party under 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1520.7.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;A representative of any union certified as the exclusive representative will have the right to be present at formal discussions provided that, except during collective bargaining on appropriate subjects occurring at the national level, the union's role in such meetings is limited to providing information and stating the interest(s) of the union and/or covered employees. A formal discussion is any meeting that is prearranged between one or more representatives of TSA management and one or more unit employees on a specific topic or topics concerning personnel policies, practices, or other conditions of employment. Impromptu discussions between a supervisor and a subordinate, routine staff meetings, or individual performance counseling sessions are not considered formal discussions. Further, this paragraph does not amend or broaden the rights to personal representation afforded under TSA Management Directives addressing personal representation rights and under &#x00A7; IV.A.3. and 4 above or provide a right to union representatives to be present when a covered employee has not selected a union or union representative as his/her personal representative under TSA management directives and above under &#x00A7; IV.A.3 and 4.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;An exclusive representative will have the right to be notified of any changes to Government-wide rules or regulations applicable to TSOs and will have the opportunity to present the union's views and recommendations regarding these changes. TSA will consider any recommendations and provide a reply, in writing, stating the reason or reasons why the recommendations were or were not adopted.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.&#x2003;An exclusive representative must maintain respectful and constructive communication on work issues and concerns with TSA employees and management and act in a manner characterized by cooperative problem-solving approaches to raising, addressing, and seeking resolution of issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;TSA management must:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Maintain respectful and constructive communication on work issues and concerns with co-workers, subordinates, upper management and union representatives. 2. Act in a manner characterized by cooperative problem solving approaches to raising, addressing, and seeking resolution of issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;TSA may:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Maintain and manage terms and conditions of employment for covered employees in place on the date of this Determination until such time as the terms and conditions may be changed through a binding collective bargaining agreement affirmed, as provided for in this Determination, in a referendum held among covered employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Make changes to the terms and conditions of employment for covered employees unless and until a term or condition is superseded by a binding collective bargaining agreement provision that addresses that particular term or condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Where a term or condition of employment for covered employees is excluded from collective bargaining (see &#x00A7; III(B)(3)), change that term or condition irrespective of any collateral impact that change does or might have on a matter within the scope of collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4&#x2003;Engage with any covered employee or covered employees generally on any matter or deal with any employee group on issues affecting covered employees except that TSA will not engage in collective bargaining resulting in a binding collective bargaining agreement with any entity other than a union which has been certified as the exclusive representative of the covered employees by the FLRA provided that a union is so certified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Resolution Processes</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;I have concluded that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;TSA must create an environment in which all employee issues and concerns whether they go to the core of the security mission or affect the employees who carry it out, can be raised with confidence that they will be heard and, if possible, addressed, without fear of retaliation;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;TSA's employees deserve a resolution system that is fair, transparent, and efficient; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;TSA's mission requires that disputes, including those related to union activity and collective bargaining, be resolved quickly and collaboratively and without protracted and potentially acrimonious litigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Therefore, I have determined that TSA will, without delay, develop a unitary dispute resolution system, including both interest-based and neutral, third party rights-based options. The core principles, objectives, and requirements of this system are set forth below. The details of this system will be developed prior to the conclusion of an election process. Should a union be certified as the exclusive representative, at that time the details of the system will be shared with the exclusive representative and its input, comments, and concerns will be considered. Suggestions for modifications to the system from the exclusive representative will be adopted to the extent possible and, if not adopted, TSA will explain in writing the basis for its decision. This system will not be subject to the collective bargaining process except that details of the initial local phases of the resolution process may be subject to bargaining at the discretion of TSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Core Principles, Objectives, and Requirements for Resolution Processes under this Determination:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;It is in the interests of both covered employees and management that issues and concerns be raised and resolved as close to the origin of the issue or concern as possible by the affected individuals or groups themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The unitary resolution process established will be fair and, when not involving a confidential resolution process, transparent, with provisions designed to ensure that issues, concerns, and disputes are addressed equitably and in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;The unitary resolution process will cover the resolution of issues raised by, between, or among employees covered by this Determination, the exclusive representative, if any, and TSA except that issues concerning the representation election process that arise before the election or arise in the form of objections or challenges after the election will be resolved by the FLRA under its processes as consistent with this Determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;The resolution processes established under this Determination <span id="page_79"></span>will provide that the first step in addressing most issues will be an interest-based conversation between or among the individuals or groups closest to the issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;Recognizing that some issues must be addressed in particular forums, such as Workers' Compensation claims or Whistleblower or discrimination complaints, the resolution system will include safeguards to ensure that employees and union representatives are fully informed about dispute resolution processes including mandatory and/or rights-based processes with filing deadlines.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.&#x2003;Recognizing that some issues are not amenable to localized solutions, other avenues will be bolstered or created to ensure that such issues can be raised and, when possible, resolved confidently and effectively. Recognizing that the resolution of some issues will, despite the parties' best efforts, require neutral assistance, the resolution system will, in appropriate circumstances, provide neutral assistance to enable the parties to reach interest-based solutions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">7.&#x2003;Such interest-based resolution assistance may include, as appropriate, coaching, facilitated interest-based discussions, mediation, and other neutral third-party approaches that assist parties to raise and resolve issues, concerns, and disputes themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">8.&#x2003;Recognizing that some disagreements will require a rights-based decision made by a neutral decision-maker, credible rights-based systems will be established.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">9.&#x2003;The system for resolving disputes on the following issues will include a rights-based mechanism for final decisions by panels selected from a roster of neutrals, with backgrounds in both security and collective bargaining, who are mutually agreed upon by both TSA and the certified exclusive representative:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;After certification of an exclusive representative, issues that arise during the collective bargaining process, including but not limited to: i. ii. iii. Failure to agree on ground rules; Allegations of failure to bargain in good faith; and Failure to agree on terms of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;After certification of an exclusive representative, allegations that:</p>
<p class="noindent-4">i.&#x2003;Management or the exclusive representative has interfered with, restrained, or coerced any employee for exercising their rights regarding union activity as set forth in this Determination or rights established under a binding collecting bargaining agreement;</p>
<p class="noindent-4">ii.&#x2003;Management or the union failed to act in a manner consistent with this Determination;</p>
<p class="noindent-4">iii.&#x2003;The exclusive representative coerced, disciplined, fined, or attempted to coerce a unit employee as punishment, reprisal, or for the purpose of hindering or impeding the member's work performance, productivity as an employee, or the discharge of the member's duties as an employee; and iv. Management or the exclusive representative failed or refused to comply with a binding collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">10.&#x2003;All matters that are not resolved through informal interest-based conversation or processes will be entered into a database by location and subject (without reference to the names of those involved). This database will record the timeliness of steps in the process and be reviewed on a regularly scheduled basis by those responsible for the resolution process system and those responsible for field operations to ensure accountability and in order to identify systemic issues and potential locations of concern.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">11.&#x2003;After 18 months in operation, the entire resolution system will be evaluated by an expert independent third party under standards and requirements agreed upon by TSA and the exclusive representative, if one is certified, and this third party will produce a report for TSA that will be shared with that exclusive representative and the workforce.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">This case is before the Authority on an application for review filed by the Petitioner under &#x00A7; 2422.31(c) of the Authority's Regulations. The Petitioner seeks review of the Regional Director's (RD's) decision to dismiss petitions seeking elections to determine whether employees, including passenger screeners, baggage screeners, and lead screeners, of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) wish to be represented by the Petitioner for the purpose of collective bargaining. For the reasons that follow, we grant the Petitioner's application for review and affirm the RD's decision to dismiss the petitions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Background and RD's Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed petitions seeking elections to determine whether employees, including passenger screeners, baggage screeners and lead screeners for the TSA, wished to be represented by the Petitioner for the purpose of collective bargaining. In resolving this question, the RD first noted that "there are no material facts in dispute on the issue of jurisdiction and that the record contains sufficient evidence on which to base a decision on the issue of whether the Authority has jurisdiction to conduct elections as requested by the Petitioner<span class="Italic">." </span>(citing <span class="Italic">Federal Mediation and Conciliation Serv.</span>, 52 FLRA 1509, 1516 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In November of 2001, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) which created the TSA, a department within the United States Department of Transportation<span class="Italic">. See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114. Within the language of the ATSA, two provisions are of particular importance to this matter. First, in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(n) (as codified), Congress stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The personnel management system established by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under section 40122 shall apply to employees of the Transportation Security Administration, or, subject to the requirements of such section, the Under Secretary may make such modifications to the personnel management system with respect to such employees as the Under Secretary considers appropriate, such as adopting aspects of other personnel systems of the Department of Transportation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935 Note, Congress stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security may employ, appoint, discipline, terminate, and fix the compensation, terms, and conditions of employment of Federal service for such a number of individuals as the Under Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out the screening functions of the Under Secretary under section 44901 of title 49, United States Code. The Under Secretary shall establish levels of compensation and other benefits for individuals so employed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above language, on January 8, 2003, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security issued a memorandum regarding the collective bargaining rights of TSA security screeners. It stated as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">By virtue of the authority vested in the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security in Section 111(d) of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, Pub. Law No. 107-71, 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935 Note 2001, I hereby determine that individuals carrying out the security screening function under section 44901 of Title 49, United States Code, in light of their critical national security responsibilities, shall not, as a term or condition of their employment, be entitled to engage in collective bargaining or be represented for the purpose of engaging in such bargaining by any representative or organization.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In November of 2002, prior to the issuance of this memorandum, Congress enacted the Homeland Security Act (HSA), Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002), which created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). As the missions of both the TSA and DHS were similar in nature, (<span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism, minimize the damage from attacks and assist in the recovery from terrorist attacks) the TSA was transferred to the DHS. HSA, &#x00A7; 403(2), 6 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 203. However, as noted by the RD, "Congress provided that the Transportation Security Administration would remain a 'distinct entity' within the DHS for two years following the enactment of the legislation" and that the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security would now be known as the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (referred to as the "Under Secretary" throughout this decision)....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The RD set forth the following issues for resolution:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Did Congress intend to confer on the Under Secretary of the Agency sole and exclusive discretion to determine conditions of employment of security screening personnel and thus to exempt the Agency from the obligation to bargain collectively with a labor organization under chapter 71 of title 5 of the U.S. Code?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Did the transfer of the Agency to the Department of Homeland Security alter the original intent of Congress in regard to the discretion that the head of the Agency exercises in the employment of security screening personnel?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Even if the Agency is exempt from the obligation to bargain collectively under chapter 71 of title 5, may the Federal Labor Relations Authority conduct an election for the purpose of determining whether the Petitioner may exercise on behalf of security screening personnel any of the rights set forth in chapter 71 of title 5?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_80"></span>IV.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons set forth below, we grant review of the Petitioner's application because there is an absence of Authority precedent addressing an issue presented in this case. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.31(c)(3)(i). On review, we conclude that the RD correctly found that the petitions could not be processed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111 because of the Under Secretary's decision to exercise his unfettered discretion to preclude TSA screeners from being represented by an organization for the purposes of engaging in collective bargaining with the Agency. As such, we conclude that the RD did not fail to apply established law under &#x00A7; 2422.31(c)(3)(i) of the Authority's Regulations and, therefore, deny the application for review with regard to these issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The RD's Decision Raises an Issue for Which There Is an Absence of Precedent</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.31(c) the Authority may grant an application for review only when the application demonstrates that review is warranted. The application for review in this case raises an issue concerning whether passenger screeners, baggage screeners, and lead screeners of the TSA have a right to engage in collective bargaining. The legislation at issue, the ATSA, has been recently enacted and the Authority has yet to address its impact on rights granted to employees under chapter 71 of title 5. Specifically, whether the Under Secretary by his January 8, 2003 memorandum can preclude TSA screener personnel from being represented by a labor organization, is a question of first impression. Accordingly, upon review of the issues involved with this case we grant review of the RD's decision under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.31(c)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The RD Did Not Fail to Apply Established Law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.31(f), the Authority may "rule on the issue(s) in an application for review in its order granting the review." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nat'l Mediation Board</span>, 56 FLRA 1 (2000) (granting the application for review and resolving the issues submitted). Here, the Petitioner notes that based on its application, the Authority has "jurisdiction to process and rule upon the instant representation petitions." The RD also noted that "the Petitioner stated that the jurisdictional issues involve statutory interpretation and questions of law and that in this regard there were no facts in dispute." Accordingly, we find that in resolving the issue of whether the RD properly applied established law in reaching his decision, there is no need for further briefing by the parties under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.31(g).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The ATSA Grants the Under Secretary Unfettered Discretion to Set the Terms and Conditions of Employment for TSA Screener Personnel</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935 Note, Congress carved out an exception to the general principle that employees of the TSA fall under the personnel management system as set forth, and argued by the Petitioner, in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 144(n). Specifically, under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; &#x00A7; 44935 Note, the Under Secretary may in his unfettered discretion, among other things, set the terms and conditions of employment for employees carrying out "screening functions" of the TSA "notwithstanding any other provision of law."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching the above conclusion, we note that in <span class="Italic">Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group</span>, 508 U.S. 10, 18 (1993), the Supreme Court stated "[a]s we have noted previously in construing statutes, the use of such a 'notwithstanding' clause clearly signals the drafter's intention that the provisions of the 'notwithstanding' section override conflicting provisions of any other section." The Supreme Court further noted that the "Courts of Appeals generally have 'interpreted similar "notwithstanding" language...to supersede all other laws stating that '[a] clearer statement is difficult to imagine." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Liberty Maritime Corp. v. United States</span>, 928 F.2d 413, 416 (D.C. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority precedent is consistent with the Supreme Court's interpretation. As the RD noted, in <span class="Italic">NIMA,</span> 57 FLRA at 843 n.10, we reiterated that "[w]here a statutory provision pertaining to a given subject matter provides for the matter to be determined 'notwithstanding' or 'without regard to' any other law, the provision affords agency officials 'sole and exclusive discretion' to determine that subject matter<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3295</span>, 47 FLRA 884 (1993),<span class="Italic"> aff'd sub nom. AFGE, Local 3295 v. FLRA</span>, 46 F.3d 73 (D.C. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Illinois National Guard v. FLRA</span>, 854 F.2d 1396 (D.C. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Assoc. v. FLRA</span>, 851 F.2d 1486, 1489 (D.C. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in finding the above we also reject two additional arguments raised by the Petitioner. First, we do not agree with the Petitioner that the failure of Congress to include language similar to that of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 461 mandates a finding that Congress did not confer unfettered discretion upon the Under Secretary in setting terms and conditions of employment for the screeners. There is no support for the argument that "sole and exclusive discretion" requires the use of the language set out at 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 461. Second, given the above, we conclude that the RD correctly found that the Under Secretary has sole and exclusive discretion over the terms and conditions of employment of security screeners. In exercising this discretion, the Under Secretary determined that the Agency will not bargain over the terms and conditions of employment of screener personnel. As such, since the Under Secretary has the unfettered discretion to set terms and conditions of employment, and has chosen to do so, the Petitioner's attempt to override that discretion by seeking to be formally recognized as the exclusive representative of these employees would unlawfully usurp the Under Secretary's authority as it would be contrary to the actions taken by the Under Secretary pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935 Note.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we also agree with the RD that, although not specifically raised by the Petitioner here, &#x00A7; 7111 of the Statute allows for the exclusive recognition of a labor organization and that an exclusively recognized labor organization by definition is an entity that has the right to deal with an agency over "grievances<span class="Italic"> and conditions of employment</span>."<span class="Italic"> See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(4) (emphasis added). As the Under Secretary has exercised his discretion to preclude screener personnel from seeking an exclusive representative under the terms of &#x00A7; 7111, the Petitioner is now precluded from, and has not established how it can avail itself of that same statutory process for seeking exclusive representative status and the benefits that such status would afford it<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 2953</span>, 730 F.2d at 1538.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this connection, we disagree with the Petitioner to the extent it claims that it has the ability to utilize the procedures established in &#x00A7; 7111 to become an exclusive representative for purposes other than the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. The process established in &#x00A7; 7111 permits employees to obtain an exclusive representative "for the purpose of collective bargaining." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b)(1)(A). However, it is clear that a union obtaining exclusive representative status under &#x00A7; 7111 obtains the full range of exclusive representative rights established by chapter 71 of title 5, not just the ability to engage in the collective bargaining process leading up to a collective bargaining agreement. For example, only exclusive representatives are accorded rights under &#x00A7; 7114(b) to be present at certain interactions between bargaining unit employees and agency representatives. Similarly, &#x00A7; 7117 provides only exclusive representatives with the ability to file negotiability appeals. Under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4), only exclusive representatives have certain rights to information provided for by chapter 71 of title 5. And, of course, only exclusive representatives have the right to engage in collective bargaining for the purposes of executing a collective bargaining agreement, under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) and 7103(a)(12). Thus, the process established by &#x00A7; 7111 to accord unions exclusive representative status is designed to provide an exclusive representative with all the rights that accrue to an exclusive representative, not just a more limited right to engage only in the collective bargaining process leading up to a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is consistent with Authority precedent that has found that the term "collective bargaining" has a broader meaning that just encompassing negotiations. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Commander Naval Air Pacific, San Diego, Ca., and Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Oak Harbor, Wa.</span>, 41 FLRA 662, 668 (1991) the Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he term "collective bargaining" encompasses "the <span class="Italic">process</span> wherein the agency and the exclusive representative are engaged in the performance of their mutual obligation to bargain concerning the conditions of employment affecting unit employees." 38 FLRA at 519 (emphasis in original). We also concluded that collective bargaining encompasses bargaining, administration of a collective bargaining agreement, third-party dispute resolution procedures, the processing of grievances and cases before the Authority, and other labor-management activities that affect unit employees' conditions of employment or a union's status as exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that the procedures in &#x00A7; 7111 are designed to grant unions exclusive representative status for the full range of rights and responsibilities accorded an exclusive representative by chapter 71 of title 5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we also agree with the RD that "[t]here is no evidence of Congressional intent to confer on the Authority the power to determine an appropriate unit and to conduct an election for any purpose other than to determine a representative for collective bargaining" such as is being sought here by the Petitioner. Nor is there any evidence in the legislative history of the ATSA that Congress expressed any intent to create some sort of hybrid exclusive representative in this case. Therefore, since the Under Secretary determined that screener personnel do not have the right to "engage in collective bargaining or be represented for the purpose of engaging in collective bargaining," we agree with the RD that he is "without authority under section 7111(b)(1)(A) of the Statute to conduct an election unless the purpose of the representation petition is to determine whether the employees wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if we were to agree that a union could utilize the procedures encompassed by &#x00A7; 7111 to become recognized as a kind of hybrid exclusive representative having less than the full rights accorded by <span id="page_81"></span>chapter 71 of title 5, we find that the Under Secretary's exercise of his sole and exclusive discretion precludes such an outcome in this case. As already noted, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the term "collective bargaining" addresses the full array of representational activities by an exclusive representative. As such, we find no support for the argument that the Under Secretary meant to permit the creation or recognition of an exclusive representative having less than the full rights accorded to exclusive representatives under chapter 71 of title 5. Rather, based on the above, the Under Secretary's action precludes the recognition of an exclusive representative for any and all representational activity permitted by chapter 71 of title 5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, Congress has provided unions with something less than the full rights accorded to exclusive representatives under &#x00A7; 7111, but has chosen to provide such rights in only two instances: national consultation rights under &#x00A7; 7113(a), provided there is not an exclusive representative on an agency-wide basis; and dues withholding under &#x00A7; 7115(c)(1), which permits a union, where there is no exclusive representative already in place, to negotiate with an agency over dues withholding procedures. Absent any expression of Congressional intent to create something less than full and exclusive recognition for screener personnel under &#x00A7; 7111, we have no statutory authority to do so at the request of a Petitioner willing to accept something less than the full range of collective bargaining provided under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The Legislative History Indicates That TSA Screeners Have Collective Bargaining Rights Only at the Discretion of the Under Secretary</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner also contends that the legislative history of the ATSA indicates that Congress intended for TSA security screeners to enjoy collective bargaining rights. However, upon review we find that the Petitioner's argument is unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, we have looked at the legislative history provided by the Petitioner. We note that when read in context, the cited language expresses the perception that private security screeners had not done an adequate job in providing security rather than implying that under the ATSA screeners would be unequivocally allowed to elect an exclusive representative. Moreover, the language cited by the Petitioner also indicates that at least one legislator acknowledged that under the ATSA the Under Secretary would retain discretion over the right to engage in collective bargaining. In this respect, the Petitioner cites to the statement of Representative Schakowsky who, in talking about the screener personnel, stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We do not want those critical workers to be given second-class status when it comes to employee benefits and rights. We must attract the most qualified people possible to fulfill the role of protecting the flying public. There should be no question that they deserve the same treatment as their fellow federal employees. (Cong. Rec. H8313 [daily ed. Nov. 16, 2001] (statement of Rep. Schakowsky[)]. [)]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, what the Petitioner fails to mention is that immediately prior to this statement, Representative Schakowsky stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">However, I continue to be concerned that we have left the Secretary of Transportation with a great deal of discretion as to whether those new public employees will enjoy the same employment benefits and protections as other federal workers. While we agree that these federal law enforcement employees will not have the right to strike, <span class="Italic">it is my understanding that the Secretary is given the authority to determine whether they can join a union</span>; participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan and retirement options; and be covered by non-discrimination, health and safety, and whistleblower laws. (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, unlike other areas in which the House Conference Committee expressed a view as to how the Under Secretary should exercise his discretion (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 107-296, at 64 (2001)), no expression was made in the report about labor relations. Rather, the House Conference Committee stated "the Secretary should also ensure that screeners have access to Federal health, life insurance, and retirement benefits, as well as workers' compensation benefits. The Committee believes that screening personnel must also be given whistleblower protections so that screeners may report security conditions without fear of reprisal." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, after reviewing the RD's decision and the legislative history provided by the Petitioner, we conclude that the legislative history of the ATSA does not undermine the plain language of 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935, Note, which leaves unfettered discretion to the Under Secretary to determine the terms and conditions of employment for screener personnel in the TSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;The Petitioner's Constitutional Issues Are Not Properly Before the Authority</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its final argument, the Petitioner claims that the ATSA as interpreted by the RD would deny employees both their First Amendment right to assembly, free speech and association and their Fifth Amendment right to equal protection. For the following reason, we will not consider the Petitioner's argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Constitutional issues raised by the Petitioner are claimed to be based solely on the RD's alleged unconstitutional interpretation of the ATSA. However, we note that the RD's interpretation is consistent with the same interpretation offered by the TSA in its Agency Response to Election Petition. In its subsequent briefs, the Petitioner failed to raise these Constitutional claims to the RD even though the Agency's submissions should have placed it on notice that the RD certainly could determine that the ATSA left the Under Secretary with unfettered discretion to determine the terms and conditions of employment of screener personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As "an application may not raise any issue or rely on any facts not timely presented to the...Regional Director" the Authority is precluded from reviewing these Constitutional issues. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.31(b)<span class="Italic">. See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.5 which states that the Authority will not consider any issue which was not presented in the proceedings before the Regional Director; <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soc. Sec. Admin. Headquarters, Balt., Md.</span>, 57 FLRA 459 (2001) (Authority would not consider union's constitutional due process argument under &#x00A7; 2429.5 where there was no evidence that it had been raised before the arbitrator); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def. Educ. Activity, Arlington, Va.</span>, 56 FLRA 985 (2000) (union's claim that an award was contrary to law, including a claim that the award violated the Appropriations Clause of the United States Constitution, Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7, was barred by &#x00A7; 2429.5 because they should have been raised before the arbitrator). Accordingly, the Authority will not address the Petitioner's Constitutional claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">The 2003 decision in <span class="Italic">DHS TSA </span>was taken into district court through an indirect method, and on appeal to the D.C. Circuit, the result reached by FLRA was left undisturbed as the court decided in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Loy</span>, 367 F.3d 932 (2004), that neither it nor the district court had jurisdiction to review the Authority's unit determination. [<span class="Italic">Loy</span> is reviewed in Chapter 10, "<a href="0100-2023-18-028.html#sec10-32">Representation and Unit Determination</a>."]</p>
