<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-141"><span class="space">b.</span> Abuse of Supervisor; Disrespectful or Coarse Language</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Abusive and obscene language toward a supervisor, a form of insubordination, seriously undermines the capability of management to maintain employee efficiency and discipline; no agency should be expected to exercise forbearance for such conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McKowen v. MSPB</span>, 703 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1983) ("We do not think the Board's determination, that having given McKowen several previous opportunities to improve his behavior, the Agency could properly remove him when he continued to explode at his superiors, was an abuse of discretion."); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DOJ</span>, 68 MSPR 303, 310-11 (1995) (removal of a GS-9 Border Patrol Agent, held to a high standard of conduct, for disrespectful language: a significant past disciplinary record demonstrated little potential for rehabilitation); <span class="Italic">Parker v. VA</span>, 30 MSPR 109, 111 (1986) (sustaining removal, given progressive discipline, a relatively short period of employment, and aggravating circumstances accompanying the abusive behavior consisting of obscene language to a supervisor (and AWOL)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Profanity in conversations with supervisors may support discipline. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. DOJ</span>, 30 MSPR 652, 657 (1986); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Pinegar v. FEC</span>, 105 MSPR 677, 689 &#x00B6; 26, 2007 MSPB 140 (2007) ("An attorney can fulfill his duty of candor to his client and even express his vigorous professional disagreement with his supervisors without resorting to the inappropriate remarks that the appellant made in this case."). Abusive language disrupting operations of the workplace warrants discharge if there has been progressive discipline. <span class="Italic">James v. FERC</span>, 755 F.2d 154 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Telling a supervisor to "shut up" and making other discourteous remarks in the course of a meeting is considered actionable insubordination. <span class="Italic">Cascio v. GSA</span>, 21 MSPR 7, 9 (1984) (charge of disorderly conduct not sustained since there was no evidence that appellant was abusive or that his conduct disrupted workplace). Foul language to a supervisor, coupled with a threat, warranted removal (with other charges), even though that language, divorced of threats, seemed commonplace in the workplace. <span class="Italic">Sims v. DOD</span>, 58 MSPR 131, 137 (1993) (use of the expression "mother fucker").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A single incident of disrespectful language in an email would not ordinarily support removal, <span class="Italic">Kone v. Dept. of Navy,</span> PH-0752-13-0217-I-3 (NP 2/27/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the third charge, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's November 27, 2012 email to his supervisor was indeed disrespectful. In the email, which the appellant testified that he sent because it was the only way he knew to get the attention of the higher-ups that he copied on it, he essentially accused his supervisor of racism in pursuing his removal and asserted that, in doing so, the supervisor was "starting to make a fool" of himself and others, including the several members of the agency's "Upper Management" whom the appellant copied on the message. In his petition for review, the appellant explains that he sent the email at issue in response to what he perceived as a "badgering" email from his supervisor and that, at the time, he felt discriminated against on the basis of race and felt justified in challenging him on that basis. The appellant also challenges the penalty, arguing that the agency identified no authority supporting removal in a situation like this, where the only sustained charge is disrespectful conduct towards a supervisor and the record establishes a tense relationship between the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although, as the administrative judge acknowledged, the appellant and his supervisor clearly had a contentious relationship, the appellant's frustration does not excuse his conduct. Nevertheless, as noted above, Board law is consistent in finding that removal is not appropriate for a single, first instance of such misconduct. <span class="Italic">E.g., O'Neill v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 220 F.3d 1354, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (noting the Board's consistent view that "insolent disrespect toward supervisors so seriously undermines the capacity of management to maintain employee efficiency and discipline that no agency should be expected to exercise forbearance for such conduct more than once") (quoting <span class="Italic">Redfearn v. Department of Labor</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 307, 316 (1993); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Suggs v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 15 (2010) (a 30-day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty for single sustained specification of disrespectful conduct), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 415 F. App'x 240 (Fed. Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if a charge of disrespectful conduct toward a supervisor (and toward the representative of an agency vendor) is the only charge sustained among a group of charges, it may support dismissal if there is a record of similar misconduct, <span class="Italic">Lewis v. VA</span>, 80 MSPR 472, 474-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge properly found that the appellant's misconduct of interrupting her supervisor's meeting with a non-agency sales representative at least twice, yelling at her supervisor in the presence of co-workers, and advancing towards her menacingly constituted disrespectful conduct. After a thorough review of the record, we discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's findings that the agency sustained the charge of disrespectful conduct by preponderant evidence and that the appellant failed to prove her affirmative defenses. Because we find that the removal is reasonable based on the sustained charge of disrespectful conduct, we do not need to determine whether the second charge, deliberate failure or unreasonable delay in carrying out instructions, was sustained. Thus, for the reasons discussed below, further adjudication of this case is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where all of the charges against the appellant are sustained, we will review an agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981). In those in which all of the charges have not been sustained, the Board will independently and responsibly balance the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine a reasonable penalty. <span class="Italic">White v. U.S. <span id="Page_2614"></span>Postal Service,</span> 71 MSPR 521, 527 (1996). Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> here that only charge one were sustained, even if we therefore apply this independent balancing, we would conclude that removal remains a reasonable penalty. The appellant's disrespectful conduct towards her supervisor in the presence of co-workers and a business invitee was serious in nature. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roberson v. Veterans Administration,</span> 27 MSPR 489, 494 (1985) (abusive language and disrespectful behavior are not acceptable conduct and are not conducive to a stable work atmosphere).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the Board has found that insolent disrespect towards supervisors so seriously undermines the capacity of management to maintain employee efficiency and discipline that no agency should be expected to exercise forbearance for such conduct more than once. <span class="Italic">See Jefferson v. Veterans Administration,</span> 6 MSPR 348, 352 (1981) (penalty of removal was appropriate and reasonable based on two specifications of disrespectful conduct toward supervisors). The record reflects that the appellant was previously disciplined for similar misconduct (i.e., making threatening remarks to her supervisor and toward the medical center) and, that, as part of a grievance arbitration, she received an 18-month suspension.[1] Moreover, when the arbitrator mitigated the penalty for the prior misconduct, he specified that "[t]he lesson she should learn if she is to be rehabilitated by this major suspension is that if she is to maintain a successful working relationship at the VA Medical Center or any other place of business then she much [sic] make changes in her argumentative and sometimes belligerent behaviors and in the way she handles stress on the job." Unfortunately, the appellant was not rehabilitated because the sustained misconduct occurred only two years after her suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Although the arbitrator concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the threat charge, he found that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the "belligerent behaviors exhibited [by the appellant]...constituted just and sufficient cause for progressive discipline under offense "'Disrespectful conduct, using insulting, abusive, or obscene language to or about other personnel.'"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the record does not suggest that the appellant's performance was unsatisfactory, it shows that she had worked for the agency for six years. The deciding official testified that he considered various alternative sanctions in this case, but because of the appellant's lack of remorse, the seriousness of the misconduct, her length of service, and her prior disciplinary record, he decided that removal was appropriate. Furthermore, the agency's table of penalties recommends removal as the maximum penalty for a second offense of disrespectful conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for mitigating factors, the administrative judge noted that the appellant's altercation with her supervisor was regarding why she had been assigned to replenish the 35-pound oxygen tanks, which was a source of distress to the entire staff of respiratory therapists because some therapists, including the appellant, had injured themselves in the past while moving the tanks. The administrative judge also noted that both Ms. Britt and the appellant testified that the medical center was short staffed on the day of the incident, which contributed to the stressful situation. Notwithstanding these mitigating factors, given the seriousness of the sustained charge of disrespectful conduct, the severity of the appellant's prior disciplinary record, and her lack of rehabilitation potential, we find that removal is within the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, at 305.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In evaluating whether a penalty is reasonable, the Board places primary importance upon the nature and seriousness of the offense and its relation to the appellant's duties, position, and responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 469, &#x00B6; 15 (2008), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 315 Fed. Appx. 305 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The appellant was aware that he was required to follow Ms. Bickerstaff's instructions even though he disagreed with them, and the appellant admitted that he defied Ms. Bickerstaff's instructions to remain in her office and to give her the PS Forms 3971. Deliberate defiance of a supervisor's direct orders constitutes serious misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Redfearn v. Department of Labor</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 307, 316 (1993) ("An employee's deliberate refusal to follow supervisory instructions constitutes serious misconduct that cannot be condoned."); <span class="Italic">see also Davis v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 397, 400 (1983) (the offence of failure to obey an order "goes to the heart of the supervisor-employee relationship"). The appellant was also aware of the impropriety of his belligerent behavior toward Ms. Bickerstaff, and the agency proved that the appellant spoke to Ms. Bickerstaff in a loud, disrespectful, and menacing manner. This element of the appellant's actions also constitutes serious misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 472, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 10 (1998) (the appellant's actions of yelling at her supervisor and advancing toward her in a menacing manner constituted serious misconduct); <span class="Italic">Wilson v.

The appellant's misconduct is particularly problematic in light of his duty to work largely unmonitored in a building of nearly 1 million square feet, and his supervisors' loss of trust in his ability to do so without incident. [<span class="Italic">S</span>]<span class="Italic">ee Talavera v. Agency for International Development</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 445, &#x00B6; 12 (2007) (loss of trust is a significant aggravating factor in a penalty determination). Finally, the appellant's failure to express remorse or to acknowledge the impropriety of his conduct suggests that a lesser penalty may be ineffective to deter such behavior in the future. <span class="Italic">See Neuman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 26 (2008) (the appellant's rationalizations and lack of remorse indicated little rehabilitation potential and were aggravating factors). Although the appellant might contend that his lack of remorse is due to the fact that he did not engage in the charged misconduct, this argument would constitute mere disagreement with the administrative judge's reasoned and explained findings to the contrary; <span class="Italic">see Weaver v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 129, 133-34 (1980), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's many years of service and his lack of prior record discipline are significant mitigating factors, the importance of which should not be downplayed. <span class="Italic">See Tryon</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 9 (considering the nature and seriousness of the proven misconduct, the appellant's 45 years of unblemished federal service warranted mitigation of his removal to a 60-day suspension). Nevertheless, having carefully weighed all the pertinent factors, we find that the removal penalty in this instance does not exceed the tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Biniak</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 682, &#x00B6; 15 (where the agency considered improper factors in arriving at its penalty determination, the question was whether the penalty was still within the bounds of reasonableness upon consideration of the proper factors). Accordingly, we sustain the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nonverbal conduct can support adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pokorny v. GSA</span>, 49 MSPR 165, 167 (1991) (removal for an unannounced and belligerent entry into a supervisor's office, followed by the refusal to leave, followed by a return to the office and standing in the supervisor's doorway, refusing to leave, assuming a threatening "nose-to-nose" posture during an argument with the supervisor, and throwing papers on the supervisor's desk). Walking away from a supervisor who is trying to speak with the employee is disrespectful and insubordinate conduct. <span class="Italic">Meads v. VA</span>, 36 MSPR 574, 581 (1988) (removal for that and other charges). The Board sustained removal of an employee with some prior history of insubordination who refused to attend a meeting with his supervisor concerning performance evaluation, told the supervisor to "go away," and after telling the supervisor to "get out of my office," closed his office door. <span class="Italic">Yartzoff v. EPA</span>, 38 MSPR 403, 405, 409 (1988) ("An agency is entitled to expect that its employees will willingly comply with supervisory orders and will not defy simple instructions to discuss their performance.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Insubordinate or similarly actionable behavior encompasses refusal to answer a supervisor's questions, grabbing her telephone, thrusting the appellant's arm toward her, and speaking in a loud confrontational voice. <span class="Italic">Jeffers v.

<p class="Body-Text">A suspension was sustained of an employee who called or characterized a supervisor as "Nazi, Gestapo agent, and anti-Semitic." As to the appellant's defense that the terms were used in an allegorical sense, <span class="Italic">Scheer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 529, 533 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We believe that whether these terms were used by the appellant "directly" or "allegorically," they are considered inherently derogatory in civilized society and, whenever used aggressively or in anger, can only be intended to impugn the character and reputation of those to whom they are addressed....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We accept as self-evident the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's remarks were "the product of emotional anger." There is in the record, however, no indication that Mr. Kaul's words or actions constituted such provocation that could mitigate the malicious nature of the appellant's outburst. On the contrary, Mr. Kaul was repeatedly described by witnesses as having remained calm and professional throughout his exchanges with the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant apparently truly believed that Mr. Kaul had treated him unfairly by putting him on report for an excessive lunch break. These circumstances, however, did not justify the appellant's use of extremely derogatory language with the evident intent of impugning his supervisor's reputation in the presence of co-workers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Abusive language by a correctional officer to a supervisor within the hearing of inmates is a serious breach of the supervisor-subordinate relationship. <span class="Italic">Fikes v.

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 9 MSPR 310, 312 (1981): "[A]ppellant was expected to set an example for his subordinates. However, appellant's attitude toward his supervisor demonstrated a lack of respect for authority and undermined his own ability to command the respect of his subordinates." A couple of disrespectful interactions with a supervisor on one day warranted removal of a supervisory firefighter with a long record of service. The appellant has a record of prior discipline. The conduct was characterized as loud, heated, combative, insulting, and abrasive. Maintenance of discipline and ready compliance within the chain of command was significant for firefighters. <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 253 Fed. Appx. 946, 949 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">A charge of disrespectful conduct must take into account the surrounding circumstances, including the atmosphere and context involved in the remarks leading to discipline, as in <span class="Italic">Daigle v. VA</span>, 84 MSPR 625, 626, 628 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6 (1999), dismissing a threat charge based on the AJ's analysis and considering a charge of disrespectful conduct arising out of comments about the boss to an EEO counselor:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed as a Medical Clerk, GS-04, at the agency's Medical Center in Syracuse, New York. On October 21, 1996, the agency proposed the appellant's removal from federal service based on charges of a threat to inflict bodily injury upon another agency employee and disrespectful conduct toward agency personnel. In support of these charges, the agency alleged that during the course of an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counseling session on September 17, 1996, the appellant, while referring to the Medical Center Director, made comments to the effect that "If I wasn't a sane man, I'd take a weapon and blow the motherfucker's brains out."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that the administrative Judge erred by failing to sustain the disrespectful conduct charge. Although the Board has noted that "Disrespectful conduct as manifested by the use of abusive language is unacceptable and not conducive to a stable working atmosphere," <span class="Italic">Wilson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Justice,</span> 68 MSPR 303, 310 (1995), the Board also considers the context in which inappropriate comments are made to determine whether the comments constituted misconduct and to determine whether the penalty imposed for such misconduct is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Larry v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 MSPR 348, 358 (1997) (comments made during psychotherapy); <span class="Italic">Armstrong v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 28 MSPR 45, 50 (1985) (comments made during a sexual harassment training session in which the instructors encouraged comments and feedback); <span class="Italic">Farris v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 14 MSPR 568, 574 (1983) (noting that employees generally may not be discharged for rude and impertinent conduct in the course of presenting grievances). Given the fact that EEO counseling sessions are a semi-confidential means through which employees complain about the conduct of other agency personnel, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105, and the fact that complainants are likely to be emotionally distraught when they are reporting perceived discrimination to the EEO counselor, these sessions are one of the contexts in which it is reasonable to afford employees more leeway with regard to their conduct than they might otherwise be afforded in other employment situations. We note that the appellant was not referring to the counselor when he used abusive language during the counseling session. In these circumstances, we do not find that the administrative judge erred by failing to sustain the disrespectful conduct charge.</p>
