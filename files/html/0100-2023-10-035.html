<p class="noindent">Public affairs specialists were not excluded as confidential employees when their supervisor did not have significant involvement in effectuation of labor-management policies. <span class="Italic">Broadcasting Bd. of Gov. and AFGE Local 1812</span>, 64 FLRA 235, 236-38 (2009), determined, over Member Beck's dissent:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the RD concluded that King is not significantly involved in labor-management relations because she does not: (1) develop, or advise management in developing, positions or proposals for bargaining with the Union; (2) represent management, or advise those representing management, in responding to grievances; or (3) represent management, or advise those representing management, at <span id="Page_41"></span>arbitration. The RD likewise concluded that Jackson and Davis-Roane are not involved in labor-management relations matters.<span class="Italic"> </span>The Agency contends that the RD erred by ignoring testimony clearly demonstrating their involvement in labor-management relations matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The testimony that the Agency alleges demonstrates involvement in "personnel and potential labor relations issue[s]," may demonstrate involvement in general personnel issues, but fails to demonstrate involvement by King or Jackson in any matter that the Authority has recognized as a labor-management relations matter. The cited testimony also does not specify any involvement by Jackson or King in the formulation or effectuation of management policies, even if the matter were connected to labor-management relations. In this regard, the Agency fails to specify any involvement by King and identifies Jackson's involvement solely as conducting research to prepare a statement about the possible personnel cuts in a particular Agency component when the Agency's review of that component was completed. As Jackson testified, her involvement in labor-management relations matters is to present the Agency's positions on such issues to the media and external entities only after the positions are formulated. In <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev. Headquarters</span>, 41 FLRA 1226, 1234 (1991), the Authority found that employees' occasional involvement in the issuance of press releases pertaining to labor-management relations matters did not demonstrate that they were confidential employees. Accordingly, such testimony fails to demonstrate a genuine issue over whether the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter when he concluded that King and the employees are not significantly involved in labor-management relations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency additionally argues that the RD disregarded testimony that King, Jackson, and Davis-Roane have advance knowledge of information pertaining to labor-management relations matters. The definition of "confidential employee" under the Statute includes employees who, in the normal performance of their duties, may obtain advance information regarding management's position with regard to contract negotiations, the disposition of grievances, and other labor-management relations matters. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Labor, Office of the Solicitor, Arlington Field Office</span>, 37 FLRA 1371, 1383 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Office of the Solicitor</span>). In this regard, the Authority found that management should not be faced with having bargaining-unit members in positions where they could divulge information pertaining to labor-management relations to the union in advance. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Agency argues that Jackson's testimony that she had advance knowledge of information pertaining to possible personnel cuts in one of the Agency's components establishes that she and Davis-Roane are confidential employees. Although advance knowledge of information pertaining to possible personnel cuts relates generally to a personnel issue, the Agency does not provide any evidence that the advance knowledge of such information had any connection to a labor-management relations matter. Accordingly, such testimony fails to demonstrate a genuine issue over whether the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also alleges that the RD disregarded Jackson's testimony of advance notice of "employee complaints and grievances" in concluding that the employees are not confidential employees. In this regard, the hearing officer asked Jackson whether the "grievances" about which she had testified were grievances filed under the negotiated grievance procedure or whether her reference to "grievances" referred to more general employee dissatisfaction. Jackson answered: "A lot of times it's employee dissatisfaction."<span class="Italic"> </span>The Union's attorney then asked: "Have you ever reviewed...management's grievance response to the union before it was submitted?" Jackson answered: "I don't think I have." This testimony fails to establish any advance knowledge of management's position in connection with grievances under the negotiated grievance procedure and, thus, fails to demonstrate a genuine issue over whether the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency alleges that Jackson's testimony concerning the Agency's telecommuting policy confirms that she has advance notice of negotiations with the Union. In this connection, when asked by the hearing officer what King "tell[s Jackson] about any labor proposal or negotiations[,]" Jackson replied that King "may say something to the effect where, well, the Agency is--received an inquiry from the union that this telecommuting is not working and, you know, management is going to do what they can to work things out. And someone suggested A, B, and C and then that's about it." This testimony does not establish that the disputed employees have any advance knowledge of management's proposals or positions in contract negotiations with the Union and fails to demonstrate a genuine issue over whether the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter in this regard. <span class="Italic">Cf. Office of the Solicitor</span>, 37 FLRA at 1383 (employees were confidential employees where they had advance information concerning management's positions with regard to contract negotiations, disposition of grievances, and other labor-management relations matters that would not normally be known to the union). In addition, Jackson's testimony that she has no contact with the Agency's labor-relations specialists and employee-relations specialists, further supports the RD's conclusion that the employees are not privy to information concerning labor-management relations matters before the information is conveyed to the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the dissent's conclusion that King, Jackson, and Davis-Roane receive "advance notice" of "labor relations matters." In our view, this conflates matters with potential implications for an agency's labor relations policies with labor-management relations matters themselves, conflicting with &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13)'s requirement of a nexus with "labor-management relations." As the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Office of the Solicitor </span>reflects, &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13)'s reference to "labor-management relations" matters is narrowly limited to matters commonly understood to be within the meaning of that phrase, such as contract negotiations and the disposition of grievances. <span class="Italic">See Office of the Solicitor</span>, 37 FLRA at 1383; <span class="Italic">cf. NLRB v. Hendricks County Rural Elec. Membership Corp. </span>454 U.S. 170 (1981) (declining to expand the confidential employee exclusion under the NLRA to encompass confidential business information that did not meet the NLRB's labor-nexus test). The dissent would expand &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13)'s "confidential employee" exclusion, which would inappropriately "deprive many employees of the right to bargain collectively." <span class="Italic">Office of the Solicitor, </span>37 FLRA at 1379 (citing analogous precedent under the NLRA).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Agency has not demonstrated that there is a genuine issue over whether the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, under Authority precedent, an employee is a confidential employee when: (1) there is evidence of a confidential working relationship between an employee and an agency representative; and (2) the agency representative is significantly involved in labor-management relations. <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, 59 FLRA at 855. In addition, as also set forth above, employees who may obtain advance information of management's position regarding labor-management relations matters are confidential employees under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the RD failed to apply established law when he failed to assess whether King and the employees: (1) have advance information of management's position with regard to contract negotiations, disposition of grievances, or other labor-management relations matters; and (2) are part of discussions relating to labor-management relations matters. The Agency misconstrues the RD's decision. In this regard, as discussed previously, the RD specifically acknowledged and rejected the Agency's claim that Jackson and Davis-Roane are confidential employees because King has advanced knowledge of management's actions in the area of labor-management relations. The RD determined that, although King is privy to sensitive and confidential information, she is not privy to information concerning labor-management relations before the information is conveyed to the Union. These findings demonstrate that the RD applied established Authority precedent and assessed whether the employees are confidential employees. <span class="Italic">See DOL</span>, 59 FLRA at 855.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Agency has not demonstrated that there is a genuine issue over whether the RD failed to apply established law.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The support specialist is a confidential employee because she formulates or effectuates labor-management-relations policies.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is undisputed that the support specialist has represented the Office of Public Affairs in a discussion with the Union. In addition, the record indicates that the support specialist was thoroughly involved in assisting management's development of an "action plan[&#8197;]" that was aimed at making "substantive change[s]" in the workplace. In this regard, the record establishes that the support specialist attended several meetings in which attendees discussed and proposed ideas for making changes in the areas of "leadership, training, and innovation." Between the meetings, she maintained a draft of the action plan and solicited ideas from attendees. The Union "wanted a chance to review the plan[&#8197;], make suggestions, and note any issues...or any concerns [that] they had." The Office of Public Affairs scheduled a "high[-]level" meeting with the Union to discuss the action plan and asked the support specialist to represent management at that meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also establishes that the support specialist serves as the administrative officer in certain circumstances. In that position, the support specialist is responsible for preparing management's response to any filed grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The above evidence demonstrates that the support specialist is aligned with management in such a manner that her inclusion in the bargaining unit would create a conflict between the interests of management and those of the Union.[39] Consistent with Authority precedent, we find that the support specialist formulates or effectuates labor-management-relations policies and, thus, is a confidential employee under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute.[40] Consequently, the RD's conclusion that the support specialist is not a confidential employee is inconsistent with established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[39]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See DOL Solicitor</span>, 37 FLRA at 1380 (stating that employees "who by their duties, knowledge, or sympathy [are] aligned with management should not be treated as members of labor" and should be excluded from the bargaining unit (alteration in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB v.

<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The program analyst is a confidential employee because she is in a confidential working relationship with the deputy associate solicitor.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the program analyst is in a confidential working relationship with her supervisor, the deputy associate solicitor. The record evidence indicates that the deputy associate solicitor is involved in labor-management issues "from time to time." He has "consult[ed]" with the Union about office relocations and is the management official responsible for responding to grievances. Consistent with Authority precedent finding that an agency representative who answers grievances and negotiates with the union formulates or effectuates labor-management-relations polices,[46] we find that the deputy associate solicitor is such an individual.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[46]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Army</span>, 60 FLRA at 772; <span class="Italic">see also Air Force</span>, 67 FLRA at 121-22 (to determine whether a particular individual formulates or effectuates labor-management policies, the Authority considers whether the individual represents management in negotiations with the union); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12) (defining collective bargaining as including "<span class="Italic">consult</span>[<span class="Italic">ing</span>]...to reach agreement" (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the nature of the program analyst's position requires her to act in a confidential capacity to the deputy associate solicitor. In this regard, the support specialist is the primary source of management support for all personnel activities within the division and is the only employee available to support the deputy associate solicitor in handling labor-management matters. Moreover, the program analyst has access to: employees' personnel files, the division's incoming and outgoing correspondence, and a staffing report--which the record indicates contains information related to pending personnel actions, such as promotions, transfers, and details. As the Agency points out, the Authority has found similar employees to be confidential employees under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute.[54] Accordingly, we find, contrary to the RD, that the support specialist is a confidential employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[54]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NASA</span>, 57 FLRA at 571, 574 (finding employees who, among other things, "screen[ed] incoming correspondence, review[ed] outgoing correspondence[,] and establish[ed] and maintain[ed] files containing correspondence and documentation concerning pending personnel actions" to be confidential employees); <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 5 FLRA at 322-23 (finding employees who, among other things, processed all outgoing and incoming correspondence and maintained personnel files to be confidential employees).</p>
<p class="noindent">Fire assistant chiefs and captains were confidential employees, even though they did not personally negotiate contracts or grant and deny grievances. They worked with the fire chief and his deputy on those matters, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, AFMC Hanscom AB and IAFF Local F-78,</span> 71 FLRA 81, 81-83 (2019) (Member DuBester concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the RD considered whether the incumbents have a confidential working relationship with the fire chief and deputy. The RD found that the incumbents attend management meetings--including the fire chief's weekly staff meetings--where Agency representatives discuss grievances, disciplinary actions, contract negotiations, job classifications, and other confidential labor&#8209;management matters. The RD found that, through their regular attendance at such meetings, the incumbents obtain "advance information" about management's position concerning grievances, contract negotiations, and other labor&#8209;relations matters. The RD also noted that the chief of employee and labor relations (labor chief) testified that she and the fire chief include the incumbents on emails and phone calls with Agency representatives concerning confidential labor&#8209;management issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD also found that the incumbents provide input to Agency representatives in responding to grievances. For instance, the RD noted that a captain testified that he wrote a response to a grievance, submitted it to management for review, and then delivered the response directly to the grievant. In addition, the RD found that the incumbents assist management in preparing for negotiations with the Union. For example, the RD noted that a captain testified that he had worked directly with the fire chief concerning union proposals about overtime and callbacks. The RD also noted that an assistant chief worked to update a confidential flight&#8209;operation guide, which, upon implementation, could require bargaining with the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD determined that the weight of the evidence supported finding that the incumbents have a confidential working relationship with the fire chief and deputy. Accordingly, the RD concluded that the incumbents are confidential employees under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute, and should be excluded from the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that "the RD failed to apply established law" when she determined that the four incumbents are confidential employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7112(b)(2) of the Statute excludes "confidential employee[s]" from appropriate bargaining units. And &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute defines a "confidential employee" as "an employee who acts in a confidential capacity with respect to an individual who formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor&#8209;management relations."[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13); <span class="Italic">see Navy</span>, 70 FLRA at 232.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not dispute that the fire chief and deputy "formulate[&#8197;] or effectuate[&#8197;] management policies in the field of labor&#8209;management relations," but contends that, under established law, the incumbents do not "act[&#8197;] in a confidential capacity with respect to" the fire chief and deputy. To assess whether an employee "acts in a confidential capacity with respect to"[12] an agency representative who formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor&#8209;management relations, the Authority considers whether the employee: (1) obtains advance information of management's position regarding contract negotiations, the disposition of grievances, and other labor&#8209;management matters;[13] (2) attends meetings where labor&#8209;management matters are discussed; (3) because of physical proximity to a supervisor, overhears discussions of labor&#8209;management matters; or (4) has access to, prepares, or types materials related to labor&#8209;management relations, such as bargaining proposals and grievance responses.[14]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Applying the standards above, the RD concluded that the incumbents <span id="Page_43"></span>act in a confidential capacity with respect to the fire chief and deputy because the incumbents (1) obtain "advance information" on management's positions concerning confidential labor&#8209;relations matters when they attend regular management meetings and communicate with the fire chief, deputy, and labor chief; (2) provide input to Agency representatives regarding responses to grievances; and (3) assist management in preparing for negotiations with the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the RD erred because the management meetings that the incumbents attend do not concern "confidential" labor&#8209;management matters or "ongoing labor[&#8209;]relations issues." But we reject that argument because the record shows that the management meetings, as well communications outside those meetings, provide the incumbents advance knowledge of management's position on labor&#8209;management matters such as grievances, classification, and contract negotiation.[18] In addition, the record reflects that the fire chief dismisses bargaining&#8209;unit employees--but not the incumbents--from meetings when discussing confidential labor&#8209;relations matters. Thus, the record supports the RD's finding that the incumbents obtain advance information about confidential labor&#8209;management matters.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the RD's decision is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration, Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio</span> (<span class="Italic">NASA</span>),[20] because there is no evidence that the incumbents "review[&#8197;], draft[&#8197;], [or] maintain[&#8197;] correspondence[, or] open[&#8197;] or answer[&#8197;] mail or email for the fire chief or deputy...pertaining to any negotiation or grievances." In <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, the Authority found that secretaries were confidential employees because their duties included reviewing correspondence, attending management meetings, and preparing documents on management's behalf for grievances, negotiations, and personnel actions.[22] But the Authority did not hold that employees must manage the correspondence of an agency representative in order to be confidential employees. And here, the record shows that the incumbents obtain advance information about negotiations and grievances through the normal performance of their duties, regardless of whether they manage the fire chief's or deputy's mail or email.[23] Therefore, we reject the Union's argument that the RD's decision is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">NASA</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union also contends that the RD misapplied established law because the incumbents have not participated in contract negotiations. But the Authority does not require that an individual participate in negotiations to be considered a confidential employee. For example, the Authority has previously found individuals to be confidential employees based, in part, on their collaborative interactions with a union to draft agency policies and procedures.[25] Here, the record demonstrates that the fire chief has solicited input from the incumbents to prepare for contract negotiations. In addition, an assistant chief testified that he helped to update an Agency standard operating procedure, which, upon implementation, could require bargaining with the Union. The record also shows that the fire chief emails the incumbents about labor&#8209;relations matters. Thus, the evidence supports the RD's finding that the incumbents act in a confidential capacity with respect to the fire chief and deputy, even though the incumbents have not directly participated in contract negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 71 FLRA at 30; <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Edwards Air Force Base, Cal</span>., 62 FLRA 159, 163 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union argues that the incumbents are not confidential employees because they are not "significantly involved" in labor&#8209;relations matters--in other words, they do not formulate or effectuate management policies in the field of labor&#8209;management relations. Section 7103(a)(13) requires that a confidential employee have a working relationship with an <span class="Italic">agency representative</span> who formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor&#8209;management relations, but does not require that the alleged confidential employee also formulate or effectuate such policies.[30] The Union does not challenge the RD's determination that the fire chief and deputy are "significantly involved in labor&#8209;management relations." And to the extent that the Union is arguing that the incumbents do not spend enough time working in a confidential capacity to be excluded under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13), the Authority has recently reiterated that the frequency and amount of time that an employee spends performing in such a capacity "may be relevant," but is "not controlling." Thus, the Union's argument lacks merit.</p>
