<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-118"><span class="space">c.</span> Putative Spouse</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">State law controls marital status when there are claims to a survivor annuity by individuals both claiming to be the decedent annuitant's surviving spouse, <span class="Italic">Nivert v. OPM</span>, 11 MSPR 77, 78-79 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A putative spouse, who is entitled under state law to the same rights and benefits as a legal wife, has been held by the former United States Civil Service Commission to be entitled to a civil service survivor annuity where there is no legal spouse contesting for receipt of these payments. However, appellant's claim that a putative spouse has a right to such benefits which takes precedence over that of a legal spouse who has also applied for them is without foundation. While state law may entitle a putative spouse to civil service annuity payments in some cases, those benefits are payable to "only one natural person" under federal regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.601(b), and are not divisible among two or more recipients. Therefore, contrary to appellant's assertions, there is a clear and substantial federal interest--in limiting payment of survivor benefits to one recipient--which overrides any possible conflicting interpretation of state law in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">State law must be consulted only in identifying the surviving spouse to whom Nivert was married at the time of his death. Appellant's status as a putative spouse in this case does not render her the surviving legal spouse for all purposes. On the contrary, the record reveals that appellant's marriage to the deceased was annulled by order of a Louisiana state court on September 17, 1980. However, even absent the annulment, the fact that Nivert's marriage to the intervenor was never dissolved requires that she be considered the surviving legal spouse for determining entitlement to survivor annuity benefits. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(b)(1). Therefore, appellant has failed to show that the presiding official's conclusion was based on erroneous statutory or regulatory interpretation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jacobs v. OPM</span>, 13 MSPR 23, 26-27 (1982), determined that a surviving spouse may lose the ability to claim a survivor annuity relative to a competing claimant if there is unreasonable delay in challenging the husband's later marriage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Civil service annuity benefits are payable to only one natural person <span id="Page_4249"></span>under Federal law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.601 (b); <span class="Italic">Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo;</span> 439 U.S. 572 (1979). When competing claims are filed for survivor annuity benefits, the law of the state with the most significant interest in determining the marital status is used to determine who is the legal surviving spouse, <span class="Italic">See Nivert v. OPM,</span> MSPB Docket NO. DA08318010311 (April 8, 1982), absent a conflict with Federal law.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., McCulloch v. Maryland,</span> 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 436 (1819) (prohibiting states from imposing obligation on the United States).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As found by the presiding official and OPM, California law recognizes a presumption of validity of the latest marriage which may be overcome by a conclusive demonstration of no divorce. <span class="Italic">Vargas v. Superior Ct.,</span> 9 Cal. App. 3d 470, 88 Cal. Rptr. 281 (1970). However, a person claiming entitlement by virtue of an earlier marriage may be barred from making a claim where she unreasonably delayed taking action to protect her position as spouse after gaining knowledge sufficient to support such an action to the detriment of the legal rights of another. <span class="Italic">See generally United States v. Georgia-Pacific Co.,</span> 421 F.2d 92, 96 (9th Cir. 1970); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Brown,</span> 274 C.A. 2d 178, 79 Cal. Rptr. 257 (1969).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record establishes that the appellant and Mr. Jacobs lived separate and apart for almost thirty years. During this time their primary contact was limited to 2 to 3 telephone calls per year. It was not until the legal separation in 1958, which intervenor indicates was represented by appellant to Mr. Jacobs to be a divorce, that he took legally significant actions as a divorced person. He married intervenor ceremonially in 1961 and executed all documents relating to his retirement and insurance benefits as previously divorced but married to intervenor. Subsequent to the marriage of Mr. Jacobs and the intervenor, he was in attendance at a funeral with the intervenor and introduced her to persons at the gathering as his wife. There is no indication that appellant, who attended the same funeral, expressed any concern or raised any inquiry in this connection. Appellant's testimony that she assumed intervenor to be a housekeeper is not credible. Appellant acknowledges that she heard from others that Mr. Jacobs had children in California but took no action. The evidence of record also indicates that on one occasion appellant visited with relatives in California who resided on the same street as intervenor and Mr. Jacobs, only three houses away, and where the fact of the marriage was discussed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record indicates further that Mr. Jacobs was not a highly educated person, having only a sixth or seventh grade education. The legal separation was granted by default and there is no indication that he was served with a copy of the final judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All of these facts lead us to conclude, as did OPM, that appellant unreasonably delayed taking legal action to challenge the validity her husband's later marriage within a reasonable time after gaining knowledge of it to the detriment of the deceased Mr. Jacobs and intervenor, and is therefore barred from now claiming entitlement to a civil service retirement annuity as legal surviving spouse.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bailey v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 670, 672-73 (1986), arrived at a result similar to <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant appeal, although there has been no actual showing that appellant and Mr. Bailey were divorced or were not divorced, we find that the presumption of validity of intervenor's marriage to Mr. Bailey has not been overcome. There has been no conclusive demonstration of no divorce by appellant. Nor has appellant, having asserted continuation of the first marriage, met her burden of proof demonstrating such continuation. Furthermore, a person claiming entitlement by virtue of an earlier marriage may be barred from making a claim where she unreasonably delayed taking action to protect her position as spouse after gaining knowledge sufficient to support such an action to the detriment of the legal rights of another. <span class="Italic">See Jacobs, supra.</span> Appellant was well aware of Mr. Bailey's subsequent marriage to intervenor and took no action to protect her position as spouse.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jacobs</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was distinguished, and laches did not bar a wife from challenging the later marriage of her husband and securing for the first wife survivor annuity benefits, in <span class="Italic">Rogers v. OPM</span>, 67 MSPR 251, 258-62 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Briefly, the decedent married the appellant on January 26, 1950, in Mobile, Alabama, and they had four children, born on June 27, 1950, July 17, 1951, October 9, 1953, and June 5, 1968. Although the appellant and the decedent lived apart for alleged job reasons, they maintained contact, and the couple bought a home together in Mobile, where the appellant and their children lived.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Meanwhile, the decedent married the intervenor in Pascagoula, Mississippi, on April 4, 1952. Prior to their marriage, they had two children, born on March 20, 1950, and May 2, 1951, and, after their marriage, three additional children, born in 1953, 1955, and 1960. They first lived in Mobile, where they attended church together as a family, and then moved to San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In affirming OPM's reconsideration decision, the administrative judge found, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the decedent held the intervenor out to be his wife based on evidence that: (1) The intervenor and the decedent filed Federal income tax returns as husband and wife; (2) the decedent elected survivor benefits for the intervenor as his spouse; (3) he listed her as his spouse on paperwork for a job move to San Antonio; (4) they executed a will together; and (5) the intervenor was designated as the decedent's surviving spouse on his death certificate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, however, that the appellant overcame the presumption under Texas law of the validity of the most recent marriage because she showed that she and the decedent were never divorced and that she therefore was the decedent's legal widow. Further, the administrative judge noted that, under the applicable law of Texas, a legal spouse may be barred from asserting her marital rights "if, after gaining knowledge sufficient to support an action to protect her position as legal spouse, she unreasonably delays in taking such action to the detriment of the legal rights of a putative spouse."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the testimony presented, the administrative judge found that the appellant knew of the decedent's relationship with the intervenor and of the children they had together. The administrative judge noted the decedent's long, continual absences from the appellant's home. She also noted that some of the children of both relationships went to the same school and knew each other and of their kinship and that at least one of the appellant's sons visited the intervenor and the decedent in their home. Further, the administrative judge noted that, upon the decedent's death, the appellant traveled to San Antonio and attended the funeral and the burial that were arranged by the intervenor, and she did not challenge the decedent's will, which was probated with the intervenor as his widow. Relying in part on <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 13 M.S.P.R. 23, 26-27 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 707 F.2d 513 (5th Cir. 1983) (Table), the administrative judge found that the appellant was therefore barred from claiming entitlement to a survivor annuity as the decedent's legal widow. She concluded that the appellant's delay of 35 years in protecting her position as the decedent's legal spouse was unreasonable, and that the delay "worked to the detriment of [the intervenor] by preventing her from protecting her position as a subsequent good faith spouse."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Civil service annuity benefits are generally payable to only one natural person under Federal law. <span class="Italic">See Jacobs,</span> 13 M.S.P.R. at 26<span class="Italic">;</span> but <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h) 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.614(b) (civil service survivor annuities may, under certain circumstances, be divided between a current spouse and former spouses). When competing claims are filed for survivor benefits, the law of the state with the most significant interest in determining the marital status of the employee is used to determine who is the legal surviving spouse. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.603; <span class="Italic">Money v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 811 F.2d 1474, 1477 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (in determining entitlement to a civil service survivor annuity, state law is used to identify which surviving spouse was married to the decedent at the time of his death); <span class="Italic">Jacobs,</span> 13 M.S.P.R. at 26<span class="Italic">.</span> We discern no error in the administrative judge's determination that Texas law applies in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Texas law, when two or more marriages of a person to different spouses are alleged, the most recent marriage is presumed to be valid as against each marriage that precedes it until one who asserts the validity of a prior marriage proves its validity. <span class="Italic">See</span> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &#x00A7; 2.01 (West Supp. 1994); <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Avalos,</span> 567 S.W.2d 85, 87 (Tex. Civ. App., El Paso 1978). We discern no error in the administrative judge's determination that the appellant has rebutted the presumption of validity of the intervenor's marriage by proving the validity of her own marriage to the decedent. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Davis,</span> 521 S.W.2d 603, 605 (Tex. 1975). We further discern no error in the administrative judge's determination that the appellant knew of the decedent's subsequent marriage to the intervenor yet failed to take action to protect her rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that the instant appeal is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Jacobs.</span> We agree. Although the decision in <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span> does not specify whether it is utilizing the principle of equitable estoppel or the doctrine of laches, it cites the case of <span class="Italic">United States v. Georgia-Pacific Co.,</span> 421 F.2d 92, 96 (9th Cir. 1970), which applied equitable estoppel. Under Texas law, the doctrine of equitable estoppel requires a false representation or concealment of material facts with the <span class="Italic">intention</span> that said false representation or concealment be acted on. <span class="Italic">See Simpson v. Simpson,</span> 380 S.W.2d 855, 860-61 (Tex. Civ. App., Dallas 1964). In <span class="Italic">Jacobs,</span> 13 M.S.P.R. at 26-27<span class="Italic">,</span> the first wife allegedly told her husband that their legal separation was in fact a divorce, a representation that he and his second wife acted upon to their detriment. In the present appeal, however, there was no false representation or concealment. In <span class="Italic">Jacobs,</span> 13 M.S.P.R. at 26<span class="Italic">,</span> the contact between the decedent and his first wife, following their separation prior to his second marriage, was limited to two to three telephone calls a year. In this appeal, not only did the appellant claim to have spoken with the decedent every day until his death, she also purchased a home with him, lived with him at least part-time until 1967, and had two children with him <span class="Italic">after</span> his second marriage. Other than her failure to take affirmative steps to declare that she was still married to the decedent, there is no evidence of false representation or concealment of facts on the part of the appellant. In fact, on her one alleged encounter with the intervenor prior to the <span id="Page_4250"></span>decedent's funeral, when informed of the decedent's intention to marry the intervenor, the appellant reportedly responded that the decedent could not marry the intervenor because he was still married to her. We therefore analyze the parties' competing claims under the doctrine of laches.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish the equitable affirmative defense of laches, which operates to estop the assertion of a right, a party must show: (1) Unreasonable delay by one having legal or equitable rights in asserting them; and (2) good faith change of position by another to his detriment because of the delay. <span class="Italic">See McBride v. McBride,</span> 797 S.W.2d 689, 693 (Tex. Civ. App., Houston 1990); <span class="Italic">see also Simpson,</span> 380 S.W.2d at 861. Failure to prove any one or more of the elements is fatal. <span class="Italic">See Mandril v. Kasishke,</span> 620 S.W.2d 238, 242 (Tex. Civ. App., Amarillo 1981). It is appropriate to treat the doctrine of laches as a form of affirmative defense available to a putative spouse in defending her claim to property left by the decedent against the claims of the decedent's legal spouse. <span class="Italic">See Simpson,</span> 380 S.W.2d at 861; <span class="Italic">see also Money,</span> 811 F.2d at 1478-79 (upholding the Board's refusal to apply the doctrine of laches under California law where the second spouse failed to show unreasonable delay). Thus, the burden should have been placed on the intervenor to plead and prove a bar to the appellant's claim to the annuity below. <span class="Italic">See Murray v. Murray,</span> 611 S.W.2d 172, 173 (Tex. Civ. App., El Paso 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we concur in the administrative judge's determination that the appellant unreasonably delayed in protecting her legal rights, we do not concur in the administrative judge's finding that the delay worked to the intervenor's detriment. Based on our review of the record, the intervenor has not satisfied her burden of alleging and showing a good faith change in position or injury as a result of the appellant's delay. <span class="Italic">See Murray,</span> 611 S.W.2d at 173; <span class="Italic">Simpson,</span> 380 S.W.2d at 861.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record suggests that, since her marriage to the decedent in 1952, the intervenor remained as the decedent's putative spouse for 35 years without a change in position to her detriment. As previously noted, the decedent's will was probated with the intervenor as his widow. If the appellant had promptly asserted her rights as the legal spouse of the decedent, as the intervenor asserts that the appellant should have done, the intervenor's marriage to the decedent may well have been declared void. <span class="Italic">See</span> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &#x00A7; 2.22 (West 1993) (a marriage is void if either party was previously married and the prior marriage is not dissolved). Prejudicial harm does not occur merely because one loses what she otherwise would have kept. <span class="Italic">See Baylor University Medical Center v. Heckler,</span> 758 F.2d 1052, 1058 (5th Cir. 1985). We thus do not discern, based on the evidence of record, how prejudice to the intervenor would arise from anything other than an adverse decision by this Board on the merits. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the intervenor has failed to allege and submit evidence establishing a good faith change of position to her detriment as a result of the appellant's delay, we conclude that her affirmative defense of laches must fail. Accordingly, the initial decision is reversed and OPM's reconsideration decision is not sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shirar v. OPM</span>, 55 MSPR 402 (1992) (question of whether ceremonial marriage was overcome by evidence of lack of a divorce of the first spouse under California law); <span class="Italic">Hundley v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 162 (1989) (remand to address issues including proper marital status among conflicting claimants); <span class="Italic">McAndrews v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hyde v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 204, 207 (1989), questioned whether the husband of a federal employee, who he murdered, was entitled to a survivor annuity when an intervening claimant questioned whether the underlying marriage was valid as a result of the mental state of the husband. The Board determined it did not have the authority to adjudicate the validity of the marriage and remanded it to OPM, noting that the validity of a marriage under applicable law must be determined by the appropriate local judicial body. <span class="Italic">Beatty v. OPM</span>, 46 MSPR 623, 629 (1991), considered the law of Virginia to determine if common law marriage was recognized so as to permit a claim for a survivor annuity.</p>
