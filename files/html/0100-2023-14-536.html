<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was a proposal that each examiner have his or her own telephone. It concerned the technology of performing work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3760 and SSA, Disability Analysis Branch</span>, 11 FLRA 576 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 827 F.2d 814, 820-21 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (Proposal 14 was nonnegotiable as an infringement upon the agency's right to determine the technology for performing work proposal that employees be given access to military and civilian telephones at their worksite). For the same reason a proposal that adequate telephones be provided for the conduct of agency work was not negotiable. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, MSHA, Morgantown</span>, 15 FLRA 902, 903 (1984) (Proposal 3); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, MSHA</span>, 21 FLRA 1046 (1986) (Proposal 1, that management provide sufficient telephones necessary to conduct government business, was nonnegotiable because it concerned technology of performing work; it was permissively negotiable). A proposal that employees have sufficient access to agency telephones to perform at an acceptable level was a nonnegotiable infringement on the right of the agency to make substantive decisions concerning the technology of performing work. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 229 and DHHS</span>, 22 FLRA 698, 699 (1986). But negotiable as appropriate arrangements in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1122 and DHHS, SSA, W. Program Serv. Ctr.,</span> 47 FLRA 272, 274, 284 (1993), were two proposals mandating that the agency provide centralized telephones to handle "rollover" calls and to provide that equipment to certain unit employees in their workstations. The equipment would reduce the possibility of lost messages and reduce the disruption to (and increase privacy) of authorized personal emergency calls. The agency did not offer specific information on how its costs would outweigh the benefits afforded by the proposals.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 520 and VA Reg'l Office Columbia, SC</span>, 60 FLRA 615, 616-17 (2005), declared nonnegotiable a proposal that the agency continue to provide a <span id="page_1020"></span>telephone at each employee's "destination cubicle" for all those employees involved in a transfer who currently had a telephone:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union concedes that the proposal affects the Agency's right to determine the technology, methods, and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). Generally, a proposal that concerns a &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) matter is bargainable at the election of the agency. However, if the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, the agency has an obligation to bargain over the proposal. The Union argues that the proposal in this case constitutes an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority follows the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>)<span class="Italic">.</span> Under this analysis, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 31; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Serv. v.</span> FLRA, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG, </span>21 FLRA at 31. Proposals that address purely speculative or hypothetical concerns, or that are unrelated to management's exercise of its reserved rights, do not constitute arrangements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-100</span>, 39 FLRA 762, 766 (1991). The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently "tailored" to compensate those employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1687</span>, 52 FLRA 521, 523 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the Authority determines that the proposal is an arrangement, then the Authority will examine whether the arrangement is appropriate, or whether it excessively interferes with the relevant management right. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-32. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's right. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the proposal is intended to address the adverse effects resulting from the Agency's decision not to provide the employee with a telephone at his cubicle. In identifying the adverse effects, the Union asserts that the Agency's decision restricts the employee's ability to make and receive telephone calls in the privacy of his cubicle, compromises the employee's safety, and decreases his work production and ability to meet the performance standards established for his duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record, we conclude that the adverse effects the Union seeks to mitigate are speculative. In this regard, the Union has failed to establish that the Agency's decision not to provide the employee with a telephone at his cubicle adversely effects the employee's ability to make and receive personal and work-related telephone calls. In fact, the Union acknowledges that there are several telephones located in the Resource Center available for such use. In addition, although the Union claims that the proposal addresses the employee's safety concerns, the Union has not established that requiring the Agency to provide the employee with a telephone at his cubicle will have any impact on the employee's safety. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R1-100</span>, 39 FLRA at 766. Further, the Union has not demonstrated that the Agency's exercise of its management right will adversely effect the employee's work production and his ability to meet the performance standards established for his duties. <span class="Italic">See Prof'l Airways Sys. Specialists</span>, 59 FLRA 25, 29 (2003). <span class="Italic">Cf. W. Point Elementary Sch. Teachers Ass'n, NEA</span>, 34 FLRA 1008, 1013 (1990) (where agency's exercise of a management right detracts from an employee's ability to satisfactorily accomplish his or her duties, the adverse impact on the employee is reasonably foreseeable).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, this case is distinguishable from a proposal in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1122</span>, 47 FLRA 272, 284-91 (1993), which involved negotiations over the impact and implementation of the agency's decision to install systems furniture in unit employees' work area. The union proposed that each employee be provided with a certain type of telephone that would permit the employee to handle rollover calls from the secretary. The Authority found that the proposal was an arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute in that the proposal was designed to address the adverse effects of the agency's decision to provide only one such telephone at the workstation of one employee. Noting, among other things, that all of the employees provided backup to the secretary in the latter's absence, the Authority found that the proposal would give each employee an equal chance of receiving rollover calls, thereby reducing the adverse effect on the performance of the one employee in whose workstation the telephone was placed. The Authority also found that the proposal would provide employees with easier access to make and receive work and non-work related phone calls without having to make such calls in the presence of the employee in whose workstation the one telephone was located. Applying <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, the Authority essentially found that the adverse effects that the proposal sought to mitigate were not speculative. In contrast, and for the reasons stated above, the Union has not established that the adverse effects on the employee in this case are other than speculative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the concerns the proposal is intended to address are speculative, the proposal does not constitute an arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). As such, the proposal is not an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal permitting personnel to use the telephone for personal emergency calls was not barred from negotiation. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3511 and VA Hosp., San Antonio</span>, 12 FLRA 76, 100 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, AFLC, Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 53 FLRA 1664, 1668-69 (1998) (determining in context of refusal to bargain case that availability and location of telephones for employees' personal calls is negotiable); <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 31 FLRA 651, 660 (1988) (negotiable: Proposal 3, requiring that emergency phone calls be referred immediately to employee rather than being screened by supervisor). Also negotiable was a proposal that while on travel or TDY status employees be allowed to use government phones for personal business, or when government phones are not available be permitted to use private phones on reimbursable basis. FLRA determined that the proposal was not inconsistent with law or government-wide regulations governing use of telephones and that the proposal was not contrary to an agency regulation supported by a compelling need. <span class="Italic">PASS and Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point</span>, 38 FLRA 149, 153-54 (1990) (Provision 1). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council and DOJ, INS</span>, 16 FLRA 251, 252-53 (1984) (Proposal 2 nonnegotiable: permitting employees one weekly telephone call home while on detail conflicted with GSA travel allowance regulations permitting calls only for official business).</p>
<p class="noindent">Reviewing exceptions to an arbitrator's award that in turn failed to enforce a provision ordered by FSIP, FLRA required bargaining over a proposal that the agency place phones for the use of employees to receive emergency calls in inspection areas where the agency barred the use of cellphones or other wireless devices, <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 64 FLRA 443, 447-49 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator concluded, and there is no dispute, that the provision would not affect the Agency's right to assign work in the Agency's larger offices. However, the Arbitrator found that the provision would affect the Agency's right to assign work in the Agency's smaller offices. In this regard, the Arbitrator reasoned, "it is likely that there would be times when an employee would not be available to hear and answer the dedicated phone line[ ]" and that, "[i]n those situations, the [Agency] would have to choose between violating the requirements of the [provision] or reassigning an employee from other duties to make sure an employee was available to hear and answer the dedicated line."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3511</span>, 12 FLRA 76, 99 (1983) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3511</span>), the Authority held that a proposal allowing employees to use a phone for emergency calls did not interfere with the Agency's right to assign work. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 31 FLRA 651, 660-61 (1988) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span>), the Authority found that a proposal allowing employees to directly receive personal emergency phone calls did not interfere with the Agency's right to assign work. Both cases indicate that an occasional emergency phone call made or received by an employee does not rise to the level of affecting an agency's right to assign work under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing precedent here, there is no basis in the record to conclude that, even in "smaller" offices, requiring an employee to be available to hear and answer calls made on the dedicated line would affect the right to assign work, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. We note, in this regard, the award cites no evidence, and the Agency provides none, supporting the distinction between offices of various sizes. Moreover, the Agency emphasizes that, in addition to using its telephones "to receive calls from other law enforcement agencies regarding specific terrorist alerts, the Agency must maintain open lines to receive calls from the public regarding threats or concerns, intelligence from foreign governments, and calls from the trade community." In addition, as the Agency now acknowledges, "the telephone lines are always answered." As the ability to receive telephone calls is so critical to the Agency's operations, and as there is existing capability to respond to telephone calls, we find that, whatever the size of the office, satisfying the additional responsibility to respond to emergency calls on the dedicated line would not have more than an incidental impact on the Agency's work assignments. Accordingly, we find that the provision does not affect the Agency's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the right to determine internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, the Authority has held that this right includes the authority to determine the policies and practices that are part of an Agency's plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, or operations against internal or external risks. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA 539, 581 (1997). Where the agency shows a link or reasonable connection between its objective of securing or safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and the policy or practice designed to implement that objective, a proposal that conflicts with the policy or practice affects management's right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA 1174, 1186 (1999) <span id="page_1021"></span>(Member Wasserman dissenting in part). Once [such] a link has been established, the Authority will not review the merits of the agency's plan in the course of resolving a negotiability dispute." <span class="Italic">Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 1-F</span>, 51 FLRA 143, 145 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2143, </span>48 FLRA 41, 44 (1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the Agency has an objective of protecting against a "wide variety of security threats" and that the Agency uses its telephones to protect against these threats, stating that "[t]he use of the Agency telephone lines is an essential part of the [Agency's] internal security practices." Thus, the award indicates that there is a reasonable connection between the Agency's internal security objectives and its practices regarding Agency telephones.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also found that the provision would affect the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices if the provision were implemented by diverting some of the Agency's currently-used telephone lines, stating that this would "[r]educ[e] the number of telephone lines that the Agency has determined it needs for its own internal security practices [and] would impair those practices." However, the Arbitrator did not consider whether the provision would affect the Agency's right to determine internal security practices if the provision were implemented by adding telephone lines. The Arbitrator acknowledged and the Agency concedes that the provision could be implemented this way. Nevertheless, the Agency argues that adding telephone lines "is impractical" and "would have an implicit impact on [its] telecommunication strategy, plans, and budget to allot for telephone lines to perform agency work." Additionally, the Agency claims that the provision "would still require that an employee, who is in the middle of responding to a security threat, must interrupt his security efforts in order to answer the dedicated line."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Arbitrator made no finding that, if implemented by adding telephone lines, the provision would affect the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. Moreover, the Agency does not demonstrate such an effect. The Agency asserts that the provision is not practical--an assertion that relates to the provision's merits, not its negotiability--and the claim regarding the provision's "implicit impact" is unsupported.<span class="Italic"> </span>In addition, the Agency's claim that an employee who is responding to a security threat must interrupt the response to answer the dedicated line misconstrues the provision, which only requires the dedicated line "be in an area where an employee could hear it ring and be able to answer the call." Nothing in the wording of the provision requires the result claimed by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we find that the provision does not affect the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. As such, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether the Arbitrator erred in concluding that the provision is not an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2050</span>, 35 FLRA 706, 715-16 (1990) (finding it unnecessary to determine whether proposal was an appropriate arrangement where proposal did not affect any management right).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 59 FLRA 844, 647-48 (2004), resolved as nonnegotiable two proposals permitting employees to carry cell phones and pagers to receive messages during worktime and to permit employees to respond if permitted by their supervisors. The proposals, intended to permit employees to attend to personal matters involving family members and day care providers, interfered with the agency's ability to set internal security requirements to a degree that precluded negotiation as arrangements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The test for determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) is set out in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under that test, the Authority initially determines whether a proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. An arrangement must seek to mitigate adverse effects "flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. Proposals that address speculative or hypothetical concerns do not constitute arrangements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 2015</span>, 53 FLRA 967, 973 (1997). The alleged arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1687</span>, 52 FLRA 521, 523 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If a proposal is an arrangement, the Authority then determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management rights. <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the purposes of this decision, we assume here that the proposals are arrangements that are sufficiently tailored to benefit employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices. As for whether the proposals are appropriate arrangements, we find that allowing inspectors to carry personal wireless communication devices while on duty in the primary and secondary areas and allowing employees to respond to calls or messages received on such devices would provide a benefit to employees adversely affected by management's right to determine its internal security practices. As delineated by the Union, these proposals would allow employees to be in contact with their family members in the event of personal emergencies, as well as managers and other law enforcement officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find that this benefit is more than outweighed by the Agency's goal in safeguarding its operations and the public from the dangers posed by allowing inspectors to carry personal wireless communication devices while on duty in primary and secondary inspection areas. Significantly, the proposals would reverse the Agency's decision to establish a policy that completely prohibits all employees from carrying personal communication devices while on duty in primary and secondary inspection areas. The Authority previously has found that proposals having this effect do not constitute negotiable appropriate arrangements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 1</span>, 49 FLRA 225, 249 (1994) (proposal acted as absolute restriction on right to assign particular duties to certain employees, found not to be appropriate arrangement); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 15,</span> 30 FLRA 1046, 1057-58 (1988) (proposal that completely negated the Agency's decision to use random drug testing for purposes of protecting security would reverse the substantive impact of that decision and was not an appropriate arrangement); <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R7-23</span>, 23 FLRA 753, 759 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Local R7-23</span>) (proposal which negates management's exercise of its right to determine internal security is excessive when it reverses the substantive effect of management's action).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with this precedent, we find that the proposals in this case are not appropriate arrangements because they excessively interfere with management's right to determine its internal security practices. Accordingly, we conclude that the proposals are not within the Agency's duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Internal security concerns led to the determination that proposals concerning use of cell phones and pagers in FAA facilities were nonnegotiable, <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 64 FLRA 161 (2009). The proposal was (disputed portion in italics):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 8. Radios, television sets, appropriate magazines/publications, pagers/cell phones, and electronic devices will be permitted in designated non-work areas at all facilities for use at non-work times. <span class="Italic">Pagers/Cell Phones may be set on a non-audible position within work areas but their actual use in those work areas is not permitted. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">In facilities where pagers/cell phones interfere with NAS communications equipment due to close proximity, all such equipment shall be set in the off position when in the immediate vicinity of the operational position(s).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's analysis was, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> at 163-64:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The proposal affects management's right to determine internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to determine internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the right to determine the policies and practices that are a part of an agency's plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, or operations against internal or external risks. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1920,</span> 47 FLRA 340, 348 (1993) (Local 1920). Where an agency shows a link, or reasonable connection, between its objectives of securing or safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and the policy or practice designed to implement that objective, a proposal that conflicts with the policy or practice affects management's internal security rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU,</span> 55 FLRA 1174, 1186 (1999). Upon finding such a link, the Authority "will not examine the extent to which the practices adopted by management to achieve its security objectives actually facilitate the accomplishment of those objectives." <span class="Italic">AFSCME,</span> Locals 2910 &#x0026; 2477, 49 FLRA 834, 839 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has established a reasonable link between its objectives of securing or safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and its practice of prohibiting employees from carrying wireless communication devices while on duty in operational areas. Specifically, we find that the Agency has established that prohibiting employees from carrying and using such devices in operational areas may prevent those devices from disrupting air traffic communications, and may decrease the risk that the air traffic controllers will be distracted from their duties in handling the safe and efficient sequencing and separation of aircraft. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1030,</span> 57 FLRA 901, 902 (2002) (proposals permitting guards to use outside shelters equipped with various amenities affected right to determine its internal security practices by increasing risk that guards would be distracted from their duties). As such, the proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The proposal is not an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, the Authority applies the test set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87,</span> 21 FLRA 24, 31-33 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). <span id="page_1022"></span>Under this test, the Authority initially determines whether the proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 31. In this regard, the Authority considers whether the proposal is "tailored" to compensate or benefit employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1687,</span> 52 FLRA 521, 523 (1996). If the proposal is an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether the arrangement is appropriate or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights. <span class="Italic">See KANG,</span> 21 FLRA at 31. In making this determination, the Authority balances the proposal's benefits to employees against its burdens on management. <span class="Italic">See NTEU,</span> 62 FLRA 267, 272 (2007) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting in part).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying that test, the Agency's current internal-security practice prohibits employees from carrying personal wireless communication devices while on duty in an operational work area. The proposal would benefit employees by allowing them to carry such devices in such areas under certain circumstances. Accordingly, it is tailored to benefit those employees who are adversely affected by management's exercise of its right to determine internal security. Thus, it is an arrangement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE Local 1156,</span> 63 FLRA 340, 342 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the arrangement is appropriate, by permitting employees to carry personal wireless communication devices (in an "on" but non-audible position) in operational areas, employees would be able, when they checked the devices at appropriate times, to determine who was attempting to contact them. However, employees could not "actual[ly] use" the devices while in the operational area. Thus, even under the proposal, employees could not review a device's call log until they leave the operational area. This is something that employees are already entitled to do. As such, the only benefit to employees articulated by the Union is either minimal or nonexistent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the burdens on management, the Agency has identified several concerns associated with allowing these devices in operational areas, even when the devices are set to non-audible positions. Specifically, the Agency cites audio interference to air traffic controller headsets that "seriously affect[s] radio frequency transmissions[;]" interference with "air traffic control communication systems used in sequencing and separating aircraft[;]" and distraction to air traffic controllers performing the mission-critical job of separating aircraft. Thus, the Agency cites significant, specific concerns regarding how the proposal would interfere with its internal security practice of prohibiting such devices. The burdens on management would be lessened to some extent by the fact that, under the proposal, the Agency would retain the rights to determine which devices affect Agency equipment and which equipment is affected, and to direct that a device be turned off when management has determined that it affects equipment. Nevertheless, it is undisputed that the proposal would impose burdens involving important security matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Balancing the minimal or nonexistent benefit that the proposal would have to employees against the specified burdens on management, we find that the burdens on management outweigh the purported benefit to employees. Accordingly, on balance, we find that the proposal excessively interferes with management's right to determine its internal security practices and, thus, is not an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU,</span> 59 FLRA 844, 847-48 (2004) (proposal allowing employees to carry personal wireless communication devices while on duty in inspection areas was not an appropriate arrangement).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that employees retain their telephone numbers after being relocated to different work stations. Telephone use was a matter directly affecting the work situation and employment relation and was within the duty to bargain. Although the telephone concerned the technology of performing work, it was not apparent that assignment of a telephone number to a phone was itself part of the technical method to accomplish the work of the agency. <span class="Italic">CREA and Library of Congress</span>, 18 FLRA 36, 38-39 (1985). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-044.html#sec6-45">Beepers and Standby Time</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that the union have the right to monitor data collection and verification processes used by the agency to monitor long distance telephone use. The proposal was challenged only on the basis that it did not affect employment conditions. Employment conditions were implicated by the proposal. The reports sought by the union could be used to initiate disciplinary actions for violations of agency policy concerning telephone use. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3824 and Dept. of Energy, Western Area Power Admin.</span>, 52 FLRA 332, 334-35 (1996) (Proposal 4).</p>
