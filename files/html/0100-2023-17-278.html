<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-275"><span class="space">o.</span> Environmental Differential Pay; Danger Pay</h5>
<p class="noindent">EDP is established under 5 USC 5343:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2227"></span>(c)&#x2003;The Office of Personnel Management, by regulation, shall prescribe practices and procedures for conducting wage surveys, analyzing wage survey data, developing and establishing wage schedules and rates, and administering the prevailing rate system. The regulations shall provide--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;for proper differentials, as determined by the Office, for duty involving unusually severe working conditions or unusually severe hazards, and for any hardship or hazard related to asbestos, such differentials shall be determined by applying occupational safety and health standards consistent with the permissible exposure limit promulgated by the Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970;...</p>
<p class="noindent">OPM regulations government environmental differential pay (EDP) for Prevailing Rate employees are at 5 CFR 532.511 (2022) and an associated appendix to that section. They were previously described in the late Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), and references to the FPM are sprinkled throughout this section. If a case cites to the FPM, a researcher should check the CFR and the associated Appendix A to make sure the corresponding EDP category remains the same. Note that entitlement to the differential is not blocked under the regulations if the underlying environmental condition is a component of the classification of the employee's position. The result is different with hazardous duty pay, discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-17-277.html#sec9-276">Hazard Pay</a>."</p>
<p class="noindent">OPM advises:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hazardous duty pay is additional pay for the performance of hazardous duty or duty involving physical hardship.&#x2003;Hazardous duty pay is payable to General Schedule (GS) employees covered by chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code. Prevailing rate (wage) employees are eligible to receive environmental differential pay in certain circumstances under a separate statutory provision (5 U.S.C. 5343(c)(4)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><a href="https://www.opm.gov/frequently-asked-questions/search/?cid=c4c7e7ca-48be-4650-bbc8-6ec08e8fd479">https://www.opm.gov/frequently-asked-questions/search/?cid=c4c7e7ca-48be-4650-bbc8-6ec08e8fd479</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The basic determinants governing EDP claims litigated through the grievance process were summarized in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R7-36 and Dept. of Army, Savanna Army Depot Activity</span>, 51 FLRA 720, 723 (1995), involving a claim for the differential for work with or in close proximity to explosives or incendiary material involving potential personal injury or loss of life:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that specific work situations for which EDP is payable under the categories codified in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 532.511, Appendix A are left to local determination, including arbitration. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, McAlester</span>, <span class="Italic">Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 2815</span>, 36 FLRA 434, 438 (1990). However, to justify the payment of EDP, an arbitrator's award must meet all pertinent regulatory requirements. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Navy Public Works Center, San Diego, California and National Association of Government Employees, Local R12-35</span>, 49 FLRA 553, 559 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">For explanation of the wage computations involved in EDP, refer to <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE</span>, 43 FLRA 207, 213-15 (1991) (asbestos exposure). An employee may not be paid more than one environmental differential for a particular period of work. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Underseas Warfare Ctr. Div. and IAM Local 282</span>, 54 FLRA 3, 6 (1998). A more elaborate summary of controlling law was provided in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2144 and Dept. of Air Force</span>, 51 FLRA 834, 838-39 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Appendix A [to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 532.511], which is substantively identical to former Appendix J, does not set forth any specified level of exposure required for the payment of EDP. Accordingly, as was the case under Appendix J, the specific work situations for which EDP is payable are left to local determination, including arbitration. <span class="Italic">VAMC</span>, 51 FLRA at 623; <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1482 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California</span>, 50 FLRA 572, 574 (1995). Thus, when the parties submit a grievance to arbitration involving exposure to asbestos, the arbitrator has the authority to resolve a dispute over what quantitative level of exposure to airborne concentrations of asbestos exposes employees to potential illness and injury and how that level is derived or calculated. <span class="Italic">VAMC</span>, 51 FLRA at 624. Of course, in making local determinations regarding the specific work situations for which EDP is payable, the parties could negotiate, consistent with law and regulation, the quantitative level of asbestos exposure that would be used in assessing employee entitlement to EDP. As there is no evidence in this case that the parties negotiated such a standard, the Arbitrator did not err in finding that the Agency adopted the OSHA standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in relying on <span class="Italic">Allen Park</span> as support for its contention that the Arbitrator should not have applied the OSHA standard, the Union misinterprets the Authority's findings in <span class="Italic">Allen Park</span>. That case did not establish a specific standard for the level of asbestos exposure warranting the payment of EDP which would be applicable to all Federal facilities. The standard applied in <span class="Italic">Allen Park</span>--that there is no permissible asbestos exposure level for the payment of EDP--was determined by the arbitrator in that case based on the facts presented. There is nothing in <span class="Italic">Allen Park</span> or this case that requires the Arbitrator to apply that standard in the instant case. Moreover, arbitration awards are not precedential and, therefore, a contention that an award conflicts with other arbitration awards provides no basis for finding an award deficient....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VA San Diego Healthcare Sys. and NAGE</span>, 65 FLRA 45, 49 (2010), sustained an arbitrator's analysis of EDP entitlement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343(c)(4), the Office of Personnel Management is required to provide for WG employees "proper differentials...for duty involving unusually severe working conditions or unusually severe hazards." As the Arbitrator explained, those differential rates, 8% for high degree hazard and 4% for low degree hazard, are set out in Appendix J to Subpart E of Part 532.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the legal standard in &#x00A7; 5543(c)(4) [sic] and the regulations, the Arbitrator found that the incumbents in the WG positions worked with, or in close proximity to, bio-hazardous waste and were exposed to a high degree of risk. The Agency claims, however, that the duties regularly performed by the WG positions are not "unusually severe" for purposes of &#x00A7; 5343(c)(4). Pursuant to &#x00A7; 5343(c)(4), OPM's regulations define "unusually severe" hazards warranting an EDP. The Arbitrator, based on the evidence and arguments, found that the WG positions fell within the "high degree hazard of micro-organisms" category within OPM's schedule of EDPs for "unusually severe" hazards, warranting an EDP of 8%. Except for its argument that the employees' exposure risk was practically eliminated--an argument which, as discussed <span class="Italic">supra</span>, is not properly before the Authority--the Agency does not argue that the Arbitrator improperly placed the hazard within this EDP category. Moreover, contrary to the Agency's contention, unlike &#x00A7; 5545(d), &#x00A7; 5343(c)(4) does not provide that an employee is not entitled to EDP if the position's classification factored in exposure to hazards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator's conclusion that the incumbents were entitled to EDP of 8% is consistent with the applicable standard of law. Therefore, we find that the award of EDP to the WG positions is not contrary to law and deny the Agency's exception.</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA lacks the authority to challenge OPM regulations governing EDP authorization. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot and AFGE Local 2142</span>, 56 FLRA 1057, 1065 (2001) (adding that FLRA will not find an award contrary to 5 USC 5343(c)(4) if award is consistent with 5 CFR part 532, subpart E and Appendix A), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied on other grounds</span>, 57 FLRA 290, 292 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator's determination of exposure by employees to asbestos, warranting retroactive payment of EDP, constitutes the finding, required by the Back Pay Act, that but for the unwarranted action, the employees would not have suffered a withdrawal or reduction of their pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Leavenworth and AFGE Local 85</span>, 24 FLRA 902, 905 (1986); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3854 and March Air Reserve Base</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-185.html">71 FLRA 951</a>, 951-52 (2020) (improper denial of EDP is a reduction in pay or allowances requiring a back pay award). The arbitrator may issue an award sustaining a grievance without elaborate detail. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Charleston Naval Shipyard and FEMTC</span>, 39 FLRA 987, 991, 993 (1991), one concern was the amount of time that painters were exposed to unusually severe hazards for "high work." Sustaining the award, the FLRA noted: "An arbitrator does not need to specify or discuss particular items of evidence which were considered and on which the award is based...." An arbitrator cannot award EDP for continuing exposure to asbestos, for the award of EDP requires a finding (apparently retrospective in nature) that the employees continue to work in areas exposing them to asbestos entailing risks not practically eliminated by protective measures or safety devices. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army and AFGE Local 2142</span>, 58 FLRA 77, 80 (2002). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-010.html#sec9-11">Classification</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-17-015.html#sec9-16">Environmental Differential Pay</a>," concerning classification issues for additional case law concerning awards granting EDP.]</p>
<p class="noindent">A lump-sum payment for EDP improperly denied in the past was acceptable under the late FPM. <span class="Italic">Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 18 FLRA 899, 900 (1985). An award of EDP to persons not paid under a Federal Wage System wage schedule was not permitted under FPM 532-1, S8-7, expressly limiting payment of EDP to wage employees under the FWS wage schedules. <span class="Italic">Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 18 FLRA 899, 901 (1985). If the parties do not otherwise limit their issues, an arbitrator may decide the appropriate EDP classification for an award, even <span id="page_2228"></span>if the union advocates a different classification of EDP. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Navy Pub. Works Ctr., Norfolk and Tidewater FEMTC</span>, 54 FLRA 339 (1998). Under <span class="Italic">Navy Pub. Works Ctr.</span>, any EDP grant must conform to the conditions of the EDP category, for the payment is a charge against public funds and must be strictly construed to avoid exceeding the scope of the waiver of sovereign immunity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596, was amended by Pub. L. 105-261 in 1998, to add subsection (b)(4), establishing a six year recovery period. Before that amendment, there was some inconsistency in FLRA decisions on limitations, other than imposed by contract, on the recovery period for EDP. <span class="Italic">Allen Park VAMC and AFGE Local 933</span>, 34 FLRA 1091, 1103 (1990), noted that, at that time, an arbitrator's award of EDP back to 1978 was permissible: "Nothing in the Back Pay Act or in FPM Supplement 532-1, Appendix J, indicates that the period of time for which the Arbitrator awarded backpay was improper." The statutory amendment was approved on October 17, 1998. Before that, there was an argument that another statute, the Barring Act, barred recover of more than six year, but FLRA disagreed and determined in April of 1998 that an arbitrator could, under a contract, award retroactive EDP for a period longer than permitted by a general six-year statute of limitations governing claims against the United States, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Underseas Warfare Ctr. Div. and IAM Local 282</span>, 54 FLRA 3, 6-7 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's contention that the Arbitrator was barred from awarding EDP to the grievants for a period longer than 6 years prior to the filing of the grievance because of the statute of limitations contained in 31 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 3702(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">31 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 3702, known as the Barring Act, reads in pertinent part:</p>

<p class="noindent-2">31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Regulations that implemented 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702 before the 1996 amendment were found at 4 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 31.5. Contrary to the Agency's exception, these regulations are no longer in effect. The applicable regulations to 31 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 3702 are discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) promulgated general procedures for the settlement of these claims in 62 Fed. Reg. 68139 (1997) (to be codified at 5 C.F.R. Part 178). These regulations state that, except for Fair Labor Standards Act and "other possible statutory limitations" that are not listed, all claims filed against the United States Government are subject to the 6-year statute of limitations contained in 31 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 3702(b). 62 Fed. Reg. at 68140 (to be codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 178.104). However, these regulations do not apply to "claims concerning matters that are subject to negotiated grievance procedures under collective bargaining agreements entered into pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)." 62 Fed. Reg. at 68139 (to be codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 178.101(b), "Scope of Subpart").[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Similarly, the Authority consistently held that the 6-year statute of limitations in the pre-amendment version of 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702(b) was not applicable in grievance/arbitration, as it "only applie[d] to claims brought before the Comptroller General. <span class="Italic">See International Association of</span> <span class="Italic">Firefighters, Local 13 and Panama Canal Commission, General</span> <span class="Italic">Services Bureau, Balboa, Republic of Panama</span>, 43 FLRA 1012, 1027-28 (1992), <span class="Italic">citing, Acton v.

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator issued his award in response to a grievance filed by the Union under the negotiated grievance procedure. Claims that are handled under a negotiated grievance procedure fall into the "Claims not Covered" section of the regulations. Since the resolution of this grievance was not subject to the regulations, which settle claims under 31 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 3702, the Arbitrator was not limited by the 6-year statute of limitations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Analysis following the Back Pay Act amendment followed the outside limitation of that statute. An arbitrator properly calculated liability for EDP to extend for a period of six years prior to the grievance and running to the date of the award, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1156 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Inventory Control Point</span>, 57 FLRA 602, 603 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 5596(b)(4) provides, in relevant part, that "in no case may pay, allowances, or differentials be granted under this section for a period <span class="Italic">beginning</span> more than 6 years before the date of the filing of a timely appeal." [2] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(4) (emphasis added). On its face, this provision establishes the earliest date on which a grievant's entitlement to backpay may begin. However, nothing in the plain wording of this provision, or any other provision of the Back Pay Act, establishes when backpay must end. Likewise, relevant legislative history is ambiguous concerning when backpay must end.<span class="Italic"> See </span>H.R. Rep. No. 105-532, at 342 (1998) (stating that &#x00A7; 5596(b)(4) "establishes a standard six-year limit" for backpay awards); H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 105-736, at 725 (1998) (stating that awards of backpay shall not exceed six years). However, the House Report, H.R. Rep. No. 105-532 at 342, refers to similar recovery periods that have been interpreted to permit more than six years' recovery. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., In the Matter of Llewellyn</span> <span class="Italic">Lieber, </span>57 Comp. Gen. 856, 859-60 (1978) (awarding nine years' recovery where six-year statute of limitations was applicable similar to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2401); <span class="Italic">Matter of: Mary J. Kampe and Martha R. Johnson, </span>No. B214,245, 1984 WL 46283, at *2 (Comp.

<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;As relevant here, an appeal is timely when an employee or the employee's representative initiates a grievance under a negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.804 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined that the grievants' entitlement to backpay continued up to the date of the initial award. Consistent with this finding, the Arbitrator awarded backpay beginning six years prior to the filing of the grievance up to the date of the initial award. As the award of backpay is consistent with &#x00A7; 5596(b)(4), we find that the supplemental award is not contrary to the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Cf. VA Puget Sound Health Care System and AFGE Local 3197</span>, 72 FLRA 441 (2021) (Chairman DuBester concurring) (EDP awarded for six years).</p>
<p class="noindent">Agencies argued that rather than a long limitation statutory period, a contract article limiting the time for filing a grievance should govern EDP recovery. Of this argument, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot and AFGE Local 2142</span>, 56 FLRA 1057, 1065-66 (2001), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied on other grounds</span>, 57 FLRA 290, 292 (2001), noted in the context of an EDP dispute:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has specifically distinguished between contractual backpay recovery periods and contractual time periods for filing grievances.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Commerce, Nat'l Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin.</span>, 55 FLRA 816, 822 n.9 (1999). A contractual backpay recovery period specifies a time limit on recovery of backpay for timely filed grievances while a contractual filing period specifies the time limit for filing grievances. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The Arbitrator refused to interpret the contractual time limits for filing grievances as contractual backpay recovery periods. As the Authority defers to an arbitrator's interpretation and application of a collective bargaining agreement, the Agency's reliance on the contractual filing period for grievances is misplaced. The Agency fails to establish that notwithstanding such deference, the contractual filing period for grievances must apply as a matter of law to the backpay recovery period. Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Conversely, should an arbitrator decline to go beyond a contract limitation period and refuse to extend an EDP claim for the six-year period established by 31 USC 3702 for claims against the government with the Comptroller General, the award would not be set aside as contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE</span>, 43 FLRA 207, 212 (1991); <span class="Italic">Naval Avionics Ctr., Indianapolis and AFGE Local 1744</span>, 37 FLRA 406, 408 (1990). The discretion of the arbitrator to interpret the limitation period for EDP was illustrated by FLRA's affirmation of an award setting the initiation of the contractual grievance and recovery period at the date that regulations were implemented in 1993 allowing hazard pay for asbestos exposure, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 933 and VAMC Detroit</span>, 58 FLRA 480, 480-82 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, in 1999, the Union filed a grievance seeking hazardous duty pay (HDP) for asbestos exposure beginning in 1993. The grievance was unresolved and submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator dismissed the grievance, concluding that it was untimely filed. In reaching that conclusion, the Arbitrator applied Article 42 of the parties' agreement, which provides that a grievance must be filed within "thirty (30) calendar days of the date that the employee or union became aware of the act or occurrence or anytime if the act or occurrence is of a continuing nature." The Arbitrator rejected the Union's claim that the grievance was timely because the events giving rise to the grievance were of a continuing nature. The Arbitrator found instead that for the grievance to be timely, it must have been filed within thirty days after June 8, 1993--the date the regulations providing entitlement <span id="page_2229"></span>to HDP became effective. Accordingly, the Arbitrator concluded that the grievance, which was filed in June 1999, was untimely under the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator's determination regarding the timeliness of a grievance under a collective bargaining agreement constitutes a procedural arbitrability determination, which may be found deficient only on grounds that do not challenge the determination itself. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 422, </span>56 FLRA 586, 587 (2000); <span class="Italic">AFGE,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 2921,</span> 50 FLRA 184, 185-86 (1995). The Authority has found that the grounds on which such award may be found deficient include arbitrator bias or a finding that the arbitrator exceeded his/her authority. In addition, the Authority has resolved the merits of contrary to law claims challenging an arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 422,</span> 56 FLRA at 587; <span class="Italic">Nat'l Gallery of Art, Wash., D. C,</span> 48 FLRA 841, 845 (1993); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army, Aviation Ctr., Fort Rucker, Ala., </span>39 FLRA 1113, 1115 (1991). This is consistent with the fact that statutory, procedural requirements may be established that apply to negotiated grievance procedures and recognizes that a statute could be enacted establishing a filing period for grievances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's claims that the award is inconsistent with Authority precedent, as well as the Back Pay Act and the Barring Act, raise a question of law, which we review <span class="Italic">de novo. See NTEU, Chapter 24,</span> 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv. v. FLRA,</span> 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local</span> <span class="Italic">1437, </span>53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to Authority precedent, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Allen Park, </span>34 FLRA at 1103, is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Allen Park, </span>the Authority held that an award providing an eight-year back pay recovery period for asbestos exposure was consistent with the Back Pay Act, and that the arbitrator was not required to limit the period for which back pay could be recovered (the recovery period) to the period during which a grievance must be filed under the parties' agreement (the filing period). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Contrary to the Union's assertion, <span class="Italic">Allen Park </span>does not provide that the filing period for grievances involving asbestos exposure is governed by the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Union's claim that the award is inconsistent with the Back Pay Act is without merit. The Back Pay Act provides, in relevant part, that back pay may not be granted under the Act "for a period beginning more than 6 years before the date of the filing of a timely appeal." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(4). On its face, this provision establishes the earliest date from which an award of back pay may commence. <span class="Italic">See </span>H.R. Rep. No. 105-532, at 342 (1998) (stating that &#x00A7; 5596(b)(4) limits the "amount of redress available" for back pay awards); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, Local 1156, </span>57 FLRA 602, 603 (2001). However, the Back Pay Act does not, implicitly or explicitly, establish a filing period for negotiated grievance procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Barring Act does not apply here, as its implementing regulations explicitly provide that the Act does not apply to "claims concerning matters that are subject to negotiated grievance procedures under collective bargaining agreements entered into pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 178.101(b); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Underseas Warfare Ctr. Div., Keyport, Wash., </span>54 FLRA 3, 6-7 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the award is not contrary to law, and deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">An EDP award may not extend prior to the effective date of the OPM authorization for the EDP category, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 50 FLRA 21, 23-24 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal government is subject to monetary liability only to the extent it has waived its sovereign immunity and specifically authorized such liability.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, for example</span>, <span class="Italic">United States v.

<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the statutory basis for EDP claims is 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343(c)(4) (1988) (originally enacted as Pub. L. No. 92-392, &#x00A7; 1(a), 86 Stat. 564, 566 (1972)), which directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide, by regulation, "proper differentials...for duty involving unusually severe working conditions or unusually severe hazards[.]" In establishing those regulations, OPM promulgated FPM Supplement 532-1, which states, in pertinent part, that "[a]n agency shall pay the environmental differential in [A]ppendix J to a wage [grade] employee...when the employee is performing assigned duties which expose him/her to an unusually severe hazard, physical hardship, or working condition listed in [A]ppendix J, <span class="Italic">on or after the</span> <span class="Italic">effective date specified."</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Supplement 532-1, subchapter S8-7f.(1) (emphasis added). The effective date specified in Appendix J for the poison/toxic chemical category is November 1, 1970.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of this regulation, November 1, 1970, is the earliest date on which EDP could be paid for exposure to hazardous metal dust under the poison/toxic chemical category of FPM Supp. 532-1, Appendix J. In this connection, there is nothing in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343(c)(4) or the FPM Supplement 532-1, Appendix J, which expressly authorizes the payment of EDP for exposure to hazardous metal dust prior to November 1, 1970. Moreover, we are aware of no other express authorization for the Arbitrator's award to extend to earlier exposure, and none has been cited to us.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that, as there is no statutory or regulatory authorization for the payment of EDP for exposure to hazardous metal dust prior to November 1, 1970, any award of EDP prior to that date is deficient. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Glenview Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1641</span>, 48 FLRA 1420, 1429-31 (1994); <span class="Italic">Bevelheimer v. United States</span>, 4 Cl. Ct. 558, 560 n.1 (1984). Accordingly, we hereby modify the portion of the award directing payment of EDP prior to November 1, 1970 as indicated below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Statutory authorization for certain hazard payments to prevailing rate employees was tied to OSHA standards in 2003 under 5 USC 5343:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;The Office of Personnel Management, by regulation, shall prescribe practices and procedures for conducting wage surveys, analyzing wage survey data, developing and establishing wage schedules and rates, and administering the prevailing rate system. The regulations shall provide--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;for proper differentials, as determined by the Office, for duty involving unusually severe working conditions or unusually severe hazards, and for any hardship or hazard related to asbestos, such differentials shall be determined by applying occupational safety and health standards consistent with the permissible exposure limit promulgated by the Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970;</p>
<p class="noindent">That OSHA standards are not shown to be exceeded does not appear to block an EDP award if protective measures at the agency do not practically eliminate the potential for injury within the meaning of OPM regulations, <span class="Italic">VA Central Arkansas Healthcare System and AFGE Local 2054</span>, 71 FLRA 593, 595 (2020):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343(c)(4) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 532.511 because the Arbitrator found that the protective equipment and training that the Agency provided did not practically eliminate the potential for injury. In particular, the Agency claims that the training and protective equipment met the standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and, therefore, meet the standard of <span class="Italic">practically</span> eliminating the threat of high-degree exposure under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 532.511. The Agency also argues that the backpay award is "disproportionate to the violation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the Agency fails to demonstrate how the protective equipment and training met OSHA standards.[25] Rather, the Arbitrator found that the grievants' training, protective equipment, and position descriptions are deficient. In particular, several grievants testified that they are frequently exposed to needles and other sharp objects. Furthermore, the Agency has failed to successfully challenge any of the Arbitrator's factual findings as nonfacts. The Agency's contrary-to-law exception merely challenges the weight that the Arbitrator ascribed to evidence and testimony.[29] Additionally, even if the Agency's training and protective equipment met OSHA standards, the Agency fails to demonstrate that this would render the award contrary to law. That is, the Agency fails to prove that compliance with OSHA requirements would show that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the training and equipment nevertheless failed to "practically eliminate" the potential for injury within the meaning of the regulations.[30] Consequently, we uphold the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant are owed high-degree environmental-differential pay.</p>

<p class="noindent">Before 2003, there were quite a few arbitration decisions coming to various results as to what level of exposure to asbestos qualified for an award of EDP. In the National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2004, Pub. L. 108-136 (Nov. 24, 2003), Congress legislated to set OSHA limits as the threshold for EDP for asbestos exposure. Section 1122 of the 2003 statute provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 1122. COMMON OCCUPATIONAL AND HEALTH STANDARDS FOR DIFFERENTIAL PAYMENTS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS. (a) PREVAILING RATE SYSTEMS.--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 5343(c)(4) of title 5, United States Code, is amended by inserting before the semicolon at the end the following: "and for any hardship or hazard related to asbestos, such differentials shall be determined by applying occupational safety and health standards consistent with the permissible exposure limit promulgated by the Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;GENERAL SCHEDULE PAY RATES.--Section 5545(d) of such title is amended by inserting before the period at the end of the first sentence the following: ", and for any hardship or hazard related to asbestos, such differentials shall be determined by applying occupational safety and health standards consistent with the permissible exposure limit promulgated by the Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;APPLICABILITY.--Subject to any vested constitutional property rights, any administrative or judicial determination after the date of the enactment of this Act concerning backpay for a differential established under sections 5343(c)(4) or 5545(d) of such title shall be based on occupational safety and health standards described in the amendments made by subsections (a) and (b).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Adair v. United States</span>, 497 F.3d 1244, 1254 (Fed. Cir. 2007), was a Tucker Act suit seeking recovery for exposure to environmental tobacco smoke:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, too, Congress' amendment of the statute in 2003 to cover an employee's exposure to asbestos, which Adair contends is comparable to ETS [Environmental Tobacco Smoke]. <span class="Italic">See </span>National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, P.L. 108-136, &#x00A7; 1122 (2003). Even then, Congress did not mandate additional compensation for all levels of exposure to asbestos, only for those levels that were above the threshold set by the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA").[4] However, in the 2003 Amendment, Congress did not mandate additional compensation for ETS.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The current threshold or permissible exposure limit is 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air as an eight (8)-hour time-weighted average. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1910.1001(c). We observe that even OSHA does not provide for coverage of ETS.</p>
<p class="noindent">The 2003 statute was considered as to an arbitrator's award in <span class="Italic">Bremerton MTC and Dept. of Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</span>, 64 FLRA 103 (2009) (reconsideration denied as to argument concerning retroactivity, 64 FLRA 543 (2010). The cases that follow were not limited by that legislation.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA decisions predating the statutory change accorded considerable discretion to arbitrators to set the levels of exposure triggering EDP entitlements. EDP for asbestos exposure was considered in <span class="Italic">Allen Park VAMC and AFGE Local 933</span>, 28 FLRA 1166, 1168-70 (1987). FLRA decided that before an arbitrator awards EDP for asbestos exposure, three specific factual findings must be made in a "fully articulated, reasoned decision" that: persons are working in an area where airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers expose employees to potential illness or injury; a threshold quantitative level of exposure, set through local determination, has been met or exceeded; and protective devices or safety measures have not practically eliminated the potential for personal illness or injury. FLRA did not state how the threshold level of exposure would be determined without some local agreement or practice. After remand, FLRA found the resulting award of EDP met legal requirements. <span class="Italic">Allen Park VAMC and AFGE Local 933</span>, 34 FLRA 1091, 1101 (1990), noted that the resulting award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[C]omplies with the Authority's instructions to provide a fully reasoned decision on the application of the requirements of [FPM Supp. 532-1] Appendix J. The Arbitrator stated in a fully articulated opinion and award that he was convinced by the evidence presented that there is a potential for asbestos-related disease to occur at any level of exposure and that there is no safe threshold level of exposure. In the absence of a mandated quantitative level set by applicable law or regulation or otherwise agreed to by the parties, that finding constitutes an appropriate determination of quantitative levels for purposes of entitlement to EDP under Appendix J.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that asbestos was present at the Activity, that the grievants had been exposed to amounts of airborne asbestos which would expose them to potential illness, and that protective devices and safety measures had not practically eliminated the potential for illness or injury. These findings have not been shown to violate law or applicable regulation. Accordingly, the Agency's exceptions present no basis for finding the award deficient or for modifying the award.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Allen Park</span> was explained, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2250 and VAMC Muskogee</span>, 52 FLRA 320, 323 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, as there is no evidence that the parties negotiated such a standard, the Arbitrator did not err in applying the OSHA standard. In this regard, the Union misinterprets the Authority's findings in <span class="Italic">Allen Park. Allen</span> <span class="Italic">Park</span> does not stand for the proposition that unless a threshold level of exposure to airborne asbestos is negotiated between the parties, a quantitative level of exposure cannot be applied. Rather, in <span class="Italic">Allen Park</span>, the Authority held that in the absence of a mandated quantitative level set by applicable law or regulation or otherwise agreed to by the parties, the arbitrator has the authority to determine the threshold quantitative level of exposure for the payment of EDP. Moreover, the standard applied in <span class="Italic">Allen Park</span>--that there is no permissible asbestos exposure level for the payment of EDP--was determined by the arbitrator based on the facts presented.</p>
<p class="noindent">Concerning the threshold level of exposure necessary to obtain EDP for asbestos contamination, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI El Reno and AFGE Local 171</span>, 37 FLRA 559, 563 (1990), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 38 FLRA 541 (1990), determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Category 16 of Appendix J conditions the payment of EDP on findings that: (1) employees are working in areas where airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers may expose them to potential illness or injury; and (2) protective devices or safety measures have not practically eliminated the potential for such personal illness or injury....&#8197;The specific work situations for which an environmental differential is payable under the categories of FPM Supplement 532-1, Appendix J, are left to local determination, including arbitration....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the latter point, the Agency has adopted, by regulation, an exposure level of 0.2 f/cc. as its "permissible exposure limit" and a level of 0.1 f/cc. as its "action level." Although the exposure levels discussed in the Agency's regulations require certain actions, including the designation of "regulated areas," and the requirement that employees wear respirators and protective clothing, nowhere in the regulations is exposure at either level linked to the payment of EDP....&#8197;There is, therefore, no basis on which to conclude that, pursuant to the Agency's regulations, EDP may not be paid to employees unless their exposure to airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers exceeds 0.2 f/cc.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Government-wide regulations applicable here, Appendix J, conditions the payment of EDP on a finding of "potential illness or injury." Nothing in the record of this case supports a conclusion that there is a potential for illness or injury only if the level of exposure exceeds 0.2 f/cc. Accordingly, as parties are free to determine through negotiations and arbitration the situations in which EDP is payable under Appendix J, we reject the Agency's assertions that in order to award EDP, the Arbitrator was required by law to find that the grievants' exposure to airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers exceeded 0.2 f/cc....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">FCI El Reno</span> was returned by FLRA to the parties to remand to the arbitrator for a clearer statement of whether asbestos level concentrations at the worksite were hazardous, whether the hazard was abated by protective measures, and for other determinations necessary to evaluate the reasoning leading to his award.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2280 and VAMC Iron Mountain</span>, 51 FLRA 620, 624 (1995), reemphasized that (at least before 2003) the parties set the level of asbestos exposure necessary to trigger EDP entitlement through their agreement or through grievance resolution with the assistance of an arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]hen the parties submit a dispute to arbitration involving exposure to asbestos, the arbitrator has the authority to resolve a dispute over what quantitative level of exposure to airborne concentrations of asbestos exposes employees to potential illness and injury and how that level is derived or calculated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator erred by applying the OSHA standard.&#x2003;Rather, the Union misinterprets the Authority's findings in <span class="Italic">Allen Park</span> and <span class="Italic">VA</span> <span class="Italic">Medical Center, Huntington, WV</span>. Those cases did not establish a specific standard on the level of asbestos exposure for the payment of EDP applicable to all Federal facilities. The standard applied in those cases--that there is no permissible asbestos exposure level for the payment of EDP--was determined by the arbitrators in those cases based on the facts presented. There is nothing in those cases or this case that requires the Arbitrator to apply that standard in the instant case. Moreover, arbitration awards are not precedential, and, therefore, a contention that an award conflicts with other arbitration awards provides no basis for finding an award deficient. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 28, Lewis Engineers and Scientists Association and National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio</span>, 50 FLRA 533, 536-37 (1995); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1273 and U.S. Department <span id="page_2231"></span>of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Boise, Idaho</span>, 44 FLRA 707, 712 (1992). Consequently, the Union's contention that the Arbitrator's adoption of the OSHA standard is contrary to Authority precedent provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">Through 2003, FLRA had long permitted an EDP award to be made for asbestos exposure even though concentrations were not demonstrated to be in excess of OSHA levels, <span class="Italic">GSA, Kansas City and AFGE Council 236</span>, 38 FLRA 438, 445-46 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]here is no requirement in Appendix J which conditions the payment of EDP for exposure to asbestos on OSHA standards....&#8197;[T]he specific work situations for payment of EDP under Appendix J are matters for local determination....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not find, and the record does not otherwise show, that the OSHA standard had been adopted by the parties as the threshold quantitative level for payment of EDP under Appendix J. Rather, the Arbitrator, acting within his authority to make such a determination, found that the conditions set forth in Appendix J were met in the case of maintenance employees because, based on the record, maintenance workers who work in the vicinity of bulk asbestos are subject to unpredictable, episodic exposures to asbestos fibers in amounts "which may potentially expose [them] to a hazard for which safety devices and safety measures have not practically eliminated the hazard."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Government-wide regulation applicable here, Appendix J, conditions the payment of EDP on a finding of "potential illness or injury." Nothing in the record of this case supports a conclusion that there is a potential for illness or injury only if the level of exposure exceeds 0.1 or 0.2 f/cc. Accordingly [the] parties are free to determine through negotiations and arbitration the situations in which EDP is payable under Appendix J....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1273 and VAMC, Boise</span>, 44 FLRA 707, 712 (1992), also concluded that, when the parties submit to arbitration a disputed local work situation involving asbestos exposure, the arbitrator is free to determine what quantitative level of exposure creates potential illness and injury, and the arbitrator may determine how that level is derived or calculated. In that case FLRA declined to set aside the award because it did not follow the "precedent" of other arbitrators' awards. When the arbitrator has the discretion to set the level of exposure to asbestos triggering EDP entitlement, his finding that there is no safe level of exposure is tantamount to the establishment of a quantitative standard and constitutes an appropriate determination of quantitative levels for purposes of EDP entitlement. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Huntington and AFGE Local 2344</span>, 46 FLRA 1160, 1166 (1993); <span class="Italic">see VAMC, Ann Arbor and AFGE Local 2092</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v56/56-026.html">56 FLRA 216</a>, 222 (2000) ("an arbitrator's finding that any exposure to asbestos puts employees at risk of illness or injury within the meaning of the regulation serves to identify the quantitative threshold as anything greater than zero"); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1482 and Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow</span>, 50 FLRA 572, 574 (1995) ("The Union has failed to show that the Arbitrator erred by applying the OSHA standard. Appendix A, which is substantively identical to former Appendix J, does not set forth any specified level of exposure required for the payment of EDP.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In arbitration of an asbestos EDP dispute, the agency's determination concerning exposure or entitlement was not entitled to deference over an arbitrator's determination, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot and AFGE Local 2142</span>, 56 FLRA 1057, 1066 (2001), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied on other grounds</span>, 57 FLRA 290, 292 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that its decision to deny EDP should be granted deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Chevron</span>). The Agency notes that Congress delegated to OPM the authority to establish environmental differentials. The Agency asserts that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 532.511, OPM has deferred to local agencies by delegating to each installation the determination of whether any local work situations are covered by any of the defined categories. Consequently, the Agency argues that it has the sole authority to decide whether a local work situation warrants payment of EDP. In addition, the Agency asserts that OPM policy in reviewing an agency's determination of whether a local work situation warrants payment of an environmental differential is to apply OSHA standards. The Agency claims that because this is the policy of OPM, the Arbitrator was required to grant <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference to the Agency's denial of EDP on the basis of OSHA standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, the Supreme Court addressed a challenge to certain regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency implementing the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977. The Court held that in deciding cases involving the interpretation of an unclear statutory term, a court must decide whether the responsible agency's regulation "is based on a permissible construction of the statute." 467 U.S. at 843. The Court further held that "[s]uch legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 844 (footnote omitted). We find that the Agency's attempt to cloak itself in <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference is unavailing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, deference is granted to the agency to which Congress has delegated administration of a congressionally created program. Consequently, <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference is due OPM, not the Agency. It is OPM that Congress has charged with the establishment of a wage system that provides for environmental differentials. The requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 532.511 for local installations to evaluate its local work situations is not a delegation implicated by <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>. This exception does not concern the validity of OPM's regulations, but, rather, the Agency's application of those regulations. As the Authority has specifically held, such applications are not entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Washington, D.C.</span>, 46 FLRA 1063, 1071 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference inapplicable to a grievance over whether an agency properly applied OPM regulations), <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health and Human Services, Social Sec. Admin., Baltimore, Md.</span>, 44 FLRA 773, 796-97 (1992) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on an OPM decision letter is also misplaced. As the letter states, OPM will not serve as an appellate source when a claim is subject to a negotiated grievance procedure. Consequently, by its own terms, the letter cannot support a mandated application of OSHA standards in an arbitration under a negotiated grievance procedure of an EDP grievance. This is consistent with the uniform approach of OPM and its predecessor agency the Civil Service Commission to the resolution of grievances over whether a local work situation warrants the payment of an environmental differential. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Army, Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot, Lexington, Ky</span>., 43 FLRA 1074, 1083 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot</span>). OPM has consistently refrained from acting as an appellate source in disputes between agencies and their employees in specific cases because this matter has been left to the agencies and collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1083-84.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before 2003, although nothing required them to do so, the parties were free to employ in their contract the OSHA standard governing asbestos contamination. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2004 and DLA</span>, 55 FLRA 6, 9-10 (1998) (parties agreed to use OSHA standards). An arbitrator may determine whether local conditions satisfy an EDP standard if OPM guidance leaves room for interpretation of the application of the standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1622 and DOD, AAFES</span>, 67 FLRA 186, 189 (2014) (cold work).</p>
<p class="noindent">Before 2003, if the contract did not set a standard for asbestos exposure and EDP, an agency regulation could do so, and it would then be honored as the basis for adjudicating a grievance seeking EDP. The significance of an agency regulation was explained in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1617 and Dept. of Air Force, Kelly AFB</span>, 58 FLRA 63, 66-68 (2002), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 58 FLRA 183 (2002):</p>

<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The standard for entitlement to EDP for exposure to asbestos can be prescribed by an agency regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Authority has had many EDP cases, it has not previously been presented with a case where an agency had prescribed the standard for entitlement to EDP by an agency regulation; an arbitrator did not apply the standard prescribed by the regulation in resolving a grievance over EDP; and the agency filed an exception to that award alleging that the award was deficient because it conflicted with the regulation. The first question raised by the Arbitrator's award and the Agency's exception is whether the standard for entitlement to EDP can be prescribed by an agency regulation. We conclude that it can be.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has repeatedly and uniformly described the framework for determining entitlement to EDP for exposure to asbestos, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Appendix A, which is identical to former Appendix J, does not set forth any specified level of exposure required for the payment of EDP. Accordingly, as was the case under Appendix J, the specific work situations for which EDP is payable are left to "local determination, including arbitration."</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We find no basis for not interpreting the reference to "regulation" to include an agency regulation.

Campbell</span>, 37 FLRA at 193-94. Moreover, the Authority has indicated in two asbestos <span id="page_2232"></span>cases that an agency regulation would have been viewed as permissibly prescribing the standard for entitlement to EDP if the regulation had been sufficiently linked to the payment of EDP. <span class="Italic">See United States Gen.

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, contrary to the Union's arguments, Authority precedent and the court's decision in <span class="Italic">O'Neall</span> support the conclusion that an agency can prescribe by regulation the standard for entitlement to EDP for exposure to asbestos.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The AFLC/AFMC Supplements sufficiently link exposure at the OSHA PEL to the payment of EDP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A critical question raised by the Authority precedent discussed above is whether the AFLC/AFMC Supplements sufficiently link exposure at the OSHA PEL to the payment of EDP. We conclude that they do.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both <span class="Italic">GSA and FCI, El Reno </span>indicate that a critical question in determining whether an agency regulation governs entitlement to EDP is whether the regulation is sufficiently linked to the payment of EDP. In this case, there is no dispute that the AFLC/AFMC Supplements provide that employees must be exposed to asbestos at, or in excess of, the level of the OSHA PEL in order to be entitled to EDP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency clearly asserts that the Supplements set the level of exposure for EDP and notes that the Authority defers to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations. In addition, the Arbitrator also viewed the Supplements as setting the level of exposure for EDP. The Arbitrator specifically found that the Supplements provide that the OSHA PEL is the standard for entitlement to EDP for exposure to asbestos. Moreover, although the Union disputes that the Supplements govern the standard for EDP, the Union does not dispute that the Supplements link exposure at the OSHA PEL to the payment of EDP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has repeatedly held that "[a]n agency's interpretation of its own regulation generally is controlling unless clearly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation's plain wording." <span class="Italic">E.g., United States</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of Transportation, Fed. Aviation Admin.,</span> 55 FLRA 797, 801 (1999) <span class="Italic">(FAA). </span>We find that the Agency's interpretation of the Supplements is controlling because it is neither clearly erroneous nor inconsistent with the plain wording of the Supplements. Accordingly, we conclude that the AFLC/AFMC Supplements specifically link the payment of EDP to exposure at, or in excess of, the OSHA PEL.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;The use of the OSHA PEL is appropriate as a standard for entitlement to EDP for exposure to asbestos.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A question raised by the Union's opposition is whether use of the OSHA PEL as a standard for entitlement to EDP is appropriate. We conclude that it is.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In disputing that the Supplements govern the standard for EDP, the Union argues that there are "practical and compelling safety reasons for not tying EDP to the OSHA PEL." The Union maintains that OSHA's actual determinations preclude the Agency's position that "only exposure above the PEL entails risk to employees of potential asbestos illness or injury." The Union's arguments are similar to arguments made by the employees in <span class="Italic">O'Neall </span>and rejected by the court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court in <span class="Italic">O'Neall </span>was not persuaded of any material differences in the OSHA and EDP regulatory schemes which made it improper to look to OSHA for guidance in setting a standard for the level of exposure to asbestos in order to be entitled to EDP. In particular, the court rejected the argument that use of the OSHA PEL was inconsistent with the mandate of FPM Supplement 532-1 to compensate for working conditions involving unusually severe hazards. <span class="Italic">See O'Neall, </span>797 F.2d at 1582.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, although the Authority has never been presented with a case just like this one, the Authority has been presented with several cases in which the arbitrator applied the OSHA PEL to determine entitlement to EDP. In none of these cases did the Authority question whether the OSHA PEL was appropriate for use as an EDP standard. <span class="Italic">See NAGE Local </span>R4-78, 56 FLRA 418 (2000); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2004, </span>55 FLRA 6 (1998); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2250, </span>52 FLRA 320 (1996); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local</span> <span class="Italic">2144, </span>51 FLRA 834 (1996); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2280,</span> 51 FLRA 620 (1995); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1482, </span>50 FLRA 572.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;The AFLC/AFMC Supplements do not conflict with the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency rules and regulations "govern the disposition of matters to which they apply...when the rules and regulations do not conflict with provisions of an applicable collective bargaining agreement." <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell, </span>37 FLRA at 195. The AFLC/AFMC Supplements clearly apply to the disputed matter of the standard for entitlement to EDP for exposure to asbestos by providing that the standard is the OSHA PEL. On the basis of the Arbitrator's interpretation of the agreement, we find that the Supplements do not conflict with provisions of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that the Supplements set the standard for entitlement to EDP for exposure to asbestos at the OSHA PEL does not conflict with the contractual obligation under Article 26 to pay EDP in accordance with law, Government-wide regulation, and the collective bargaining agreement, none of which prescribes a standard for the payment of EDP for exposure to asbestos. As the Arbitrator expressly ruled, "there is no specific standard for entitlement to EDP set forth in the contract," and the parties had not "agree[d] to a specific standard for entitlement to EDP."...&#8197;Therefore, the Arbitrator interpreted the parties' agreement as not setting forth a specific standard for entitlement to EDP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where, as here, an agreement does not set a specific standard and an applicable agency regulation does set a specific standard, the agreement does not conflict with the agency regulation and the agency regulation governs the matter in dispute. <span class="Italic">See NAGE Local R12-33,</span> 51 FLRA 541, 543 (1995) (an agency regulation governed the matter in dispute because it provided the "dispositive criteria" for determining eligibility, while the agreement did not); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army,</span> <span class="Italic">Army Communications-Electronics Command, Ctr. for</span> <span class="Italic">Command, Control and Communications Sys., Fort</span> <span class="Italic">Monmouth, N.J., </span>46 FLRA 555, 558 n.4 (1992) (an agency regulation governed the matter in dispute because the collective bargaining agreement did "not substantively address" the matter in dispute); <span class="Italic">United</span> <span class="Italic">States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Regional Office, Chicago, Ill., </span>38 FLRA 356, 358 (1990) (<span class="Italic">VA Chicago</span>) (an agency regulation that permitted the agency's actions governed the matter in dispute because the collective bargaining agreement was "silent" on the matter). Accordingly, we find that the Supplements do not conflict with the agreement, as interpreted by the Arbitrator, and that they govern the matter in dispute as to what standard applies in this case to EDP for exposure to asbestos.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-78 and VAMC Martinsburg</span>, 56 FLRA 418, 420 (2000) (contract adopted agency standard; agency standard was OSHA standard; although arbitrator had discretion to use different standard, award was not improper when he did not).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA affirmed an award that interpreted EDP entitlement for asbestos exposure in accordance with OSHA standards, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2635 and Dept. of Navy, Computer Telecommunications Station</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v56/56-011.html">56 FLRA 114</a>, 116 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the Agency "adopted" the OSHA standard because, according to the Union, pertinent regulatory wording--requiring payment where asbestos "may expose employees to potential illness"--deems all asbestos to be hazardous. Exceptions at 3-4 (quoting 5 C.F.R. Part 532.511, Appendix A). However, the regulation cited by the Union "does not set forth any specified level of exposure required for the payment of EDP." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2004 and U.S. Department of Defense,</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Distribution Region</span> <span class="Italic">East, New Cumberland, Pennsylvania, </span>55 FLRA 6, 10 (1998). As such, the Authority has consistently held that parties are free to negotiate, or determine through arbitration, the quantitative level of asbestos exposure to be used for employee entitlement to EDP. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Red River Army Depot,</span> <span class="Italic">Texarkana, Texas and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3961, </span>53 FLRA 46, 51 (1997); <span class="Italic">VAMC</span>, 51 FLRA at 623-24. <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Army, Red River Army Depot, Texarkana, Texas</span> <span class="Italic">and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 53 FLRA 46, 51 (1997) (exceptions denied to award where arbitrator determined that any level of exposure to asbestos satisfied the threshold quantitative level); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">2250 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical</span> <span class="Italic">Center, Muskogee, Oklahoma, </span>52 FLRA 320, 321, 323 (1996) (exceptions denied to award where arbitrator determined that exposure to asbestos in excess of 0.1 fibers/cc satisfied the threshold quantitative level).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with this precedent, the Arbitrator had the authority, absent the parties' agreement on a level of exposure, to determine the level of exposure for which EDP is payable. The Arbitrator determined, in this connection, that the Agency had both "adopted" and applied the OSHA standard. The Arbitrator recognized that other arbitrators have rejected OSHA standards in decisions where unions have supplied medical evidence to support their position, but found that the Union in this case did not offer any medical evidence to warrant deviating from the OSHA standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other than its assertion that Appendix A to Part 532 does not specify a minimum exposure level, the Union has not alleged that the parties agreed to such a level. As such, we find that the Union has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See Dept. of Army, Red River Army Depot and AFGE Local 3961</span>, 53 FLRA 46, <span id="page_2233"></span>52 (1997) (noting sections of award specifying safety problems leading to arbitrator's conclusion that agency did not practically eliminate risk for potential illness or injury in asbestos-exposure EDP grievance); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2924 and Dept. of Air Force, Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson</span>, 50 FLRA 275, 278 (1995) (briefly discussing EDP standard of "practical elimination" of an asbestos hazard).</p>
<p class="noindent">EDP for exposure to toxic chemicals was reviewed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Navy Pub. Works Ctr., San Diego and NAGE Local R12-35</span>, 49 FLRA 553, 559-61 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...FPM Supplement 532-1, Appendix J is a Government-wide regulation that lists categories of situations, such as exposure to toxic chemicals, that warrant the payment of EDP....&#8197;In order to justify EDP, all the pertinent regulatory requirements must be met....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator correctly observed, the category pertaining to exposure to toxic chemicals is divided into high degree and low degree hazards. Under the category governing exposure to a low degree hazard, the payment of EDP is conditioned on findings that: (1) employees work with or in close proximity to toxic chemicals that involve the potential for personal injury; and (2) protective devices and/or safety measures have not practically eliminated the potential for personal injury. FPM Supplement 532-1, Appendix J, Part II, Category 5. Both of these requirements must be satisfied to establish an entitlement to EDP. In this case, the Arbitrator applied the standards and concluded, based on the evidence before him, that the Union failed to prove that protective devices and/or safety measures had not practically eliminated the potential for personal injury.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union excepts to the award on the ground that the Arbitrator incorrectly interpreted the regulations.&#x2003;More specifically, the Union maintains that under the regulation governing payment of a low degree hazard differential, "any potential for personal injury" establishes an entitlement to EDP. As set forth above, however, in addition to a finding that the grievants worked with toxic chemicals that involved the potential for personal injury, it must be demonstrated that the potential for personal injury had not been practically eliminated by the use of protective devices or safety measures. The Union's interpretation of the regulation ignores the second requirement of the standard. Accordingly, we conclude that this contention must be rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Union's assertion that the Arbitrator incorrectly interpreted the regulations when he stated that "a serious injury must occur" for an employee to receive EDP. To the extent the Union is contending that the Arbitrator applied the wrong standard, we note that the Arbitrator specifically found that the instant grievance was governed by the regulations concerning a low degree hazard and accordingly "turn[ed] on whether protective devices or safety measures ha[d] practically eliminated the potential for personal injury." As this finding clearly reflects, the Arbitrator did not analyze the grievance under the regulations governing payment of EDP based on exposure to a high degree hazard but, rather, analyzed the grievance under regulations governing exposure to a low degree hazard. Accordingly, the Union fails to establish that the award is deficient in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent the Union is arguing that the injuries involved in the instant grievance were sufficiently serious to warrant the payment of EDP under the regulations concerning low degree hazards, we find no merit to the Union's contention. The Arbitrator found that few injuries were sustained and that each of the injuries was relatively minor. Therefore, the Arbitrator concluded that the Union failed to prove an entitlement to EDP. In our view, the Union's contention constitutes disagreement with the Arbitrator's findings of fact and conclusions. As such, this contention provides no basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Langley Air Force Base</span>, 41 FLRA at 249. In this regard, the Union has not established that the Arbitrator erroneously relied on <span class="Italic">Bendure</span> [<span class="Italic">v. United States</span>, 695 F.2d 1383 (Fed. Cir. 1982)] for the proposition that headaches and rashes do not constitute "unusually severe hazards."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the Union's claims that the award is deficient because the Arbitrator placed undue emphasis on the term "practically." According to the Union, an injury need not occur to establish an entitlement to EDP, and an employee is entitled to receive EDP where protective devices fail. The Union argues that because the grievants' work involves the potential for personal injury that cannot be eliminated through the use of protective devices or safety measures, the Arbitrator wrongly denied the grievance. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Arbitrator found, based on the evidence before him, that "the protective devices and safety measures required and provided by the [A]gency [were] consistent with the risks encountered by hazardous waste workers at the workplace," and, therefore, that the Agency had practically eliminated the potential for personal injury. Second, the Arbitrator observed that the statutory and regulatory requirements authorizing EDP "suggest that any 'potential' sought to be eliminated is not absolute." According to the Arbitrator, the conditional nature of the language contained in the regulations, as well as the high standard contained in the statute "indicates that some exposure and even some minor and occasional injuries are allowable" without establishing an entitlement to EDP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Union has failed to demonstrate that the award conflicts with the regulatory requirements. Instead, the Union's exception constitutes mere disagreement with the Arbitrator's findings of fact and conclusions based thereon. Consequently, this contention does not establish that the award is deficient....</p>
<p class="noindent">A decision involving a claim for EDP based on exposure to low degree explosives and incendiary devices emphasized that the parties may negotiate a standard defining when the hazard has been "practically eliminated," but the arbitrator could fashion her own standard if there is no negotiated standard, <span class="Italic">DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Texas NG</span>, 51 FLRA 1688, 1690-91 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To justify the payment of EDP, an arbitrator's award must meet all pertinent regulatory requirements. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R7-36 and U.S. Department of the Army, Savanna Army Depot Activity, Savanna, Illinois</span>, 51 FLRA 720, 723 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Savanna Army Depot Activity</span>). According to the FPM Supplement, employees exposed to low degree hazards must prove that: (1) they work with or in close proximity to explosives and incendiary devices which involve potential for personal injury; and (2) protective devices and/or safety measures have not practically eliminated the potential for such injury. FPM Supplement 532-1, Appendix J. In this case, the Union argues that the Arbitrator's definition of "practically eliminated" is erroneous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that the specific work situations for which EDP is payable under the FPM Supplement are left to local determination, including arbitration. <span class="Italic">E.g., Savanna Army Depot Activity</span>, 51 FLRA at 723. Of course, in making local determinations regarding the specific work situations for which EDP is payable, the parties could negotiate, consistent with law and regulation, a standard defining the term "practically eliminated" that would be used in assessing employee entitlement to EDP. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2144 and U.S. Department of the Air Force</span>, 51 FLRA 834, 838 (1996) (in making local determinations regarding the specific work situations for which EDP is payable for exposure to asbestos, the parties could negotiate, consistent with law and regulation, the quantitative level of asbestos exposure that would be used in assessing employee entitlement to EDP). Absent local determination, the term "practically eliminated" does not require total elimination of a potential for injury. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2924 and U.S. Department of the Air Force, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona</span>, 50 FLRA 275, 277-78 (1995). As there is no evidence in this case that the parties negotiated a standard, the Arbitrator correctly found that in order for a potential for injury to be practically eliminated, "total elimination of the hazard is not required, nor expected." The Union has not demonstrated that the award conflicts with regulatory requirements.[3] <span class="Italic">E.g., Savanna</span> <span class="Italic">Army Depot Activity</span>, 51 FLRA at 724.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Because the same standards and legal requirements previously contained in the FPM continue to be codified in the C.F.R., the conclusion we reach would be the same whether or not we applied the now-expired FPM Supplement. Consequently, we need not address the question of whether the abolition of the FPM would affect the outcome of this case, and whether that abolition should be retroactively applied. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 51 FLRA 310, 316 n.7 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reemphasized that an arbitrator was to determine whether the local situation met the criteria established by the former FPM Supplement governing EDP awards. The arbitrator was not to consider the FPM categories in the abstract, lest his award be vacated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot and IAM Lodge 859</span>, 43 FLRA 1074, 1082 (1992). Nevertheless, an arbitrator could award EDP only if the employee met the requirements of FPM Supp. 532-1, Appendix J. If the employee did not meet those conditions, EDP could not be awarded because other employees, similarly situated, were improperly receiving EDP. The EDP could be awarded because of conditions described in the FPM, not as a matter of equity. <span class="Italic">Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Bremerton Metal Trades Council</span>, 33 FLRA 56, 59 (1988) (relying on <span class="Italic">Griffiss AFB and AFGE Local 2612</span>, 15 FLRA 213 (1984)). An arbitrator could apply provisions of the parties' contract to determine whether the conditions established by the FPM were met. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, New Cumberland Army Depot and AFGE Local 2004</span>, 40 FLRA 186, 192 (1991), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 40 FLRA 1032 (1991). If the late FPM specified that more than one condition be present to justify an award of EDP for a particular category of hazard, an arbitrator was to determine that those conditions have been met before the differential could be awarded. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, McAlester Army Ammunition Plant and AFGE Local 2815</span>, 36 FLRA 434, 439 (1990) (EDP for exposure to explosives).</p>
<p class="noindent">The issues of whether various employees claiming EDP are in units other than the unit represented by the union, and whether retirees have timely filed grievances claiming EDP, are procedural arbitrability determinations under the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2635 and Dept. of Navy, Computer Telecommunications Station, </span><a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v56/56-011.html">56 FLRA 114</a>, 115 (2000). On another procedural <span id="page_2234"></span>point, under <span class="Italic">VAMC, Ann Arbor and AFGE Local 2092</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v56/56-026.html">56 FLRA 216</a>, 223-24 (2000), an arbitrator may make a determination that a class of employees is entitled to EDP and leave it to the parties to sort out the amounts (the arbitrator retaining jurisdiction to resolve disputes), but there must be determinations based on individual entitlement if the award is for a sum certain:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found...that the Agency employed approximately 150 WG employees for each of the years covered by the award. The Arbitrator further estimated, in accordance with the Union's calculations, that the Agency owed the affected employees EDP in the amount of $5,739,728.00. The Agency maintains that the Arbitrator's award violates the Back Pay Act because the computations set forth therein only constitute estimates and, accordingly, fail to comport with the Back Pay Act's more specific requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of backpay is authorized under the Back Pay Act only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or the reduction of an employee's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department</span> <span class="Italic">Health and Human Services and</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, </span>54 FLRA 1210, 1218-19 (1998) (Authority clarified that a requirement that the pay loss would not have occurred but for the unwarranted action is not a separate, independent requirement of the Act but merely amplifies the causal connection requirement of the Act). A violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Department of Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Dependents Schools and Federal Education Association, </span>54 FLRA 773, 785 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first requirement for back pay awards, the Arbitrator specifically found that affected employees "hav[e] been required to work in an area or areas where airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers may expose or may have exposed [them] to potential illness or injury[.]" The Arbitrator additionally found that the use of protective devices or safety measures have not practically eliminated the potential for illness or injury. Based on these findings, the Arbitrator concluded that affected employees are entitled to EDP. Accordingly, the Arbitrator effectively found that the Agency violated Article 25, section 1 of the parties' bargaining agreement. We find these findings sufficient to warrant a conclusion that the Agency committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the second requirement for back pay awards, the Authority has found that the loss of a differential, such as EDP for exposure to asbestos, constitutes a withdrawal or reduction of an employee's pay, allowances or differentials. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, </span>43 FLRA 207, 212 (1991). The Agency contends, however, that the Arbitrator's findings fail to justify his award of back pay because the computations upon which the Arbitrator relied do not comport with the Back Pay Act's more specific requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found, as relevant here, that affected employees are "entitled to recover EDP wage payments as computed in the Wage Calculation Document for the period of November 28, 1988 to the date of September 30, 1998 and for such additional amount that may accrue until this matter reaches final status for settlement and payment of amounts due." [6] In addition, the Arbitrator stated that the calculation for the period between November 28, 1988, and September 30, 1998, "is $5,739,728.00."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;It is the wage calculation document submitted by the Union from which the Arbitrator's computation of $5,739,728.36.00 in back pay derives.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority routinely enforces arbitration awards in which the arbitrator has not specifically calculated the amount of back pay owed.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service, El</span> <span class="Italic">Paso, Texas and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 143</span>, 55 FLRA 553, 560 (1999) <span class="Italic">(NTEU, Chapter 143); U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of</span> <span class="Italic">Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution, Sheridan,</span> <span class="Italic">Oregon and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3979</span>, 55 FLRA 28, 29 (1998). If, however, an arbitrator does determine to calculate the amount of back pay, such calculations must accurately reflect the individual entitlements of affected employees. The Back Pay Act requires, in this regard, that on correction of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, the employee is entitled to receive for the period for which the personnel action was in effect "an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i). Indeed, by its plain wording, the Back Pay Act sets a ceiling on the amount of back pay that an employee can receive and contemplates that any amounts payable pursuant thereto will be based on calculations applicable to individual employees.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;That is not to say that back pay calculations may not be based on agreed upon estimates where accurate records have not been maintained.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it is undisputed that the amount of EDP awarded by the Arbitrator was based only on an estimate. We, therefore, find that as it was not based on specific calculations, the portion of the award ordering a specific amount of back pay must be set aside. Nevertheless, the calculation of the amount of back pay owed does not implicate the requirements of the Back Pay Act, but rather implicates a matter of compliance and implementation. <span class="Italic">See, NTEU, Chapter 143</span>, 55 FLRA at 560. Therefore, as the award of EDP satisfies the requirements of the Back Pay Act in all other respects, we will modify this portion of the award only with regard to the amount of back pay owed.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator is not empowered to add categories to conditions providing for EDP or hazard pay, discussed in the next section.

Lodge 725, Local Lodge 726</span>, 60 FLRA 196, 199 (2004); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Red River Army Depot, Texarkana, Tex</span>., 53 FLRA 46, 51 (1997); and <span class="Italic">NAGE</span>, 43 FLRA at 422-25. The Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">NAGE</span> in this case is, however, misplaced, because that case concerns the scope of bargaining and provides no basis for employees to claim entitlement to premium pay absent contract terms providing for such payment. As the Union does not claim that there is such a contract entitlement in this case, this precedent does not demonstrate that the award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">None of the authorities noted above, however, require an agency to affirmatively seek to have second hand smoke, or any other matter, added to the lists set out in the HPD and EDP Appendices, and the Union's arguments in support of its exception do not establish otherwise. In that regard, the Comptroller General decision discussed in the Authority's <span class="Italic">NAGE</span> decision addresses an agency's discretion to determine whether a local situation falls within the coverage of a matter already listed in the EDP Appendix, and not with any agency independent obligation to petition OPM to have OPM include additional matters to the HPD and EDP Appendices. And, that decision in any event does not require an agency to always exercise its discretion in such a way so as to always ensure the broadest possible application of the HPD and EDP Appendices to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Union's claim that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the Union was required to request the Agency to petition OPM to include exposure to second-hand smoke in the HPD Appendix A, we conclude that the Arbitrator made no such finding. Instead, the Arbitrator merely found that the Agency had not made a request to OPM and the Union had not "requested the Agency to undertake efforts in that regard[.]" There is no indication in the award that the Arbitrator required the Union to request that the Agency petition OPM to include exposure to second-hand smoke in the HPD or EDP Appendix A. Accordingly, the Union has not established that the Arbitrator erred in this regard.</p>

<p class="noindent">Premium pay for working in a boiler room was awarded in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Marion and AFGE Local 2483</span>, 38 FLRA 270, 274 (1990), after an arbitrator determined that an employee had been improperly detailed out of a position that allowed him to earn that premium. Danger pay is awarded, under 5 USC 5928, to employees serving in foreign areas under conditions involving threats of physical harm or imminent danger to their health or well-being. The danger pay allowance of 25% of basic pay does not result in an upward adjustment of overtime pay. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft.
