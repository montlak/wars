<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-430"><span class="space">2.</span> Agency Misapplication of Valid OPM Requirement; Agency Employment Practices; Nonselections</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Although "the jurisdictional grant of section 300.104 applies only to employment practices of OPM" and "it does not provide the Board with jurisdiction over employment practices of the agencies, even if those employment practices violate section 300.103," <span class="Italic">Lien v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3075) (challenge to agency merit promotion procedures followed the filling of particular vacancies), an agency's misapplication of a valid OPM requirement under 5 CFR Part 300 constitutes an appealable employment practice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Banks v. USDA,</span> 59 MSPR 157, 160 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 26 F.3d 140 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). <span class="Italic">Banks</span> relied on <span class="Italic">Maule v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 388, 392-93 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to its statutory authority under 5 USC 1103(a)(5) to execute, administer, and enforce civil service rules and regulations, OPM has both the power to create a right of appeal to the Board by regulation and to limit the scope of such a right<span class="Italic">. See Gaxiola v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 6 MSPR 515, 519 (1981). OPM has exercised that authority under 5 CFR 300.104(a) to make "employment practices" by OPM that violate a basic requirement in 300.103 appealable to the Board<span class="Italic">. See Dowd</span>, 713 F.2d at 722.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for an action to be an appealable employment practice it must: (1) Constitute an "employment practice" within the meaning of 5 CFR Part 300, Subpart A; and (2) meet the requirements of 5 CFR 300.103. In <span class="Italic">Dowd</span>, the court specifically held that an agency's alleged misapplication of the valid "time-in-grade" restrictions under 5 CFR 300.601-300.605 constitutes an "employment practice" within the meaning of 5 CFR Part 300, Subpart A<span class="Italic">. See Dowd</span>, 713 F.2d at 722-24. In so doing, the court rejected the Board's interpretation in <span class="Italic">Hellman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 10 MSPR 639, 643 (1982), that "employment practices" are restricted to "examinations, measurement tools, and qualifications directly relating to merit." <span class="Italic">See Dowd</span>, 713 F.2d at 722-23<span class="Italic">. See also Maule</span>, 812 F.2d at 1399. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lackhouse v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 773 F.2d 313, 315 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 475 U.S. 1049, <span class="Italic">reh. denied</span>, 475 U.S. 1133 (1986), the court held that an agency's alleged misapplication of the "rule-of-three" under 5 CFR 332.405 to drop from further consideration a candidate who has been passed over three times for selection is an "employment practice" appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM contends that, while the court in <span class="Italic">Dowd</span> and <span class="Italic">Lackhouse</span> has judicially expanded the definition of "employment practices" appealable to the Board "beyond merit-based tests," <span class="Italic">see Dowd</span>, 713 F.2d at 724, such definition does not include mere procedural decisions. We agree. As noted above...employment practices include the "development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments." Procedural decisions do not meet this definition and are not, in themselves, the "merit considerations" the court has found appealable under Part 300<span class="Italic">. See Dowd</span>, 713 F.2d at 723.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Roeder v. OPM</span>, 3 MSPR 387, 389 (1980), determined that the Board does not have jurisdiction over an employment practice "within the control of the agencies and did not concern a matter applied to him by the Office of Personnel Management," although that holding was stated so broadly as to provide little guidance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official also interpreted 5 CFR 300.104(c)(2), 44 Fed. Reg. 48951 (1979), as providing that employment practices administered or required by the agency which violate a basic requirement of 5 CFR 300.103 shall be grieved within the agency. The Board agrees with this interpretation and with the finding of the presiding official that appellant had no Part 300 right of appeal to the Board because his failure to be selected for the Air Safety Investigator and Airspace System Inspector Pilot positions was within the control of the agencies and did not concern a matter applied to him by the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One decision cited in <span class="Italic">Maule</span>, <span class="Italic">Lackhouse v. MSPB</span>, 773 F.2d 313 (Fed. Cir. 1984), suggested that an employment practice appeal was appropriate as to an agency's passover of a veteran on a certificate of eligibles because OPM was required by regulation to approve the passover. The employment practice was tied to OPM and not only to the employing agency. Another decision relied on by <span class="Italic">Maule</span>, <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States</span>, 713 F.2d 720 (Fed. Cir. 1983), involved a challenge to the Army's application of an OPM time-in-grade restriction to one of its employees. The employment practice challenge was appropriate, the court concluded, because the real motivation for the case was the OPM regulation, applied without further ado by the Army. A dissenting opinion in <span class="Italic">Dowd</span> argued that the Board lacked jurisdiction because it was the Army that acted against the appellant, not OPM, and an employment practice is supposed to be directed against an OPM practice. Board case law has not clearly explained when and how, given the results in <span class="Italic">Lackhouse</span> and <span class="Italic">Dowd</span>, the employment practices of an agency (other than OPM) create jurisdiction in the Board. Following <span class="Italic">Dowd</span>, <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Smithsonian Institution,</span> NY-3443-14-0350-I-1 (NP 6/23/2015), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States,</span> 713 F.2d 720, 721-22 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">Dowd I</span>), the agency conceded that it erroneously applied the time-in-grade <span id="Page_832"></span>restrictions set out in 5 C.F.R. Part 300, Subpart F to an applicant. The court found that the agency's action constituted an "employment practice" for purposes of a Board appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 723-24. Accordingly, the court remanded for further proceedings. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 724. Pursuant to that remand, the Board further adjudicated the matter, concluding that jurisdiction was still lacking because there was no OPM involvement in the agency's erroneous application of the time-in-grade regulations. <span class="Italic">See Dowd v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 745 F.2d 650, 651 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Dowd II</span>). In <span class="Italic">Dowd II</span>, our reviewing court affirmed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the <span class="Italic">Dowd</span> cases demonstrate, even if the agency erroneously applied the regulatory time-in-grade restrictions, as the appellant alleges, rather than simply borrowing language from 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.605(b) as a discretionary method of measuring the appellant's qualifications, there is no indication that OPM was involved in any way. <span class="Italic">See generally Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 888 (to characterize an agency's nonselection as a practice applied by OPM for purposes of jurisdiction in an employment practices appeal, OPM's involvement in the selection process must be significant). Accordingly, the appellant failed to meet his burden of proving, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that his appeal concerns an employment practice that OPM is involved in administering.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Summarizing its law and some of the Board's, the Federal Circuit evaluated agency decisions constituting "employment practices" subject to Board review, with additional commentary on the <span class="Italic">Maule</span> and <span class="Italic">Dowd</span> decisions, in <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. MSPB</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998), determining that "an individual agency action or decision that is not made pursuant to or as part of a rule or practice of some kind does not qualify as an 'employment practice'":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the "practices" that Mr. Prewitt challenges in this case is the alleged error by an agency employee in misidentifying Mr. Prewitt's race and the race of other applicants for the Equal Opportunity Assistant position. This court has held that "employment practice" is to be construed broadly and should not be restricted to the "examinations, measurement tools, and qualifications relating to merit" referred to in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.101<span class="Italic">. Maule v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd</span>., 812 F.2d 1396, 1399 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">see Dowd v. United States,</span> 713 F.2d 720, 723-24 (Fed. Cir. 1983). However, an individual agency action or decision that is not made pursuant to or as part of a rule or practice of some kind does not qualify as an "employment practice." <span class="Italic">Saya v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 68 MSPR 493, 496 (1995). <span class="Italic">Compare Banks v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 59 MSPR 157 (1993) (failure to consider all relevant education and experience, and other alleged irregularities in the selection process do not constitute an employment practice), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 26 F.3d 140 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (table), <span class="Italic">with Dowd v. United States,</span> 713 F.2d at 724 (application of time-in-grade restrictions is an employment practice), and <span class="Italic">Lackhouse v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd</span>., 773 F.2d 313, 315 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (application of "rule of three" provision specified in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 332.405 is an employment practice). The racial misidentification alleged by Mr. Prewitt in this case is more aptly characterized as an irregularity in the selection process rather than an application of a specific rule, provision, or policy by the agency. As such, the alleged misidentification is not an employment practice that is appealable to the Board under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.104(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Prewitt also challenges the agency's failure to maintain employee selection records and its use of allegedly inappropriate minimum qualification standards for the Equal Opportunity Assistant position. He has not satisfied his burden of establishing Board jurisdiction with respect to those practices, however, because he has not shown that OPM was involved in the administration of either of those practices. While early MSPB cases held that non-selection by an agency could never be designated as an action for which OPM was responsible, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Carroll v. EEOC,</span> 6 MSPB 198, 6 MSPR 228, 230-31 (1981), this court has held that in certain circumstances, OPM's involvement in an agency's selection process may be sufficient to characterize a non-selection action by that agency as a practice applied by OPM. For that prerequisite to be satisfied, however, OPM's involvement in the selection process must be significant. <span class="Italic">Compare Maule v.</span> <span class="Italic">Merit Sys. Protection Bd.,</span> 812 F.2d at 1398 (OPM made "pivotal decision" that ultimately resulted in non-selection), and <span class="Italic">Lackhouse v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 773 F.2d at 315 &#x0026; n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (OPM's promulgation of rule was the "direct cause" of agency's action), <span class="Italic">with Dowd v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 745 F.2d 650, 651 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (OPM "played no part" in agency's non-selection). Mr. Prewitt has not alleged that OPM was involved in either the failure to maintain employee selection records or the establishment of allegedly improper minimum qualifications for the position for which he applied. He therefore failed to establish that either practice is applied to him by OPM and thus failed to show that the Board had appellate jurisdiction under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.104(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sutton v. VA</span>, 671 Fed. Appx. 781, 783 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP) ("As the Board recognized, Mr. Sutton does not challenge any OPM employment practice. He does not contend that the educational qualification requirements at issue are inappropriate. Nor does he argue that OPM should not have applied those qualification requirements to him. Instead, he challenges OPM's individual determination that his transcript is insufficient to establish that he meets the education requirement. At most, this amounts to an irregularity in the selection process.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Purifoy v. MSPB</span>, 621 Fed. Appx. 673, 674-75 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP), expanded on <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span> as to the significance of OPM involvement in a selection process for an employment practice to be within the Board's jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, we held that "OPM's involvement in an agency's selection process may be sufficient to characterize a non-selection action by that agency as a practice applied by OPM" only where OPM's involvement in the selection process is "significant." <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 888. As the Board observed, however, Ms. Purifoy "did not allege that OPM was involved in administering the alleged practices at issue or that the agency's alleged wrongful actions were based upon any regulation or standard promulgated by OPM." That is, Ms. Purifoy has not satisfied her burden of establishing Board jurisdiction with respect to the employment practices because she "has not shown that OPM was involved in the administration of [the] practices." <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887-88; <span class="Italic">see also Dowd v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 745 F.2d 650, 651 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ("[S]ince OPM played no part in the [employment practice applied] to petitioner by the [agency], OPM had not applied any employment practice to petitioner." (emphasis omitted)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, under <span class="Italic">Miranne v. MSPB</span>, 635 Fed. Appx. 895, 897 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we agree that OPM need not directly be involved, some sort of OPM involvement is necessary so as to not render that requirement a nullity. All of our cases Mr. Miranne cites for this proposition involve an agency's application of a specific OPM policy alleged to be in violation of the basic requirement. <span class="Italic">See Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887 (listing cases);. We have found jurisdiction only when the appellant showed that OPM made the "pivotal decision" that resulted in non-selection, <span class="Italic">see Maule v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 812 F.2d 1396, 1398 (Fed. Cir. 1987), or that OPM's promulgation of a rule was the "direct cause" of the agency's action, <span class="Italic">see Lackhouse v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.,</span> 773 F.2d 313, 315 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1985). None involved an agency's alleged failure to apply an OPM regulation. We agree with the Board that an alleged failure to implement an OPM regulation does not demonstrate OPM involvement or establish Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Inapplicability of an employment practice challenge to a nonselection was echoed by <span class="Italic">Nichols v. MSPB</span>, 625 Fed. Appx. 987, 990-93 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is strictly defined and confined by statute and regulation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a). "An agency's failure to select an applicant for a vacant position is generally not appealable to the Board." <span class="Italic">Prewitt,</span> 133 F.3d at 886 (citing <span class="Italic">Ellison v.

Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) ("Employment practices"), however, "[a] candidate who believes that an <span class="Italic">employment practice</span> which was <span class="Italic">applied to him or her by the</span> [<span class="Italic">OPM</span>] violates a basic requirement in &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the [Board]." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) (emphases added). Thus, the Board has jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 300.104(a) "when two conditions are met: first, the appeal must concern an 'employment practice' [of the OPM,] and second, the employment practice must be alleged to have violated one of the 'basic requirements' for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103." <span class="Italic">Meeker,</span> 319 F.3d at 1373.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An "employment practice" is defined as those practices "that affect the recruitment, measurement, ranking, and selection of individuals for initial appointment and competitive promotion." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101. While this court has held the term "employment practices" "has a naturally broad and inclusive meaning," <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States (Dowd I),</span> 713 F.2d 720, 723 (Fed. Cir. 1983), "an individual agency action or decision that is not made pursuant to or as part of a rule or practice of some kind does not qualify as an 'employment practice.'" <span class="Italic">Prewitt,</span> 133 F.3d at 887.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a), Mr. Nichols must make non-frivolous allegations, supported by evidence, that (1) an "employment practice" (2) applied to him by OPM (3) violated &#x00A7; 300.103 because it was not based on a "job analysis" that was relevant to the position or was discriminatory. <span class="Italic">See Marcino</span>, 344 F.3d at 1202; <span class="Italic">Meeker</span>, 319 F.3d at 1373; <span class="Italic">Vesser</span>, 29 F.3d at 603. Here, Mr. Nichols has raised non-frivolous allegations that an employment practice--the selection criteria used by the Agency for the positions at issue--violated &#x00A7; 300.103 because they were not based on a "job analysis" that was relevant to the position or were discriminatory. As noted, the term "employment practices" "has a naturally broad and inclusive meaning," <span class="Italic">Dowd I</span>, 713 F.2d at 723, and is defined by regulation as those practices "that affect the recruitment, measurement, ranking, and selection of individuals for initial appointment and competitive promotion," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101. The selection criteria used by the Agency in this case fall within the breadth of this definition. The Board's conclusion that the challenged employment practice was better characterized "'as an irregularity in the selection process rather than an application of a specific rule, provision, or policy by the agency,'" Final Order at 4 (quoting <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887), is refuted by the fact that Mr. Nichols challenged the selection criteria used to fill more than one position, not his non-selection for a particular position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That Mr. Nichols was unable to support his assertion that the identified employment practice violated &#x00A7; 300.103 was due, at least to some extent, to the Agency's failure to place the Report of Investigation on the record of this appeal. The Board's statement that Mr. Nichols "presumably had a copy of the agency's [Report of Investigation] and could have submitted portions of it in response to the administrative judge's jurisdictional order," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 6 n.3, ignored "procedures required by...regulation." <span class="Italic">Forest</span>, 47 F.3d at 410 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c)). In particular, the Agency was required to submit to the Board "[a]ll documents contained in the agency record of the action" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.25(c) ("The agency response to an appeal <span class="Italic">must contain</span>...[a]ll documents contained in the agency record of the action."). Mr. Nichols's citations to the Report of Investigation, if placed on the record by the Agency as required by regulation, would have served as preponderant evidence to support his nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Fields</span>, 452 F.3d at 1302; <span class="Italic">Marcino</span>, 344 F.3d at 1202.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board correctly concluded that Mr. Nichols failed to demonstrate the alleged employment practice was applied by OPM, or that "OPM's involvement in the selection process was...significant." <span class="Italic">See Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 888. As the Board observed, there was no evidence to establish "OPM was involved in the administration of the practice at issue" or "was involved in the agency's allegedly improper development of the scoring criteria." That is, Mr. Nichols "has not satisfied his burden of establishing Board jurisdiction with respect to th[e employment] practices...because he has not shown that OPM was involved in the administration of [the] practices." <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887-88; <span class="Italic">see also Dowd v.

Cir. 1984) ("[S]ince OPM played no part in the [employment practice applied] to petitioner by the Department of the Army, <span class="Italic">OPM had not applied</span> any employment practice to petitioner."). Without such a showing, Mr. Nichols cannot establish jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). Accordingly, the Board's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was proper.</p>

Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6; 6 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant does not claim that any employment practice administered by OPM violated the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">See Mapstone v. Department of the Interior</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 691, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15 (2007), <span class="Italic">modified by Mapstone v. Department of the Interior</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6; 7 (2008). Nor does he allege that that the qualification requirements were not "rationally related" to the Warden position. <span class="Italic">See Sauser</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (finding that an appellant established jurisdiction over an employment practices appeal <span id="Page_834"></span>based on an allegation that an agency misapplied OPM qualification standards because he alleged that the standards were not rationally related to performance in the position to be filled).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead, the appellant claims only that the agency "misapplied" an existing OPM standard by "selectively" and "systematically and willfully" interpreting the qualification standards in a manner that resulted in the qualification of only individuals who previously have performed in the Associate Warden position. The appellant asserts that, by the agency narrowly interpreting OPM's qualification standards, qualified applicants were denied the opportunity to compete for positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an agency's "misapplication" of a valid OPM requirement also may constitute a colorable employment practices claim. <span class="Italic">Sauser</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6; 7 (citing <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998)); <span class="Italic">Holse v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 6 (2004). However, to constitute a misapplication of a valid OPM requirement, OPM must have been involved in a "significant way" in the administration of the qualification standard misapplied by the agency. <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 888; <span class="Italic">Mapstone</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 691, &#x00B6; 14. In <span class="Italic">Dowd v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 745 F.2d 650, 651 (Fed. Cir. 1984), for example, the appellant challenged an agency finding that he was ineligible for a position based on the hiring agency's application of OPM's time-in-grade regulations, and our reviewing court affirmed the Board's dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because "OPM played no part in the ineligible rating given to [the] petitioner," and thus "OPM had not applied any employment practice to [the] petitioner." Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Manno v. Department of Justice</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 696, &#x00B6; 8 (2000), the Board found that it lacked jurisdiction over an employment practices appeal when the appellant failed to show that OPM had any involvement in the alleged mishandling of his application for promotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, nothing in the record indicates that OPM was at all involved in administering or reviewing the additional specialized qualification requirements that the agency considered in evaluating applicants for the Warden position. Instead, the appellant is attempting to challenge how the agency evaluated the specialized supervisory/managerial experience he provided on his application and the fact that his experience was ultimately assessed to be insufficiently broad to meet the agency's needs for the Warden position. Beyond his conclusory allegation that the agency was too selective in applying OPM's requirements to "exclude qualified applicants," the appellant does not explain how the agency's determination that his experience was insufficient, or the fact that it identified alternative work experience that would, in fact, meet its specialized experience requirements, violated any of the basic requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. Such an argument does not constitute a claim that the agency "misapplied" otherwise valid OPM requirements and is rather more accurately characterized as a challenge of the appellant's individual qualification determination, over which the Board does not have jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Richardson v. Department of Defense</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 58, 61 (1998) (finding that an alleged error in rating and handling an individual's employment application did not constitute an employment practice); <span class="Italic">see also Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887 (stating that an individual agency action or decision that is not made pursuant to or part of a rule or practice of some kind does not qualify as an "employment practice"). Whether by consequence or by design, the agency's application of its qualification standards in a manner that deemed only individuals with previous experience as Associate Wardens qualified for the Warden position does not constitute an appealable employment practices claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, to the extent the appellant's claim that he is being "denied the opportunity to compete" for the Warden position is intended as a challenge to the administrative judge's determination that he failed to nonfrivolously allege he was subject to a negative suitability action, we find that argument is also without merit. As the administrative judge correctly noted, the Board does have jurisdiction over a "suitability action," which includes a cancellation of eligibility, a removal, a cancellation of reinstatement eligibility, and a debarment. <span class="Italic">See Kazan v. Department of Justice</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 390, &#x00B6; 6 (2009). However, a nonselection for a specific position is not a "suitability action," even if it is based on the criteria for making suitability determinations set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202. <span class="Italic">Kazan</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 390, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.203(a)-(b), 731.501(a). Beyond finding him unqualified under the listed announcements, the appellant does not allege that the agency took any broader action regarding his eligibility, such as canceling any other eligibilities on other existing competitive registers or barring him from consideration for future announcements. <span class="Italic">See Kazan</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 390, &#x00B6; 6. As a result, we agree with the administrative judge's determination that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that his nonselection was an appealable suitability action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Following up on <span class="Italic">Dowd</span> was <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. SSA</span>, DA-300A-12-0429-I-1 (NP 11/5/2013). The appellant was concerned that in his application for an ALJ position, SSA did not properly follow the "rule of three," embodied in an OPM regulation, 5 CFR 332.404. The Board decided that Mr. O'Leary did not make out an employment practice case against SSA when the issue was the rating and handling of individual applications, rather than the failure of the agency to apply an OPM regulation at all:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the following reasons, we find that the appellant has not established jurisdiction over this employment practices appeal. As the appellant argues, the Board has found that an agency's "misapplication" of a valid OPM requirement may constitute an "employment practice" for purposes of Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). <span class="Italic">E.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Russo v. Department of the Navy</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 12, &#x00B6; 12 (1999); <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 157, 160 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 26 F.3d 140 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). However, "misapplication" in this context means that the agency applied an employment practice that it should not have applied at all; it does not mean that the agency applied an applicable employment practice incorrectly. The proposition that an agency's "misapplication" of a valid OPM requirement may constitute an employment practice first appeared in <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States</span>, 713 F.2d 720 (Fed. Cir. 1983). In that case, the Department of the Army rated the appellant ineligible for the GS-12 position to which he had applied because the appellant did not meet OPM's time-in-grade requirement of having served 1 year at the next lower grade. 713 F.2d at 721. The appellant filed a Board appeal, arguing that he was exempt from OPM's regulatory time-in-grade requirements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 721-22. Thus, the issue in <span class="Italic">Dowd</span> was not whether the agency properly determined that the appellant lacked the 1 year of service required under the regulation, but whether that requirement should apply at all to the appellant's situation. The Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that time-in-grade requirements do not constitute appealable employment practices. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 721, 723. The court reversed the Board's decision, finding that the time-in-grade requirement is an employment practice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 724. The court further stated that, although the validity of OPM's time-in-grade requirements was not in question because they were contained in a regulation "equal in dignity to the 'Basic requirements' in section 300.103," their applicability to the position in question "can be considered by the [B]oard to the same extent as any other employment practice." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, "misapplication of a valid OPM requirement" does not mean that the agency inaccurately evaluated a candidate using a valid OPM requirement. Rather, it means that the very application of the requirement to the candidate violated one of the basic requisites of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. In other words, "misapplication of a valid OPM requirement" refers to the applicability of a requirement, rather than to the method of its application.[3] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 11 (2007). The appellant in this case is not challenging the applicability of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.404; he is challenging the method of its application. Therefore, the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that the SSA "misapplied" that employment practice within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Dowd</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;To hold otherwise would be to allow challenges to the rating and handling of individual applications, which the Board may not do. <span class="Italic">See Richardson v. Department of Defense</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 58, 60-61 (1998); <span class="Italic">Banks</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 160; <span class="Italic">see also Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (an individual agency action or decision that is not made pursuant to or part of a rule or practice of some kind does not qualify as an "employment practice").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant has not even made a nonfrivolous allegation that the SSA applied 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.404 incorrectly. That section merely requires an appointing official to select from the highest three unselected eligibles on a certificate, and the appellant admits that the SSA did so by hiring ALJs from among "the three highest candidates based on the OPM final score." The appellant's real dispute is with the SSA's practice of sometimes selecting the lower of these three candidates, often based on the outcome of an interview. However, section 332.404 explicitly permits the SSA to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant has not alleged any sort of connection between this practice and OPM. For OPM to be deemed to have been involved in the administration of an agency's employment practice, OPM's involvement "must be significant." <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Here, the appellant has failed to show that OPM is involved in the SSA's interview process and scoring of ALJ <span id="Page_835"></span>applicants. Absent significant involvement by OPM in the SSA's process of interviewing and scoring ALJ candidates, the Board lacks jurisdiction over these alleged employment practices. <span class="Italic">See Manno v. Department of Justice</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 696, &#x00B6; 8 (2000) (the Board lacked jurisdiction over the alleged employment practice because the appellant failed to show that OPM had any involvement in the practice). The fact that the SSA developed the interview process under its delegated examining authority undermines rather than supports the appellant's argument that OPM itself was involved in administering that practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant has not raised a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant also asserts that the SSA's interview process and scoring of applicants based on their interviews violates 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104. OPM regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104 only provides the Board with authority to consider challenges based on the three grounds set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 and does not give the Board jurisdiction over any and all legal challenges to employment practices. <span class="Italic">Meeker</span>, 319 F.3d at 1374. Accordingly, the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the appellant's legal challenges to the SSA's alleged employment practices that are not based on the grounds set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency involvement in employment practices challenges was limited to testing and selection criteria in <span class="Italic">Kelly v. OPM</span>, 53 MSPR 511, 516 (1992), involving what was a nonappealable challenge to an agency's refusal to provide veterans preference status to the appellant for purposes of conducting a reduction in force:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 CFR 300.104(a), an "employment practice" that was applied to a "candidate" by OPM may be appealed to the Board if it violates a basic requirement in 5 CFR 300.103. Under 5 CFR 300.101, the term "employment practices" includes the "development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments." An agency's action in applying an OPM rule relating to preference eligible status during RIFs is not an employment practice as contemplated under 5 CFR Part 300. By their terms these regulations cover an applicant's selection for an initial appointment or competitive promotions in the merit systems....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employment practice challenge was rejected as to an agency's development and use of scoring criteria used to fill several positions, <span class="Italic">Nichols v. Dept. of Navy</span>, AT-3443-14-0159-I-1 (NP 10/16/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over an employment practices appeal pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) when two conditions are met: first, the appeal must concern an employment practice that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is involved in administering; and second, the employment practice must be alleged to have violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 10 (2007). OPM, however, need not be immediately involved in the practice in question, and an agency's misapplication of a valid OPM requirement may constitute an appealable employment practice action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 888 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Importantly, although our reviewing court has emphasized that the term "employment practice" is to be construed broadly, such breadth does not cover "an individual agency action or decision that is not made pursuant to or as part of a rule or practice of some kind." <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887 (citing <span class="Italic">Saya v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 493, 496 (1995)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We concur with the administrative judge that the appellant has failed to establish the Board's jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). The record reflects that the appellant is challenging the individual selection and scoring criteria developed by the agency, which is unique to a particular position within the agency. Based on the evidence in the record, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's challenge to the agency's action is better categorized "as an irregularity in the selection process rather than an application of a specific rule, provision, or policy by the agency." <span class="Italic">See Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887. Thus, differing from cases where an agency has applied OPM's time-in-grade restrictions, or where OPM changed the scoring formula used to score administrative law judge examinations, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Chadwell v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 629 F.3d 1306, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (summarizing cases involving appealable employment practices), here, the appellant is challenging the agency's individualized decision to select another candidate for a particular position of employment, IAF, Tab 5 at 7 (arguing that the selection criteria was improperly designed to favor a single applicant). Such a challenge to an agency's individualized hiring decision falls outside of the Board's appellate jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). <span class="Italic">See Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887 (holding that the agency's action, specific to the appellant, was not an employment practice under 5 C.F.R. part 300); <span class="Italic">see also Dow v. General Services Administration</span>, 590 F.3d 1338, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (finding that an agency's decision not to select an employee because it found the employee unsuitable was not an appealable employment practice).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that there is no evidence in the record to support the second jurisdictional element of the appellant's employment practices appeal, i.e., that OPM was involved in the administration of the practice at issue. <span class="Italic">See Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887-88. In <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, the Federal Circuit found that the appellant failed to allege that "OPM was involved in...the establishment of allegedly improper minimum qualifications for the position for which he applied." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 888. Similar to <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, we find that the appellant has failed to allege that OPM was involved in the agency's allegedly improper development of the scoring criteria used to select a female candidate over the appellant. The appellant's bare assertion that the agency misapplied OPM's regulatory requirement that a job analysis be used to identify the basic duties and responsibilities of the position, without more, fails to nonfrivolously establish <span class="Italic">how</span> the agency's job analysis is deficient or <span class="Italic">how</span> the agency misapplied those standards. <span class="Italic">See Scott</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 11 (noting that the appellant did not specifically identify which basic requirement she believed the agency violated and how that requirement might have been violated, but remanding to the administrative judge for additional notice of the jurisdictional elements of an employment practices appeal).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the appellant alleged that the agency manipulated the hiring process and changed the qualification criteria for the position to ensure that she was excluded from consideration. We find that these claims constitute a challenge to an individual selection process for a particular position with the agency, rather than the application of a rule, provision, or policy by the agency, and do not raise an employment practices claim or any other matter appealable to the Board.[7] <span class="Italic">See Prewitt,</span> 133 F.3d at 887 (holding that the agency's individual error, specific to the appellant, was not an employment practice); <span class="Italic">Banks v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The appellant's contentions that the agency also failed to select her for a prior vacancy similarly do not raise a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further alleged that the agency violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 in failing to maintain an active merit promotion plan and to develop selection criteria based upon a professionally-developed job analysis.

Moreover, we agree with the administrative judge that, even assuming that the actions challenged by the appellant constituted employment practices, the Board would nevertheless lack jurisdiction over her appeal because she failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that they affected the processing of her application. <span class="Italic">See Dow v.

Instead, the agency conceded that the appellant should have been identified as a qualified candidate but was not, as the result of a RESUMIX system error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In that regard, we disagree with the administrative judge that the agency's erroneous rejection of the appellant's application due to a RESUMIX system error raised a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction over her employment practices appeal entitling her to a jurisdictional hearing. Neither the appellant nor the agency has alleged that the RESUMIX system error occurred pursuant to or as part of any rule or practice. <span class="Italic">See Manno</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 696, &#x00B6; 7 (an agency's alleged mishandling of an appellant's application did not raise a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction over an employment practices appeal where he did not allege that the mishandling was pursuant to any rule or practice); <span class="Italic">Banks</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 159-60 (an agency's failure to consider all of an appellant's relevant education and experience and other alleged irregularities in the selection process did not constitute an employment practice). Moreover, neither the agency nor the appellant alleged that OPM had any involvement, significant or otherwise, in the RESUMIX system. <span class="Italic">See Manno,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 696, &#x00B6; 8 (an appellant did not raise a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction where he did not allege that OPM had any involvement in the agency's mishandling of his application). Accordingly, we find that the RESUMIX system error did not raise a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction entitling the appellant to a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Purifoy v. MSPB</span>, 621 Fed. Appx. 673, 674 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP), affirmed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The record reflects that Ms. Purifoy's nonreferral was due to an error in the Agency's application processing system. It was not as a result of an "employment practice" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 300.104. We have repeatedly held that, for the Board to have jurisdiction, it is "necessary that the challenged employment practice have been applied to the applicant as the basis for the adverse hiring decision." <span class="Italic">Dow v. Gen. Servs. Admin</span>., 590 F.3d 1338, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2010). As such, we agree that the Board lacked jurisdiction over Ms. Purifoy's appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An error in assembly or retention of portions of an applicant's file did not rise to the level of an appealable employment practice, <span class="Italic">Manno v. DOJ</span>, 85 MSPR 696, 699-700 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.104(a), "[a] candidate who believes that an employment practice which was applied to him or her by the Office of Personnel Management [(OPM)] violates a basic requirement in &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of its regulations." To satisfy his jurisdictional burden under section 300.104(a), the appellant must show (1) that the actions in question constitute employment practices, and (2) that OPM is involved in the administration of those practices. <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons discussed below, we find that the appellant has failed to satisfy either of these jurisdictional criteria.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the jurisdictional issue of whether the agency's actions constituted employment practices, "the term 'employment practices' includes the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.101. Our reviewing court has held that, although the term "employment practices" should be construed broadly, "an individual agency action or decision that is not made pursuant to or as part of a rule or practice of some kind does not qualify as an 'employment practice.'" <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887. In <span class="Italic">Prewitt,</span> the court held that the alleged error by an agency employee in misidentifying Prewitt's race and the race of other applicants does not constitute an "employment practice" because it is more aptly characterized as an irregularity in the selection process rather than an application of a specific rule, provision, or policy by the agency. 133 F.3d at 887. Here, the appellant claimed that the agency mishandled his employment application but has not alleged or shown that the alleged mishandling was pursuant to or as part of any rule or practice. We therefore find that the appellant's allegations, even if true, do not show that the agency's alleged mishandling of his application constituted an "employment practice." <span class="Italic">See also Russo v. Department of the Navy,</span> 85 MSPR 12, T 12 (1999) ("[A]n individual agency action or decision that is not made pursuant to or as part of a rule or practice of some kind does not qualify as an 'employment practice."'); <span class="Italic">Saya v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 68 MSPR 493, 496 (1995) (same); <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 59 MSPR 157, 159-60 (1993) (failure to consider all relevant education and experience and other alleged irregularities in the selection process do not constitute an "employment practice"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 26 F.3d 140, 1994 WL 180335 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the appellant's failure to satisfy the first jurisdictional criterion of showing that the alleged mishandling of his application constitutes an employment practice, we need not reach the second jurisdictional criterion involving the issue of whether OPM was involved in the administration of the alleged employment practice. Nevertheless, we find that the appellant failed to satisfy the second jurisdictional criterion. For OPM to be deemed to have been involved in the administration of an agency's employment practice, OPM's involvement "must be significant." <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 888. The appellant has not alleged or shown that OPM had any involvement in the agency's mishandling of his application. We therefore conclude that the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.104(a), and that he is therefore not entitled to the jurisdictional hearing which he requested below and on review. <span class="Italic">See Banks,</span> 59 MSPR at 159-60 &#x0026; nn. 2, 3. (the Board declined to remand the appeal for a jurisdictional hearing and instead dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, after considering for the first time on petition for review the appellant's jurisdictional claim under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.104(a) and finding that the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">see generally Black v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 78 MSPR 561, 564 (1998) (where an appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency's actions are appealable under <span class="Italic">Banks</span>, 59 MSPR at 160, in which the Board stated that an agency's misapplication of a valid OPM requirement under 5 CFR part 300 constitutes an appealable employment practice. The appellant has not identified any OPM requirement under 5 CFR part 300 which the agency applied or misapplied in allegedly mishandling his employment application. We therefore find that this argument is without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not dispute the AJ's finding that the Board otherwise lacks jurisdiction over his nonselection for the Assistant Port Director position, and we discern no error in it. <span class="Italic">See Prewitt,</span> 133 F.3d at 886 (an agency's failure to select an applicant for a position is generally not appealable to the Board, and claims of unlawful conduct in the selection process ordinarily must be brought before other forums); <span class="Italic">Pritchett v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 35, 38 (1996); <span class="Italic">Walters v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 MSPR 115, 118 (1994).</p>
