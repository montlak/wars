<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-82"><span class="space">c.</span> Review of Agency Determination; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Egan</span></span>; Constitutional Due Process</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The process due under the Executive Order differs substantively from the process due during adverse action procedures (long-term suspension or termination resulting from clearance suspension or revocation). <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Dept. of State,</span> <a href="https://openjurist.org/217/f3d/1372/rayburn-hesse-v-department-of-state-f-dc">217 F.3d 1372</a>, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000), noted the distinctions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the proceedings before the agency pertaining to his indefinite suspension from his position, Mr. Hesse was entitled to the procedural protections set forth in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b). The record reflects that he received all the procedural protections the statute requires, including advance written notice of his proposed suspension, an opportunity to respond to the charges against him and to furnish written material in support of his response, the right to be represented by an attorney or other representative, and a written decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that Mr. Hesse complains about the manner in which the proceeding leading to the suspension of his security clearance was conducted, the protections of section 7513(d) do not apply to that process, because the suspension of a security clearance is not an "action" within the meaning of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512. Moreover, to the extent that Mr. Hesse is contending that he was denied due process by the procedure leading to the suspension of his security clearance, this court has held that a federal employee does not have a liberty or property interest in access to classified information. For that reason, this court has held, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment has no application to a proceeding to review an employee's security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223, 1225-26 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Egan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 28 MSPR 509, 519 (1985), determined the Board had no authority to review an agency's security clearance determination on the merits, but it would review the procedures used by the agency and ensure that the employee was provided with procedural due process. <span class="Italic">Egan</span> was reviewed and reversed by the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Egan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 802 F.2d 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1986), concluding that the Board had the obligation to review a security clearance determination both for procedural due process and on the merits or reasons for revoking the clearance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In February 1988, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit in a 5-3 decision, essentially resolving that the grant or denial of a clearance is a matter within the expertise of the intelligence community and is not directly reviewable by MSPB. The Board has jurisdiction only to determine whether the appellant received due process: notice of the reasons for the proposed denial, an opportunity to inspect all relevant evidence, a right to respond, a written decision, and an opportunity to appeal to the security appellate organization for Egan's agency, the Personnel Security Appeals Board. The Court also touched upon, but did not clearly resolve, whether the Board could review the right of the appellant to be assigned to a vacant nonsensitive position in lieu of removal or downgrading. The Supreme Court decided that MSPB does not have the authority to go behind the revocation of the clearance. The Court reviewed the facts and the procedural history, noting early in the Opinion that all the positions at Egan's facility required a clearance. His clearance was denied for past criminal convictions that were not listed on his employment application. Without the clearance, he was not eligible for the job he held. Reassignment to a nonsensitive position was not possible because there was no nonsensitive position at the facility. Relying principally on the doctrine of agency expertise in the issuance of security clearances, the Court concluded that the Federal Circuit was mistaken in determining that the Board had authority to examine the merits of the clearance revocation, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. Egan,</span> 484 U.S. 518, 527-30, 533-34 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he grant of security clearance to a particular employee, a sensitive and inherently discretionary judgment call, is committed by law to the appropriate agency of the Executive Branch.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since World War I, the Executive Branch has engaged in efforts to protect national security information by means of a classification system graded according to sensitivity....&#8197;After World War II, certain civilian agencies...were entrusted with gathering, protecting, or creating information bearing on national security. Presidents, in a series of Executive Orders, have sought to protect sensitive information and to ensure its proper classification throughout the Executive Branch by delegating this responsibility to the heads of agencies....&#8197;Pursuant to these directives, departments and agencies of the Government classify jobs in three categories: critical sensitive, noncritical sensitive, and nonsensitive. Different types and levels of clearances are required, depending upon the position sought. A Government appointment is expressly made subject to a background investigation that varies according to the degree of adverse effect the applicant could have on the national security....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It should be obvious that no one has a "right" to a security clearance. The grant of a clearance requires an affirmative act of discretion on the part of the granting official. The general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when "clearly consistent with the interests of the national security."...A clearance does not equate with passing judgment upon an individual's character. Instead, it is only an attempt to predict his possible future behavior and to assess whether, under compulsion of circumstances or for other reasons, he might compromise sensitive information. It may be based, to be sure, upon past or present conduct, but it also may be based upon concerns completely unrelated to conduct, such as having close relatives residing in a country hostile to the United States. "[T]o be denied [clearance] on unspecified grounds in no way implies disloyalty or any other repugnant characteristic."...The attempt to define not only the individual's future actions, but those of outside and unknown influence renders the "grant or denial of security clearances...an inexact science at best."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Predictive judgment of this kind must be made by those with the necessary expertise in protecting classified information. For "reasons...too obvious to call for enlarged discussion,"...the protection of classified information must be committed to the broad discretion of the agency responsible, and this must include broad discretion to determine who may have access to it. Certainly, it is not reasonably possible for an outside nonexpert body to review the substance of such a judgment and to decide whether the agency should have been able to make the necessary affirmative prediction with confidence. Nor can such a body determine what constitutes an acceptable margin of error in assessing the potential risk. The Court accordingly has acknowledged that with respect to employees in sensitive positions "there is a reasonable basis for the view that an agency head who must bear the responsibility for the protection of classified information committed to his custody should have the final say in deciding whether to repose his trust in an employee who has access to such information."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act by its terms does not confer broad authority on the Board to review a security clearance determination....&#8197;[T]he Board does have jurisdiction to review "adverse actions," a term, however, limited to a removal, suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay....&#8197;A denial of a security clearance is not such an "adverse action" and by its own force is not subject to Board review. An employee who is removed for "cause" under &#x00A7; 7513, when his required clearance is denied, is entitled to the several procedural protections specified in that statute. The Board then may determine whether such cause existed, whether in fact clearance was denied, and whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible. Nothing in the Act, however, directs or empowers the Board to go further....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not agree that respondent would have received greater procedural protections under &#x00A7; 7532 than he received in the present case. Respondent received notice of the reasons for the proposed denial, an opportunity to inspect all relevant evidence, a right to respond, a written decision, and an opportunity to appeal to the Personnel Security Appeals Board. Until the time of his removal, he remained on full-pay status. His removal was subject to Board review that provided important protections outlined above. In contrast, had he been removed under &#x00A7; 7532, he would have received notice to "the extent that the head of the agency determines that the interests of national security permit," a hearing before an agency board, and a decision by the head of the agency. He could have been suspended without pay pending the outcome. He would not have been entitled to any review outside the agency, and, once removed, he would have been barred from employment with the agency. In short, &#x00A7; 7532, instead, provides a procedure that is harsh and drastic both for the employee and for the agency head, who must act personally in suspending and removing the employee....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent's argument that the Board decision in this case creates an anomaly seems to come down to his contention that, had he been removed under &#x00A7; 7532, he would have been entitled to a trial-type hearing prior to his removal. Even assuming he would be entitled to such a hearing under &#x00A7; 7532, we would still consider the two procedures not anomalous, but merely different. As explained above, we doubt whether removal under &#x00A7; 7532, even as envisioned by respondent, would have amounted to "more" procedural protection.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">As a general principle, according to the indefinite suspension appeal in <span class="Italic">Pangelinan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-16-0218-I-1 (NP 1/6/2017), "it is well settled that employees 'do not have a liberty or property interest in access to classified information, and the termination of that access therefore [does] not implicate any due process concerns.' <span class="Italic">Gargiulo v.

Cir. 2013), removing constitutional due process as an element of the clearance review process leading to an indefinite suspension, under <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the agency was required to establish that the revocation of a security clearance was done with at least minimal due process. The outer boundary of "minimal due process," however, was not defined by the Board. <span class="Italic">Weissberger v. USIA</span>, 39 MSPR 370, 374-75 (1988), implied the requirements of notice, a statement of the reasons for the denial of the revocation, and an opportunity to respond:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question presented before the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> did not involve the sufficiency of the agency's internal proceedings. Indeed, Justice Blackmun's opinion for the majority framed the issue as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[M]ay the Board, when &#x00A7; 7513 is pursued, examine the merits of the security-clearance denial, or does its authority stop short of that point, that is upon review of the fact of denial, of the position's requirement of security clearance, and <span class="Italic">of the satisfactory provision of the requisite procedural protections?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">108 S. Ct. at 823 (emphasis supplied). As the agency's petition for a writ of <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> acknowledged, "[t]he government has not in the present case challenged the authority of the MSPB to review the removal and determine, as it did, that the employee received procedural due process in connection with the security clearance determination." The petition also stated the government's concurrence that the employee is, as a general matter, entitled to notice, a statement of the reasons for the denial of revocation of the clearance, and an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no basis for our reaching the contrary conclusion since the Board's review of the protections afforded do not require it to second guess security determinations committed to agency discretion. Certainly, there is nothing unusual about our review of such protections, even though we do not have review authority over the merits. <span class="Italic">See Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 470 U.S. 768, 105 S. Ct. 1620, 84 L. Ed.2d 674 (1985); <span class="Italic">Greene v. McElroy,</span> 254 F.2d 944, 953 (D.C.

We thus conclude that the administrative judge properly reviewed the agency's procedures in connection with the underlying security clearance revocation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the administrative judge correctly concluded that the agency afforded the appellant the required minimum due process. She found that the agency informed the appellant of its decision to revoke his clearance because of the State Department's Office of Medical Services' recommendation based upon its psychological evaluation of the appellant. She further found that the agency subsequently informed him that the State Department would not change its recommendation because his condition remained unchanged and he would not submit to therapy, and that, when the appellant persisted in his refusal to undergo therapy or counseling, the agency proposed his removal, but offered to reconsider if he would submit evidence that he had relented. He submitted a letter reflecting one visit to a psychiatrist, which the administrative judge found, the Office of Medical Services had reviewed and decided was not sufficient to change its recommendation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition, the appellant argues that he "was never given an opportunity to respond to the basic allegation that he suffered from a medical condition which adversely affected his ability to safeguard classified materials." Our review of the record demonstrates that this was not the case. In the appellant's submission in response to the proposal notice, he included a report by Dr. Thomas A. Mathews expressly addressing the appellant's condition. Indeed, in response to the initial revocation, the appellant had previously written to the Agency Director, requesting reinstatement of his security clearance, and attached a statement from his supervisors supporting his request. That the appellant failed to persuade the agency that he should be allowed access to classified information, even though it was willing to reconsider his removal if he submitted to therapy, does not support a finding that the agency did not afford him minimal due process, including an opportunity to respond, in connection with the underlying revocation action. Accordingly, we find this contention to be without merit.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Agencies may place appellants on indefinite suspension pending investigation of security clearance problems--when the clearance is suspended but not yet revoked--as long as they are provided minimum due process under <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v.

Although an agency could remove an employee for loss of a security clearance, it did not correctly place the employee on enforced leave if the clearance was revoked unless the employee was given the proper procedural protections. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ballance v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 381, 382 (1985). In 1993, the Board decided an indefinite suspension case, <span class="Italic">Alston v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 158, 162 (1993) (on a reconsideration petition of OPM), concluding that because there is no property right to a security clearance, the constitution does not mandate due process protections before the clearance is revoked or suspended. Then in 1994, the Board issued <span class="Italic">Kriner v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 526, 532-33 (1994), reversing this position and concluding that due process requires that an appellant be informed of, and have an opportunity to respond to, problems relating to the loss of a security clearance when the problems with the clearance, in turn, lead to an indefinite suspension. The law switched back to a constitutional due process review clearance suspension in indefinite suspensions appeals in <span class="Italic">Gargiulo v.

<p class="Body-Text">In 1994 the Federal Circuit, over the dissent of Judge Newman, reaffirmed that the Board lacks authority to review the substantive grounds for revocation of a clearance without what it described as a "colorable" claim that the clearance denial violates rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, or Ninth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. In <span class="Italic">Brockmann v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 27 F.3d 544, 546-47 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the panel majority opinion did not explain when a "colorable" constitutional claim might arise and the degree of scrutiny that would then be provided to the clearance revocation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Brockmann nevertheless argues that a decision of the Supreme Court subsequent to <span class="Italic">Egan, Webster v. Doe</span>, 486 U.S. 592, 108 S. Ct. 2047, 100 L. Ed.2d 632 (1988), supports judicial review of the constitutional claims he claims to have raised relating to withdrawal of his security clearance. <span class="Italic">Webster</span> concerned the termination of an employee by the Director of Central Intelligence pursuant to section 102(c) of the National Security Act, 50 USC &#x00A7; 403(c) (1982). The respondent brought claims under both the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 701-706 (1982 &#x0026; Supp. 1986), and the First, Fourth, Fifth and Ninth Amendments. With respect to the statutory claims, the Court reasoned that the National Security Act's "extraordinary deference to the Director in his decision to terminate individual employees," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 601, 108 S. Ct. at 2052, indicated that the "agency action is committed to agency discretion by law," as provided in 5 USC &#x00A7; 701(a)(2). Removal under the National Security Act was thus judicially unreviewable under the APA's own terms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court looked more favorably, however, upon the terminated employee's constitutional claims. The Court rejected the government's argument that the National Security Act precluded judicial review of constitutional claims, concluding that "[n]othing in &#x00A7; 102(c) persuades us that Congress meant to preclude consideration of <span class="Italic">colorable</span> constitutional claims arising out of actions of the Director pursuant to that section...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 603, 108 S. Ct. at 2054 (emphasis added). The Court remanded the ease to the district court for further adjudication of the <span class="Italic">Webster</span> respondent's colorable constitutional claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot agree with Mr. Brockmann that <span class="Italic">Webster v. Doe</span> impacts the reviewability of the substantive aspects of his removal in this case. The assertions made by Mr. Brockmann do not rise to the level of colorable constitutional claims that the Court contemplated in <span class="Italic">Webster v. Doe.</span> Mr. <span id="Page_2539"></span>Brockmann's constitutional claims which mention the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments are vaguely stated, undeveloped, and unsupported. His argument on this appeal that the adverse action was pretextual because of his known sexual preference--the argument that caught the Court's attention in <span class="Italic">Webster v.</span> <span class="Italic">Doe</span>--appears so peripherally in Mr. Brockmann's brief (in parentheses with no discussion) that it appears to be an afterthought. He further offered no rebuttal to the government's argument that no colorable claim of violation of a constitutional right of freedom of speech or association was made by Mr. Brockmann. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hill v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 818 F.2d 874 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (discrimination claim must be supported to the extent of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case in order to create a "mixed case").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that as Mr. Brockmann raised no colorable constitutional claim in terms of <span class="Italic">Webster v. Doe</span>, the holding in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> squarely controls the judicial reviewability of his appeal. Mr. Brockmann having stipulated that the standards set out in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> were satisfied, the Board's denial of his petition for review must be affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brockmann</span> discussed the decision of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Webster v. Doe</span>, 108 S. Ct. 2047, 2053-54 (1988), involving a case brought under the National Security Act to review the decision to terminate employment of a CIA employee for alleged national security reasons. The government maintained that the CIA director's discretion was judicially unreviewable. The employee sought a determination that the discretion was at least tempered by considerations of substantive or procedural constitutional due process. The Supreme Court sided with the employee to permit review of constitutional claims. The Court construed provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act that the employee urged permitted review for constitutional violations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner maintains that, no matter what the nature of respondent's constitutional claims, judicial review is precluded by the language and intent of &#x00A7; 102(c). In petitioner's view, all Agency employment termination decisions, even those based on policies normally repugnant to the Constitution, are given over to the absolute discretion of the Director, and are hence unreviewable under the APA. We do not think &#x00A7; 102(c) may be read to exclude review of constitutional claims. We emphasized in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Robison</span>, 415 U.S. 361, 94 S. Ct. 1160, 39 L. Ed.2d 389 (1974), that where Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so must be clear. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 373-374, 94 S. Ct., at 1168-1169. In <span class="Italic">Weinberger v. Salfi</span>, 422 U.S. 749, 95 S. Ct. 2457, 45 L. Ed.2d 522 (1975), we reaffirmed that view. We require this heightened showing in part to avoid the "serious constitutional question" that would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim. <span class="Italic">See Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians</span>, 476 U.S. 667, 681, n.12, 106 S. Ct. 2133, 2141-42 n.12, 90 L. Ed.2d 623 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of &#x00A7; 102(c) convinces us that it cannot bear the preclusive weight petitioner would have it support. As detailed above, the section does commit employment termination decisions to the Director's discretion, and precludes challenges to these decisions based upon the statutory language of &#x00A7; 102(c). A discharged employee thus cannot complain that his termination was not "necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States," since that assessment is the Director's alone. Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of &#x00A7; 701, however, remove from judicial review only those determinations specifically identified by Congress or "committed to agency discretion by law." Nothing in &#x00A7; 102(c) persuades us that Congress meant to preclude consideration of colorable constitutional claims arising out of the actions of the Director pursuant to that section; we believe that a constitutional claim based on an individual discharge may be reviewed by *604 the District Court.[8] We agree with the Court of Appeals that there must be further proceedings in the District Court on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Petitioner asserts, <span class="Italic">see</span> Brief for Petitioner 27-28, n.23, that respondent fails to present a colorable constitutional claim when he asserts that there is a general CIA policy against employing homosexuals. Petitioner relies on our decision in <span class="Italic">Bowers v. Hardwick</span>, 478 U.S. 186, 106 S. Ct. 2841, 92 L. Ed.2d 140 (1986), to support this view. This question was not presented in the petition for <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>, and we decline to consider it at this stage of the litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner complains that judicial review even of constitutional claims will entail extensive "rummaging around" in the Agency's affairs to the detriment of national security. <span class="Italic">See</span> Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-13. But petitioner acknowledges that Title VII claims attacking the hiring and promotion policies of the Agency are routinely entertained in federal court, <span class="Italic">see</span> Reply Brief for Petitioner 13-14; Tr. of Oral Arg. 9, and the inquiry and discovery associated with those proceedings would seem to involve some of the same sort of rummaging. Furthermore, the District Court has the latitude to control any discovery process which may be instituted so as to balance respondent's need for access to proof which would support a colorable constitutional claim against the extraordinary needs of the CIA for confidentiality and the protection of its methods, sources, and mission. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. United States District Court</span>, 426 U.S. 394, 405, 96 S. Ct. 2119, 2125, 48 L. Ed.2d 725 (1976); <span class="Italic">United States v. Reynolds</span>, 345 U.S. 1, 73 S. Ct. 528, 97 L. Ed. 727 (1953).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner also contends that even if respondent has raised a colorable constitutional claim arising out of his discharge, Congress in the interest of national security may deny the courts the authority to decide the claim and to order respondent's reinstatement if the claim is upheld. For the reasons previously stated, we do not think Congress meant to impose such restrictions when it enacted &#x00A7; 102(c) of the NSA. Even without such prohibitory legislation from Congress, of course, traditional equitable principles requiring the balancing of public and private interests control the grant of declaratory or injunctive relief in the federal courts. <span class="Italic">Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo</span>, 456 U.S. 305, 102 S. Ct. 1798, 72 L. Ed.2d 91 (1982); <span class="Italic">Hecht Co. v. Bowles</span>, 321 U.S. 321, 329-330, 64 S. Ct. 587, 591-592, 88 L. Ed. 754 (1944). On remand, the District Court should thus address respondent's constitutional claims and the propriety of the equitable remedies sought.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "colorable constitutional claim" defense suggested in <span class="Italic">Brockmann v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 27 F.3d 544, 546-47 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Johnson cannot succeed on his discrimination claim. While the AJ was not correct in stating that Johnson could not raise his discrimination claim, he merely made an unsubstantiated allegation that the agency treated him differently from another agency employee whose security clearance was also suspended as a result of entering a work furlough program. He offered no rebuttal to the government's evidence that any disparity in treatment of the two employees was due to legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons. In particular, the government presented evidence that the other employee promptly reported his arrest to his supervisor and immediately provided an employment verification form signed by his supervisor before entering his work furlough program. In contrast, Johnson did not immediately inform his supervisor of his arrest and he forged the employment verification form required for the work furlough program. Thus, Johnson failed to raise a colorable constitutional claim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Brockmann v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force</span>, 27 F.3d 544, 546-47 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequent to <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, we rendered our decision in <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>.

Finally, in another split decision, the Board again reconsidered and held that Alston was denied due process because he was never given reasons for his employment suspension with enough specificity to respond. <span class="Italic">Alston v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 19, 24 (1994). OPM appealed to this court. <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, 75 F.3d at 660.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We limited our review in <span class="Italic">Alston</span> to whether "the agency provided Alston with the procedural protection guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) when it placed him on enforced leave." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 662. We expressly noted that we were neither "reviewing the merits of the agency's decision to suspend Alston's access to classified information" nor "the procedures the agency followed in denying such access." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We stated that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">section 7513(b) entitles an employee to notice of the reasons for the suspension of his access to classified information when that is the reason for placing the employee on enforced leave pending a decision on the employee's security clearance. Such notice provides the employee with an adequate opportunity to make a meaningful reply to the agency before being placed on enforced leave. Merely providing the employee with information that his access to classified information is being suspended, without more, does not provide the employee with sufficient information to make an informed reply to the agency before being placed on enforced leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 661-62. However, we concluded that Alston had received all of the process he was due because he was "able to focus his response on <span id="Page_2540"></span>his medical status, rather than to have to guess whether the agency's action was based on disloyalty, unreliability, or other possible ground for suspension of access to classified information." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 662. We noted that Alston met with agency officials and offered medical evidence, which was considered before he was placed on enforced leave. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We therefore reversed the decision of the Board because we determined that Alston received all of the process he was due. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 663.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We decided another case growing out of the suspension of a security clearance in <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Department of State</span>, 217 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In that case, Hesse's security clearance was suspended, resulting in an indefinite suspension from employment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1374. Hesse appealed his suspension to the Board, which upheld the suspension. <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Dep't of State</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 489, 492-93 (1999). The Board explained that it could only inquire into whether the procedures required by section 7513 had been met. Proceeding on that basis, the Board held that the requirements of the statute were met because "the agency here twice advised the appellant of the specific reasons for his security clearance suspension and twice provided him an opportunity to respond to that action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 491. Thereafter, Hesse petitioned this court for review. We affirmed the decision of the Board. In so doing, we explained three principles that we drew from the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;there is no presumption that security clearance determinations will be subject to administrative or judicial review, as those determinations are committed to the broad discretion of the responsible Executive Branch agency; (2) unless Congress specifically provides otherwise, the Merit Systems Protection Board is not authorized to review security clearance determinations or agency actions based on security clearance determinations; and (3) when an agency action is challenged under the provisions of chapter 75 of title 5, the Board may determine whether a security clearance was denied, whether the security clearance was a requirement of the appellant's position, and whether the procedures set forth in section 7513 were followed, but the Board may not examine the underlying merits of the security clearance determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Hesse</span>, 217 F.3d at 1376.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The teaching we glean from <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, and <span class="Italic">Hesse</span> is this: in a case involving a suspension resulting from the suspension of a security clearance, both the Board's and this court's review is limited. Neither the Board nor this court may review the underlying merits of an agency's decision to suspend a security clearance. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 825-26; <span class="Italic">Hesse</span>, 217 F.3d at 1376; <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, 75 F.3d at 661-62. All the Board and this court may do is "determine whether a security clearance was denied, whether the security clearance was a requirement of the appellant's position, and whether the procedures set forth in section 7513 were followed." <span class="Italic">Hesse</span>, 217 F.3d at 1376. Under section 7513, the employee must receive "written notice...stating the specific reasons" for the suspension of his or her security clearance "when that is the reason" for suspending the employee "pending a decision on the employee's security clearance." <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, 75 F.3d at 661. The requirements of section 7513 are met if, as we stated in <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, the notice "provides the employee with an adequate opportunity to make a meaningful reply to the agency" before being suspended. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In other words, the employee must be given enough information to enable him or her to make a meaningful response to the agency's proposed suspension of the security clearance. "Merely providing the employee with information that his access to classified information is being suspended, without more, does not provide the employee with sufficient information to make an informed reply to the agency" before being suspended. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 662.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the case before us, we hold that the procedural requirements of section 7513 were not met. The Board itself found that the DEA did not provide any specific information regarding the time frame of Mr. Cheney's alleged misconduct, and "did not identify any specific queries of the data base [sic] nor did the agency describe the manner in which [Mr. Cheney] abused the administrative subpoena process." These findings by the Board are undisputed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our view, the Board's own findings demonstrate that the requirements of section 7513, as explained in <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, were not met in this case. Indeed, at oral argument, counsel for the government forthrightly acknowledged that the reasons given to Mr. Cheney for the suspension of his security clearance were "vague." First, the DEA told Mr. Cheney that his security clearance was being suspended "based on allegations of potentially derogatory personal conduct and possible violations of law and DEA standards of conduct." The notice of suspension also stated that Mr. Cheney had "failed to comply with security regulations" and that he had "demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty and/or rule violations." We fail to see how Mr. Cheney could have made a meaningful response to such broad and unspecific allegations when there was no indication of when his alleged conduct took place or what it involved. Nor do we think that it was possible for Mr. Cheney to make a meaningful response based upon the information that he was given in Mr. Johnson's memorandum of November 17, 2004. In his memorandum, Mr. Johnson stated that Mr. Cheney had "inappropriately queried or caused to be queried Law Enforcement Data Bases," had "abused the Administrative Subpoena process," and had acted "in violation" of the confidentiality agreement into which he had entered with OPR during its investigation. In our view, the November 17 memorandum was akin to informing Mr. Cheney that his security clearance was being suspended because he had robbed a bank, without telling him where the bank was and when he had robbed it, particularly in view of the fact that it is undisputed that Mr. Cheney regularly had reason to cause the database to be queried. Mr. Cheney clearly was not entitled to the detailed information that HRM requested. <span class="Italic">Egan</span> clearly bars the kind of civil case discovery that HRM sought for Mr. Cheney. Mr. Cheney, however, was entitled to more information about the allegations against him than he received.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem is that the limited information provided to Mr. Cheney put him in the position where, for all intents and purposes, he had to "guess" at the reason for his security clearance suspension. <span class="Italic">See Alston</span>, 75 F.3d at 662 ("[The employee] was...able to focus his response...rather than have to <span class="Italic">guess</span> whether the agency's action was based on disloyalty, unreliability, or other possible ground for suspension of access to classified information." (emphasis added)). While Mr. Cheney was told, in general terms, the reasons for the suspension of his security clearance, he was not given the allegations that supposedly supported those reasons so that he could make a meaningful response to the proposed suspension. For example, he was not told what the nature of his alleged derogatory personal conduct was. Neither was he told what laws and DEA standards of conduct he had violated, or when he had allegedly improperly caused the database to be queried. Thus, Mr. Cheney's case is distinguishable from that of the employee in <span class="Italic">Alston</span>. The employee in <span class="Italic">Alston</span> was told that his security clearance was being suspended because he "possibly suffered from a medical condition which requires further investigation and evaluation." 75 F.3d at 659. The employee thus knew that he had to focus on <span class="Italic">his own</span> medical condition in order to respond to the agency's action. However, Mr. Cheney, while he was told the general nature of the allegations against him, was not given the minimal information he needed to respond to those allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we do not agree with the government that acceptance of Mr. Cheney's arguments on appeal would amount to a holding that DEA had to prove that Mr. Cheney committed the acts under investigation before suspending him from his position. All we hold today is that DEA failed to provide Mr. Cheney with the information he needed to make "a meaningful response" to the charges against him. Had DEA provided Mr. Cheney with that information, considered his response to the charges against him, and then suspended his security clearance, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> would have barred review of the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that, in suspending Mr. Cheney, the DEA failed to meet the procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513.[3]. Cheney's indefinite suspension was therefore improper, and he is entitled to recover back pay for the period of the improper suspension. <span class="Italic">See Gose v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 451 F.3d 831, 840 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("Accordingly, Gose is to be immediately reinstated to his position, with back pay and credit, for all purposes, for the period of his improper removal from the Postal Service."); <span class="Italic">McFarland v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 161, 165-66 (1994) (ordering back pay when the protections of section 7513 were not provided in suspending an employee).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Board's conclusion that Mr. Cheney received the notice to which he was entitled under section 7513 because he was told that his employment suspension was based on his security clearance plainly is at odds with what we said in <span class="Italic">Alston</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 75 F.3d at 661-62.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Relying on <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>, <span class="Italic">Lucena v. DOJ,</span> <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1974.Opinion.3-3-2020_1543740.pdf">802 Fed. Appx. 585</a>, 589-90 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), discerned no due process violation through an alleged denial of information in a proposed indefinite suspension based on a clearance suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...First, Mr. Lucena argues that the Notice "did not afford [him]...sufficient reasons...for his clearance suspension[,]" likening his situation to that in <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>. Pet'r's Br. 21 (citing <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>, 479 F.3d at 1352-53). Mr. Lucena's reliance on <span class="Italic">Cheney</span> is inapt. In <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>, we concluded that the DEA had not met the procedural requirements of &#x00A7; 7513(b) because it had provided the impacted employee with only "broad and unspecific allegations" without any "indication of when his alleged conduct took place or what it involved[,]" leaving him unable to make "a meaningful response." 479 F.3d at 1352. There, the DEA had not provided "any specific information regarding the time frame" of the alleged conduct or the specific nature of the conduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. That is not the case here. The Notice provided specific times and specific allegations of misconduct. Mr. Lucena was not left to "guess at the reason" for his proposed suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mr. Lucena contends that the Notice was insufficient because it "omitted material facts that [Mr. Lucena's] counsel relied on in drafting a reply." This argument is without merit. The Notice was not required to "include explicitly every element of every charge underlying the proposed action." <span class="Italic">Brook</span>, 999 F.2d at 526-27. Accordingly, the MSPB did <span id="Page_2541"></span>not err in concluding that the DOJ gave Mr. Lucena sufficient notice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) of his proposed indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coghlan v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-16-0163-I-1 (NP 9/16/2016) (in an indefinite suspension based on a suspension of access to classified information, the employee received statutory due process to information supporting the proposal when he was aware, through receipt of an investigation or report of investigation, providing the reasons for the loss of access).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But just when it seemed clear that the Board is properly called upon to consider due process implications of removals associated with clearance revocations, the Federal Circuit decided <span class="Italic">Robinson v. DHS</span>, 498 F.3d 1361, 1364-66 (Fed. Cir. 2007), seemingly denying the appellant the right to contest before the Board whether the termination of his security clearance was predetermined by agency officials, allegedly in violation of constitutional--as opposed to statutory--due process protections:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Government notes, and contrary to Mr. Robinson's argument and what appears to be the MSPB's view, security clearance decisions are not reviewable for "minimum due process protection." We consistently have held that a federal employee does not have a liberty or property interest in access to classified information, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223, 1225-26 (Fed. Cir. 1992), and therefore the revocation of a security clearance does not implicate constitutional procedural due process concerns. <span class="Italic">See Hesse v. Dep't of State</span>, 217 F.3d 1372, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("[T]he Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment has no application to a proceeding to review an employee's security clearance."). The opportunity a government employee may have for access to top secret or other classified information is not subject to due process procedural protections but rather is subject to the applicable statutes and regulations for issuing and revoking such clearances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his reply brief Mr. Robinson shifts ground and argues that he seeks only the minimal due process required under &#x00A7; 7513, the statute regarding removal actions. But in an adverse employment action, such as removal, based on failure to maintain the security clearance required by the job description, the absence of a properly authorized security clearance is fatal to the job entitlement. Mr. Robinson's case is not one that falls into the interstices of the &#x00A7; 7513 process such as the suspension cases of <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span> and <span class="Italic">Cheney v. Department of Justice</span>. We need not address the full scope of those earlier cases nor is it our task as a panel to reconsider the correctness of those decisions. However, in Mr. Robinson's case, the revocation of his security clearance was a completed matter in which he fully participated, so that its absence became a matter of record before the MSPB on which the MSPB could rely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that, even if the issue of whether the revocation of Mr. Robinson's security clearance was predetermined were properly before us, the record does not demonstrate that Mr. Edwards' proposed testimony would show such bias on the part of agency personnel responsible for deciding whether to revoke Mr. Robinson's security clearance as to affect the decision. Mr. Edwards' conclusion that the decision regarding Mr. Robinson's security clearance was predetermined appears to be based on his "personal impressions"--he was aware of one or two conversations between the Special Agent in Charge of the Little Rock Field Office and headquarters officials prior to the February 2004 suspension of the security clearance, and he was unaware of any follow-up investigation after that time. It should surprise no one that the local agent in charge would confer in advance before suspending a fellow agent of long-standing in the Service, and whether Mr. Edwards would be in the chain of command once the investigation was underway is not made known.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor do Mr. Edwards' statements demonstrate that any particular decision maker at the agency was incapable of judging fairly on the merits whether Mr. Robinson's security clearance should be revoked, nor do they show that a decision was made without consideration of the relevant information. They merely confirm what the other evidence of record already indicates: as a result of an investigation into Mr. Robinson's conduct, agency officials concluded that Mr. Robinson's behavior raised enough concerns to suspend, and subsequently revoke, his security clearance. Therefore, even if the alleged "predetermination" of Mr. Robinson's security clearance revocation was within the scope of the MSPB's review, the exclusion of Mr. Edwards' testimony was not an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See Guise v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 300 F.3d 1376, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("A determination to allow or exclude witness testimony is within the sound discretion of the administrative judge.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Judge Rader concurred with the result in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, but he made clear that the Board and the Federal Circuit "lack jurisdiction to review security clearance removal processes at all." Judge Rader made clear that he believed <span class="Italic">Cheney</span> was incorrectly decided. Judge Plager offered a more extensive concurring opinion that placed other cases, including <span class="Italic">Cheney,</span> into context by noting the distinctions between an indefinite suspension, based on suspension of a clearance pending investigation, and Robinson's case, involving termination resulting from final revocation of the clearance. Judge Plager argued, 498 F.3d at 1368-70:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Robinson contends that, according to our decision in <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, &#x00A7; 7513(b) requires that he be given the opportunity to present a meaningful reply to the agency's charges and therefore he must be permitted to present evidence before the MSPB that the revocation of his security clearance was predetermined. To the contrary, the holding in <span class="Italic">Alston</span> is limited to a particular factual situation and is inapplicable to Mr. Robinson's case. In <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, the agency temporarily suspended the employee's security clearance and placed the employee on unpaid leave pending completion of an investigation and adjudication as to whether his security clearance should be revoked.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The employee challenged the action, and the MSPB, after some indecision, held that the employee had been denied the statutory protections of &#x00A7; 7513(b), governing adverse employment actions, because of the agency's failure to provide adequate notice of the reasons for the suspension of the security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, we agreed with the MSPB that the agency must provide some indication of the reasons for an agency's decision to suspend access to classified information before placing an employee on enforced leave. We found authority for this requirement in &#x00A7; 7513(b), which we said "entitles an employee to notice of the reasons for the suspension of his access to classified information when that is the reason for placing the employee on enforced leave pending a decision on the employee's security clearance." <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, 75 F.3d at 661. The point was, as the MSPB had noted, to provide the employee with an adequate opportunity to make a meaningful reply to the agency before an adverse employment action was taken, even though that meant looking into the security clearance itself. However, we disagreed with the MSPB on the facts of the case and held that the employee had sufficient notice. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 662.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>, the MSPB in a similar situation held that the employee had been given adequate notice of the reasons for the security clearance action. The employee was indefinitely suspended from employment by the agency because his security clearance had been suspended, based on allegations of "derogatory personal conduct," pending an investigation. 479 F.3d at 1345. The employee challenged the agency action before the MSPB, arguing that he had not been able to prepare a meaningful response to the adverse action because the agency had given him only a generalized vague notice of the reasons for suspending his security clearance. The MSPB upheld the agency action on the ground that, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the employee's challenge was to the merits of the security clearance decision, and therefore was barred by <span class="Italic">Egan</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reversed. Citing <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, we noted that, under &#x00A7; 7513, an employee must receive written notice stating the specific reasons for the suspension of his security clearance when that is the reason for suspending the employee pending a decision on the employee's security clearance. <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>, 479 F.3d at 1352. On the basis of the MSPB's factual findings, and the Government's concession that the reasons given were indeed "vague," we held that the requirements of &#x00A7; 7513 were not met. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1352-53. The dissenting judge, noting the tension that exists between security clearance determinations that are not reviewable and adverse actions that are, considered the information given the employee about his security clearance issue sufficient to meet the <span class="Italic">Alston</span> standard. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1354-59 (McKinney, C.J., dissenting).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rule created to deal with the <span class="Italic">Alston</span> and <span class="Italic">Cheney</span> problem is a narrow one that applies when the agency has decided to suspend the employee from his position because his security clearance has been suspended and there is a continuing investigation into whether the security clearance should be revoked. <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>, 479 F.3d at 1351-52. The rationale is that there is an ongoing investigative and adjudicative process regarding the security clearance in which the employee can participate. The employee should therefore have the opportunity to address the agency's concerns and allegations before being subjected to an adverse action--indefinite suspension of employment--based on the suspension, but not yet the revocation, of his security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The case before us is different from <span class="Italic">Alston</span> and <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>. The agency did not take its adverse employment action against Mr. Robinson until after it revoked his security clearance. That is, the revocation of Mr. Robinson's security clearance and the adverse action against him--his removal from employment--were seriatim, the first completed before the second began. Furthermore, once the investigation began into whether there were grounds for revoking his security clearance, the procedures established under Executive Order 12,968 for security clearance revocations, but not suspensions, were invoked, and the record indicates these were fully implemented. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 12,968 &#x00A7; 5.2(a), 60 Fed. Reg. 40,245, 40,252 (Aug. 2, 1995). Unlike Mr. Cheney, Mr. Robinson was given a detailed explanation of why the agency had decided his security clearance should be revoked, and he was afforded the rights specified in the Executive Order. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 5.2(a)(1) (providing that an employee undergoing review proceedings concerning the revocation of his security clearance should be given "as comprehensive and detailed a written description of the basis for that conclusion as the national <span id="Page_2542"></span>security interests of the United States and other applicable laws permit"). Mr. Robinson then had the opportunity to participate in the security clearance determination process to its conclusion, including review by the agency's internal Security Appeals Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, in a case such as this in which the agency made a final decision on the employee's eligibility for a security clearance after following the applicable procedures before it pursued an adverse action, the problem presented by <span class="Italic">Cheney</span> and <span class="Italic">Alston</span> is not present. Then, when the adverse action followed--the agency terminated Mr. Robinson's employment--Mr. Robinson was entitled to the procedural protections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 with respect to his removal, but &#x00A7; 7513(b) does not require any additional process with regard to the earlier security clearance determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the <span class="Italic">per curiam</span> opinion, we followed the court's summary discussion noted at the beginning of this concurrence with the conclusory sentence that, in Mr. Robinson's case, "the revocation of his security clearance was a completed matter in which he fully participated, so that its absence became a matter of record before the MSPB on which the MSPB could rely." With the explanation given above, that sentence correctly captures the state of our law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board, following <span class="Italic">Cheney,</span> affirmed the significance of due process (both statutory and regulatory) in indefinite suspension cases involving clearance suspensions, <span class="Italic">Rothlisberger v. Dept. of Army</span>, 111 MSPR 662, 667-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14, 2009 MSPB 141 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b), an individual is entitled to 30 days' advance written notice of the reasons for the suspension of her access to classified information when that is the reason for placing her on suspension pending a decision on her security clearance. <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 661 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The agency's notice must provide the employee with specific reasons for the proposed action and provide her with sufficient information to make an informed reply to the agency. <span class="Italic">Romero v. Department of Defense</span>, 527 F.3d 1324, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2008). In other words, the employee must be given enough information to enable him or her to make a meaningful response to the agency's proposed suspension of the security clearance. <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>, 479 F.3d at 1352. "Merely providing the employee with information that his access to classified information is being suspended, without more, does not provide the employee with sufficient information to make an informed reply to the agency" before being suspended. <span class="Italic">King</span>, 75 F.3d at 662. Additionally, under section 7513(b), the employee is entitled to a reasonable time, but not less than 7 days, to answer orally or in writing and to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer, to be represented by an attorney or other representative, and to receive a written decision and the specific reasons therefore at the earliest practicable date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, section 7513 is not the only source of procedural protections for employees subject to adverse actions related to security clearance matters; agencies also must follow the procedures established by their own regulations. <span class="Italic">Romero</span>, 527 F.3d at 1328 (citing <span class="Italic">Drumheller v. Department of the Army</span>, 49 F.3d 1566, 1569-73 (Fed. Cir. 1995)). In the event that an agency does not follow its own regulations, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) provides that the Board may not sustain an adverse action if the employee shows harmful error in the agency's application of its procedures in arriving at its decision. <span class="Italic">Romero</span>, 527 F.3d at 1328. Finally, when reviewing a case involving an indefinite suspension without pay pending the completion of a security clearance investigation, the court in <span class="Italic">Cheney</span> also stated that the Board may determine "whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible." <span class="Italic">Cheney,</span> 479 F.3d at 1350.</p>

Cir. 2007), the court held that the <span class="Italic">suspension</span> of an appellant's clearance was subject to a review by the Board as to whether the procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 were followed. <span class="Italic">See Alston</span>, 75 F.3d at 661 (holding that "section 7513(b) entitles an employee to notice of the reasons for the suspension of his access to classified information when that is the reason for placing the employee on enforced leave pending a decision on the employee's security clearance"); <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>, 479 F.3d at 1351-52 (holding that "in a case involving a suspension resulting from the suspension of a security clearance," the Board may "determine whether the procedures set forth in section 7513 were followed" with respect to the security clearance); <span class="Italic">see also Hesse v. Department of State</span>, 217 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The explanation provided by the <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> court for this distinction in Board authority between suspended and revoked clearances is that because a fully revoked security clearance is a completed matter in which the employee would have been given the ability to participate, a revocation is a "matter of record before the MSPB on which the MSPB [can] rely." <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, 498 F.3d at 1365. Because the agency's decision to revoke the appellant's security clearance was final, the <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> holding applies in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rahgozar v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 118 MSPR 37, 40-41 &#x00B6; 8, 2012 MSPB 55 (2012), remanding a removal case for analysis of the regulatory protections that may have been required as to a proceeding, initiated before removal, to reinstate the appellant's clearance, summarized due process considerations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In particular, the employee suffering the adverse action is entitled to enough information to enable him or her to make a meaningful response to the loss of his security clearance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cheney v. Department of Justice</span>, 479 F.3d 1343, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Rothlisberger v. Department of the Army</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 13 (2009). The Board may then determine whether cause existed, whether the clearance was actually denied, and whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530. In addition, the Board may determine whether the agency afforded the employee minimum due process with respect to his constitutionally protected property interest in his employment. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). Moreover, an agency must also follow its own regulations regarding security clearance decisions. <span class="Italic">Romero v. Department of Defense</span>, 527 F.3d 1324, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (<span class="Italic">Romero I</span>); <span class="Italic">Rothlisberger</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 14.")</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stoyanov v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 110 MSPR 586, 2009 MSPB 29 (2009) (separate opinion of Chairman McPhie: "This case stands at the intersection of <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v.

Under <span class="Italic">Cheney,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) 'entitles an employee to notice of the reasons for the suspension of his access to classified information when that is the reason for placing the employee on enforced leave pending a decision on the employee's security clearance.' 479 F.3d at 1351"; the opinion traces the evolution of due process cases in the indefinite suspension context at n.2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We return, however, to <span class="Italic">Gargiulo v. DHS</span>, <span class="blue">727 F.3d 1181</span> (Fed. Cir. 2013), seemingly removing constitutional due process as an element of the clearance review process leading to an indefinite suspension, suggesting little or no Board review of underlying agency clearance determinations should the due process requirements of Executive Order 12968 not be met. Barring any change from past practice, at a minimum the Board will exercise its limited review to determine whether or not a clearance was required, if it was revoked, and if there was a requirement of reassignment to a nonsensitive position in lieu of removal, as provided by <span class="Italic">Egan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 28 MSPR 509, 522-23 (1985), and in the decisions discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-15-084.html#sec8-84">Reassignment to Nonsensitive Position; Mitigation</a>." Procedural failings not relevant to the essential <span class="Italic">Egan</span> determinants appear to be of little consequence in the MSPB review process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gessner v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3184) (as to the assertion that the Board denied the appellant discovery, that "the Board's due process inquiry is limited, in a security clearance determination, to ascertaining whether notice and an opportunity to be heard were given...."); <span class="Italic">Norrup v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 87 MSPR 444, 446 &#x00B6; 4 (2001) ("When an agency action based on the denial, suspension, or revocation of a security clearance is challenged under the provisions of chapter 75 of title 5, the Board may determine whether a security clearance was denied, whether it was a requirement of the appellant's position, and whether the procedures set forth at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513 were followed.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whatever their source, due process considerations do not ensure an error-free opportunity to respond to the agency's notice of intent to revoke a clearance. The errors of an employee's counsel do not detract from the due process provided by the employee. The process due amounts to an opportunity to respond to a proposed clearance revocation. The agency's adverse action will not be set aside because the employee's attorney failed to take advantage of the opportunity to respond to a letter of intent to revoke a clearance, <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 118 Fed. Appx. 495, 496-98 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The thrust of Ms. Brewer's appeal to the Board was that her counsel's failure to respond to the LOI, which possibly contributed to her removal, should not be attributed to her, notwithstanding the bed-rock rule of American jurisprudence that a client is responsible for the errors of her attorney. <span class="Italic">See Link v. Wabash R.R. Co.</span>, 370 U.S. 626, 633-34, 82 S. Ct. 1386, 8 L. Ed.2d 734 (1962). Ms. Brewer argued that under Board law, she cannot be held responsible for the acts of her counsel when her counsel engaged in negligent behavior and deceived her into believing that counsel was properly representing the client's interests. The Board law upon which Ms. Brewer relied allows the Board to waive its own procedural rules in instances where it determines that the client suffered from negligent and deceitful action by the attorney. The pertinent Board law imposes on the client a duty to be diligent even where the attorney is behaving in a negligent and deceitful manner, by requiring that the client monitor the progress of her appeal by repeated inquiries to counsel about the progress of the case. <span class="Italic">See Lamb v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 68 <span id="Page_2543"></span>M.S.P.R. 500 (1995) (holding that a client's actions monitoring her counsel were not sufficiently diligent so as to excuse her from responsibility for the attorney's misconduct); <span class="Italic">Laube v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, M.S.P.R. 643, 645-46 (1996) (holding that because the client "actively monitored her appeal and was led by her attorney to believe that her response had been timely filed," she was released from the misconduct of her attorney).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The gist of Ms. Brewer's argument way that unless she is excused from the misconduct of her attorney, the process afforded to her by the agency in deciding to revoke her security clearance failed to meet the minimum standards of due process of law, as required by Board precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board reviewed the facts of the case in light of its precedent and concluded that the agency had given Ms. Brewer adequate due process by giving her notice of the charges against her and ample opportunity to rebut them. The Board further concluded that Ms. Brewer had not sufficiently monitored her attorney's behavior to warrant excuse from the attorney's failure to respond to the LOI. The Board thus upheld the agency's decision to remove Ms. Brewer, and she timely sought review in this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must affirm the final decision of the Board, unless we determine that it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c)(1) (2000). When the Board's decision rests on findings of fact, we must accept those findings if supported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7703(c)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Brewer concedes that no response to the LOI was filed. But she attributes that failure to the misconduct of her attorney, and she argues that her attorney's misconduct deceived her into thinking that response to the LOI had in fact been filed. Nonetheless, she asserts that she sufficiently monitored the conduct of her attorney so as to be released from the consequences of her attorney's misconduct, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Laube</span>. In response, the agency argues that the Board correctly determined that the facts of this case more nearly resemble those in <span class="Italic">Lamb</span>. The agency thus argues in support of the Board's final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case does not deal with a decision by the Board to excuse untimely filings in the process of its own cases. The precedent upon which Ms. Brewer, the agency and the Board relied in this case is inapplicable to the question of whether the agency must release a client from the consequences of attorney misconduct when the attorney's actions deceive the client, even though she may be diligently monitoring the legal process in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The law of the land is clear. Misbehavior of an attorney is taxed to the client. <span class="Italic">Link</span>, 370 U.S. at 633-34, 82 S. Ct. 1386. The law in our circuit is the same, and is equally clear. When a client relies in good faith on incorrect advice, the client is bound by the actions of the attorney. <span class="Italic">See Massingale v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 736 F.2d 1521, 1523 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In <span class="Italic">Rowe v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, we were faced with a client who placed good faith reliance on the lawyer who negligently failed to meet a filing deadline at the Board. 802 F.2d 434 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Citing <span class="Italic">Link</span>, we stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Therefore, Rowe cannot escape the consequences of the lateness of his appeal that was filed by his union attorney after the deadline, even though Rowe himself acted in good faith in relying on the advice and actions of his attorney.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 437.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the clarity of the law which burdens the client with the misbehavior of the attorney, the Board has decided that, in some circumstances, for purposes of its own filing deadlines, it will excuse the client from deceptive conduct of the attorney. We have no cause in this case to decide whether the Board's discretion over its own procedure is sufficiently broad so as to allow it to adopt a more generous rule in instances of attorney misconduct than is otherwise applicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Until such a time that the agency decides for itself that it will apply a more generous test in these circumstances, the otherwise clear law applies: the client suffers the mistakes of the attorney.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency afforded Ms. Brewer more than minimal due process. Ms. Brewer was notified of the charges against her, and was clearly instructed in the LOI on how she could respond. Her failure to respond led to her security clearance revocation and then to her removal. In this civil setting, she could not even argue constitutional entitlement to counsel. So long as she was afforded a due process opportunity to meet the charges, due process required no more. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed.2d 494 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's error in applying law applicable to its own procedural rules is harmless, because under the correct test, Ms. Brewer cannot mount a due process objection to her removal (through an attack on the revocation of her security clearance) based on her good faith reliance on her attorney, whose representation may have proved harmful to her case....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Returning to the appeal not implicating constitutional due process issues but based on the appellant's assertion that the agency revoked a clearance as a pretext to remove an employee who, the appellant asserted, should have been given the due process and appellate process available for a conduct-based removal, <span class="Italic">Blackford v. USPS</span>, DA-3443-14-0329-I-1 (NP 10/31/2014), rejected any review role for the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant repeats his argument, made below, that there are no legitimate security issues that justify the revocation of his security clearance, and that the agency revoked his security clearance to effectuate a conduct-based removal that was insulated from Board review. The administrative judge correctly found that the Board lacks jurisdiction to review the merits of an agency's decision to revoke a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 526-34 (1988); <span class="Italic">see also Flores v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2014). The appellant's arguments that the revocation of his security clearance was unjustified and that his clearance was revoked as a pretext to remove him from his position go to the merits of his security clearance determination and are not reviewable by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Romero v. Department of Defense</span>, 527 F.3d 1324, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (upholding the Board's rejection of an appellant's argument that the revocation of a security clearance was retaliatory).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 1985, it was the law that should an action be taken against an employee because the employee's security clearance was revoked, the Board reviewed the propriety of the agency revocation during its consideration of the appeal from the adverse action based on the revocation. The Board's analysis of its jurisdiction followed the court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Hoska v. Dept. of Army</span>, 677 F.2d 131 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (citing <span class="Italic">Gayer v. Schlesinger</span>, 490 F.2d 740 (D.C. Cir. 1973))<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Brandt v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 36, 39-40 (1984) (analyzing the merits and nexus of the clearance revocation and the removal that followed the revocation); <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. Dept. of Army</span>, 16 MSPR 642, 645 (1983) (remanding for development of evidence under <span class="Italic">Hoska</span> standards). In most security clearance cases, <span class="Italic">Hoska</span> noted, the courts specifically insisted upon a rational nexus between the denial or withdrawal of the individual's security clearance and the individual's ability to protect classified information. It appeared that minimal due process for security clearance revocation did not require an agency hearing if the removal was accomplished under 5 USC 7512 rather than under 5 USC 7532. <span class="Italic">Holtcamp v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 66, 68 (1985). [Refer to the Federal Circuit's decision, <span class="Italic">Gargiulo v.
