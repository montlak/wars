<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-16"><span class="space">a.</span> Review Request by OPM</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 7703(d), OPM may request the Federal Circuit (or, under the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 amendments, any circuit court for whistleblower cases) to consider any case decided by the Board if the Director of OPM determines that the Board decision erroneously interprets a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management, and if the Director determines that the decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, or regulation. Unlike 5 USC 7701, requiring that when OPM intervenes in an appeal the disputed regulation must be under OPM's jurisdiction, there is no comparable limitation on the authority of OPM to petition for judicial review, although OPM must first seek reconsideration by the Board before seeking review with the Federal Circuit. Under 7703, the Director acts to protect the interests of a respondent agency or to protect the interests of the civil service as a whole. <span class="Italic">Horner v. Schuck</span>, 843 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (reviewing MSPB's application of a collective bargaining agreement's provisions affecting preference eligible postal employees). [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-232.html#sec5-231">OPM Reconsideration Requests</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7703(d) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;Except as provided under paragraph (2), this paragraph shall apply to any review obtained by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. The Director may obtain review of any final order or decision of the Board by filing, within 60 days after the Board issues notice of the final order or decision of the Board, a petition for judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit if the Director determines, in the discretion of the Director, that the Board erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management and that the Board's decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive. If the Director did not intervene in a matter before the Board, the Director may not petition for review of a Board decision under this section unless the Director first petitions the Board for a reconsideration of its decision, and such petition is denied. In addition to the named respondent, the Board and all other parties to the proceedings before the Board shall have the right to appear in the proceeding before the Court of Appeals. The granting of the petition for judicial review shall be at the discretion of the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5177"></span>(2)&#x2003;This paragraph shall apply to any review obtained by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management that raises no challenge to the Board's disposition of allegations of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b) other than practices described in section 2302(b)(8), or 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D). The Director may obtain review of any final order or decision of the Board by filing, within 60 days after the Board issues notice of the final order or decision of the Board, a petition for judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or any court of appeals of competent jurisdiction if the Director determines, in the discretion of the Director, that the Board erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management and that the Board's decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive. If the Director did not intervene in a matter before the Board, the Director may not petition for review of a Board decision under this section unless the Director first petitions the Board for a reconsideration of its decision, and such petition is denied. In addition to the named respondent, the Board and all other parties to the proceedings before the Board shall have the right to appear in the proceeding before the court of appeals. The granting of the petition for judicial review shall be at the discretion of the court of appeals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 amendments allow for review of some whistleblower cases in the regional circuit courts of appeal. Section 108 of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 amendments permit an appellant or OPM to secure review of those cases in circuit appellate courts. That provision, first of limited duration, was extended a couple times and now appears a permanent feature of the law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Director of OPM may petition for review of a Board decision irrespective of whether the Board's jurisdiction is original (e.g., a Special Counsel disciplinary case), or appellate. OPM may seek review of a decision, and the controversy will not be considered moot even if some charges were dismissed and others closed out by the Board through a settlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Horner v. MSPB</span>, 815 F.2d 668, 671 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Lachance v. MSPB</span>, 147 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (OPM reconsideration petition survived employee's death). OPM requests for judicial review of arbitration awards are considered under the same process as are OPM requests for review of MSPB cases<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Devine v. Brisco</span>, 733 F.2d 867 (Fed. Cir. 1984). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-24-081.html#sec17-77">Review of Arbitration Awards</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-24-090.html#sec17-86">Review Sought by OPM</a>."] Federal agencies lack standing to seek affirmation of an MSPB decision in federal court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Magee v. USPS</span>, 903 F. Supp. 1022 (W.D. La. 1995). Federal Circuit Rule 47.9 (2021) governs the format and content of a petition for judicial review by the OPM Director.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Horner v. MSPB</span>, 815 F.2d 668, 671 (Fed. Cir. 1987), explained that the authority of OPM to seek judicial review of a Board decision was not impeded by a settlement between the parties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a preliminary matter, the board argues that this appeal cannot be sustained because the board dismissed Count I and adopted the proposed settlement of Count II and thus left no live case or controversy. We reject this suggestion of mootness insofar as OPM is concerned. A case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome. <span class="Italic">Powell v. McCormack,</span> 395 U.S. 486, 496-97, 89 S. Ct. 1944, 1950-51, 23 L. Ed.2d 491 (1969); <span class="Italic">United States v. Associated Dry Goods Corp.,</span> 682 F.2d 212, 213 (CCPA 1982). For the following reasons, we conclude that the judicial resolution of the issue of OSC's jurisdiction raised in this appeal remains live and is properly appealable by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has been given a statutory right to seek judicial review of any final order or decision of the board that is determined by the Director of OPM to be an erroneous interpretation of a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management and to have a substantial impact on such law, rule, or regulation. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7703(d) (1982). Standing to initiate or maintain an action may be granted by statute. In <span class="Italic">Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp</span>, 397 U.S. 150, 154, 90 S. Ct. 827, 830, 25 L. Ed.2d 184 (1970), the Court stated that "Congress can, of course, resolve the question [of standing] one way or another, save as the requirements of Article III dictate otherwise." (Citation omitted.) <span class="Italic">Accord Warth v. Seldin,</span> 422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 2206, 45 L. Ed.2d 343 (1975). As a result, OPM is authorized to initiate and maintain this appeal. We have no question that the issue of the OSC's authority to bring a general disciplinary action against an employee, and in turn the issue of the board's jurisdiction to hear such a case, the latter being dependent on the former, is of vital interest to OPM, which has administrative responsibility for personnel practices and policies throughout most parts of government. These interests are more than sufficient to satisfy the section 7703(d) requirements and any Article III case or controversy requirement. Since OPM has standing and interests which are adversely affected by the board's decision, this case is properly before this court to resolve the issue of OSC's authority to initiate a general disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Williams did not appeal the board's decision, the disciplinary action against him will be a nullity if we overturn the board's decision regarding OSC's authority. There is no requirement, however, that Williams must appeal in order for OPM to seek appeal. As stated, OPM has its own, independent statutory authority to petition for review in this court of final orders and decisions of the MSPB which meet the requirements of section 7703(d). Accordingly, the fact that Williams settled Count II and did not appeal the board's determination on Count I is irrelevant to OPM's right to appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are two additional related issues bearing on the propriety of OPM's appeal that do not require extensive treatment. The first of these is whether Sec. 1206(e)(1)(D) is a "civil service law" appealable under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7703(d) (1982). The placement of Sec. 1206(e)(1)(D) within Title 5, its enactment as part of the CSRA, and its bearing on civil servants demonstrate that Sec. 1206(e)(1)(D) is a civil service law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second additional issue is whether the Director of the OPM can petition for judicial review of a final decision or order of the MSPB under Sec. 7703(d) where the MSPB issued the decision under its original jurisdiction. Both the plain reading of Sec. 7703(d) and the legislative history support the conclusion that the Director may petition for review regardless of whether the MSPB's jurisdiction is original or appellate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 672 F.2d 150 (D.C. Cir. 1982), the court adopted the literal and broad meaning of the provision of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7703(a)(1) (1982) allowing an employee to appeal a "final order or decision" of the board.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 160. The court in <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> rejected the board's argument that there are limitations on the availability of the section 7703(a)(1) appeal by an employee. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The analysis in <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> is helpful to us in that the language involved in section 7703(a)(1) allowing an employee judicial review of a "final order or decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board" is the same as that in section 7703(d) concerning the right of the Director to petition for review of any "final order or decision" of the board. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7703(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of any reference in the legislative history to a limitation on the authority of the OPM to appeal, and in light of the clarity of the language in section 7703(d) and the absence of conflict with other provisions, we decline to limit the appellate authority of the OPM.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit permitted OPM to proceed with judicial review of a Board decision that was remanded to an AJ. The court determined that the policy issue presented by the case was finally determined by the Board and ripe for judicial consideration in <span class="Italic">Berry v. Conyers</span>, 435 Fed. Appx. 943, 943-45 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>, <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d 1148 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (dissent by Judge Dyk, joined by Judges Newman and Reyna)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) petitions for review of an order of the Merit Systems Protection Board pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d). Rhonda K. Conyers, Devon Haughton Northover, and the Board respond and move to dismiss the petition. OPM replies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conyers and Northover were indefinitely suspended and demoted, respectively, from their positions with the Department of Defense after they were found ineligible to occupy noncritical sensitive national security positions because of national security concerns. Conyers and Northover separately appealed the agency's actions. In both appeals, the agency argued that, because the respondents' positions were designated noncritical sensitive by the agency, under the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy v. Egan,</span> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), the Board could not review the merits of the agency's decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> the Supreme Court held that the Board does not have the authority to review the substance of an underlying decision to deny or revoke a security clearance in the course of reviewing an adverse action. The administrative law judge in Conyers' case found that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> did not apply, but granted the agency's motion to certify the issue for interlocutory appeal. The administrative law judge in Northover's case found that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> did apply, and also certified the issue for interlocutory appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 22, 2010, the Board affirmed the administrative law judge's decision in Conyers and reversed the decision in Northover, concluding that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> "limits the Board's review of an otherwise appealable adverse action only if that action is based upon a denial, revocation, or suspension of... access to classified information or eligibility for such access." Because Conyers' and Northover's appeals did not specifically involve the denial of a security clearance, the Board concluded it had authority to review the merits of the agency's decisions. The Board then remanded both cases and directed the administrative law judges to adjudicate the cases under the general applicable standard the Board applies in adverse action appeals. OPM moved for reconsideration of the Board's decisions, which the Board denied. This petition for review followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d), OPM may seek review of a final Board order or decision when it determines that the Board erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule or regulation, and that that Board's decision will have a substantial impact on the administration of the civil service. Generally, this court does not have jurisdiction to review remand orders because such orders are not final. <span class="Italic">See Weed u. Social Sec. Admin.,</span> 571 F.3d 1359, <span id="Page_5178"></span>1362-63 (2009) (Board's remand order was not final order subject to immediate review); <span class="Italic">Cabot Corp. v. United States,</span> 788 F.2d 1539, 1542-43 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("[A]n order remanding a matter to an administrative agency for further findings and proceedings is not final.") OPM argues that this court has jurisdiction to review the orders under <span class="Italic">Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp.,</span> 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949) because the orders resolve an issue conclusively, resolve important questions separate from the merits, and could be effectively unreviewable on appeal from the Board's final decision in the case. <span class="Italic">See also Matthews v. Eldridge,</span> 424 U.S. 319, 330-31 (1976) (allowing judicial review of administrative action on collateral issue). We agree that the orders resolve the issue conclusively and resolve a question separate from the merits, i.e., separate from the merits of whether the actions against the employees were proper. Regarding the third criterion, whether the issue could be effectively reviewable on appeal from a final decision, OPM argues that delay in review of the issue would "imperil a substantial public interest" or a "particular value of a high order" and thus collateral review is proper. <span class="Italic">See e.g. Will v. Hallock,</span> 546 U.S. 345, 350, 351-53 (2006). We agree that the issues in the Board's orders raise an issue of such interest, i.e., whether the agency must disclose its determinations regarding what it classifies as issues of national security and must litigate the merits of such a determination, and thus are subject to immediate review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before seeking review of a decision by the court, OPM must intervene at the Board level or seek reconsideration by the Board [a process described in Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-232.html#sec5-231">OPM Reconsideration Requests</a>," by 5 CFR 1201.119 (2022), and by <span class="Italic">Bloomer v. DHHS</span>, 966 F.2d 1436, 1437-38 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (with specific application to review of arbitration awards)] . <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 405, 408 (1996) (noting that the Federal Circuit states that the statute "plainly requires the Director to petition the Board for reconsideration in order to obtain judicial review."). The time limits established at 5 USC 7703(b) for appellants' judicial review requests do not govern the process for OPM review requests. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Parton v. MSPB</span>, 684 F.2d 530, 533 (8th Cir. 1982).

<p class="Body-Text">As a prelude to the government-initiated judicial review process, MSPB must entertain an OPM reconsideration petition. A contrary policy by MSPB that vested in MSPB discretion to consider or reject an OPM reconsideration petition without substantive review was reversed in <span class="Italic">Newman v. Lynch</span>, 897 F.2d 1144, 1145 (Fed. Cir. 1990) [discussed in Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-232.html#sec5-231">OPM Reconsideration Requests</a>"] . OPM's reconsideration request should raise a matter of significance under the Reform Act. Generally, a dispute about whether a particular penalty should be mitigated is not a case having implications beyond the immediate parties to the case. OPM should not request reconsideration of a mitigation decision directed by the Board or by an arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Devine v. Sutermeister</span>, 724 F.2d 1558, 1565 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Although the Federal Circuit independently determines whether its exercise of jurisdiction is warranted over an OPM request for judicial review, "[i]t is particularly appropriate to grant OPM's petition for review when the interpretation of a statutory or regulatory provision is at issue." <span class="Italic">James v.
