<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-225"><span class="space">a.</span> Abandonment of Position</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Abandonment of position occurs if the employee stalks off the job, never to return. Because it is presumed voluntary, like a resignation, the Board ordinarily lacks jurisdiction over a separation for abandonment of position. An agency may separate an employee for abandonment of his position without protection of adverse action procedures. <span class="Italic">Fugate v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 19 MSPR 506, 509 n.4 (1984); <span class="Italic">see Poschl v. United States</span>, 206 Ct. Cl. 672, 687-90 (1975) (briefly noting the practice under the FPM of treating an abandonment of a position as a separation not requiring formal adverse action procedures); <span class="Italic">Barton v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 74 MSPR 236, 241-42 (1997) ("If the agency had characterized the appellant's action as an abandonment of her position, the Board would apparently lack jurisdiction over a subsequent appeal, as the abandonment of position is normally considered to be a voluntary action over which the Board lacks jurisdiction, and an agency may separate an employee for the abandonment of her position without the protection of adverse action procedures. <span class="Italic">See Fugate v. Department of the Interior,</span> 19 M.S.P.R. 506, 509 n.4, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 765 F.2d 162 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table).");<span class="Italic"> cf.</span> FPM 751-2-1(b)(2)(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The antecedents of the small amount of current law on abandonment of positions are found in cases predating the Reform Act, and in the Federal Personnel Manual, of similar antiquity. Under the former FPM Chapter 752, "Adverse Actions," 3-1:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">b.&#x2003;Actions not covered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)(c) Chapter 715 provides that an employee who fails to report for duty or return from leave or furlough for 30 days or less may be separated after a reasonable time (10 calendar days or more) for abandonment of position without following the procedures in Part 752 if the agency is unable to determine his or her intentions. However, if the employee asks to return to work after a separation for abandonment of position, it is good practice for the agency to restore the employee unless it has proof of actual intent to abandon the job. In some instances, the employee may not have communicated his or her intent to return to work, perhaps because of illness. Even if the agency has been faced with a continuing pattern of short unexcused absences on the part of an employee, OPM recommends that the agency restore the employee and then take any disciplinary action that appears to be warranted, e.g. a suspension or removal for AWOL, so as that the employee may have due process. (See also <span class="Italic">Bond v. Vance</span>)</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_369"></span>According to the authority cited by the late FPM, <span class="Italic">Bond v. Vance</span>, 327 F.2d 901, 902 (D.C. Cir. 1964):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the applicable regulations, an employee is to be "separated" where, as here, being absent without leave, he fails to disclose his intentions with respect to returning to duty. Also under the regulations, however, separation is not discharge, and a career employee who has been "separated" shall be restored to duty on request and appropriate disciplinary action taken against him thereafter....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A decade following <span class="Italic">Bond</span>, the Court of Claims declared: "[i]n order to establish abandonment, there must be an intent to abandon," and "[t]he agency is first required to ascertain the intention of the employee as to whether he will return." <span class="Italic">Poschl v. United States</span>, 206 Ct. Cl. 672, 687-88, 690 (1975). The position abandoned is the position assigned to the employee. <span class="Italic">See McLane v. Haaland</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20210622a69">___F. Supp.___</a>, ___ (D.D.C. 2021) ("the Court is aware of no MSPB decisional authority supporting McLane's reading of the abandonment standard as requiring reinstatement whenever an employee refuses to show up to work but indicates a willingness to report to some other position that she has not been assigned to or even offered").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies will more likely terminate employees for AWOL, following notice and reply procedures, than for abandonment of position, but there are Board decisions that consider the substantive and procedural complications that following a termination for abandonment. Those decisions tend to rely on the court decisions and the now-abolished FPM. Abandonment was interpreted in <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Dept. of Interior</span>, SF-0752-13-4271-I-1 (NP 12/3/2014), although for jurisdictional purposes the Board accepted the appellant's assertion that he was involuntarily separated from his position, making his claim one of a constructive adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[5]&#x2003;The appellant's conduct could be construed as abandonment. <span class="Italic">See</span> Office of Personnel Management's Guide to Processing Personnel Actions, Ch. 35 at 1 (Apr. 2014), <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation#url=Processing-Personnel-Actions">http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation#url=Processing-Personnel-Actions</a> (defining abandonment as when an employee does not submit a resignation but fails to report for duty); <span class="Italic">e.g., Fugate v. Department of the Interior</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 506, 507-08 (1984) (an agency invoked abandonment after an employee went missing while hiking and was never seen or heard from again), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 765 F.2d 162 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table); <span class="Italic">Poschl v. United States</span>, 206 Ct. Cl. 672, 687-88 (1975) (before separating an employee for abandonment, an agency must first attempt to determine whether the employee intends to return). However, the appellant's statements and actions could be construed as a resignation. <span class="Italic">See generally Balagot v. Department of Defense</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12 (2006) (discussing how an employee's statements and actions can signify resignation even in the absence of a resignation letter or other such formality).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the abandonment is involuntary, e.g., caused by threats from a supervisor of physical harm to the employee if he returns to work, the appellant's case is a constructive adverse action within Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Freedman v. VA</span>, 23 MSPR 361, 364 (1984). The agency may be obliged to restore an employee, whose absence from the job is due to a psychiatric condition, rather than separate the employee for abandonment of the position. <span class="Italic">See Searcy v. USDA,</span> AT-0752-11-0243-I-1 (NP 11/10/2011) (considering the impact of a death threat on an appeal challenging an alleged abandonment of position, citing <span class="Italic">Swaney</span>, <span class="Italic">post,</span> for the proposition that "when an employee asks to be restored to duty after being separated for abandonment of position, the agency should restore the employee unless it has proof of an actual abandonment of position."); <span class="Italic">Swaney v. Dept. of Army</span>, 19 MSPR 440, 442-43 (1984) (interpreting former FPM provisions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The analysis of what constitutes abandonment of a position, and the timing of an appeal to the Board, may depend on the agency's reaction to the employee's eventual statement of interest in returning to the job. <span class="Italic">Belton v. VA,</span> DC-0752-10-0805-I-1 (NP 8/25/2011), reviewed the caselaw applying, if not fully explaining, the concept of position abandonment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Timeliness</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency provided an affidavit reflecting that an agency Human Resources Specialist mailed the Standard Form 50 (SF-50) showing the appellant's resignation to the appellant's address of record and that it was not returned as "not received." On the other hand, the appellant claims that he did not receive the SF-50 effecting his resignation. He further claims that he was not aware of the agency's action until he received Senator Barbara Mikulski's July 22, 2010 letter transmitting the agency's response to the inquiry that her office had made on the appellant's behalf. The appellant argues that he acted with due diligence once he learned of his appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the agency effected the appellant's removal under the abandonment of position doctrine without affording him adverse action procedures. It is also undisputed that the agency failed to provide the appellant with any notice of his appeal rights, either at the time it determined it would separate the appellant, or any time thereafter. Given the agency was aware in May 2009 that the appellant sought assistance from Senator Mikulski's office to be returned to duty, by the time the agency effected his alleged "resignation" in June 2009 he had objectively placed the agency on notice that he would consider any action to separate him as involuntary. The agency was therefore obligated to provide the appellant with notice of his appeal rights. The agency did not meet its obligation to do so even if the appellant received the "resignation" SF 50 in June 2009. The agency's failure to provide the appellant with the required notice of appeal rights is "critical and controlling" in determining good cause for his late-filed appeal. <span class="Italic">See Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 670-74 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Porter v. Department of Defense</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-19 (2005); <span class="Italic">Malone v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 594, 596-97 (1989). We therefore conclude that the appellant has established good cause for his untimely appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The abandonment of position doctrine does not apply under these circumstances</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the agency may separate an employee for the abandonment of his position without the benefit of adverse action procedures, the administrative judge cited dicta in <span class="Italic">Barton v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 236, 241-42 (1997). <span class="Italic">Barton</span> was an enforcement action in which the agency stipulated that the employee did not voluntarily resign and specifically concerned that employee's right to back pay under a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Barton</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 237-39. Although the agency did not allege that the employee in <span class="Italic">Barton</span> had abandoned her position, the Board noted that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the agency had characterized the appellant's action as an abandonment of her position, the Board would apparently lack jurisdiction over a subsequent appeal, as the abandonment of a position is normally considered to be a voluntary action over which the Board lacks jurisdiction, and an agency may separate an employee for the abandonment of her position without the protection of adverse action procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 241-42 (citing <span class="Italic">Fugate v. Department of the Interior</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 506, 509 n.4 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 765 F.2d 162 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table)). Thus, the Board did not apply the abandonment of position doctrine in <span class="Italic">Barton</span>. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Fugate</span>, by contrast, involved a Park Ranger in Arizona who left his office to check some trails in the park where he worked and was never heard from again. <span class="Italic">Fugate</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. at 507. The Board also noted in <span class="Italic">Fugate</span> that an agency may separate an employee for abandonment of position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 509 n.4. However, the Board did not apply the abandonment of position doctrine in <span class="Italic">Fugate</span> either, which instead turned on the efforts of that employee's spouse to seek review of the agency's determination of her husband's status under the Missing Employee Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5561-5570. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 509. Thus, the Board's observation in <span class="Italic">Fugate</span> that "separation for abandonment of position is not an adverse action according to the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), ch. 751, subch. 2-1(b)(2)(b)" and therefore does not trigger the protections of Chapter 75, was also dicta. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 509 n.4 (citing <span class="Italic">Poschl v. United States</span>, 206 Ct. Cl. 672, 673, 687-690 (1975)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FPM was abolished on December 31, 1993, but the Board has since repeatedly noted that it may still be relied upon in appropriate circumstances. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Wallace v. Department of Commerce</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 23, &#x00B6; 11 n.2 (2007). Nevertheless, as the following discussion indicates, to the extent that the abandonment of position doctrine is viable post-FPM, it does not apply in this case because the appellant did not abandon his position. In another appeal decided around the same time as <span class="Italic">Fugate</span>, the Board recognized that under the FPM, "when an employee asks to be restored to duty after being separated [for abandonment of position], the agency should restore the employee unless it has proof of an actual abandonment of position." <span class="Italic">Swaney v. Department of the Army</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 440, 442-43 (1984). Consistent with requiring actual intent to abandon, the predecessor to our reviewing court recognized in <span class="Italic">Poschl</span> that an employee's assertion to the contrary, i.e., that his absence was involuntary and that he had therefore not abandoned his position, indicates that the doctrine is inapposite. <span class="Italic">Cf. Poschl</span>, 206 Ct. Cl. 672, 1975 WL 22843, at *11 (because the employee's "absence was caused by his arrest and physical confinement, the [agency] justifiably doubted their ability to prove intent to abandon").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the administrative judge found the agency had proved that the appellant abandoned his position because the appellant did not contact the agency between 2005 and 2009. However, the chronology of events the agency provided below reflects that it effected the appellant's resignation based on abandonment after it learned that the appellant wanted to go back to work. Regardless of the merits of the appellant's request to return to work, his request reflects that he did not intend to abandon his position and that the agency cannot sustain a removal based on the abandonment of position doctrine. <span class="Italic">Poschl</span>, 206 Ct. Cl. 672, 1975 WL 22843, at *11;<span class="Italic"> Swaney</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. at 442-43. Moreover, the agency's action cannot be sustained because the agency removed the appellant without affording him the required statutory procedural rights pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513, 7701(c)(2). <span class="Italic">Swaney</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. at 442-43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_370"></span>Order</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we ORDER the agency to cancel the appellant's removal and to restore the appellant effective June 5, 2009. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The agency must complete this action no later than 20 days after the date of this decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Abandonment of a position does not occur when a supervisor tells an employee he is fired, the employee then leaves the job, and the agency subsequently formally removes him for conduct (AWOL) that occurred, in part, before the supervisor's statement. The Board will adjudicate the appeal based on the removal decision and the portion of the AWOL that occurred before the employee's directed departure. <span class="Italic">See Ely v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 103, 106 (1992); <span class="Italic">cf. Epperly v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-17-0606-I-1 (NP 2/13/2023) (if a supervisor tells an employee who is being investigated for misconduct that he should not report for work pending review of his actions, with no written notice and no explanation of his ensuing pay status (ameliorated by the employee by taking sick leave or annual leave to maintain his income), a constructive suspension is sufficiently established that a hearing is required). Nonfrivolous allegations concerning a dispute between an agency, claiming abandonment of position, and an appellant, claiming she did not abandon the job, will ordinarily be treated as an allegation of constructive adverse action warranting a hearing if the jurisdictional issue cannot be resolved on documentary evidence. <span class="Italic">Jarman v. SBA</span>, 44 MSPR 514, 516 (1990). As in other cases implicating Board jurisdiction, nonfrivolous allegations concerning a dispute between an agency, claiming abandonment of position, and an appellant, claiming she did not abandon the job, will ordinarily be treated as an allegation of constructive adverse action warranting a hearing if the jurisdictional issue cannot be resolved on documentary evidence. <span class="Italic">See Jarman v. SBA</span>, 44 MSPR 514, 516 (1990). [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-012.html#sec6-13">Constructive Adverse Action</a>."]</p>
