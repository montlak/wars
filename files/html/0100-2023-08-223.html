<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-220-1"><span class="space">b.</span> Loss of Promotion Opportunities</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A reassignment is not an adverse action despite an appellant's perceived property interest in promotion opportunities attached to the position held before reassignment. <span class="Italic">Colligan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 36 MSPR 547, 549 (1988); <span class="Italic">Cotton v. Dept. of Navy,</span> DC-3443-15-0660-I-1 n.3 (NP 11/16/2015) ("the Board does not have jurisdiction over a reassignment to a position at the same grade and pay, even if the new position has fewer advancement opportunities."); <span class="Italic">Ben v. DHUD</span>, 6 MSPR 7, 8, 6 MSPB 21 (1981) (rejecting argument that a reassignment constituted an adverse action because the appellant had a property interest in promotional opportunities available through the position that was lost through reassignment); <span class="Italic">Harman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 3 MSPR 530, 530, 4 MSPB 48 (1980) (rejecting argument that the reassignment was an adverse action because the prior position had promotion potential to GS-14). A reassignment through a Chapter 43 performance-based action is not appealable despite protestations that advancement in grade would have been a near certainty in the original job. <span class="Italic">See McGetrick v. SSA</span>, NY-0752-12-0295-I-1 (NP 3/21/2014).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A reassignment from a job with known promotion potential to one at the same grade without promotion potential is not an adverse action; no downgrading occurred. The expectancy of promotion does not transform reassignment into adverse action. A federal employee has no absolute right to promotion, and a promotion, despite expectations, does not become a fact until an official appointment is made to the higher-graded position. A change in classification is not an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Burrell v. EPA</span>, 81 MSPR 427, 432 &#x00B6; 12 (1999) ("We first find that, to the extent that the appellant is alleging that his former GM-13 Supervisory Grants Specialist position should have been classified as a GS-13 Supervisory Grants Specialist position (with promotion potential to a GS-14) at the time of his reassignment to the GS-13 Senior Grants Specialist position (with no promotion potential), this allegation does not support a constructive demotion claim because reassignment from a position with known promotion potential to one without such expectancy does not constitute an appealable reduction in grade. <span class="Italic">See Lange v. Department of Transportation</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 700, 701-03 (1980); <span class="Italic">see also Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 490, 494-95 (1995) (the Board does not generally distinguish between positions of equal grade on the basis of promotion potential)."); <span class="Italic">Lange v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 1 MSPR 700, 702, 2 MSPB 110 (1980) ("[H]er expectancy of promotion cannot reasonably transform her reassignment into an adverse action."). Cancelation of a reassignment (or voluntary downgrading) that could result in increased opportunities for overtime is not a demotion; the basic pay rate controls. <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 41 MSPR 40, 42-43 (1989). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-209.html#sec1-207">Pay and Benefits; Classification; Debt; Leave</a>"; and Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-002.html#sec6-3">Cancelation of Appointment, Promotion</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit is in accord with the Board. Under <span class="Italic">McEnery v. MSPB</span>, 963 F.2d 1512, 1514-16 (Fed. Cir. 1992), no appealable reduction in pay occurs when a reassignment obliterates promotion potential. The court eschewed the theory that potential loss of pay was analogous to <span class="Italic">Russell-</span>type appeals concerned with reassignments immediately followed by upward reclassification of the job held just prior to reassignment. There was no appeal to the Board from a reassignment that jeopardized potential pay, even if an oral promise was made that the pay would be granted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McEnery filed an appeal with the MSPB on May 18, 1990, alleging jurisdiction based on a reduction of pay and grade under 5 USC 7511-7513 (1988). McEnery's argument is based in part upon an alleged oral promise by his immediate supervisor that, despite his reassignment to a position of lesser responsibility, he would receive future pay raises commensurate with those of his former job peers. The AJ held that McEnery's reassignment did not constitute a constructive removal or a constructive demotion, and that prior case law foreclosed any argument that the reassignment from one PCES I position at $80,000 per year to another PCES I position of $80,000 per year constituted a reduction of pay or grade. Further, the alleged promise of McEnery's supervisor could not confer jurisdiction in the absence of a reduction of pay or grade. The decision of the AJ became the final decision of the Board on December 13, 1990, when the full Board denied McEnery's petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...McEnery argues before this court that his reassignment to a position of lesser responsibility (previously categorized as an EAS-24 position) was a reduction in grade. However, this court has plainly held that a reassignment from a position of greater to lesser responsibility within the same grade is <span class="Italic">not</span> a "reduction in grade" within the meaning of 5 USC 7511. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. MSPB</span>, 807 F.2d 1577, 1580-1581 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (PCES I positions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alternatively, McEnery argues that his reassignment to a PCES I position with lesser responsibility will inherently result in a reduction in his <span class="Italic">future</span> pay--i.e. foreclosure of future pay raises. A reduction in pay must be ascertainable <span class="Italic">at the time of the personnel action</span>, not at some future date. <span class="Italic">Garbacz v. United States</span>, 656 F.2d 628, 633, 228 Ct. Cl. 309 (1981); <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 807 F.2d at 1582; <span class="Italic">Chaney v. VA</span>, 906 F.2d 697, 698 (Fed. Cir.) <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> __U.S.__, 111 S. Ct. 440, 112 L. Ed.2d 423 (1990). At least in his opening brief, petitioner made no argument that such potential "reduction" in future pay was ascertainable at the time of the personnel action. With regard to this issue, McEnery has presented inconsistent characterizations of the alleged promise of his supervisor. Prior to the Government's citation to <span class="Italic">Garbacz</span> and its progeny, he characterized the promise as one made by the supervisor and subsequently broken by the Executive Compensation Committee (ECC). Faced with the burden of having to show an ascertainable reduction <span class="Italic">at the time of the personnel action</span>, McEnery recharacterized the supervisor's promise as one made in bad faith--i.e., since the Postal Service never had any intent of keeping the promise, the effect on McEnery was "ascertainable" at that moment. In any event, this argument is not persuasive because the reduction must be ascertainable at the time of the personnel action "<span class="Italic">without reference to anticipated future developments</span>." <span class="Italic">Garbacz</span>, 656 F.2d at 633 (emphasis in original). Speculation about the Postal Service's intent to keep its promise and its subsequent actions certainly cannot be said to be "without reference to anticipated future developments."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, although the AJ specifically grounded the reduction of pay holding on <span class="Italic">Garbacz</span>, McEnery failed to mention this case in the initial brief, and in the reply brief characterized the case as "irrelevant," despite the fact that this case subsequently has been cited as authority for this very point in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> and <span class="Italic">Chaney</span>. Nor did McEnery mount a frontal attack and argue why this court should overturn otherwise controlling precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McEnery's final argument in this appeal is only slightly less frivolous than the preceding two examples. He analogizes the alleged future pay decrease (or more accurately, non-increase) to the "constructive demotion" theory of <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPB 585, 6 MSPR 698 (1981). Simply stated, the MSPB in <span class="Italic">Russell</span> held that a transfer from one position to another was a "constructive demotion" when the first position was misclassified at a lower grade. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 6 MSPR at 711. This theory has been applied to Postal Service employees, even though such employees are not members of the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Shadid v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 223, 226 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In both <span class="Italic">Russell</span> and <span class="Italic">Shadid</span>, the constructive demotion theory was limited to errors in classification of the <span class="Italic">initial</span> position. McEnery makes no argument regarding the classification of the initial PCES I Director position. Rather, he argues "by parity of reasoning" that the constructive demotion theory applies to his situation, since the <span class="Italic">second</span> position was classified upward. This argument fails for three reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, McEnery's argument fails to overcome the distinction between the salary increase a party <span class="Italic">would</span> receive in situations when the initial position is erroneously classified, and the salary increase which McEnery <span class="Italic">might or might not</span> receive in his second position. In other words, the argument fails because there is no way of predicting what McEnery's pay would be in the future--especially in light of the fact that the Postal Service has been specifically exempted by Congress from the classification principles of 5 USC Chapter 51, and further in light of the creation of the ECC to shift the Postal Service to a strictly merit-based compensation system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More fundamentally, the expansion of the constructive demotion theory which McEnery proposes flies in the face of specific Congressional intent. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 807 F.2d at 1581, "Congress intended adverse action rights such as the right to appeal a reduction in pay to be given a narrow construction." In response, courts have interpreted the term 'basic rate of pay' restrictively. Further, the Postal Service is "subject to only limited application of Federal employment laws." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1579. The Postal Career Executive Service system was created by Congress expressly to "promote flexibility in executive assignments to enable the agency <span id="Page_367"></span>to accomplish its mission in an effective and expeditious manner." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. McEnery's proposed expansion of the "constructive demotion" theory clearly flies in the face of these Congressional objectives.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, McEnery's proposed expansion of the constructive demotion theory founders upon this court's recent decision in <span class="Italic">Artmann v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 926 F.2d 1120 (Fed. Cir. 1991). In <span class="Italic">Artmann</span>, this court reviewed <span class="Italic">Russell</span> approvingly, but made the following cautionary comments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board's theory [of constructive demotion], is that if a position originally was classified erroneously or a change in classification standards would have mandated a change in grade, it was proper to view the employee as if that error had been rectified, so that the employee would be occupying a position with a higher grade than he actually had. The employee's grade therefore was reduced when the employee was reassigned at the same grade because, had the position been properly classified at the higher grade, the reassignment would have reduced the grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This interpretation by the Board of the statutory term "reduction in grade" is a reasonable implementation of the Board's broad authority to interpret and apply the statutory provisions it administers. (Citation omitted.) Moreover, <span class="Italic">since the Board created the concept of "constructive demotion," the agency also has considerable discretion to define the parameters of the concept</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1123. After reviewing the MSPB's factual analysis, the Federal Circuit then stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This narrow scope of "classification error" accords with and furthers the congressional policy reflected in the Reform Act to "increase the flexibility of agencies to assign employees to positions and duties where they are needed without having to take an adverse action against an employee when the job title or duties have changed, but the grade has not." S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess, 49-50 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 2723, 2771-72.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the AJ summarily disposed of McEnery's argument. As this court's discussion in Artmann makes clear, we will defer to the Board's interpretations of the constructive demotion theory when the interpretations accord with Congressional intent. McEnery's proposed expansion of the constructive demotion test to questions regarding future discretionary pay clearly undercuts the Congressional intent that agencies maintain flexibility. Given the recent discussion in Artmann of both the statutory framework and this court's expressed intent to defer to the MSPB in situations such as this case, we fail to see what McEnery hoped to accomplish with his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Maglietti v. MSPB</span>, 414 Fed. Appx. 288, 290 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP) ("In <span class="Italic">McEnery,</span> we considered a petitioner's claim that his reassignment to a position of lesser responsibility but equal pay invokes Board jurisdiction because it might foreclose future opportunities for pay increases and promotions. We held that the Board properly dismissed that claim, as its jurisdiction is limited to reassignments coupled to a reduction in pay that is "ascertainable <span class="Italic">at the time of the personnel action</span>, not at some future date."). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-215.html#sec1-213">Termination of Premium Pay; Bonus; LEAPA; Seniority, Overtime Adjustments</a>"; refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-073.html#sec6-73">Constructive Demotion Through Reassignment; <span class="Italic">Russell</span></a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Fourth Circuit declined to honor a claim that loss of promotion potential through reassignment equated to an action appealable to MSPB, <span class="Italic">Zachariasiewicz v. DOJ</span>, 48 F.4th 237, 248 (4th Cir. 2022) (Judge Diaz dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alternatively, Appellant contends that even if an IRA appeal does not satisfy &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(A) because that statute applies only to those personnel actions directly appealable to the MSPB, he nonetheless suffered a "constructive demotion" that is equivalent to such a personnel action. Specifically, he argues that his "categorical[ ] ban on being promoted,," amounts to a reduction in grade or pay, both of which are personnel actions listed in &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As Appellant points out, the Federal Circuit has indeed recognized that the MSPB has treated a constructive demotion as "a reduction in grade or pay...for purposes of establishing its jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Hogan v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 218 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (citing <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 6 M.S.P.B. 585, 594-95 (1981)). However, the MSPB defines a constructive demotion as a situation "where an employee was re[-]assigned from a position which, due to the issuance of a new classification standard or correction of a classification error, was worth a higher grade; the employee met the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade; and he was permanently re[-]assigned to a position classified at a grade level lower than the grade level to which he would otherwise have been promoted." <span class="Italic">Solamon v. Dep't of Com</span>., 119 M.S.P.R. 1, 7 (2012). The DEA's failure to promote Appellant does not fall within the scope of this narrow definition, as Appellant seemingly acknowledges by arguing that we should find constructive demotion in broader circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But an employee's non-selection for a position is not equivalent to a constructive demotion and does not confer MSPB jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). <span class="Italic">See Robins v. Dep't of Just</span>., 48 M.S.P.R. 644, 650-51 (1991). As it is used in &#x00A7; 7512, the term "grade" "means a level of classification under a position classification system." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(3). And the term "pay" "means the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4). Appellant specifically alleges that his involuntary transfer would result in a "position at the same grade" as the position he held before the reassignment, and he never claims that he was subject to a salary reduction. Essentially, Appellant alleges that he was stuck at the GS-14 classification level due to the DEA's failure to promote him. As such, Appellant's involuntary transfer constituted neither "a reduction in grade" nor "a reduction in pay" that would be directly appealable to the MSPB pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. "[T]he right to appeal reductions in pay and grade...has been narrowly construed," and consistent with the statutory definitions of those terms, the employee must "show a demonstrable loss, such as an actual reduction in pay, to invoke [the MSPB's jurisdiction]." <span class="Italic">Broderick v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 254, 258 (1992) (emphasis supplied). Appellant has not done so here.</p>
