<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-251"><span class="space">u.</span> Calculation</h5>
<p class="noindent">Overtime awards for prevailing rate employees must be in accordance with 5 CFR 532.503(b)(2) (2022). A contract cannot provide overtime entitlement in violation of that regulation. The result is the same for an employee whose overtime is calculated under the Federal Employees Pay Act, involving the regulation, or under the FLSA. <span class="Italic">IAM Lodge 2135 and Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing</span>, 23 FLRA 589, 591-92 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-145.html">71 FLRA 755</a> (2020) (Member Abbott concurring) (setting aside FLSA award that permitted double counting of overtime based on hours worked in a day and in a workweek); <span class="Italic">Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi and NFFE Local 797</span>, 36 FLRA 935, 940-42 (1990) (determining entitlement of firefighters to FLSA compensation and not annual premium pay for regularly scheduled work in excess of eight hours during 24-hour shift); <span class="Italic">Naval Station Mare Island and Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters, Local F-48</span>, 28 FLRA 1057, 1059 (1987) (FLSA applied to the practice of trade-off of time of firefighters). An award was set aside because the arbitrator incorrectly assessed FLSA overtime against an agency despite his holding that the grievants did not work more than five eight-hour days in any administrative workweek. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, SSA, Baltimore</span>, 45 FLRA 106, 111 (1992), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 45 FLRA 522 (1992). Overtime for work performed should be awarded on the basis of findings of how much overtime was performed, not on the basis of averaging for a work group. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FMC Carswell and AFGE Local 1006</span>, 65 FLRA 960, 967 (2011) (preliminary and postliminary work; nor may pay rates be averaged). FLRA does not apply a mitigation of damages analysis to overtime backpay awards. <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU Chapter 160</span>, 67 FLRA 688, 692 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU Chap. 150</span>, 68 FLRA 319, 322 (2015) (no duty to mitigate overtime loss by accepting offer of makeup overtime); <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU Chap. 139</span>, 68 FLRA 184, 186 (2015) ("Because the Act requires an award of backpay to be reduced by 'any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during th[e] period' when the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action was in effect, the Agency argues that any overtime backpay should be mitigated by compensation that the grievant earned while retaining her low-earner preference for additional overtime assignments, in order to prevent her from receiving a 'windfall.' However, in cases involving backpay for missed overtime, the Authority has routinely found backpay appropriate under the Act without requiring mitigation."); <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 68 FLRA 324 (2015) (similar to 68 FLRA 319) [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-247.html#sec9-245">Preparatory Time; Changing Clothing; Preliminary and Postliminary Activities</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Averaging of overtime for employees was rejected in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3954 and Bureau of Prisons, FCI Phoenix</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-8.html">73 FLRA 39</a>, 43-44 (2022), remanding the case for particularized calculations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority precedent requires an award of overtime compensation to be as precise as possible,[45] and "specifically reject[s] an arbitrator's use of an 'average amount of time expended per day per officer' in calculating an award of backpay under the FLSA." Here, the Arbitrator recognized that because the evidence in the merits hearing was "representational," additional evidence was needed for the "final monetary award...to include all employees of the Agency that [were] similarly situated." And there is no dispute that the amount of time employees spent performing <span id="page_2165"></span>compensable work varied. But instead of considering additional evidence, the Arbitrator based the amount of overtime worked primarily on the sample evidence from the merits hearing. By relying on representational evidence and not considering the "full complement" of evidence, the Arbitrator was "not able to further refine which individual [was] to be paid what." Consequently, because the Arbitrator could have made precise overtime determinations, but did not do so, the award is contrary to law.[52]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[45]&#x2003;The Authority has rejected an arbitrator's use of averages to calculate damages, because doing so potentially awards compensation to employees for the performance of activities that lasted ten or fewer minutes per workday. <span class="Italic">See BOP Tucson</span>, 70 FLRA at 417-18; <span class="Italic">BOP Carswell</span>, 65 FLRA at 966-67; <span class="Italic">BOP Terminal Island</span>, 63 FLRA at 624-25. The FLSA's implementing regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1) provides that preparatory and concluding activities that are closely related to, and indispensable to the performance of, an employee's principal activities constitute hours of work and are compensable when the time spent in the activities exceeds ten minutes per workday.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[52]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">BOP Tucson</span>, 70 FLRA at 417-18.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has also rejected the use of averages to determine the pay rate when the rate of pay varies.[53] Here, the award adopted the Agency's proposed pay rate because the Arbitrator found that deciding a rate for each post was not possible. But this finding was not based on anything in the record showing that such evidence was nonexistent or impossible to determine. Where, as here, there is no finding that the Agency was unable to produce records of the precise pay rate for each post, and the award is based on an average pay rate, the award is contrary to law.[56]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with Authority precedent, we reject the Arbitrator's use of averages to calculate damages in this case.[57] Where the record is insufficient to determine the precise amount of overtime owed, and at what pay rate, the Authority will remand an award for resubmission to the arbitrator to consider specific evidence showing how much overtime compensation is owed to each employee who was denied it.[58] Accordingly, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for further findings as to the amount of overtime owed to each employee.[59]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[59]&#x2003;The Union also argues that the Arbitrator denied it a fair hearing because the Arbitrator failed to consider specific "evidence and hold a [damages] hearing in order to precisely calculate damages," Exceptions at 49; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 48, and that the award is impossible to implement because it is based on averages which makes it "impossible for the parties to understand which grievant ought to receive a given amount of money." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 54. Because we remand the award to the Arbitrator to consider specific evidence on overtime, we find it unnecessary to address these exceptions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of VA</span>, 72 FLRA 212, 214 (2021) (then-Member DuBester concurring, in part) (finding it unnecessary to address bias exception where award is remanded to arbitrator for sufficient findings); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp.

<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator properly credits an employer's time records to reconstruct overtime, unless those records are demonstrably inaccurate or unless there are no records, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1741 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Milan</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-031.html">62 FLRA 113</a>, 119-20 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the FLSA, employees have the burden of establishing that they have performed work for which they have not been properly compensated. <span class="Italic">BOP, Marion,</span> 61 FLRA at 771 <span class="Italic">(citing Mt. Clemens,</span> 328 U.S. at 687). However, when the employer's records are inaccurate or inadequate and the employee cannot offer convincing substitutes, the employee is not required to establish the exact number of hours worked, but is only required to provide "sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference." <span class="Italic">Mt. Clemens,</span> 328 U.S. at 687. The burden then "shifts to the employer to come forward with evidence of the precise amount of work performed or with evidence to [negate] the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the employee's evidence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 687-688.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator denied the employees' claims that they worked overtime, finding that the 10-minute overlap in shifts was generally sufficient time to allow for the arrival and departure of employees. Further, he found that, where valid circumstances delayed the relief of an employee, the employee had the opportunity to request overtime. In this regard, the Arbitrator relied on the testimony of Union witnesses that overtime was normally granted when requested and credited testimony, which contradicted testimony from the Union that overtime had been denied by certain supervisors. The Arbitrator also rejected the Union's claims for specific periods of overtime for particular offices, stating that the Union had not offered "documented proof for these "estimates."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the Arbitrator did not apply the correct burden of proof.&#x2003;In this regard, the Union argues that the Arbitrator's finding that "there are no time clocks, or any other recording devi[ces], to precisely determine an employee's arrival time" and his finding that there was a "lack of documented proof as to the exact amount of time" employees did work establishes that the Agency's recordkeeping is inadequate. As a result, the Union argues that the Arbitrator should have accepted the employees' general testimony concerning the amount of overtime worked and shifted the burden of proof to the Agency to specifically disprove this testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Union's argument, there is no indication that the Arbitrator found the Agency's time keeping records to be inadequate. Instead, he found that the Agency used a system where employees' specific hours were set and recorded by the Agency and employees were required to submit requests for overtime pay where circumstances delayed their departure. He found that "[t]he procedure for claiming overtime pay is in place, now the employees <span class="Italic">have to use it to get paid."</span> As the Arbitrator found that the Agency's records were adequate under the circumstances, where employees were paid overtime when they submitted a request, he was not required to shift the burden of proof to the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Union has not established that the Agency's failure to use a time clock or to keep exact documented proof of employees' time means that its recordkeeping is necessarily inadequate. In this regard, the regulations governing this matter require only that an agency "keep complete and accurate records" and do not require recording devices to precisely record arrival and departure times. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.402. Further, as a general matter, the FLSA does not require that time records be kept in any particular form and the "use of time clocks is not required." Kearns, The Fair Labor Standards Act, BNA Books at 950 (1999); <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 785.48 (time clock not required); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6106 ("A recording clock may not be used to record time of an employee of an Executive department in the District of Columbia."). Thus, the findings relied on by the Union do not establish that the Agency's records were inadequate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Union's argument concerning the employees' failure to document overtime by requesting it, the Authority has rejected a union's claim that it was improper for an arbitrator to take employees' failure to submit overtime requests into account in evaluating overtime pay claims. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 801, Council of Prison Locals 33,</span> 58 FLRA 455, 456, 457 (2003). In addition, the courts have found that employees did not satisfy their initial burden of proof that they worked uncompensated overtime in situations where the employer was not aware of the claimed work because employees failed to follow overtime reporting procedures. <span class="Italic">Forrester v. Roth's I.G.A. Foodliner, Inc.,</span> 646 F.2d 413, 414 (9th Cir. 1981) (employee overtime pay claim rejected where employee knew overtime was supposed to be reported on time sheet, he had been paid for all overtime reported, and he then claimed additional hours at a later date); <span class="Italic">see also Newton v. City of Henderson,</span> 47 F.3d 746, 749 (5th Cir. 1995) (claim denied where overtime not authorized and employee ignored procedure requiring that overtime request be made within 72 hours of the time worked); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Food Lion,</span> 792 F.2d 1274, 1277-78 (4th Cir. 1986) (testimony of off-the-clock overtime work rejected where no employee notified the employer and employer had policy against off-the-clock work); <span class="Italic">White v. Washington Gas,</span> 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3461 (D. Md., Mar. 4, 2005) (claim denied where employee did not report hours on time sheet and did not ask to be paid).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union objects that these decisions are not applicable to the instant case because they "involve[ ] unique circumstance[s] making it impossible for the employer to know whether the employee was working" and because the cases do not permit an employer to "negligently maintain records" or "deliberately turn its back on a situation." Contrary to the Union's argument, the employer's knowledge of whether an employee <span id="page_2166"></span>is working overtime is an element of any claim, such as this one, that the employer "suffered or permitted" overtime work. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.104.[10] Here, in finding permissible the Agency's procedure of requiring employees to notify their supervisors when they had worked overtime, the Arbitrator concluded that a "supervisor cannot be expected to complete a form for authorized overtime, without first being advised of the claim." The facts found by the Arbitrator are, therefore, consistent with a conclusion that the Agency did not know of the work claimed by the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.104 defines the term "suffered or permitted work" as "any work performed by an employee for the benefit of an agency, whether requested or not, provided the employee's supervisor knows or has reason to believe that the work is being performed and has an opportunity to prevent the work from being performed."</p>
<p class="noindent">An award is not deficient if identification of employees entitled to overtime under a contract overtime guarantee is left to compliance proceedings, as long as the award is reasonably clear as to the nature of the violation, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA,</span> 63 FLRA 646, 648 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's complaint to the Arbitrator and in its exception is that there were also employees who would not have worked the overtime. However, because employees were denied overtime pay as the result of the violation of Article 38, Section 9, the Agency's complaint about employees who would not have worked overtime concerns a matter of compliance and implementation, and not the requirements of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., Wash., D.C.,</span> 55 FLRA 322, 326 (1999) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>) (when an arbitrator has found the specific requirements giving rise to entitlement to backpay, there is no requirement for the arbitrator to identify the specific employees entitled to backpay and calculate the amount of backpay). By specifying backpay only for those who were not "allowed to work[,]" the award sufficiently identifies the specific circumstances under which employees are entitled to backpay as those in which the employee otherwise would have worked. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv., El Paso, Tex.,</span> 57 FLRA 724, 727 (2002) (award satisfies the Back Pay Act when the award sufficiently identifies the circumstances under which employees are entitled to backpay); <span class="Italic">FAA,</span> 55 FLRA at 326.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 68 FLRA 253, 257 (2015) (recon. den., 68 FLRA 829 (2015)) ("[A]s long as an award sufficiently identifies the specific circumstances under which employees are entitled to backpay, an arbitrator need not require evidence of 'itemize[d] individual loss[es]' to support an award of backpay under the BPA."); <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 68 FLRA 157, 164 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting) ("Further, the Agency's assertion that the Arbitrator awarded backpay regardless of whether individual unit employees required backpay to make them whole reflects a misunderstanding of the award. Contrary to this assertion, the Arbitrator established a claims process to ensure that individual unit employees' awards correspond to their losses, and he stated that if the claims process revealed that 'some employees were not adversely affected' by violations of the scheduling requirements, then those employees would not be entitled to compensation. Indeed, the Arbitrator stated that the claims process would ensure that backpay amounts 'reflect the individual entitlements of adversely affected employees, <span class="Italic">if any</span>,' thereby emphasizing that some unit employees may not receive backpay. Moreover, the Authority has held that an arbitrator need not require evidence of 'itemize[d] individual loss[es]'" to support an award of backpay under the BPA, as long as an award sufficiently identifies the specific circumstances under which employees are entitled to backpay.") (recon. den., <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 68 FLRA 722, 724 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting)).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award is deficient if it provides a set level of compensation without tying it to a violation of the negotiated agreement (or law) and a specific basis for the compensation, e.g., a defined number of hours of lost compensation (in lieu of an opportunity for overtime) that would otherwise have been worked by the grievant, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA,</span> 63 FLRA 673, 676 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the remedy is deficient because it does not constitute pay, allowances, or differentials within the meaning of the Back Pay Act. "[P]ay, allowances, and differentials" are defined as "pay, leave, and other monetary employment benefits to which an employee is entitled by statute or regulation and which are payable by the employing agency to an employee during periods of Federal employment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803; <span class="Italic">accord Indian Health Serv.,</span> 60 FLRA at 212. Given this definition, a monetary award does not constitute "pay, leave, [or] other employment benefits" unless the award is something to which the employee "is entitled by statute or regulation." <span class="Italic">Indian Health Serv.,</span> 60 FLRA at 212. The Arbitrator did not cite any statutory or regulatory authorization for the payment of 4 hours of straight-time pay in the circumstances of this case. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Minot Air Force Base, N.D., </span>61 FLRA 366, 370 (2005) (<span class="Italic">Minot AFB</span>). Although he referred to the FLSA, it was only for the purpose of calculating an appropriate basis for a remedy, not as the basis of an entitlement. His reference to the parties' agreement is likewise unavailing. <span class="Italic">See Minot AFB,</span> 61 FLRA at 370 ("a collective bargaining agreement may require monetary payments to employees only where there is an underlying statutory [or regulatory] basis for the payment."). Consequently, the Arbitrator's remedy is not authorized and must be set aside. <span class="Italic">See Indian Health Serv.,</span> 60 FLRA at 212. As setting aside the Arbitrator's remedy leaves the contract violation without a remedy, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to order an appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA sustained a lump sum award of overtime for distribution among employees in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Atwater and AFGE Local 1242</span>, 66 FLRA 737, 739-40 (2012), based on union records that the arbitrator accepted when the agency did not maintain records:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award is not contrary to the BPA. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of backpay is authorized under the BPA only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or the reduction of an employee's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Force Base, Ga.,</span> 56 FLRA 541, 543 (2000) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 54 FLRA 1210, 1218-19 (1998)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the first requirement, a violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action within the meaning of the BPA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2608</span>, 56 FLRA 776, 777 (2000). The Arbitrator found, and the Agency does not dispute, that the Agency violated Article 18, Section P of the CBA. Thus, the first requirement of the BPA is satisfied. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the second requirement, even if employees did not actually work overtime, they may receive backpay under the BPA if a contract violation resulted in the failure to work overtime. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., Laredo, Tex.</span>, 66 FLRA 567, 568 (2012) (<span class="Italic">Customs</span>). If an arbitrator makes such a finding, and an agency does not challenge it as a nonfact, then the Authority will not find an award deficient under the second BPA requirement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> And a direct causal connection between the contract violation and the loss of pay may be "implicit" from the record and the award. <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Complex, Coleman, Fla.</span>, 65 FLRA 1040, 1045 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Coleman</span>). In this regard, where an agency disputes before an arbitrator a grievant's availability to work overtime, but the arbitrator nevertheless awards backpay for overtime, the Authority will find that the arbitrator "implicitly rejected" the agency's argument and found that, but for the agency's unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, the grievant would have worked the overtime and received the backpay awarded. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency argues that the remedy award does not satisfy the BPA's second requirement. In the Agency's view, there is neither evidence that the employees awarded overtime pay were actually "ready, willing[,] and able" to work the overtime assignments, nor any indication of how much overtime they actually would have worked.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's claims, the Arbitrator found that the Union provided information "sufficient to establish the [b]argaining [u]nit [employees] who <span class="Italic">would have been available</span> for [overtime] work assignment[s] and <span class="Italic">be[en]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic"> paid</span> for the time[s] that the [overtime] records [were] not available." Relying on that information and incorporating it into his remedy award, the Arbitrator thus made factual findings that the employees would have been available and would have been paid the overtime. Because the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings, <span id="page_2167"></span>and because the Agency does not challenge these findings as nonfacts, the Agency fails to demonstrate that the Arbitrator's determinations are deficient. <span class="Italic">See Customs</span>, 66 FLRA at 568; <span class="Italic">Local 1164</span>, 66 FLRA at 78; <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, 65 FLRA at 1046.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the parties disputed before the Arbitrator the grievants' readiness, willingness, and availability to work the overtime assignments. That is, both parties offered arguments and evidence to the Arbitrator concerning the number of available overtime opportunities, and the affected employees' willingness and readiness to work the overtime assignments. <span class="Italic">See </span>Exceptions, Attach., Agency's Reply Brief on Remedy at 23 ("we do not know which employees would have been willing, ready, and able to work on a particular day"); Opp'n, Attach., Union's Brief on the Remedy Implementing the Backpay Award (Union's Brief) at 3-6 (explaining its "formula and calculations" for determining the amount of backpay owed to each employee); Union's Brief, Attach., Guide to Appendices A, B, C, D[,] and E at 1 (explaining determination of whether employees were "qualified, available, and ready to accept [each] instance of each overtime assigned"). As noted above, based on the evidence before him, the Arbitrator found that the information provided by the Union "[was] sufficient to establish the [b]argaining [u]nit [employees] who <span class="Italic">would have been available</span> for [overtime] work assignment[s] and <span class="Italic">be[en]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic"> paid</span> for the time[s] that the [overtime] records [were] not available." Thus, the Arbitrator "implicitly rejected" the Agency's claim that there was no way to know which employees would have been ready, willing, and able to work on any particular day. <span class="Italic">See Coleman</span>, 65 FLRA at 1045. Because the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings, and because the Agency does not challenge these findings as nonfacts, the Agency fails to demonstrate that the Arbitrator's determinations are deficient. <span class="Italic">See Customs</span>, 66 FLRA at 568; <span class="Italic">Local 1164</span>, 66 FLRA at 78; <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, 65 FLRA at 1046.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, this case is distinguishable from<span class="Italic"> Beckley. </span>In <span class="Italic">Beckley</span>, the Authority set aside the arbitrator's award because he awarded backpay despite finding that "there [was] no certain way to know which employees would have received the [overtime] payments." 64 FLRA at 776. By contrast, here, the Arbitrator specifically found that the information provided by the Union was "sufficient to establish the [b]argaining [u]nit [employees] who <span class="Italic">would have been available</span> for [overtime] work assignment[s] and <span class="Italic">be[en]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic"> paid</span> for the time[s] that the [overtime] records [were] not available." Thus, unlike in <span class="Italic">Beckley</span>, the Arbitrator's factual findings support his conclusion that employees would have been available for overtime assignments and entitled to backpay. As the Agency does not challenge the Arbitrator's factual findings as nonfacts, the Authority defers to them. <span class="Italic">See Customs</span>, 66 FLRA at 568; <span class="Italic">Local 1164</span>, 66 FLRA at 78; <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, 65 FLRA at 1046.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the Arbitrator's remedy award is deficient under the BPA's second requirement, and deny the Agency's exception.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;As the Agency does not except to the rate of pay used by the Arbitrator in his calculation of backpay for the grievants' overtime pay, we do not address it. <span class="Italic">See Coleman</span>, 65 FLRA at 1045 n.10.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator properly applied Labor Department regulations, incorporated by reference into OPM regulations, governing the timeframe for overtime payments. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, FCI Florence and AFGE Local 1300</span>, 66 FLRA 537, 540 (2012).</p>
