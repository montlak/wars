<h5 class="h5" id="sec10-38"><span class="space">a.</span> Erosion of Duties</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Reclassification due to erosion of duties, rather than by planned changes in duties, is ordinarily not an agency action that requires application of current RIF regulations. That the agency earlier considered reorganization and transfer of duties out of the appellant's position did not establish that a reorganization subject to RIF regulations actually occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shillinger v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 47 MSPR 145, 150 (1991) (record established that the agency reclassified the position to make it consistent with OPM classification guidelines).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Douglas v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 41 MSPR 575, 579 (1989), stated the current law and noted the 1986 change in RIF regulations concerning erosion of duties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e note that job erosion reclassifications were removed from the coverage of RIF procedures under regulations that went into effect February 3, 1986....&#8197;Under 5 CFR 351.202(a)(2) (1986), job erosion does not constitute a basis for taking a RIF action, except in the limited circumstances where a job erosion reclassification takes effect after the agency has already formally announced a RIF in the employee's competitive area, and the RIF will take effect within 180 days.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The distinction between erosion of duties and reorganization requiring the application of RIF procedures was explored in <span class="Italic">Hardy v. Dept. of Army</span>, 67 MSPR 292, 296-300 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's guidance to agencies with respect to reclassifications provides that, when the grade of a position is reduced, the agency must decide the reason for the change; this reason determines whether RIF procedures must be followed. Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supp. 351-1, S2-4(a) (Sept. 18, 1989).[*] If a reorganization causes an agency to release an employee from a competitive level through furlough for more than thirty days, separation, demotion, or reassignment requiring displacement, the agency must follow RIF procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>., S2-4(b). "Reorganization" means the planned elimination, addition, or redistribution of functions or duties in an organization. 5 CFR 351.203; <span class="Italic">Brown v. United States Postal Service</span>, 58 MSPR 345, 348 (1993). Changes that meet the definition of reorganization may be recognized when they occur or at a later date such as during a classification survey. FPM Supp. 351-1, S2-4(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;FPM Supp. 351-1 (Sept, 18, 1989) was "provisionally retained" only through December 31, 1994. FPM Sunset Document at 54 (Dec. 31, 1993). However, the FPM provisions that were in effect at the time of the February 10, 1991 reclassification of the appellant's position apply to this appeal<span class="Italic">. See Hassman v. Department of the Army</span>, 61 MSPR 356, 360 (1994); <span class="Italic">Matthews v. OPM</span>, 4 MSPB 482, 4 MSPR 431, 433 n.1 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reclassification due to erosion, however, describes a situation where the grade of a position must be reduced because duties "have gradually drifted away through an extended erosion process." FPM Supp. 351-1, S2-4(d)(1). In job erosion cases, an evaluation of the position shows no proximate cause or determinable time for the change in duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This contrasts with a reclassification due to reorganization, where a "<span class="Italic">planned</span> change in duties has occurred in which the cause of reclassification and time frame are clear, as for example when, at an identifiable time, a statute or agency procedure changed or expired." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true, as noted by the administrative judge, that a change of duties alone is insufficient to require the agency to apply RIF procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.201(a); <span class="Italic">Shillinger v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 47 MSPR 145, 150 (1991) (reclassification due to a change in duties is no longer an agency action that requires the application of RIF regulations). As the administrative judge also correctly found, a reclassification due to an erosion of duties requires the agency to conduct a RIF only when the reclassification takes effect after the agency has already formally announced a RIF in the employee's competitive area, and the RIF will take effect within 180 days. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.202(c)(3); <span class="Italic">Douglas v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we find that the administrative judge mischaracterized the appellant's jurisdictional pleading to the extent that she found that the appellant was only alleging that an erosion of duties or a change of duties had occurred. Although the appellant does state that Beuscher testified that an erosion of duties had occurred, she also asserted that Beuscher testified that her reclassification resulted from an "incorporation of sections." The appellant stated that she submitted the transcript of Beuscher's testimony to substantiate her claim of Board jurisdiction. A review of that transcript reveals that Beuscher testified that he believed that the appellant's change in duties resulted from a "reorganization." Although the appellant may have raised this issue in an inarticulate manner, a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant is not required to plead the issues with the precision of an attorney in a judicial proceeding. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Walters v. United States Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 115, 118-19 (1994). Thus, we find that the administrative judge failed to identify and address the issue of whether the reclassification of the appellant's position was due to an erosion of duties, as claimed by the agency, or due to a reorganization, as reflected in Beuscher's testimony....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining the issue of Board jurisdiction, the appellant bears the initial burden of making a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction. Because the protections afforded by RIF procedures are a substantive right of employees, once the appellant makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence on the jurisdictional issue shifts to the agency. <span class="Italic">See Carter v. Small Business Administration</span>, 23 MSPR 309, 312 n.2 (1984). It is then left to the Board to determine whether the appellant has established Board jurisdiction over her appeal, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that the downgrading was occasioned because of a reorganization, rather than merely an erosion of duties, and the agency improperly failed to invoke RIF procedures. <span class="Italic">See Carter</span>, 23 MSPR at 311-12; <span class="Italic">Wright v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the evidence that the appellant submitted below establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that the reclassification of her GS-7 position and her subsequent reduction in grade resulted from a planned redistribution of the duties of her position that began in August or September 1990, and was effected on February 10, 1991<span class="Italic">. See</span> FPM Supp. 351-1, S2-4(d)(1). The fact that an agency reclassifies an employee's position does not necessarily preclude a finding that a reorganization occurred, <span class="Italic">see Holmes v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we REMAND this appeal for further adjudication. The administrative judge shall afford the agency an opportunity to meet its burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence on the jurisdictional question, and the administrative judge shall then issue a new initial decision that determines: (1) Whether the appellant has established Board jurisdiction over her appeal; (2) whether the agency was therefore required to utilize RIF procedures to effect the downgrading action and, if so; (3) whether the agency's failure to do so warrants reversal of the action. <span class="Italic">See Sheifer</span>, 39 MSPR at 38.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hardy</span> was summarized, <span class="Italic">Guba v. Dept. of Army</span>, 70 MSPR 192, 194-95 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hardy v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 67 MSPR 292, 294 (1995), the agency downgraded the appellant's position, based on a reclassification due to an "erosion of duties" and a "change in classification standards." The <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant there argued, albeit "in an inarticulate manner," that the downgrading of her position was due to a reorganization and that it was therefore appealable as a reduction-in-force (RIF) demotion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 294, 296. The Board noted that a downgrading based on a reclassification due to erosion of duties requires the application of RIF procedures only when the reclassification takes effect after the agency has formally announced a RIF in the employee's competitive area, and the RIF will take effect within 180 days, which circumstances did not exist in that case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 297. Nevertheless, the Board held that the downgrading by reclassification would be appealable as a RIF demotion if the actual reason for the reclassification was not an "erosion of duties," as asserted by the agency, but a "reorganization." The Board explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Reclassification due to erosion [of duties]...describes a situation where the grade of a position must be reduced because duties have gradually drifted away through an extended erosion process. In job erosion cases, an evaluation of the position shows no proximate cause or determinable time for the change in duties. This contrasts with a reclassification due to reorganization, where a <span class="Italic">planned</span> change in duties has occurred in which the cause of reclassification and time frame are clear, as for example when, at an identifiable time, a statute or agency procedure changed or expired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 297 (emphasis in the original) (quotation marks and citations <span id="Page_3047"></span>omitted). The Board found that, because the appellant raised the issue of whether the reclassification was due to an erosion of duties or due to a reorganization, the AJ was required to resolve this jurisdictional question. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Hardy</span>, the agency here downgraded the appellant's position based on a reclassification that was purportedly due to an "erosion of duties." There is no allegation or evidence that the reclassification was effective after the agency formally announced a RIF in the appellant's competitive area, and that the RIF took effect within 180 days. Thus, the agency action is facially not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Shillinger v. Department of Labor</span>, 47 MSPR 145, 149-51 (1991); 5 CFR 351.201, 351.202(c)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant asserted in his petition for appeal, however, that "the situation [regarding his downgrading by reclassification] did not meet the gradual drifting away of duties necessary to support an extended erosion process" and that "[t]he erosion basis was used to deny [him] RIF rights." He thus challenged the agency's assertion that the reclassification was due to an "erosion of duties." In addition, there is record evidence suggesting that the reclassification may have been related to a reorganization at the agency. Specifically, a memorandum for the record written by the appellant's supervisor indicates that there was a "downsizing" at the agency and that, in mid-1995, six jobs in the personnel field were "abolished" and affected employees "reassigned" to "job descriptions that identified current duties/mission of the organization."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, the AJ should have resolved the jurisdictional issue of whether the reclassification of the appellant's position was due to an "erosion of duties" or due to a "reorganization." <span class="Italic">See Hardy</span>, 67 MSPR at 297. Because he did not, and because the record is insufficient for us to resolve the issue, we find that this appeal must be remanded for further development of the record....&#8197;We further find that, because the appellant has not heretofore been afforded explicit notice of what he must show to establish the Board's jurisdiction, under the <span class="Italic">Hardy</span> standard, he must be afforded another opportunity on remand to establish Board jurisdiction<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">If an employee is demoted because the duties of his position no longer supported that classification, and if the reclassification takes effect after the agency has already formally announced a RIF in the employee's competitive area and the RIF will take effect within 180 days, such an action would require application of RIF procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.201(a)(2) and 351.202(c)(3). If the improper classification and resulting reduction in grade was the consequence of a planned redistribution of the duties of the employee's position, then the basis for the demotion by RIF is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> reorganization. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.201(a)(2) and 351.203; <span class="Italic">Guba v.

<p class="Body-Text">Under earlier law, if a position description became inaccurate through erosion or change in duties, the employee was to be released through RIF and not through reclassification of the position description. <span class="Italic">Caracciolo v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 20 MSPR 211, 213 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cariddo v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Carter v. SBA</span>, 23 MSPR 309, 311 (1984), applying earlier regulations, determined that if the downgrading represented the correction of a classification error, RIF procedures did not apply and the Board lacked jurisdiction. But RIF procedures did apply if downgrading resulted from a change in duties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stroup v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 6 MSPR 174, 176, 6 MSPB 155 (1981) (involving downward reclassification of a continuing position because of a new classification standard); <span class="Italic">Nauert v. FAA</span>, 4 MSPR 347, 348, 4 MSPB 409 (1980) (RIF appeal was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction when the appellant's position was reclassified due to a change in classification standards or an error in the original classification, but not as a result of a deliberate or gradual change in assigned duties). If there was a loss of duties, the position could not legitimately be the subject of a classification downgrading--the agency was required to follow downgrading procedures--regardless of whether the duties were previously performed, or were only projected, whether the change in duties was planned or unplanned, or whether the duties were abolished long before the actual downgrading occurred. Whether the downgrading was caused by classification error or by loss of duties was an issue going to the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the RIF, an issue within the agency's burden of proof. An agency should have applied RIF procedures after the employees "were stripped of certain of their once performed, or projected, duties due to either the gradual erosion of duties, the failure on management's part to assign duties contained in the position descriptions, or the failure of the employee to perform the duties of the positions at the designated level." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carter v. SBA</span>, 23 MSPR 309, 312 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Lester v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 18 MSPR 63, 67 (1983), and <span class="Italic">Wrenn v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 21 MSPR 33 (1984)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under earlier regulations, if on examination of the position descriptions before and after the reclassification the new position description dropped a duty, it was immaterial that the employee never performed the duty if the job was at a higher grade before the duty was dropped. RIF procedures were properly used. <span class="Italic">Moraglia v. EPA</span>, 20 MSPR 256, 257-58 (1984). Elimination of significant duties from an employee's position could be the basis for a RIF even when those duties were projected and not actually performed. Classification of a position based on projected duties was proper. When a subsequent review of the position disclosed both that the projected duties were not being assigned to the incumbent, and that the position was properly classifiable at a lower grade, RIF procedures were appropriate, even if the incumbent of the position never actually performed the grade-controlling duties. <span class="Italic">McGauley v. VA</span>, 29 MSPR 686, 688 (1986) (elimination of significant duties from a position could be the basis for a RIF even when those duties were projected duties never actually performed); <span class="Italic">Saddler v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 27 MSPR 636, 637-38 (1985) ("when a subsequent review of the position discloses that the projected duties are not being assigned to the incumbent, and that the position therefore is properly classifiable at a lower grade, reduction in force procedures are appropriate, even when the incumbent of the position never actually performed the grade-controlling duties").</p>
