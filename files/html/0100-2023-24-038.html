<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-38"><span class="space">a.</span> Credibility</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">"The Board has broad discretion in evaluation of the evidence in the record and the weight given to it." <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. DOJ</span>, 189 Fed. Appx. 973, 975 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP). <span class="Italic">Spinazola v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3054), explained that "[f]indings that turn on credibility are upheld unless the quality and weight of the evidence are such that no reasonable trier of fact could have, on the evidence adduced, reached the conclusion that was reached." The appeals court expressed a disinclination to allow the substantial evidence review process to turn into a point-by-point examination of credibility issues, holding in <span class="Italic">DeSarno v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 761 F.2d 657, 661 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (following <span class="Italic">Griessenauer v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 754 F.2d 361 (Fed. Cir. 1985)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That some parts of a witness' testimony may be attacked is a common phenomenon. It supplies no basis, however, for holding that the fact-finder is not entitled to credit other parts of that witness' testimony. Where, as here, the presiding official expressly found a witness... credible, this court cannot substitute a contrary credibility determination based on a cold paper record.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To the same effect, in <span class="Italic">Hathaway v. MSPB</span>, 981 F.2d 1237, 1241 (Fed. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A fact finder is not obliged to accept or reject a witness' testimony <span class="Italic">in toto</span>, but should rather evaluate the testimony in light of other evidence to determine whether and how much of the witness' testimony is credible.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">DeSarno</span>, supra, was followed in <span class="Italic">Hambsch v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 796 F.2d 430, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the petitioner's claim is based upon a challenge to the presiding official's credibility determinations, we reiterate our previous holdings that these determinations are virtually unreviewable, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DeSarno v. Department of Commerce</span>, 761 F.2d 657, 661 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Griessenauer v. Department of Energy</span>, 754 F.2d 361, 364 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. City of Bessemer City</span>, 105 S. Ct. 1504 (1985) (trial judge's credibility choice between two witnesses whose testimony is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence "can virtually never be clear error"), and we find nothing in the record in this case to justify our reconsidering those determinations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again, in <span class="Italic">Carosella v. USPS</span>, 816 F.2d 638, 641 (Fed. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A determination of the credibility of witnesses is the province of the official who heard their testimony and observed their demeanor. <span class="Italic">Griessenauer v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 754 F.2d 361, 364 (Fed. Cir. 1985). That determination will not be disturbed unless it is "inherently improbable or discredited by undisputed fact or physical evidence." <span class="Italic">Dittmore-freimuth Corp. v. United States</span>, 390 F.2d 664, 685 (Ct. Cl. 1968).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Finizie v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20211103204">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP) ("It is appropriate for an AJ to take into account demeanor when assessing credibility. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Purifoy v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 838 F.3d 1367, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

<p class="Body-Text">The reference in <span class="Italic">Hambsch, supra,</span> to the "virtually unreviewable" nature of credibility findings has an interesting history. <span class="Italic">Hambsch v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 796 F.2d 430, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1986), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the petitioner's claim is based upon a challenge to the presiding official's credibility determinations, we reiterate our previous holdings that these determinations are virtually unreviewable, <span class="Italic">see DeSarno v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">DeSarno v. Department of Commerce,</span> 761 F.2d 657, 661 (Fed. Cir. 1985), cited in <span class="Italic">Hambsch,</span> noted the significance of the opportunity of the MSPB AJ to observe testimony:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DeSarno and Carter present an extensive review of the testimony and evidence which bears a superficial plausability. In the manner of a jury argument, each minute "inconsistency" or possible inconsistency is discussed in depth. Because we must determine whether the Board's decision was based on substantial evidence we have reviewed the record in detail. That review shatters the surface attractiveness of DeSarno and Carter's assertions. The argument, attacking Green's credibility and citing documents (bank receipts, checks, affidavits) as refuting the Board, is unpersuasive in light of the rules governing appellate review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Griessenauer v. Department of Energy,</span> 754 F.2d 361 (Fed.

We decline in this similar case to abandon that sensible approach, which impartially serves employees and agencies alike.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That some parts of a witness' testimony may be attacked is a common phenomenon. It supplies no basis, however, for holding that the fact-finder is not entitled to credit other parts of that witness' testimony. Where, as here, the presiding official expressly found a witness (Green) credible, this court cannot substitute a contrary credibility determination based on a cold paper record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official determined that the agency had supported its charges by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7701(c)(1)(B). That evidence, formed of testimony and circumstantial elements, is such as to preclude a determination by this court that the Board's decision was not based on substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7703(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Anderson v. City of Bessemer</span>, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985), also cited in <span class="Italic">Hambsch,</span> explained that deference is provided to the factfinder's factual determinations if they meet the substantial evidence, but credibility findings based on observation of witnesses deserve a particular measure of deference:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the district court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently. Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. <span class="Italic">United States v. Yellow Cab Co.,</span> 338 U.S. 338, 342, 70 S. Ct. 177, 179, 94 L. Ed. 150 (1949); <span class="Italic">see also Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc.,</span> 456 U.S. 844, 102 S. Ct. 2182, 72 L. Ed.2d 606 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is so even when the district court's findings do not rest on credibility determinations, but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts. To be sure, various Courts of Appeals have on occasion asserted the theory that an appellate court may exercise <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review over findings not based on credibility determinations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Orvis v. Higgins,</span> 180 F.2d 537 (CA2 1950); <span class="Italic">Lydle v. United States,</span> 635 F.2d 763, 765, n.1 (CA6 1981); <span class="Italic">Swanson v. Baker Industries, Inc.,</span> 615 F.2d 479, 483 (CA8 1980). This theory has an impressive genealogy, having first been articulated in an opinion written by Judge Frank and subscribed to by Judge Augustus Hand, <span class="Italic">see Orvis v. Higgins, supra,</span> but it is impossible to trace the theory's lineage back to the text of Rule 52(a), which states straightforwardly that "findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous." That the Rule goes on to emphasize the special deference to be paid credibility determinations does not alter its clear command: Rule 52(a) "does not make exceptions or purport to exclude certain categories of factual findings from the obligation of a court of appeals to accept a district court's findings unless clearly erroneous." <span class="Italic">Pullman-Standard v. Swint,</span> 456 U.S., at 287, 102 S. Ct., at 1789.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rationale for deference to the original finder of fact is not limited to the superiority of the trial judge's position to make determinations of credibility. The trial judge's major role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise. Duplication of the trial judge's efforts in the court of appeals would very likely contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources. In addition, the parties to a case on appeal have already been forced to concentrate their energies and resources on persuading the trial judge that their account of the facts is the correct one; requiring them to persuade three more judges at the appellate level is requiring too much. As the Court has stated in a different context, the trial on the merits should be "the 'main event'... rather than a 'tryout on the road.'" <span class="Italic">Wainwright v. Sykes,</span> 433 U.S. 72, 90, 97 S. Ct. 2497, 2508, 53 L. Ed.2d 594 (1977). For these reasons, review of factual findings under the clearly-erroneous standard--with its deference to the trier of fact is the rule, not the exception.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When findings are based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses, Rule 52(a) demands even greater deference to the trial court's findings; for only the trial judge can be aware of the variations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear so heavily on the listener's understanding of and belief in what is said. <span class="Italic">See Wainwright v. Witt,</span> 469 U.S. 412, 105 S. Ct. 844, 83 L. Ed.2d 841 (1985). This is not to suggest that the trial judge may insulate his findings from review by denominating them credibility determinations, for factors other than demeanor and inflection go into the decision whether or not to believe a witness. Documents or objective evidence may contradict the witness' story; or the story itself may be so internally inconsistent or implausible on its face that a reasonable factfinder would not credit it. Where such factors are present, the court of appeals may well find clear error even in a finding purportedly based on a credibility determination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States v. United States Gypsum Co., supra,</span> 333 U.S., at 396, 68 S. Ct., at 542. But when a trial judge's finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more witnesses, each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence, that finding, if not internally inconsistent, can virtually never be clear error. <span class="Italic">Cf. United States v. Aluminum Co. of America,</span> 148 F.2d 416, 433 (CA2 1945); <span class="Italic">Orvis v. Higgins, supra,</span> at 539-540.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The deference the Board must observe when considering the demeanor and credibility findings of an AJ was again addressed, and refined, in <span class="Italic">Haebe v. DOJ</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1300-02 (Fed. Cir. 2002), emphasizing that deference is owed to demeanor findings, a subset of an overall credibility analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both Mr. Haebe and the government present to us an intricate twist to the deference requirement, asserting that there are two levels or thresholds of deference, as follows: the MSPB must give (i) deference to the administrative judge's findings based on issues of credibility, <span class="Italic">Connolly</span>, 766 F.2d at 512, and (ii) "special deference" where such findings are implicitly or explicitly based on the demeanor of witnesses who testified before an administrative judge, <span class="Italic">Chauvin</span>, 38 F.3d at 566; <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 768 F.2d at 1331. We, however, do not read our precedent as creating or endorsing any such distinction because our cases have only required deference when an administrative judge was able to observe the demeanor of a testifying witness and, as a result, the administrative judge's findings were explicitly or implicitly based on the demeanor of a witness.[26] The parties' confusion as to the deference requirement is perhaps a result of haphazard use in the case law of the terms "deference" and "special deference" and variations of those terms in relation to the concepts of credibility and demeanor.[27]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[26]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Kimm</span>, 61 F.3d at 892; <span class="Italic">Chauvin</span>, 38 F.3d at 566; <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 768 F.2d at 1332.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[27]&#x2003;The maxim of deference can be demanding in its application because courts have sometimes struggled to discern the appropriate and relative scope of the terms "credibility" and "demeanor." <span class="Italic">See Kopack v. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd.</span>, 668 F.2d 946, 953 (7th Cir. 1982) ("We now turn our attention to the ambiguity in <span class="Italic">Universal Camera</span> with which courts have most frequently grappled: the range of meaning connoted by the term 'credibility.'"). The term "credibility" denotes "[t]he quality that makes something (such as a witness or some evidence) worthy of belief." Black's Law Dictionary 374 (7th ed. <span id="Page_5204"></span>1999). "Demeanor," by contrast, relates to "[o]utward appearance or behavior, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, gestures, and the hesitation or readiness to answer questions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 442. Accordingly, demeanor is but one factor that may be considered by the trier of fact on the ultimate, broader, issue of credibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to dispel such confusion, we hold that there is only one level of deference. This sole deference requirement applies when the administrative judge's credibility determination is based on observations of the demeanor of a testifying witness such that the administrative judge's findings were explicitly or implicitly based on such observation of demeanor. This is consistent with our precedent and <span class="Italic">Connolly</span> is not in opposite effect. While <span class="Italic">Connolly</span> provides a meager textual hook for the parties' assertion of two levels of deference,[28] it otherwise fails to support a distinction of multiple levels of deference. Whether it be referred to as "special deference," "deference" or "demeanor-based deference," herein or in our precedent, the deference requirement is unitary and is fundamentally related to the observation of witness' demeanor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[28]&#x2003;Our opinions in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, <span class="Italic">Chauvin</span>, and <span class="Italic">Kimm</span> refer to this single level of deference as "special deference," a phrase that the opinion in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> borrowed from the Ninth Circuit's opinion in <span class="Italic">Penasquitos Village. See Jackson</span>, 768 F.2d at 1331. Our opinion in <span class="Italic">Connolly</span>, however, refers simply to "deference," engendering the potential for one to argue that multiple levels of deference apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The consequence of the deference requirement is that if the MSPB's reasons for overturning demeanor-based credibility determinations are not sufficiently sound, its decision does not survive substantial evidence review. <span class="Italic">Chauvin</span>, 38 F.3d at 566 ("[T]he board majority did not articulate a sufficient reason for its disbelief of Chauvin's testimony."). In light of the "sufficiently sound" requirement for overturning AJ credibility determinations, the MSPB has established procedural directives for administrative judges under its decisions in <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>[30] and <span class="Italic">Spithaler</span>[31] in order to promote the establishment of a full record for the MSPB's review.

<p class="Block-Quote2">To resolve credibility issues, an administrative judge must first identify the factual questions in dispute; second, summarize all of the evidence on each disputed question of fact; third, state which version he or she believes; and, fourth, explain in detail why the chosen version was more credible than the other version or versions of the event. Numerous factors, which will be considered in more detail below, must be considered in making and explaining a credibility determination. These include: (1) [t]he witness's opportunity and capacity to observe the event or act in question; (2) the witness's character; (3) any prior inconsistent statement by the witness; (4) a witness's bias, or lack of bias; (5) the contradiction of the witness's version of events by other evidence or its consistency with other evidence; (6) the inherent improbability of the witness's version of events; and (7) the witness's demeanor.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[32]&#x2003;Because <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> and <span class="Italic">Spithaler</span> are MSPB cases, and are rarely cited in our precedential opinions, <span class="Italic">see Wissman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When the demeanor-based deference requirement is not in play, the MSPB is free to re-weigh the evidence and substitute its own decision as to the facts or the law commensurate with the substantial evidence standard, <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 768 F.2d at 1330, but it cannot substitute its judgment on issues of credibility based on the demeanor of witnesses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reviewing court's reluctance to delve into credibility determinations is facilitated by detailed factfinding from the Board, as implied in <span class="Italic">Privette v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Clearly, if this evidence were credible, it would support Petitioner's assertion that he did not know he was violating base rules by arresting and lodging a serious offender; Petitioner conceivably could have considered himself able to make a "judgment call" on whether to arrest and lodge the offender picked up on November 27, 1992. Credibility determinations, however, are for the finder of fact, and are not for this court to remake under the guise of review for substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Carosella</span>, 816 F.2d at 641. The Board obviously did not accord to Petitioner's evidence on the October 28 meeting sufficient credibility to overcome the substantial evidence to the contrary, which included testimony by Major Thiessen, whom the Board found to be credible, that he did not recall the conversation alleged by Petitioner's witnesses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Board's finding, that Petitioner knew he was violating the "no arrest or lodging" policy, is supported by substantial evidence. We note, however, that review of this case would have been facilitated by closer adherence by the Board to its obligation to make findings of fact and conclusions of law "upon all the material issues of fact and law presented on the record." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(1) (1994). As the Board recognized, Petitioner's knowledge concerning the "no arrest or lodging" policy was a key fact issue in this case. Its conclusion on this issue would have been further supported by specific findings regarding the evidence offered by the Petitioner, which directly conflicts with the agency's evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The determination of witness credibility is within the discretion of the AJ. The AJ's determination will be accepted unless the testimony is inherently improbable or discredited by undisputed evidence or physical fact. If two versions of the facts are equally probable, the court will normally accept the version accepted by the administrative tribunal. <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer v.

DHUD</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1110). The Board bears primary responsibility not only for finding the facts, but also for drawing inferences from the factual findings. As long as the Board's inferences are supported by substantial evidence and are not illogical, error is not established by showing that other opposing inferences plausibly might have been drawn. <span class="Italic">Pena v.

<p class="Body-Text">Although the reviewing court defers to the AJ on credibility issues, automatic acceptance of credibility findings has become less frequent over time, as courts have a greater opportunity to evaluate the Board's review process.

DLA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 84-1593); <span class="Italic">Curran v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 714 F.2d 913, 915 (9th Cir. 1983) (including the cases cited in that opinion). The <span class="Italic">Connolly</span> case was not mentioned, but its theme was developed, in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1330-32 (Fed. Cir. 1985), a sexual harassment case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the relationship between the board and the presiding official and the absence of any restriction by statute or regulation, there can be no question but that the board has the <span class="Italic">power</span> to reject a presiding official's decision in a particular case and substitute its own decision, either on the facts or on the law. There is also no question but that the board has the <span class="Italic">power</span> in appropriate cases to substitute its judgment for that of the presiding official with respect to the credibility of witnesses....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The effect on our review function, where the board and the presiding official disagree on the credibility of witnesses, has not been previously addressed by this court. The analogous situation of a disagreement between the National Labor Relations Board and one of its trial examiners was, however, considered by the Supreme Court in the landmark <span class="Italic">Universal Camera</span> decision, in which the Court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We do not require that the examiner's findings be given more weight than in reason and in the light of judicial experience they deserve. The "substantial evidence" standard is not modified in any way when the Board and its examiner disagree. We intend only to recognize that evidence supporting a conclusion may be less substantial when an impartial, experienced examiner who has observed the witnesses and lived with the case has drawn conclusions different from the Board's than when he has reached the same conclusion. <span id="Page_5205"></span>The findings of the examiner are to be considered along with the consistency and inherent probability of testimony. The significance of his report, of course, depends largely on the importance of credibility in the particular case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Universal Camera</span>, 340 U.S. at 496.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">... The MSPB must afford special deference to the presiding official's findings respecting credibility where the presiding official relies expressly or by necessary implication on the demeanor of the witnesses. On appeal to this court, when a finding by the presiding official of this nature has been reversed by the board, we cannot sustain the board's decision unless the board has articulated a sound reason, based on the record, for its contrary evaluation of the testimonial evidence. The board is not free simply to disagree with the presiding official's assessment of credibility....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these principles to the present case, the issue before this court becomes whether or not the board's evaluation of the weight of the evidence is reasonable (i.e., supported by substantial evidence) taking into consideration that the presiding official, who heard the witnesses, had evaluated the agency's evidence as insufficient to meet the preponderance of evidence standard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jackson</span> went on to conclude that the Board could not reject a favorable finding by the AJ regarding the appellant's credibility and then find a complaining witness credible without making clear a reason for the choice between the witnesses. "[O]n that matter, the presiding official is without question the better judge of who to believe." The court stated, however, that if the Board engages in a more careful and articulated weighing of disputed evidence than the AJ, its credibility determinations will be upheld.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Showing some displeasure with the Board's credibility analysis, <span class="Italic">Schulman v. SBA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3297), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize the deference normally accorded to the trier of fact in making witness credibility determinations, but here, where the board's decision relies on critical statistics that were demonstrated on cross examination to be wrong, we cannot agree with the board's reliance on the testimony of Hallock. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer v. Department of Treasury</span>, 757 F.2d 1281, 1284 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (stating that a court need not accept an administrative evaluation of credibility where the testimony is "inherently improbable or discredited by undisputed evidence or physical fact").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because credibility findings are scrutinized by a reviewing court, the Federal Circuit occasionally reverses and remands for reconsideration based on a lack of sufficient or appropriate findings to sustain the result reached by the Board. This occurred in <span class="Italic">Goldstein v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1570, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (this opinion was apparently withdrawn as a precedential decision and is now nonprecedential) :</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Per its own precedent in <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of Army</span>, 35 MSPR 453 (1987), the Board must ensure that the AJ has made appropriate credibility judgments, detailing where and why she credited certain testimony over other testimony and resolving or reconciling all material conflicts in the record. Where the AJ has not, the Board must fill in the gaps, remanding for further evidentiary hearing if necessary. Although we review credibility and other factual determinations under an extremely deferential standard, where, as here, the Board and/or the AJ have failed to make necessary findings, we will not "rubber stamp" the decision because of a deferential standard of review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Long v. SSA</span>, 635 F.3d 526, 530 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (Judge Dyk, concurring), noted of Board factfinding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The general rule is that the Board is free to re-weigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of one of its administrative judges. <span class="Italic">Leatherbury v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 524 F.3d 1293, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 288 F.3d 1288, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2002). "An important exception, however, is that the Board is not 'free to overturn an administrative judge's demeanor based credibility findings merely because it disagrees with those findings."'<span class="Italic"> Leatherbury,</span> 524 F.3d at 1304. Specifically,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">where an administrative judge [is] able to observe the demeanor of a testifying witness and, as a result, the administrative judge's findings [are] explicitly or implicitly based on the demeanor of the witness, the Board may not simply disagree with the AJ's assessment of credibility... unless the [B]oard has articulated sound reasons, based on the record, for its contrary evaluation of the testimonial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1304-05 (quotation marks omitted). Therefore, "if the [Board] 's reasons for overturning demeanor-based credibility determinations are not sufficiently sound, its decision does not survive substantial evidence review." <span class="Italic">Haebe,</span> 288 F.3d at 1301.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Leatherbury v. Dept. of Army</span>, 524 F.3d 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (reversing the Board's determination to set aside an AJ credibility determinations in the absence of evidence warranting a different result reached by the AJ) (<span class="Italic">following remand, Leatherbury v. Dept. of Army,</span> 110 MSPR 308, 2008 MSPB 308 (2008)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cunningham v. USPS</span>, 328 Fed. Appx. 646, 646-48 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) (reversing 109 MSPR 402) (following remand, mitigating penalty, <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 457, 2009 MSPB 200 (2009)), found the Federal Circuit reversing a Board decision, based upon deficient credibility analysis, that reinstated removal rather than accepting mitigation directed by the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Cunningham served as a Mail Handler at the Processing and Distribution Center in Cleveland, Ohio. On February 11, 2007, Mr. Cunningham and another Postal Service worker, Mr. Melvin Allmond, were involved in a physical altercation on postal property after work. Neither Mr. Cunningham nor Mr. Allmond sought medical treatment that night for their injuries. After an investigation, Mr. Cunningham was issued a Notice of Proposed Removal based on charges of Improper Conduct/Violation of Zero Tolerance Policy. Mr. James Hostetler ("Deciding Official") issued Mr. Cunningham a Letter of Decision, sustaining the charge and removing him from the Postal Service effective June 16, 2007. Mr. Cunningham appealed the decision to the Board, which assigned the case to an AJ.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the Deciding Official had not considered mitigating factors in his decision to remove Mr. Cunningham, contrary to the requirement of <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981). <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> No. CH-0752-07-0532-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Oct. 16, 2007). The AJ mitigated the removal penalty to a 30-day suspension without pay, finding, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that Mr. Allmond was the primary aggressor and that Mr. Cunningham had acted in self-defense. The Postal Service filed a petition for review with the Board. The full Board reversed the decision of the AJ and sustained Mr. Cunningham's removal, finding that the Deciding Official had considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors such that the Deciding Official's penalty decision deserved deference. <span class="Italic">Cunningham,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. at 413. Mr. Cunningham timely filed this appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that a penalty's reasonableness should be assessed under the twelve factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas.</span> <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Webster v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 911 F.2d 679, 686 (Fed. Cir. 1990). One of the factors is "mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad faith, malice or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter." <span class="Italic">Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305. We have held that a failure to consider significant mitigating circumstances constitutes an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kline v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> F.A.A., 808 F.2d 43, 45 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In addition, the Board has held that an agency may establish a zero tolerance policy that results in automatic removal if the agency has effectively communicated the policy of removing all employees who engage in the prohibited conduct, and if the agency has consistently followed the policy. <span class="Italic">See Tucker v. Veterans Admin.,</span> 11 M.S.P.R. 131, 133-34 (1982). Because neither party contends that the policy in the present case has met these requirements, we find that Mr. Cunningham's penalty must be analyzed according to the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Cunningham argues that the Board erred in overturning the AJ's finding that the Deciding Official had not considered the mitigating circumstances <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor. We agree. The Board is not "free to overturn an administrative judge's demeanor based credibility findings merely because it disagrees with those findings." <span class="Italic">Leatherbury v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 524 F.3d 1293, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2008), (quoting <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 288 F.3d 1288, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2002)). A Board decision does not survive substantial evidence review if its reasons for overturning demeanor-based credibility determinations are not "sufficiently sound." <span class="Italic">Haebe,</span> 288 F.3d at 1301. The Deciding Official testified before the AJ that he was aware of and considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in his decision to remove Mr. Cunningham. However, he later admitted that in his view, the agency's zero tolerance policy requires removal for a sustained charge of violence in the workplace. Therefore, the AJ found that the Deciding Official claimed that he applied and considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, but his testimony in this regard lacked credibility, because he applied the Zero Tolerance Policy, a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule requiring removal. The Board overturned the AJ's finding, citing the Deciding Official's testimony that he had considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Cunningham,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. at 413. Because the Board gives no reason for overturning the AJ's credibility finding relative to the application of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the AJ's determination must stand. The Board thus abused its discretion by granting deference to the Deciding Official's decision, which, per the AJ's findings, was not properly based on the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the Board's decision in this case deviates from its standard practice of finding suspension the appropriate penalty in cases such as the present case. The Board has found mitigation of a removal to a suspension appropriate in a charge of physical assault on a co-worker where (1) no serious injury results; (2) no weapons are used; (3) the employee has a history of satisfactory performance; (4) the agency does not rely upon a prior disciplinary record in selecting the penalty; and (5) <span id="Page_5206"></span>there is an element of provocation present. <span class="Italic">Faucher v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 41 M.S.P.R. 336, 339 (1989) (finding a 60-day suspension the maximum reasonable penalty when all five of these circumstances were present); <span class="Italic">see also Quinata v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 76 (1991) (removal mitigated to a 120-day suspension when the appellant was not the primary aggressor); <span class="Italic">Lindsey v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 9 M.S.P.R. 468, 471 (1982) (removal mitigated to a 60-day suspension); and <span class="Italic">Grandison v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 7 M.S.P.R. 301, 304 (1981) (removal mitigated to a 60-day suspension). It appears from the record that all five of these circumstances are present in this case, and the Board has not held otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, the decision of the Board is reversed, and the case is remanded for an appropriate remedy in favor of Mr. Cunningham consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the Federal Circuit may not require the highest standards of analysis by an AJ to affirm credibility determinations, <span class="Italic">McBeth v. SSA</span>, 244 Fed. Appx. 369, 373 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it would have been more helpful to this court if the AJ had discussed the <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> factors[4] and provided specific reasons for why he credited Stephens' testimony over that of McBeth, this court accords great deference to the AJ's credibility determinations, <span class="Italic">Griessenauer v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 754 F.2d 361, 364 (Fed. Cir. 1985), unless they are "inherently improbable or discredited by undisputed evidence or physical fact," <span class="Italic">Hanratty v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 819 F.2d 286, 288 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (internal citation omitted). We will not reweigh the evidence, nor will we redo the AJ's credibility determination, where, as here, there is substantial evidence to support the AJ's findings and decision sustaining these charges of misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Hillen v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (M.S.P.B. 1987) (setting forth the following factors for resolving credibility issues: "(1) [t]he witness's opportunity and capacity to observe the event or act in question; (2) the witness's character; (3) any prior inconsistent statement by the witness; (4) a witness's bias, or lack of bias; (5) the contradiction of the witness's version of events by other evidence or its consistency with other evidence; (6) the inherent improbability of the witness's version of events; and (7) the witness's demeanor.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wright v. USPS</span>, 183 F.3d 1328, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 1999), chastised the Board for allowing irrelevant factors to skew its analysis of testimony. The "virtually unreviewable" standard generally applied to credibility determinations yielded to concerns about the Board's approach to evidence offered by a spouse to support the appellant's version of controlling events:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are mindful that credibility determinations by the board are "virtually unreviewable." <span class="Italic">See Hambsch v. Department of Treasury</span>, 796 F.2d 430, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1986). This special deference "simply recognizes the reality that the conduct of a witness while testifying may fairly detract from the written word." <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ("The MSPB must afford special deference to the presiding official's findings respecting credibility where the presiding official relies expressly or by necessary implication on the demeanor of the witnesses."). Here, however, the board dismissed testimony helpful to Wright based on considerations unrelated to the conduct of witnesses at the hearing. These rulings are undeserving of the higher level of deference given to credibility determinations that are based on a witness' demeanor. <span class="Italic">See Chauvin v. Department of Navy</span>, 38 F.3d 563, 566 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("[T]he board must give special deference to the [administrative judge's] factual findings that are based... on the demeanor of a witness."); <span class="Italic">DeSarno v. Department of Commerce</span>, 761 F.2d 657, 661 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (affirming presiding official's credibility determinations because it was based on witnesses' demeanor); <span class="Italic">Griessenauer v. Department of Energy</span>, 754 F.2d 361, 364 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (same).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Larson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 260 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (acknowledging the "virtually unreviewable" standard for credibility determinations, but adding as to a telephone hearing ("here the AJ conducted a telephonic hearing, so the AJ's observations of the witnesses were somewhat limited") that "we may fully consider such determinations and assess the proper weight to assign to such determinations in light of the other evidence of record.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although it is difficult to obtain any review by the appellate courts of Board factual (i.e., credibility) decisions, the Federal Circuit does reverse or remand a small number of Board decisions each year on the basis of the court's differences of opinion with the Board concerning factual conclusions. Alteration of the result reached by the Board does not occur often and, when it does, the opinion of the court is frequently unpublished or nonprecedential. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Long v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 91-3369) (disagreement within the court concerning whether the court was reviewing the record for substantial evidence or retrying the facts).</p>
