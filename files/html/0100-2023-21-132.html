<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-131"><span class="space">G.</span> DISCONTINUED SERVICE ANNUITY</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee may be eligible for retirement earlier than statutes setting age and service requirements would ordinarily allow. An agency may obtain authority from OPM, during a reorganization, to offer an early retirement to selected groups of employees, and that is known as early optional retirement, described in the OPM website, <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/csrs-information/types-of-retirement/#url=Early-Retirement">https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/csrs-information/types-of-retirement/#url=Early-Retirement</a> (CSRS) <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/types-of-retirement/#url=Early-Retirement;">https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/types-of-retirement/#url=Early-Retirement (FERS)</a>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Early Optional Retirement</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If your agency undergoes a major reorganization, reduction in force, or transfer of function, and a significant percentage of the employees will be separated, or will be reduced in pay, the head of your agency can ask the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to permit early optional retirement for eligible employees. If your agency gets approval to permit early optional retirements, eligible employees will be notified of the opportunity to retire voluntarily.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Early retirement may also be possible for an employee who, meeting defined service and age requirements, is involuntarily separated from the federal government under circumstances summarized in the OPM website, <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/csrs-information/types-of-retirement/#url=Early-Retirement">https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/csrs-information/types-of-retirement/#url=Early-Retirement</a> (CSRS) and <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/types-of-retirement/#url=Early-Retirement">https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/types-of-retirement/#url=Early-Retirement</a> (FERS):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Discontinued Service Retirement Because of an Involuntary Separation</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "involuntary separation" means any separation against the will and without the consent of the employee, other than "for cause" for misconduct or delinquency. The most common cause of an involuntary separation is a reduction in force. Another frequent cause for an involuntary separation is when the location of an office or unit is moved to an area outside the commuting area of the old worksite. Employees who decline reasonable offers of other positions are not eligible for discontinued service annuities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Exception: If, when you accepted your current position, you were placed under a general mobility agreement whereby you would be subject to geographic reassignment, you would not be eligible for discontinued service annuity rights if your position is moved to an area outside the commuting area.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If your agency-</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022; makes you a reasonable offer and you choose to decline the offer and resign, you will not qualify for discontinued service retirement, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022; separates you by adverse action procedures for not complying with a directed reassignment to a position that is a "reasonable offer"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">your separation would not be qualifying for discontinued service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Reasonable Offer</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022; Written offer of another position in your agency and commuting area for which you are qualified, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022; Which is no more than two grades or pay levels below your current grade or pay level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Commuting Area</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Geographic area that usually constitutes one area for employment purposes. It includes any population center (or two or more neighboring ones) and the surrounding localities in which people live and reasonably can be expected to travel back and forth daily in their usual employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With greater specificity, Chapter 44 of the OPM Retirement Handbook provides the bases for a discontinued service annuity (DSR):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;Involuntary Separation</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An involuntary separation that may qualify an employee for a discontinued service retirement is any separation against the will and without the consent of the employee other than a separation for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency. These non-disciplinary actions are documented on the SF 50, Notification of Personnel Action, as "terminations."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4273"></span>EXAMPLES: Separations that are involuntary for discontinued service retirement purposes include, but are not limited to, separations for:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">-&#x2003;Reduction-in-force (RIF);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">-&#x2003;Abolishment of position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">-&#x2003;Lack of funds;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">-&#x2003;Expiration of incumbent's term of office;</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The bases for a grant of discontinued service annuity were described, <span class="Italic">Gammill v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 484, 486-89 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In early 1982, appellant, an Air Traffic Control Specialist with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), was advised by the FAA that he could transfer to another facility, apply for a discontinued service retirement annuity, or seek a merit promotion and apply for various vacancies because his facility was being closed. In the event that appellant elected either of the latter two options, the agency stated that the travel order for reassignment would be canceled. Subsequently, in settlement of a complaint of discrimination on the basis of handicap, an agreement was signed between appellant and the FAA in which the FAA agreed to extend the effective date of appellant's reassignment to November 14, 1982, and to approve four months of sick leave for appellant. In return, appellant agreed to resign effective November 13, 1982, in order to apply for a discontinued service retirement annuity, and to withdraw his discrimination complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM denied appellant's application based on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.504, which precludes an employee working under a mobility agreement from receiving discontinued service retirement benefits if that employee had declined an offer of reassignment. OPM noted further that appellant was not involuntarily separated because his resignation in lieu of reassignment under the FAA's mobility agreement was voluntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the presiding official affirmed OPM's denial. She dismissed appellant's argument that he would not have resigned had he known there would be a problem obtaining the annuity, finding that the fact that the parties did not discuss the effect of the FAA's mobility agreement at the time of settlement did not justify disregarding the agreement in the instant proceeding. She further found that although his resignation was involuntary for purposes of his relationship with the FAA due to his reliance on agency misinformation, an involuntary retirement for purposes of a discontinued service annuity excluded a retirement under appellant's circumstances pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.504.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant now petitions for review of that initial decision, contending the following: 1) that the presiding official ignored court precedent which requires examination of the circumstances surrounding the separation and the reasonable reliance of an employee on governmental representations, in determining eligibility for discontinued service benefits; and 2) that the presiding official misinterpreted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336 by relying on Section 8336(d) rather than Section 8336(e), which relates to hazardous duty retirement for air traffic controllers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the conclusion of OPM and the presiding official that appellant's separation was voluntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d) only requires that an employee's separation be involuntary to establish entitlement to a discontinued service annuity. At the time appellant first applied for an annuity in August 1982 there was no OPM regulation restricting this provision. Effective October 1, 1982, as a result of a provision in the Omnibus Budget Revitalization Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-253, OPM issued the regulation which precluded approval of appellant's application for a discontinued service annuity, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.504.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That regulation states that "[a]n employee who would otherwise be eligible for retirement based on involuntary separation from the service is not entitled to an annuity...if the employee has declined a reasonable offer of another position." OPM's application of Section 831.504 to appellant's retirement implies that, but for the FAA's mobility agreement, it considered appellant as "otherwise...eligible for retirement based on <span class="Italic">involuntary</span> separation." (Emphasis supplied.) OPM, however, stated in its reconsideration decision that appellant's application warranted denial because his "resignation...amounted to a <span class="Italic">voluntary</span> action." We now address that conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether a separation is involuntary for purposes of determining eligibility for a discontinued service annuity, FPM Supplement 831-1, Subch. 511-2(a) (September 21, 1981) provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;Definition of term. The term <span class="Italic">involuntary separation</span> means any separation against the will and without the consent of the employee, other than separation for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency. Examples are: reduction in force; abolishment of position; lack of funds; expiration of incumbent's term of office; liquidation of an office or of an entire agency; inefficiency (unless due to the employee's misconduct); transfer of function outside the commuting area; disability (provided the separation action is initiated by the agency); separation during probation because of failure to qualify; or separation of an indefinite or temporary employee under OPM's instructions for displacement (section 316.801 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations). <span class="Italic">Note, however, that whether a separation is involuntary depends upon all the facts in a particular case; it is the true substance of the action which governs rather than the methods followed or the terminology used....</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under this provision, it is the true substance of an action which determines whether a separation is voluntary or not for discontinued service retirement purposes. <span class="Italic">See Yarbrough v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 770 F.2d 1056, 1059 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Patterson v. United States,</span> 436 F.2d 438, 439-41 (Ct. Cl. 1971); <span class="Italic">Browning v. United States,</span> 373 F.2d 915, 918-19 (Ct. Cl. 1967); <span class="Italic">Matthews v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 4 M.S.P.R. 431 (1980). <span class="Italic">Cf. Pauley v. United States,</span> 440 F.2d 426 (Ct. Cl. 1971); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 10 MSPB 49 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence in this case demonstrates that the FAA and appellant both believed that appellant was eligible for a discontinued service retirement annuity. As early as June 1982, appellant wrote a letter to OPM asking whether he was eligible for a discontinued service retirement. The response to that letter, dated November 30, 1982, indicated that appellant's letter was not received in the proper office until November 15, 1982. By the time appellant received the reply, appellant and the FAA had signed the settlement agreement. A Civil Rights Officer of the FAA submitted a letter to OPM explaining that none of the FAA officials involved in informing appellant concerning the retirement option, or in informally settling his discrimination complaint, was aware that the provision in the Omnibus Budget Revitalization Act pertaining to mobility agreements, would preclude approval of appellant's application. When settlement efforts were initiated and when settlement was consummated in late October 1982, FAA officials were unaware of the Act's effective date of October 1, 1982; the FAA had no reason to doubt that the application would be approved, based on knowledge of existing regulations prior to October 1, 1982.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the court held that a resignation is involuntary if it is obtained by agency misinformation; the misleading information can be negligently or innocently provided. If the employee materially relies on the misinformation to his detriment, his retirement is considered involuntary. <span class="Italic">See also Scharf v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 710 F.2d 1572, 1574-75 (Fed. Cir. 1983). We find, therefore, that based upon the facts of this case, appellant's resignation was involuntary with respect to the FAA. Although a finding of involuntariness due to misrepresentation is not sufficient to establish entitlement to a discontinued service annuity, it is sufficient as a basis to void the settlement agreement, leaving appellant on the rolls in a position in which he was eligible for discontinued service retirement prior to October 1, 1982 because of the closing of the facility at which he worked.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously found that reasonable detrimental reliance on erroneous information from the employing agency may warrant a change in the retirement date. <span class="Italic">See Potter v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 21 M.S.P.R. 476 (1984). In the instant case, it is clear that appellant would have elected to retire on or before September 30, 1982, had he been provided the correct information regarding his ineligibility for an annuity after that date. Under these circumstances, appellant's reasonable reliance on the agency's misinformation entitles him to the annuity.<span class="Italic"> See Scharf, supra.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find this case distinguishable from the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Shelley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 267 (1981), where we found that the agency is not equitably estopped from terminating appellant's survivor annuity based upon misinformation about the extent of the <span id="Page_4274"></span>benefits. The holding in <span class="Italic">Shelley</span> precludes estoppel in cases where the party claiming entitlement to benefits under federal statutes and lawfully promulgated regulations fails to satisfy the requirements imposed by Congress. "Were we to estop the Government in those cases we would be interfering with the duty of administrative agencies and courts to follow the mandate of Congress and limit payments to those whom our elected representatives have deemed eligible."<span class="Italic">Shelley, supra</span> at 230-31, citing to <span class="Italic">Gressley v. Califano,</span> 609 F.2d 1265 at 1268 (7th Cir. 1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, on the other hand, the appellant met the eligibility requirements for a discontinued service annuity prior to October 1, 1982. To accord appellant equitable relief would not require a waiver or nullification of statutory provisions; all that would be required is an administrative adjustment of the effective date of his retirement to one which he was eligible to choose from the beginning. <span class="Italic">See Potter, supra.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is the nature of the event leading to the claimed discontinued service annuity, not nomenclature on personnel paperwork, that controls annuity entitlement, <span class="Italic">Matthews v. OPM</span>, 4 MSPR 431, 434-36 (1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM bases its assertion on FPM Supp. 831-1, subch. Sll-2, interpreting the statute as requiring an employee to receive written notice that he or she faces involuntary separation as of some specific date because of coming organizational changes before his or her resignation may be accepted as involuntary and qualifying for discontinued service retirement. OPM asserts that appellant did not establish that he received specific written notice of the transfer of his function as did the other employees in his office and that his election to retire must be considered voluntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, OPM asserts that the presiding official exceeded her authority to order corrective action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1205 (a) (2) allegedly because in "retirement appeals, only the appellant and the Compensation Group" of OPM "are parties before the Board," and it is OPM as the employing agency, not the Compensation Group in OPM, which has the authority to amend an employee's SF-50 form in his or her personnel records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not here make any determination as to the binding effect of the FPM Supplement provisions generally. However, OPM's myopic construction of the FPM Supplement provision to require, without exception, a specific written notice of involuntary separation before an employee may qualify for a discontinued service retirement must be rejected. Not only did OPM fail to raise this or any other issue before the presiding official, but OPM also ignores its own language in former FPM Supp. 831-1, subch. S11-2 (a) (December 16, 1974). Subchapter S11-2 (a) set the tone for the entire section on involuntary separation for discontinued service retirement purposes and provided, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Definition of term</span>. The term <span class="Italic">involuntary separation</span> means any separation against the will and without the consent of the employee, other than separation for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency. Examples are: Reduction in force; abolishment of position; lack of funds; expiration of term of office; liquidation of an office or of an entire agency; inefficiency (unless due to the employee's misconduct); disability (provided the separation action is initiated by the agency); separation during probation because of failure to qualify; or separation of an indefinite or temporary employee under the Commission's instructions for displacement (section 316.801 of the regulations). <span class="Italic">Note, however, that whether a separation is involuntary depends upon all the facts in a particular case; it is the true substance of the action which governs rather than the methods followed or the terminology used....</span>&#8197;(Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Court of Claims has also held under this provision that it is the true substance of an action which determines whether a separation is voluntary or not for discontinued service retirement purposes. A separation is involuntary if the separation is against the will and without the consent of the employee. <span class="Italic">See Patterson v. United States,</span> 436 F.2d 438, 439-41 (Ct. Cl. 1971); <span class="Italic">Browning v. United States,</span> 373 F.2d 915, 918-19 (Ct. Cl. 1967).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee was entitled to a discontinued service annuity who was first separated for poor performance, settled the performance case by reinstatement to a term appointment, served in that appointment, once extended, for the time needed to qualify for a DSR--the purpose of the settlement--and then appealed OPM's decision denying the retirement on the basis that the settlement was an artifice to establish a retirement entitlement, <span class="Italic">Eller v. OPM</span>, 121 MSPR 17, 19-26 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-13, 2014 MSPB 19 (2014) (recon. petition denied, <span class="Italic">Eller v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was removed from his former position with the Department of the Interior in November of 2004 for unacceptable performance. The appellant filed an initial appeal of his removal with the Board, and the Department of the Interior and the appellant entered into a settlement agreement which provided that the appellant would be "convert[ed] ...to a four (4) year term appointment...as a Biologist (or other agreed upon position) beginning on January 12, 2005." The parties' settlement agreement specified that "[t]he term of the appointment provided for the agreed upon position will be for the period January 12, 2005 through and including January 12, 2009. The intent of this provision is to provide the Appellant adequate time under current [OPM] regulations...to achieve a sufficient age and sufficient years of federal service to permit him to receive a discontinued service annuity should his federal service discontinue at the end of the term specified herein."At the time of the appellant's removal from employment in November of 2004, the appellant was approximately 46 years old and had 18 years of federal service, thus making him ineligible for a DSR annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414(b).[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Under this section, an employee covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) "who...is separated from the service involuntarily, except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency...after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service, is entitled to an annuity." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414(b)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the execution of the settlement agreement, the appellant served as a Biologist in the term position for 4 years, at the expiration of which, the agency extended the appellant's employment for 1 additional year. In February of 2010, the Department of the Interior separated the appellant from service citing the expiration of his term appointment, and the appellant applied for an immediate DSR annuity with OPM. At the time of his application for a DSR annuity in February of 2010, the appellant had over 23 years of federal service and was 51 years old.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM issued an initial decision in September of 2012 denying the appellant's application for a DSR annuity, and it issued a final reconsideration decision in February of 2013 again finding that the appellant was ineligible for such an annuity. In its decisions, OPM determined that the appellant was ineligible to receive a DSR annuity at the time of his separation from employment in November of 2004 because he failed to satisfy both the age and service requirements at that time, and it further explained that it would not credit the 5 years he served in the term Biologist position toward his DSR annuity eligibility because the settlement agreement assigning him to that term position "granted [him] ...a retirement right where none existed." In making this determination, OPM explained that "[i]t appeared that [the Department of the Interior] gave [the appellant] a term appointment with the expectation that [OPM] would grant [the appellant] ...a [DSR annuity] ," and that its policies prohibit "agencies though [sic] settlement agreements to grant DSR's [sic] to employees who have a career in a long term appointment, and then move to a short term appointment with the expectation of receiving a discontinued service retirement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an initial appeal of OPM's reconsideration decision. The administrative judge issued an initial decision reversing OPM's reconsideration decision. In his initial decision, the administrative judge rejected OPM's argument that the settlement agreement "was an artifice designed to evade the statutory [DSR] requirements" which gave the appellant a right to receive retirement benefits where one did not otherwise exist; he also rejected OPM's argument that the appellant's acceptance of the term position pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement made his subsequent separation voluntary. OPM has filed a petition for review challenging the administrative judge's findings, and the appellant has filed a response in opposition to the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The settlement agreement which provided the appellant a term position was not an artifice designed to evade the statutory requirements of a DSR annuity.</span></p>

OPM, however, has provided guidance in its Civil Service Retirement System and Federal Employees' Retirement System Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices (Handbook) as to when a separation is involuntary for purposes of a DSR annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> Handbook &#x00A7; 44A1.1-2A. Examples of when a separation is involuntary include, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a reduction-in-force, an abolishment of the position, the expiration of the incumbent's term in office, and a removal based upon unacceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Gaghan v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general matter, "the retirement statutes allow for no discretion on the part of OPM in determining an individual's entitlement to an annuity." <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 119, &#x00B6; 9 (2008).

Cir. 2004), however, the Board recognized that "OPM has the authority to determine whether any separation date established by [a] [settlement] agreement is an artifice designed to evade the statutory requirements for entitlement to an annuity" when OPM is not a signatory or party to such an agreement. <span class="Italic">See also Stevenson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 481, &#x00B6; 12 (2006) ("[t]he Board held [in <span class="Italic">Parker</span>] that OPM has the authority to disregard a personnel action taken pursuant to a settlement agreement to which OPM was not a party, when the personnel action was an evasive device designed to allow the appellant to qualify for retirement benefits for which he would otherwise have been ineligible."). Applying this rule in <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, the Board found that OPM was not bound by the import of the settlement agreement because it created "documents suggesting that the appellant was appointed to a civilian position" at an earlier point in time than he actually was, which "were designed for no other purpose than <span class="Italic">to give the appearance</span> that the appellant had the service necessary for him to receive a CSRS annuity." <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 20 (emphasis added). Under these circumstances, the Board held that OPM properly denied the employee an annuity because the settlement agreement, through legal fiction alone, created a purported right to retirement benefits on paper where one did not otherwise exist. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18, 20-21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, OPM argues the settlement agreement returning the appellant to work in a term position amounted to such an artifice to evade the statutory eligibility requirements for a DSR annuity. ("[t]he administrative judge erred in ignoring the expressly stated purpose of the settlement agreement--to create legal fiction of DSR entitlement."). We cannot agree with OPM's reliance on <span class="Italic">Parker</span> under the facts of this case. Unlike the settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, which only created the impression of an employee's right to receive a retirement annuity on paper, <span class="Italic">see Parker</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 20, here, the settlement agreement returned the appellant to actual employment with his employing agency and the appellant actually served in this position for 5 years. This case is therefore distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Parker</span> because this employment arrangement was not an "evasive device designed to allow the appellant to qualify for retirement benefits for which he would otherwise have been ineligible," <span class="Italic">Stevenson</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 481, &#x00B6; 12, but rather was a means for returning the appellant to actual employment in order for him to qualify for a DSR annuity under the annuity computation formula. The fact that the settlement agreement's purpose was to return the appellant to service until he qualified for a DSR annuity does not create an artifice to evade statutory requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee is assigned to a position of employment in the federal service and actually serves in that position,[3] OPM "has no discretion to deviate from the computation formulas," and it cannot deny the employee an annuity based on its subjective determination that the employee's federal service fails to qualify him for an annuity when he otherwise objectively satisfies the statutory annuity formula. <span class="Italic">See Parker</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 20; <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 6.[4] Under these circumstances, OPM is required to apply the retirement annuity computation formulas objectively, and it may not reject an application for a DSR annuity either because it believes that the employee's federal service should not be counted toward his DSR annuity eligibility or because it disagrees with the motivation for returning the employee to actual federal service.[5] <span class="Italic">See Thompson</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">see also Parker</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 20 (noting that OPM had the authority to disregard a settlement creating documents which "were designed for no other purpose than <span class="Italic">to give the appearance</span> that the appellant had the service necessary to receive a CSRS annuity") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;OPM argues on petition for review that the Department of the Interior did not have a legitimate management need for the appellant to fill the Biologist position because he was allowed to select from among 4 open Biologist positions with the Department of the Interior, nationwide. We find this argument unpersuasive. Allowing an employee to select his assignment from several available positions does not mean that there was no legitimate need for any of those positions. OPM, moreover, has presented no evidence that the appellant did not perform the essential duties of his term position during the 5 years he served in the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In further support of this limitation, we note that OPM itself has argued to the Federal Circuit that an alleged involuntary retirement under chapter 75 cannot qualify as an involuntary separation for the purposes of a DSR annuity because, if required to process such a claim, OPM would "ha[ve] no authority and no regulations by which it could hale the [appellant's former employing] agency into court to test the employee's assertions" that her separation from employment was coerced. <span class="Italic">See Nebblett v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 237 F.3d 1353, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (agreeing with OPM's argument that "the remedies for coerced resignations [under chapter 75] and for retirement annuities when an employee is involuntarily removed are entirely different" and that "OPM is not equipped to resolve the question of whether [the appellant's] resignation was coerced by unlawful agency action" under chapter 75). Because OPM has no mechanism in place to explore the nature of the appellant's federal service, we find that OPM erred in concluding that the appellant's 5-year service in a term position should not be counted toward his DSR annuity eligibility. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Thompson</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We thus also reject OPM's assertion that although the appellant "perform[ed] creditable service during his term appointment," he did not "'earn[&#8197;] ' a DSR retirement [because] the parties to the settlement agreement arranged for it." Contrary to OPM's reasoning, we do not believe that the parties' intent to return the appellant to federal service in order for him to accrue sufficient federal service to apply for a DSR annuity vitiates the employee's objective satisfaction of the federal service longevity requirement for a DSR annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the settlement agreement assigning the appellant to a term position was not an artifice designed to evade the statutory DSR annuity requirements. Because the parties' settlement agreement required the appellant to provide actual employment services for the Department of the Interior, which the appellant performed, OPM lacks the discretion to reject the appellant's application for a DSR annuity where, as here, the appellant otherwise qualifies for an annuity under the statutory computation formula. We concur with the administrative judge that OPM erred in finding the appellant ineligible for a DSR annuity based upon his assignment to a term position pursuant to the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant was involuntarily separated from service, thus making him eligible for a DSR annuity at the end of his term position.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also argues that the appellant was not involuntarily separated from employment in February of 2010 because he voluntarily accepted a term position which he knew was limited in duration pursuant to the terms of the parties' settlement agreement. We disagree with OPM's assertion that the appellant's separation from employment under these circumstances was voluntary. "A separation is involuntary if the separation is against the will and without the consent of the employee." <span class="Italic">Matthews v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 431, 435 (1980); <span class="Italic">see also Gaghan</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 12 n.4. The Board has previously found separations from service to be voluntary when, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, an employee resigns from employment pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement or applies for either retirement or disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See Jordan</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 119, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (finding that an appellant who resigned pursuant to a settlement could not claim his separation was involuntary for purposes of receiving a DSR annuity); <span class="Italic">Gaghan</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 12 (finding that an application for disability retirement which is rejected does not transform an employee's separation from employment into an involuntary separation). As our decisions make clear, the hallmark of a voluntary separation from employment is the employee's initiation of his separation from employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miller v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 325, &#x00B6; 10 (2009) ("[t]he appellant was not lawfully involuntarily separated from his position when he decided to retire...instead of accepting the offered assignment."), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 361 Fed. Appx. 134 (Fed. Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Differing from these cases, however, the appellant in the instant appeal did not initiate his separation from employment with the Department of the Interior in February of 2010; rather, the appellant was separated based upon the expiration of his term appointment at the agency's initiative. The expiration of a term appointment, moreover, is included within OPM's enumeration of involuntary separations in its Handbook, <span class="Italic">see</span> Handbook, &#x00A7; 44A1.1-2A, and consistent with this written guidance, we find that the appellant's separation from employment upon the end of his term position was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Warren v. Department of Transportation</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 554, &#x00B6; 7 n.2 (2011) ("Although the Handbook lacks the force of law, it is entitled to deference in proportion to its 'power to persuade.'"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 493 Fed. Appx. 105 (Fed. Cir. 2013). We further note that the Department of the Interior extended the appellant's term position for 1 additional year, thus further demonstrating that the decision to separate the appellant from employment rested with the agency, not the appellant, and that the appellant's separation in February of 2010 was not a voluntary act which the appellant initiated.[6] <span class="Italic">See Nebblett</span>, 237 F.3d at 1356 (involuntary separations generally "are proper and legal acts taken by an agency that result in an employee's involuntary separation"); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 1359 (citing Board decisions which hold that an "'involuntary separation'...require[s] lawful agency action that provoked a separation").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The settlement agreement, moreover, did not provide that the appellant would be separated from employment upon a date certain, just that "[t]he term of appointment...will be for the period January 12, 2005 through and including January 12, 2009."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In further support of its argument on petition for review, OPM cites to a <span id="Page_4276"></span>section of its Handbook providing that "[a] separation is not qualifying for discontinued service retirement if the employee <span class="Italic">voluntarily leaves</span> regular longterm (career) employment to accept a short-term employment with full knowledge of its earlier termination." <span class="Italic">See</span> PFR File, Tab 1 at 9 (citing Handbook, &#x00A7; 44A2.1-8A) (emphasis added). We do not find OPM's citation to this portion of its Handbook persuasive. <span class="Italic">See Warren</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 554, &#x00B6; 7 n.2. The record reflects that the appellant did not "voluntarily leave[&#8197;] regular long-term (career) employment" in November of 2004 in order to accept a short-term position, but rather was involuntarily removed from employment for unacceptable performance under chapter 43.[7] OPM's reliance on this provision of its Handbook to deny the appellant a DSR annuity based upon his 5-year service in a term position is therefore misplaced. OPM's Handbook further explains, however, that "[i]n certain situations, terminations from short-term employment may be considered involuntary for discontinued service retirement. This would be the case if the appointment immediately followed an involuntary separation." Handbook, &#x00A7; 44A2.1-8B. Such are the facts of the present case. Thus, consistent with this portion of OPM's Handbook, we find that the expiration of the appellant's term position, which immediately followed his involuntary separation from employment under chapter 43, constitutes an involuntary separation from federal service which allows the appellant to apply for a DSR annuity. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;OPM does not dispute that the appellant's removal under chapter 43 was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board denied an OPM reconsideration petition in <span class="Italic">Eller v. OPM</span>, 121 MSPR 551, 556-65 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-29, 2014 MSPB 72 (2014), addressing additional points raised by OPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues for the first time on reconsideration that the appellant's federal service following his return to work pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Department of the Interior should not be counted toward his eligibility for a DSR annuity because it lasted for 5 years and, that without approval from OPM, a term position may last no longer than 4 years. Although the appellant argues in response that this is a new argument raised for the first time in OPM's petition for reconsideration, which the Board should not consider, the Board will review all of OPM's arguments raised in a petition for reconsideration <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, even if not asserted below, <span class="Italic">see Scott</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 467, &#x00B6; 9. We agree with the appellant's alternative argument, however, that OPM's reliance on the length of his service following his return to work does not preclude him from qualifying for a DSR annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.301(a), "[a]n agency may make a term appointment for a period of more than 1 year but not more than 4 years to positions where the need for an employee's services is not permanent." Agencies, moreover, "may extend appointments made for more than 1 year but less than 4 years up to the 4-year limit in increments determined by the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. OPM "may authorize exceptions beyond the 4-year limit when the extension is clearly justified and is consistent with applicable statutory provisions." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.301(b). Here, however, OPM contends that the Department of the Interior never requested permission to extend the appellant's term position beyond the 4-year regulatory limit, and it asserts that his service in a 5-year term position is ultra vires and thus voids his entire period of service for the purposes of determining his eligibility for a DSR annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant, however, that OPM has cited to no authority for this proposition, and we decline to adopt such a rule under the facts of this case. The Board looks to the totality of the circumstances to determine the nature of an employee's appointment. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 307, &#x00B6; 7 (2013). The Federal Circuit, moreover, recently opined that the "regulatory and statutory scheme requires that the nature [of an employee's] appointment be judged at the outset, <span class="Italic">without regard to service ultimately completed</span>." <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 741 F.3d 81, 87 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the settlement agreement returning the appellant to federal service, we find that the appellant was appointed to a term position. The parties' settlement agreement expressly stated that the appellant would be "convert[ed] ...to a four (4) year term appointment (GS 11/8) as a Biologist." Although the record developed below does not contain a copy of the Standard Form (SF) 50 effecting the appellant's appointment to this position, the SF-50 effecting his subsequent removal reflects that he was removed based upon the expiration of a term appointment. Despite the fact that this document was issued by the agency at the time of the appellant's removal, and not at the outset of his appointment, we find that the information contained therein is relevant insofar as it reflects the nature of the appellant's appointment at the time of its making, and it supports the conclusion that he was placed into a term position upon his return to federal service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hamilton v. Department of Defense</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 636, &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (an SF-50 may be considered as relevant evidence, but is not dispositive).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, moreover, that even if we were to accept OPM's argument that the appellant's service in a term position for more than 4 years without OPM's approval is ultra vires, we could not countenance the position advanced by OPM that his entire period of service is therefore <span class="Italic">void ab initio</span>. Under OPM's regulations, "[t]he employment of a term employee ends automatically on the expiration of his term appointment unless he has been separated earlier...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.303(b). Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the appellant began serving in his term position effective January 12, 2005, and he would have served in that position through and including January 11, 2009. At that time, the appellant would have had over 22 years of federal service and would have been 50 years old. To be entitled to a DSR annuity, he needed to have completed 20 years of service and have been 50 years old. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414(b)(1)(A); <span class="Italic">cf. Resnick v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 7 (2013) (finding that an applicant for an annuity under CSRS pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(e) must meet both the length of service and age requirements at the time of his separation). Thus, even if we were to discount the final year of the appellant's service with the Department of the Interior, which we do not, we would still conclude that he was appointed to a term position, by the expiration of which he had qualified for a DSR annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board's decision in Parker does not provide OPM with a basis to deny the appellant's application for an immediate DSR annuity.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for reconsideration, OPM also argues that the Board misinterpreted its prior decision in <span class="Italic">Parker</span> by narrowing the scope of authority it previously extended to OPM to determine whether any separation date established by a settlement agreement to which OPM is not a party is an artifice designed to evade the statutory requirements for entitlement to an annuity. <span class="Italic">See Parker</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 18. As explained below, we reaffirm our prior decision distinguishing <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, and, rather than narrowing <span class="Italic">Parker's</span> holding, we find that accepting OPM's application of <span class="Italic">Parker</span> to the facts of this case would constitute a considerable expansion of that precedent, which we cannot endorse. <span class="Italic">See Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, the Board had held that, when an employee resigns pursuant to a settlement agreement, the date of resignation under the agreement is controlling for determining retirement entitlements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jordan</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 614. In reaching this conclusion, the Board cited not only the policy considerations favoring the resolution of disputes through settlement but also the fact that a settlement entered into the record before the Board was equivalent to a final order and thus was entitled to the same effect as any other final Board order. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 615, 617. In <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, however, the Board overruled <span class="Italic">Jordan</span> insofar as it held that OPM is conclusively bound by the terms of a settlement agreement to which it was not a party.93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 18. Noting that factual admissions in a settlement agreement have been held not to be binding on a person who was not a party to the agreement and who did not have an opportunity to contest the alleged facts before the agreement was approved, <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00B6; 17 (citing <span class="Italic">In re Warmus</span>, 276 B.R. 688, 691, 694-95 (S.D. Fla. 2002)), the Board held that OPM has the authority to determine whether any separation date established by the agreement is an artifice designed to evade the statutory requirements for entitlement to an annuity, <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00B6; 18. The Board further explained that OPM's authority to question a personnel action taken as a result of a settlement applies whether the statutory provisions at issue implicate filing deadlines or substantive criteria for entitlement to a retirement benefit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we explained in our prior order, however, the factual circumstances leading to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Parker</span> differ significantly from the facts of this case. <span class="Italic">See Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9; <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18, 20-21. In <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, the appellant and the agency entered into a settlement agreement designed "<span class="Italic">for no other purpose than to give the appearance that the appellant had the service necessary for him to receive a CSRS annuity</span>," 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 20 (emphasis added), and it is undisputed that the appellant in that case never served any portion of the time that the parties' settlement agreement stipulated he had served, <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-21. The Board found that OPM could look behind the stipulations within a settlement agreement in an effort to determine whether the agreement contained an artifice designed to evade the statutory requirements for an employee's entitlement to an annuity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nowhere in the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, however, was there a suggestion that this authority extends beyond reviewing factual admissions or stipulations contained in settlement agreements. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 17 (discussing admissions and stipulations of fact in settlement agreements). It is undisputed, moreover, that the instant settlement agreement did not stipulate that the appellant served in a term position in which he did not serve but rather provided the appellant with the right to serve in a term position, in which he <span class="Italic">actually served</span>. Accordingly, the motivating concern in <span class="Italic">Parker</span>--that records could be revised or manipulated to reflect that something had occurred, which in reality had not--is not present in this case. Rather, the agreement at issue provided the appellant with the right to have something happen--his assignment to a term position for a period of years--which actually took place, and we again find no authority for OPM's position that it has the authority to look behind a federal employee's actual federal service to determine <span id="Page_4277"></span>whether he has earned the right to receive a retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 9 &#x0026; n.5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, as suggested above, adopting OPM's proposed application of <span class="Italic">Parker</span> would involve a substantial expansion of that decision. <span class="Italic">Parker</span> was focused on a stipulation of fact in a settlement and OPM's ability to ensure that such a stipulation was not intended to create title to a right which would not otherwise exist. <span class="Italic">See</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18. OPM's proposed subjective review of an applicant's actual federal service, and the motivation for such service, not only exceeds the scope of <span class="Italic">Parker</span> but also runs counter to long-established Board precedent holding that OPM is constrained by law to follow the annuity computation formulas passed by Congress. <span class="Italic">See Thompson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 6 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part, vacated in part, and remanded</span>, 230 F.3d 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table). We decline to read Parker beyond the facts presented in that case, and we reaffirm our prior finding that OPM may not reject an application for a DSR annuity either because it believes that the employee's federal service should not be counted toward his DSR annuity eligibility or because it disagrees with the motivation for returning the employee to actual federal service. <span class="Italic">See Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 9 &#x0026; n.5 (finding that the parties' intent for returning an employee to actual federal service does not vitiate the employee's objective satisfaction of the federal service longevity requirement for a DSR annuity).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">OPM's Handbook does not compel a different result in this case.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, OPM contends that the Board overlooked the general principle contained within its Handbook that "[a] separation is not qualifying for a [DSR annuity] if the employee voluntarily leaves regular long-term (career) employment to accept a short-term appointment with full knowledge of its early termination," <span class="Italic">see</span> Civil Service Retirement System and Federal Employees' Retirement System Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices (Handbook), &#x00A7; 44A2.1-8A, and that the Board also failed to consider an "exception to the exception" provision which provides that, if "short-term employment was arranged solely to create title to an annuity, the separation is not considered qualifying for [a DSR annuity] ," <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00A7; 44A2.1-8B. OPM further challenges the Board's assertion that the appellant was immediately placed in a term position following his removal under chapter 43 and that he actually served 5 full years in the term position. As explained below, we MODIFY our prior Opinion and Order on this latter factual issue. Our modification, however, does not change our analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, as we explained in our previous decision, we cannot agree with OPM that the appellant's original separation from employment with the Department of the Interior triggered the application of OPM's "general rule" that a separation from employment does not qualify an applicant for a DSR annuity when he voluntarily leaves regular long-term employment to accept a short-term appointment. <span class="Italic">See Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 11. The hallmark of a voluntary separation from employment is the employee's initiation of the action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 325, &#x00B6; 10 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 361 Fed. Appx. 134 (Fed. Cir. 2010)). The appellant's original separation from employment from the Department of the Interior, however, was taken pursuant to chapter 43 of Title 5, a performance-based action which OPM itself considers to be involuntary for the purposes of a DSR annuity. <span class="Italic">See Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 13; Handbook, &#x00A7; 44A1.1-2A. Thus, this case is dissimilar from those envisioned by the rule established in OPM's Handbook where an employee voluntarily leaves long-term employment and accepts a short-term position. For these same reasons, OPM's argument that the appellant was voluntarily converted from a career position to a term position pursuant to the settlement agreement is also unpersuasive. Although the appellant's conversion to a term appointment was the result of the settlement agreement, the impetus for that agreement was the agency's performance-based action under chapter 43. Here, where the appellant did not initiate his conversion to a term position, we find OPM's general rule inapplicable. <span class="Italic">See Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find OPM's argument that the appellant had a break in service between his career and term appointments unavailing. Pursuant to OPM's Handbook, a separation is qualifying for DSR purposes if, among other requirements, the employee moved to a time-limited appointment without a break in service exceeding 3 days. Handbook, &#x00A7; 44A2.1-8B. In her request for reconsideration, the Director argues that more than 3 days elapsed between the appellant's original removal from service with the Department of the Interior and the effective date of the settlement agreement rescinding his removal and converting him to a term appointment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing Handbook, &#x00A7; 44A2.1-8B). Under the terms of the settlement agreement, however, the appellant was restored to employment without a break in service. In the absence of an actual break in service, we find that the manner in which the appellant was returned to duty does not invalidate his actual federal service, the vast majority of which he actually served. <span class="Italic">See Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 9 &#x0026; n.5. Moreover, because we find that OPM's Handbook is entitled to little deference in this case, <span class="Italic">see infra</span> &#x00B6; 23, we also are unpersuaded that OPM's 3-day break in service rule should preclude the entirety of the appellant's service in his term position from being counted toward his DSR annuity eligibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find this case dissimilar from those in which the Board has held that an employee's resignation or retirement is deemed voluntary when effected pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement and precludes the appellant from relitigating whether his separation was voluntary for the purposes of an appeal under chapter 75 or a retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jordan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 119, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2008). Here, the Department of the Interior agreed to cancel the appellant's original involuntary removal under chapter 43 and to assign him to a term appointment. We thus find no support for OPM's argument that the appellant voluntarily initiated his departure from a career position with the Department of the Interior in order to accept a term position by voluntarily entering into a settlement with the Department of the Interior. <span class="Italic">See Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellant argues in response to OPM's petition, moreover, the OPM Handbook's "general rule" that a separation is not qualifying for a DSR annuity if the employee voluntarily leaves long-term employment to accept a short-term appointment with full knowledge of its early termination has been strongly criticized by the Federal Circuit, and we accord little deference to its application to the facts of this case. <span class="Italic">See Eldredge</span>, 451 F.3d at 1341-43 ("[n]either [OPM's] advisory opinion nor the Handbook cites any authority for the proposed awareness interpretation of 'involuntary separation'" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414(b)(1)(A), which is contained in Handbook &#x00A7; 44A2.1-8A); <span class="Italic">see also Warren v. Department of Transportation</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 554, &#x00B6; 7 n.2 (2011) (OPM's Handbook is only entitled to deference in proportion to its "power to persuade"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 493 Fed. Appx. 105 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Upon reading OPM's general rule, and its exceptions, we believe OPM's rule is designed to discourage an employee who, because of some desire to secure a term position, chooses to leave career employment in order to be eligible for a term appointment and then applies for a DSR annuity upon the expiration of that appointment. Under these circumstances, OPM's rule would appear to prohibit the employee from being eligible for a DSR annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> Handbook, &#x00A7; 44A2.1-8A. Those facts, however, are not the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, we find OPM's argument that the Board overlooked the "exception to the exception" clause, unavailing. <span class="Italic">See</span> Handbook, &#x00A7; 44A.2.1-8B ("[i]f the short-term employment was arranged solely to create title to an annuity, the separation is not considered qualifying for discontinued service retirement."). Although not specifically addressed in our prior decision, we find that this provision of OPM's Handbook essentially incorporates the rule which OPM petitions us to endorse in our decision in this matter. For the reasons discussed here, and in our prior decision, we decline to recognize that either OPM, or the Board, should undertake a merits-based review of why an agency may have appointed an employee to a term position after the employee serves in that position and objectively qualifies for a DSR annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414(b)(1)(A). <span class="Italic">See Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 9 &#x0026; n.5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon consideration of OPM's petition for reconsideration, however, we acknowledge that, although we stated in our prior decision that the appellant's service in his term position immediately followed his separation from employment under chapter 43, <span class="Italic">see Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 13, OPM is correct that the settlement agreement, which was signed in June 2005, retroactively placed the appellant in his term position effective January 11, 2005. As explained below, we find that this clarification does not change the outcome of this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, under the facts of this case, where the appellant actually served almost the entire duration of his term position, we cannot conclude that the appellant's entitlement to a DSR annuity is called into question. The difference between the facts of this case and <span class="Italic">Parker</span> reinforces our finding. Here, the appellant and the Department of the Interior entered into a settlement which returned the appellant to actual employment with the agency for over 4 and a half years, at the end of which the appellant objectively satisfied the statutory criteria for a DSR annuity. <span class="Italic">Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 3. In doing so, we recognize that 5 months of the appellant's term position were not actually served, and that this quantum of federal service only exists on paper. By contrast, however, the parties in <span class="Italic">Parker</span> entered into a settlement agreement stipulating that the appellant was appointed to a civilian position for no other purpose than to give the appearance that he had the civilian service necessary for him to receive a CSRS annuity. 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 20. Thus, we believe that the totality of the settlement in this case was not an artifice designed to evade the statutory requirements of a DSR annuity akin to the agreement in <span class="Italic">Parker</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, in making this finding, we do not endeavor to decide how much time an employee must actually serve in a term position in order to qualify for a DSR annuity under similar facts. <span class="Italic">See Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9; <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18, 20-21. We only decide that, under these facts, where the appellant actually served over 4 and a half years in the term position, he is entitled to receive the DSR annuity which he was originally denied. Even if the brief period of time the appellant <span id="Page_4278"></span>did not actually serve in the term appointment was deducted from his overall length of service, <span class="Italic">cf. Parker</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21, he would still objectively qualify for a DSR annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414(b)(1)(A) based on his length of service and age at the time of the expiration of his appointment in February 2010. We find, however, that our factual clarification does not compel a different result in this case, and we accordingly MODIFY our prior decision to reflect that the appellant actually served in the term position for almost the entire period of time he was placed therein.[4] <span class="Italic">See Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;This issue was not raised until the Director filed her petition for reconsideration, and we had no occasion to specifically examine the period of time between the appellant's removal and the effective date of the settlement agreement returning him to duty in our prior decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we have considered OPM's policy arguments that the Board's decision, if allowed to stand, would not only incentivize agencies to use similar settlement agreements in the future, but also would give "a pass [to employees whose performance is judged unacceptable] on having to meet the criteria for entitlement to an annuity under CSRS or FERS." We respectfully disagree with the pernicious effects OPM believes our prior decision will bear. At bottom, we believe OPM's focus on the reasoning behind an agency's decision to reemploy an employee or to enter into a settlement agreement providing for a specific type of employment arrangement is misplaced in the retirement annuity arena. As the Board originally recognized in <span class="Italic">Jordan</span>, the settlement of disputes brought before the Board promotes both public and explicit congressional policy, and we believe that OPM's position in this matter, if adopted, could cause agencies and employees to avoid settlements which return employees to duty for fear that years later OPM might deny an employee's application for retirement benefits because OPM believes that the employee should not have been returned to federal service.[5] <span class="Italic">See Jordan</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 615-16. OPM, moreover, provides no guidance as to how it would proceed to implement its suggested authority to retroactively evaluate the substance of an employee's federal service for the purpose of determining an applicant's eligibility to receive a DSR annuity, and we believe OPM's current processes and protocols are ill-designed to handle such adjudication. <span class="Italic">See Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 9 &#x0026; n.4 (citing and discussing <span class="Italic">Nebblett v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 237 F.3d 1353, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2001), in which the Federal Circuit agreed with OPM that OPM does not have the protocols in place to determine whether an employee's retirement was coerced by unlawful agency action and thus was involuntary for the purposes of a DSR annuity under the CSRS).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Such a scenario, moreover, could lead an employee to file a petition for enforcement with the Board on the theory that he has not received the full benefit of the agreement into which he entered, thus leading to the possibility of additional Board proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vance v. Department of the Interior</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 16 (2010) (outlining the possibilities if there is a material breach of a settlement agreement, including reinstating the appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We similarly believe that our prior decision does not reward employees whose performance has been found unacceptable under chapter 43. As we have explained, under the facts of this case, where the appellant actually served in a position of employment with the agency and otherwise objectively satisfies the statutory criteria for receiving a DSR annuity, the employee, by statute, has earned an entitlement to a DSR annuity. <span class="Italic">Eller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 9 n.5; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414(b)(1)(A). Although OPM may disagree with an agency's decision to reemploy a specific employee, the agency as an employer is vested with the authority to make that decision, and OPM should not collaterally undermine that decision through its administration of the federal employee retirement system.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If OPM denies a discontinued service annuity because the employee was fired for misconduct, and the employee challenges whether the acts leading to separation could validly be characterized as misconduct, on appeal the Board must assess the nature of the termination, as the Federal Circuit determined in <span class="Italic">Litzenberger v. OPM,</span> 231 F.3d 1333, 1336-1337 (Fed. Cir. 2000), when the employee argued that his separation, based on statements made in court, could not constitute a misconduct termination because the testimony in court was privileged:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...OPM ruled that "the removal was for conduct," not performance, and that "OPM has no authority" to review the conduct. Although OPM was correct that it could not make a collateral review of whether the removal was justified, OPM was incorrect in holding that any "conduct" leading to removal must necessarily satisfy the "misconduct or delinquency" requirement of 8336(d). Further, the Authority did not remove Mr. Litzenberger on grounds stated to constitute misconduct or delinquency, but for loss of confidence based on critical statements made under "absolute privilege," in the words of the Virginia court. OPM could not decide that the removal was for misconduct, a ground not mentioned by the Authority, without confronting the issue of the privileged testimony. OPM did not do so; and the Board erred in not reviewing this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that it could not review whether the underlying termination was based on misconduct or delinquency, citing <span class="Italic">Allen v. OPM,</span> 77 MSPR 212, 220 (1988), for the statement "[a]s we have previously stated, however, the determination of an involuntary separation for retirement purposes under 5 U.S.C. ch. 83 is totally separate and distinct from a determination of involuntary retirement for Board jurisdictional purposes under 5 U.S.C. ch. 75."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Allen</span> case concerned a group of Postal Service workers who accepted an "early out" offer of early retirement and later sought discontinued service annuities, arguing that their retirements were involuntary. To overcome the fact that they had accepted the early retirement offers, the workers sought to prove that their acceptances were the product of duress, coercion, or misrepresentation. In <span class="Italic">Allen</span> the Board held that an involuntary retirement had a different meaning in the context of a discontinued service annuity than it had in a wrongful discharge accusation, that the meaning in the former context was determined by OPM regulation as set forth in the Federal Personnel Manual, and that accepting an "early out" offer was not an involuntary separation for purposes of a discontinued service annuity. In <span class="Italic">Allen</span> the Board did evaluate the merits of whether the separations were involuntary under the correct standards, explaining that the appellants were trying to prove involuntariness under the wrong standard, not that they were precluded from alleging involuntariness because the issue was "collateral."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If anything, <span class="Italic">Allen</span> supports Mr. Litzenberger's assertion that the Board was required to determine whether his annuity was properly denied. Allen does not support the Board's holding that it could not review the facts of Mr. Litzenberger's termination insofar as they relate to entitlement to an annuity under Chapter 83, and thus that the Board could not review OPM's denial of the annuity. That is not the holding of Allen. OPM cites no other authority for its or the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Litzenberger does not want his job back; he wants the annuity he earned after over twenty-five years of service. OPM could not deny an annuity for misconduct or delinquency without establishing or verifying the misconduct or delinquency, including verifying whether the assertedly culpable statements were privileged under Virginia law. Although Mr. Litzenberger does not dispute that the charge of loss of confidence or trust might suffice to warrant removal from at-will employment, if Mr. Litzenberger's statements in connection with the Virginia litigation were the only asserted misconduct, the Board was required to determine whether such statements can support denial of an annuity under 8336(d).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Remanding an appeal because of an OPM error as to the dates of a mobility agreement and the date that the appellant might have been eligible for a discontinued service annuity, <span class="Italic">Beasley v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 70, 73 (1989), noted an FPM provision concerning the date that an individual may become eligible for the discontinued service annuity when there is a reorganization of the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of his contention, the appellant relies on Federal Personnel Management (FPM) Supp. Section S11-2(b) (Sept. 21, 1981), which was in effect at the time he submitted his application for discontinued service retirement in 1982, and which provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is not always necessary that an actual separation from Government employment be directed. However, an employee must have definite knowledge from a specific written notice that he or she faces involuntary separation from his or her position or from Federal service as of some specific date because of coming organizational changes before his or her resignation may be accepted as involuntary and qualifying for discontinued service retirement. The notice may be given in advance of official management action effecting the changes. In certain instances, a general notice directed to all employees facing involuntary separation may be acceptable if prior approval of the notice is obtained from OPM.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee was entitled to a discontinued service annuity when he resigned after being told he would be geographically reassigned. It was immaterial that after his resignation he was told that the official who proposed his discharge for failure to accept the reassignment had no authority to do so and that the appellant could retract his resignation. It was the basis of the separation, resignation, when it occurred, that controlled, not the agency's action attempting to rectify administrative error after the date of the separation, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. OPM,</span> 11 MSPR 60, 63-64 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining that the presiding official's interpretation of the law and guidance in this case is not erroneous we note specifically 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d) which provides in essence that an employee who has attained <span id="Page_4279"></span>certain age and service requirements and who is separated involuntarily, except by removal for cause, is entitled to an annuity. FPM Supp. 831-1, S11-2(e) provides that separation of an employee who receives a notice that reassignment is being directed outside the commuting area is involuntary. Thus, as the presiding official found, this guidance is <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> applicable in the instant case.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In determining whether a situation falls within the law and guidance, the facts and circumstances of each case must be considered. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> written notice of impending separation not necessarily required, <span class="Italic">Matthews v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 4 MSPB 482 (1980). <span class="Italic">Also see Faulty v. United States,</span> 440 F.2d 426 (Ct. Cl. 1971) where separation was construed as involuntary with facts similar to those in the instant case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM's assertion that the resignation was in fact voluntary because it was not coerced is misplaced in this case, since we are not dealing with voluntariness as pertaining to a separation in lieu of an adverse action. Rather, we are dealing with the circumstances surrounding the separation itself and not the means of effecting it. It is therefore immaterial whether appellant desired to submit his resignation. What is relevant is the directed reassignment and the separation in lieu thereof.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, whether or not the agency "ratifies" the resignation is likewise irrelevant. An employee is free to resign at any time, to set the effective date, and to have the reasons for his resignation entered in the official records, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 715.202(a). Withdrawal is at the discretion of the agency before it becomes effective, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 715.202(b). Courts have held that resignation results in the employee's complete separation, which after it becomes effective, may not be revoked at the employee's option, <span class="Italic">Taylor v. United States,</span> 591 F.2d 688 (Ct. Cl. 1979); <span class="Italic">Rosenblatt v. United States,</span> 497 F.2d 928, <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 419 U.S. 1032 (1974); <span class="Italic">McGucken v. United States,</span> 407 F.2d 1349, <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 396 U.S. 894 (1969). A resignation is an employee initiated action. There is nothing in law or regulation that permits an agency to revoke resignations at will subsequent to their effective date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, with respect to the allegedly <span class="Italic">ultra vires</span> nature of the directed reassignment, again we note that this concern does not go to the root of the matter at issue here: namely, whether the separation was involuntary under the circumstances provided for in law and guidance. An after the fact determination by the agency that the directed reassignment would have been void would have served to nullify the action had appellant been removed for failure to accept reassignment to Baltimore. It has no real bearing upon the circumstances at the time appellant's resignation was effected, September 17, 1979.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts show appellant's situation meets the criteria for discontinued service annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A resignation for intolerable working conditions was not an involuntary separation qualifying for discontinued service annuity, <span class="Italic">Nebblett v. OPM</span>, 83 MSPR 524, 527 &#x00B6; 8 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), which was in effect when the appellant resigned in 1983, defined "involuntary separation" to include a separation effected pursuant to various reasons including a reduction in force, the expiration of the incumbent's term of office, a directed reassignment requiring relocation, disability when the separation is initiated by the agency, separation during probation because of failure to qualify, or separation of an indefinite or temporary employee under OPM's instructions for displacement. FPM Supp. 831-1, subch. S11-2(a); s<span class="Italic">ee Allen v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 212, 216 (1998); <span class="Italic">Sanderson v.

Ct. 1051 (1998). The appellant argues that she retired involuntarily in 1983 because of intolerable working conditions. However, such allegations, even if true, do not support a right to an annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(1) because they do not fall within the definition of "involuntary separation," as it is meant in this statutory provision. <span class="Italic">See Allen</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 216.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's decision was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Nebblett v. OPM</span>, 237 F.3d 1353, 1354-55, 1357-59 (Fed. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Entitlement of federal employees to immediate retirement annuities is governed by the terms of 5 U.S.C. 8336 (1994). As of December 31, 1983, Ms. Nebblett did not qualify for an immediate retirement annuity under subsection (a) of section 8336. That subsection has an age requirement of 55 years, coupled with a requirement of 30 years of service. Nor could Ms. Nebblett qualify for an immediate retirement annuity under subsection (b), which requires 60 years of age and 20 years of service. At the time of her resignation, subsection (c) pertained to law enforcement officers and firefighters, positions not occupied by Ms. Nebblett. Other subsections of section 8336 also deal with job definitions and other requirements that Ms. Nebblett unquestionably does not meet.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsection (d) of section 8336, however, is a source of authority pursuant to which Ms. Nebblett arguably has a claim to an immediate retirement annuity. That provision reads, in relevant part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003;An employee who--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;is separated from the service involuntarily, except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency;...after completing 25 years of service or after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service is entitled to an annuity....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By its plain terms, this subsection would not appear to be of any comfort to Ms. Nebblett, because her resignation seemed on its face to be voluntary. This facial disparity between the law and the facts is dissipated, according to Ms. Nebblett, because, according to her allegations, her resignation was not voluntary at all. Instead, Ms. Nebblett asserts that her separation was coerced, that she was separated from her job against her will as a result of wrongful and intolerable working conditions. As a coerced retiree, Ms. Nebblett contends that she meets the definition of a "an employee who...is separated from the service involuntarily." If this contention, which raises an issue of statutory interpretation, is correct, Ms. Nebblett would fulfill the qualifications for an immediate retirement annuity as of December 31, 1983.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin with the words in the statute that are in issue: "an employee who...is separated from the service involuntarily." 5 U.S.C. 8336(d)(1). We also note that both parties agree with the correct assertion that the statute itself does not define the term "separated...involuntarily." In Ms. Nebblett's instance, she was separated from the service as a result of her voluntary filing of her Request for Personnel Action in 1983. Although she may have felt compelled to file the request because of intolerable working conditions, she in fact took the voluntary act of resignation. From the agency's perspective, in 1983, without notice of an alleged constructive removal, Ms. Nebblett's separation could only be viewed as voluntary. Nonetheless, Ms. Nebblett's view of the matter is that her Request for Personnel Action was not voluntary, indeed it was forced upon her as her only choice to avoid continued exposure to a work situation wrongly made intolerable. The difference of opinion between the agency and Ms. Nebblett as to whether her resignation is voluntary or involuntary is a matter that cannot be decided as of the date of the specific personnel action of resignation. The truth of the matter could only be decided after a legal proceeding in which it would be determined whether coercion caused the resignation. The statute, however, does not speak of a determination that is to be made after a legal proceeding. The statute asks simply whether a separation is involuntary; if it is, then an immediate annuity is forthcoming, assuming the other requirements of section 8336(d)(1) are met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties have not pointed us to any legislative history of the key statute that would indicate whether coerced separations underlying facially voluntary resignations should be deemed to be involuntary separations under section 8336(d)(1). Nor have we found any such history ourselves. Under these circumstances, we find that it is fair to conclude that Congress did not focus, in enacting section 8336(d)(1), on whether a coerced resignation should be treated as an involuntary separation under the statute. Thus, we must consider the interpretation advanced by the agency, and test that interpretation, in the light of Ms. Nebblett's response, for its reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the agency, the rights of an employee seeking an immediate retirement annuity under section 8336(d)(1) are entirely different from the rights of an employee who asserts that a facially voluntary resignation is actually a constructive removal, for which benefits must be awarded. Section 8336 resides in Chapter 83 of Title 5 of the United States Code, entitled "Retirement," and the section does not concern itself with the motives of an agency that may or may not have prompted an employee to retire. Constructive removals, on the other hand, are treated under Chapter 75 of Title 5, entitled "Adverse Actions," with the remedy for a constructive removal being found in subchapter IX of Chapter 55 of Title 5, entitled "Severance Pay and Back Pay." The remedy typically employed to correct a constructive removal is reinstatement of the employee to the position vacated, with back pay and benefits for the period from the constructive removal to the return to work. Under that remedy, the employee is treated as a matter of law as never having resigned. To emphasize this point, the agency notes that if Ms. Nebblett were to succeed with her allegation of a coerced resignation, then she would be reinstated with back pay and benefits and her personnel record would reflect that she had been consistently employed since the date of her resignation in 1983. She would be deemed never to have resigned, and thus would not have been separated in any fashion, for purposes of qualification under section 8336(d)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both Ms. Nebblett and the agency point us to the Federal Personnel Manual, Supp. 831-1, subch. S11-2(a) (Sept. 21, 1981), which was in effect at the time of Ms. Nebblett's departure from federal service in 1983. Examples cited therein of involuntary separation that qualify for recognition under section 8336(d) are: reduction in force, abolishment of position, lack of funds, expiration of incumbent's term of office, <span id="Page_4280"></span>liquidation of an office or of an entire agency, and separation during probation for failure to qualify. Each of these examples has in common the fact that the agency action producing the separation is entirely legal. Nothing is wrong with those actions, and an employee has no rights to complain about the effects of those actions. We note that although the FPM is now abolished, the handbooks for the Payroll and Personnel Office under the Civil Service Retirement System ("CSRS") and the Federal Employees Retirement System ("FERS") contain a similar list of agency actions, all lawful in nature that constitute involuntary separations. The former Federal Personnel Manual was superseded by the <span class="Italic">CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices. See</span> FPM Sunset Document, OPM Document No. 157-53-8 at 103 (Dec. 31, 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an otherwise voluntary resignation is proven to be the result of coercion by the employing agency, the agency's conduct necessarily is determined to have been wrongful. This is so whether the action that prompted the otherwise voluntary resignation is misinformation or deception caused by the agency and upon which the employee relied, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984), a threat of disciplinary action that the agency knows is not sustainable, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Schultz v. United States Navy,</span> 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987), or any other improper act by the agency, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 1136. When an employee proves that intolerable working conditions have forced the employee to resign, it necessarily follows that those working conditions are unlawful, and in need of correction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency further argues that it has consistently viewed involuntary separations under section 8336(d)(1) to require the common element of a lawful undertaking, a point that is firmly established in long-standing precedent of the Board. In this regard, the agency is correct: <span class="Italic">Allen</span> and <span class="Italic">Sanderson, supra,</span> are but examples of the Board's interpretation of "involuntary separation," for purposes of section 8336(d), to require lawful agency action that provoked a separation. The agency also reminds us that this court has previously looked to the examples in the FPM as guides to determine whether a separation is involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Yarbrough v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 770 F.2d 1056, 1058-59 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the argument that the remedies for coerced resignations and for retirement annuities when an employee is involuntarily removed are entirely different, the agency posits that OPM is not equipped to resolve the question of whether Ms. Nebblett's resignation was coerced by unlawful agency action. The agency points out that in order for Ms. Nebblett's view to prevail, OPM would be forced to conduct a hearing to determine if her resignation was indeed coerced. The defendant in those circumstances would be the agency that allegedly committed the wrongful coercion. As an adverse action under Chapter 75 before the Board, the agency would be defending itself in a typical fashion, with each side familiar with the discovery and litigating rules. But with the adverse action hearing being conducted in the first instance by OPM, to determine entitlement to the retirement annuity, OPM asserts that it has no authority and no regulations by which it could hale the agency into court to test the employee's assertions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the agency asserts that the interpretation it gives to "involuntary separation" in the key statute--that such a separation must stem from a lawful agency act--is a reasonable one that commands our adoption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Ms. Nebblett recognizes that the key statute does not itself provide a definition of an "involuntary separation," she argues that her separation, if she were to prevail on her allegation of coercion, would constitute a resignation caused by the agency, against her will. Ms. Nebblett does not deny that she could have availed herself of the remedy afforded by Chapter 75, namely a challenge to her unlawful removal, which if successful would have entitled her to reinstatement with back pay. She also does not respond to the agency's argument that were she to succeed in proving that her resignation was unlawfully coerced, she would thereby prove that she had never been separated, and thus disqualify herself under section 8336(d)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Nebblett rejects the agency's argument that OPM lacks the tools to decide whether her resignation was coerced, pointing to an express provision in Chapter 83 that empowers OPM to "perform...such acts...as are necessary and proper to carry out this subchapter."<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 8347(a) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Ms. Nebblett that the agency cannot prevail solely on the ground that OPM may not have procedures in place that would permit it to efficiently resolve the factual question of whether Ms. Nebblett's resignation was coerced by working conditions so intolerable that no reasonable employee could be expected to endure those conditions. The agency has the power and means to provide an answer to that factual question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A person in Ms. Nebblett's situation might argue that it is inhumane to force an employee who has been coerced into resignation by intolerable working conditions to vindicate her wrong by seeking reinstatement to the very agency that had wrongly pushed her out its door. While such an argument has a measure of appeal, it discounts the importance of proving, in a Chapter 75 proceeding, that the wrongful circumstances existed at the agency, the circumstances that caused the constructive removal. In order for the wrongful working condition to be corrected, it must first have been proven wrongful. A person who succeeds in proving a constructive removal because of intolerable working circumstances provides the necessity for the agency to correct its wrong. A work environment so intolerable that no reasonable person can remain in it is an environment that must be changed, for the better. It is to the improved environment that the successful Chapter 75 litigant should be reinstated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by Ms. Nebblett's arguments that the agency's interpretation of the key statute is unreasonable. To the contrary, we find that the agency's interpretation is correct. The type of involuntary separation to which section 8336(d)(1) speaks is one that results from lawful agency action. Since the agency action that allegedly caused Ms. Nebblett's resignation in 1983 necessarily must be deemed to be unlawful, she cannot meet the requirements for an immediate retirement annuity under section 8336(d)(1). We therefore affirm the final decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A separation by disability retirement did not become involuntary for purposes of a discontinued service annuity when the disability retirement was rescinded by OPM, <span class="Italic">Gaghan v. OPM</span>, 111 MSPR 397, 398-402 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 5-14, 2009 MSPB 100 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 1, 2001, the appellant filed an application for disability retirement. On February 13, 2002, OPM approved the application, and 1 week later the appellant's employing agency, the U.S. Postal Service, processed the appellant's separation for disability retirement. After receiving correspondence in which the Postal Service questioned the appellant's entitlement to a disability retirement annuity, however, OPM reevaluated the case, and on January 18, 2005, it rescinded its approval, finding that the appellant did not meet the criteria for disability retirement. Although the appellant challenged the rescission of his annuity, the action was upheld by the Board and by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the Federal Circuit had issued its decision on the appellant's disability retirement appeal, the appellant submitted an application for a discontinued service retirement annuity. OPM denied that application; it sustained its denial in a reconsideration decision; and the appellant appealed the reconsideration decision to the Board's Northeastern Regional Office. The administrative judge to whom the appeal was assigned issued an initial decision reversing OPM's reconsideration decision and finding the appellant entitled to a discontinued service annuity. In that decision, she found that OPM had misled the appellant by approving his disability retirement application, that the appellant had relied on this misinformation to his detriment in retiring, and that the appellant's disability retirement therefore was involuntary.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">A CSRS employee who has completed at least 25 years of service, and who "is separated from the service involuntarily, except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency," is entitled to a discontinued service annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(1). The appellant had over 30 years of service on the effective date of his disability retirement. He therefore would be entitled to a discontinued service retirement annuity if he was "separated...involuntarily," as that phrase is used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have indicated above, the administrative judge found that the appellant had met this criterion. In doing so, she relied on holdings, by the Board and by our reviewing court, that a resignation or retirement that was based on incorrect or misleading information was involuntary, i.e., that it was tantamount to a removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> Initial Decision at 3-4<span class="Italic"> (</span>citing <span class="Italic">Covington v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues on petition for review that the administrative judge applied an incorrect standard in finding that the appellant's separation was involuntary. We agree with OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note first, in this regard, that the cases on which the administrative judge relied in referring to the rule that a resignation or retirement based on misinformation is involuntary generally deal with actions allegedly effected under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. That is, they generally deal with alleged <span class="Italic">de facto</span> removals under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(1), in which the individual seeks restoration as an employee. <span class="Italic">See Covington,</span> 750 F.2d at 941, 944 (an employee who retired after receiving a reduction-in-force (RIF) notice informing him that he had no right of assignment or retention was to be given, on remand, an opportunity to present evidence that he was misinformed, and that he would, in the absence of his retirement, have been entitled to be retained as an employee); <span class="Italic">Scharf,</span> 710 F.2d at 1575 (because the petitioner's decision to retire was based on misleading <span id="Page_4281"></span>advice, it was involuntary and therefore an adverse action; and because it was effected without benefit of the procedures agencies are required to follow in effecting adverse actions, the individual's employing agency was ordered to cancel the retirement and reinstate him retroactively in his former position); <span class="Italic">Aldridge,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 13 (the Board remanded the appeal for a hearing on the issue of whether the appellant's retirement was the result of agency misinformation and therefore an involuntary act within the Board's jurisdiction as a constructive discharge); <span class="Italic">Rysavy,</span> 28 M.S.P.R. at 265 (the Board remanded the appeal for a hearing on whether the appellant's retirement prior to the effective date of his scheduled RIF action was involuntary, and therefore tantamount to a removal, because it was based on misinformation regarding the effect of the retirement on his right to appeal the RIF action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[T]he Board has long held that the determination of an involuntary separation for retirement purposes under 5 U.S.C. [chapter] 83 is totally separate and distinct from a determination of involuntary retirement or resignation for Board jurisdictional purposes under 5 U.S.C. [chapter] 75." <span class="Italic">Allen v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 212, 216 (1998). In the present case, the appellant does not allege that his former employer obtained his resignation in violation of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 by providing him, either intentionally or negligently, with misinformation, and he does not seek to have his separation from the Postal Service canceled. Instead, as we have indicated above, he seeks to have his disability retirement annuity replaced with a discontinued service annuity. The cases on which the administrative judge relied therefore are inapplicable here. <span class="Italic">See Sanderson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 311, 316 (1996) (even if the appellant's former employing agency had obtained his resignation by providing him with misinformation regarding his entitlement to an annuity, a finding of involuntariness based on such misinformation would be insufficient to establish entitlement to a discontinued service retirement annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 129 F.3d 134 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 522 U.S. 1115 (1998); <span class="Italic">Gammill v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 484, 488-89 (1985) (the employing agency's incorrect statement that the appellant would be eligible for a discontinued service annuity if he retired, although providing a basis for voiding the resignation and restoring the appellant to the employment rolls, did not make the appellant eligible for an annuity).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that our reviewing court has considered a case similar to the one now before us. In <span class="Italic">Nebblett v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 237 F.3d 1353, 1354-55 (Fed. Cir. 2001), it addressed a claim that the petitioner's employing agency had coerced the petitioner's resignation through improper actions (in that case, intolerable working conditions), that the petitioner accordingly was involuntarily separated, and that she therefore was entitled to a discontinued service retirement annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(1). The court noted that a separation obtained through intolerable working conditions or through misinformation was unlawful, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1358, and it held that the "type of involuntary separation to which section 8336(d)(1) speaks is one that results from lawful agency action," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1359. It concluded, therefore, that, even if the petitioner could prove that her resignation was involuntary as alleged, she would not be eligible to receive a discontinued service annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court's decision in the case described above, as well as the underlying Board decision in the same case, was based in part on a provision of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) defining the term "involuntary," as that term was used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(1). The court noted that the FPM defined that term as applying to separations under conditions such as "reductions in force, expiration of an incumbent's term of office, and other actions, all of which are proper and legal acts taken by an agency that result in an employee's involuntary separation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1356; <span class="Italic">see Nebblett v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 524, &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (referring to same definition). Although the FPM has been abolished, OPM has continued to define the term in a similar manner in its CSRS and FERS Handbook (Handbook), whose provisions have superseded the relevant part of the FPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Handbook</span>, &#x00A7; 44A1.1-2A; <span class="Italic">Nebblett,</span> 237 F.3d at 1358. According to the Handbook, "involuntary separation that may qualify an employee for a discontinued service retirement is any separation against the will and without the consent of the employee other than a separation for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency." <span class="Italic">Handbook</span>, &#x00A7; 44A1.1-2A.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in the Handbook definition quoted above suggests that the separation of the appellant in this case for disability retirement qualifies as an "involuntary separation" for purposes of discontinued service retirement. The appellant does not argue that his separation was against his will or without his consent, and he does not deny that he voluntarily applied for retirement. Moreover, none of the examples the Handbook includes with its definition describe circumstances that could be said to be present here.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Examples of "involuntary separations" listed in the Handbook include, in addition to the ones mentioned by the court in <span class="Italic">Nebblett,</span> "[u]nacceptable performance (unless due to employee's misconduct)," "[r]eassignment outside commuting area when no mobility agreement exists," and "[f]ailure to continue to meet qualification requirements of the position...." <span class="Italic">Handbook</span>, &#x00A7; 44A1-1-2A.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The case now before us differs somewhat from <span class="Italic">Nebblett</span> in that the appellant in this case allegedly relied on misinformation that was provided by OPM, rather than by his employing agency. The decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414 (1990), however, indicates that these differences are immaterial to the outcome of this case. In<span class="Italic"> Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. at 416, 434, the Court held that an individual's reliance on misinformation provided by a government official could not serve as a basis for the individual's entitlement to annuity benefits not otherwise permitted by law. Moreover, while the misinformation at issue in that case was provided by an official of the individual's employing agency,<span class="Italic"> see id.</span> at 416-17, nothing in <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> suggests that the result in the case would have been different if the misinformation had been provided by OPM. Instead, the reasoning on which the decision is based indicates that misinformation provided by any Executive Branch official would provide an insufficient basis for awarding benefits because that branch is not empowered by the Constitution to overrule "the difficult judgments reached by Congress as to the common good...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 427-28; <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 428 ("If agents of the Executive were able, by their unauthorized oral or written statements to citizens, to obligate the Treasury for the payment of funds, the control over public funds that the [Appropriations] Clause reposes in Congress in effect could be transferred to the Executive.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we need not determine whether OPM's 2002 approval of the appellant's disability retirement application can properly be regarded as the providing of misinformation or misleading information on which the appellant relied to his detriment. Even if it can properly be regarded in this manner, it does not provide a proper basis on which to find that the appellant is entitled to a discontinued service retirement annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(1).</p>
