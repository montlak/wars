<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-148"><span class="space">5.</span> Voluntary Early Retirement Authority</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency denies a VERA retirement to an otherwise eligible employee in an agency deemed by OPM to be eligible for VERA, the employee may appeal the employing agency's refusal to extend a VERA retirement to him. <span class="Italic">Adams v. DOD</span>, 688 F.3d 1330, 1334-36 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (Board remand order at <span class="Italic">Adams v. DOD</span>, DC-3443-10-0711-M-1 (NP 8/27/2013)), involving a termination for loss of a security clearance, determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB held that, because it did not have authority to review the merits of the agency's revocation of Mr. Adams' security clearance, it did not have jurisdiction to review the agency's denial of his request for early retirement under the VERA. The Board stated that "a prohibited personnel practice claim may be considered by the Board only if it is raised in connection with an otherwise appealable action," and that since the agency's security clearance-based actions cannot be appealed, neither can the agency's denial of the request for early retirement. However, the Board misstates the premises, for security clearance-based actions can indeed be appealed, albeit on the limited basis of whether the minimal due process requirements of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> were met; the merits of the security clearance-based action are not reviewable because of the uniquely personal and subjective components of security evaluations. The limited appeal of agency security clearance-based actions does not remove federal employees from all other employment rights and benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No statute or policy suggests that retirement issues are removed from appellate review when the retirement relates to revocation of a security clearance. We discern no basis for removing actions related to retirement from sensitive positions from the general system of MSPB review of adverse employment actions, without specific legislative instruction. <span class="Italic">Cf. Webster v. Doe,</span> 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988) ("[w]here Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so must be clear.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial briefing of this case, the government argued that the Board acted correctly in denying its own jurisdiction, government counsel stating that the government is "unaware" of "any law, rule or regulation that provides the Board with jurisdiction over an agency's decision not to grant an employee's request for retirement incentives such as early retirement under VERA." On supplemental briefing at the court's request, the government discarded this position and now states that "the MSPB conceivably could have jurisdiction to entertain Mr. Adam's VERA claim...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that the federal employment statutes require this conclusion. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) provides for appeal to the MSPB "from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation." MSPB jurisdiction is summarized at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3, where subsection (a)(6) authorizes the MSPB to review adverse retirement decisions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461, the Federal Employees Retirement System by which Mr. Adams is covered. The voluntary early retirement benefit is part of the Federal Employees Retirement System pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414. Pursuant to &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1), "an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States under the provisions of this chapter [chapter 84] administered by the Office [of Personnel Management] may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board." Congress authorized the Department of Defense to decide VERA benefits, and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(0(4) states that "[a]n employee who is at least 50 years of age and has completed 20 year of service, or has at least 25 years of service, may, pursuant to regulations promulgated under this section, apply and be retired from the Department of Defense and receive benefits in accordance with chapter 83 and 84...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Adams states, and the government does not dispute, that he is within the scope of possible voluntary early retirement, that he properly filed a claim for early retirement, that he meets the statutory requirements based on his age and employment term, and that his claim was denied by the DoD. The denial significantly affects Mr. Adams' "rights or interests" under &#x00A7; 8461 of the Federal Employees' Retirement System, and thus may be an appealable "administrative action" within the Board's jurisdiction. Since the MSPB incorrectly determined that no statutory provision provided an appeal to the MSPB with respect to the denial of early retirement benefits, we remand to the Board for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government now states that Mr. Adams is barred from appealing to the MSPB because he failed to appeal the DoD denial to OPM. We take note that OPM is charged with administering claims under chapter 83, and chapter 84 relating to the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414(b)(1)(B)(iv) and (v). We do not decide, however, whether Mr. Adams was required first to appeal to OPM, an issue to be addressed on remand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dawson v. USDA</span>, 121 MSPR 495, 504-05 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17, 2014 MSPB 67 (2014) (Member Robbins concurring), concluded that jurisdiction existed to entertain an appeal from an agency denial of a belated voluntary early retirement application:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, we note that the administrative judge correctly determined that the Board has jurisdiction over this matter. According to the Standard Form 50 effectuating the appellant's removal, he was covered under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). The Board has jurisdiction over an appeal from "an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual" under the CSRS. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d). Ordinarily, such an appeal is from an OPM decision. <span class="Italic">Mandarino v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6; 7 (2012). Here, however, the agency approved or denied early retirement applications from Rural Development employees pursuant to an express delegation of authority from OPM, and the appellant challenges the agency's failure to grant his application pursuant to that authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.114. Our reviewing court has held that an appeal from an adverse VERA determination under such circumstances falls within the Board's jurisdiction as "an administrative action or order" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d). <span class="Italic">Adams v. Department of Defense</span>, 688 F.3d 1330, 1335-36 (Fed. Cir. 2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency confirmed below that it did not issue a written response to the appellant's application. We conclude that the appellant was not required to wait for the agency's written decision before filing his appeal. The Board has held under analogous circumstances that, where OPM has delegated to an agency the authority to make an enhanced retirement coverage determination, and the agency has not issued a final decision on a claim for retirement benefits and does not intend to do so, the Board will deem the agency to have denied the appellant's request and take jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1). <span class="Italic">Mandarino</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (concerning an appellant's request for enhanced retirement benefits available to law enforcement officers). Similarly here, OPM has delegated to the agency the authority to make an enhanced retirement coverage determination and the agency has not issued a final decision on the appellant's claim for benefits. Further, there is no indication that the agency intends to do so. We are not persuaded by the agency's attempt to distinguish <span class="Italic">Mandarino</span> on the ground that the appellant in that case requested reconsideration from the agency, whereas the appellant in this case has not. First, as stated above, the agency has not issued any determination concerning the appellant's request from which he could seek reconsideration. Second, because the agency has made no determination, it has not advised the appellant of any right or obligation on his part to seek reconsideration.[2] Under the circumstances of this case, we deem the agency to have denied the appellant's request for application to retire with a VERA benefit and take jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d). <span class="Italic">See Adams</span>, 688 F.3d at 1335-36.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Although the court in <span class="Italic">Adams</span> did not decide whether an appellant is first required to seek reconsideration of an adverse VERA determination from OPM prior to filing a Board appeal, <span class="Italic">see</span> 688 F.3d at 1335-36, we agree with the administrative judge that <span id="Page_4337"></span>the appellant was not required to do so. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Melvin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, MSPB Docket No. SF-0831-98-0378-I-1, 1998 WL 1981575 (Initial Decision, July 10, 1998) (stating that OPM had refused to issue a reconsideration decision concerning the determination of the appellant's employing agency that he was not entitled to a VSIP, on the ground that it lacked the authority to issue such a decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baracker v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DE-0752-21-0158-I-1 (2/2/2023) (summarizing <span class="Italic">Adams</span> [FERS] and <span class="Italic">Dawson</span> [CSRS], <span class="Italic">supra</span>: "If the administrative judge determines that the appellant did not submit an application for the agency's VERA program, he should examine whether the agency's conduct in determining that the appellant was not eligible for VERA program justifies the waiver of any pertinent filing deadline for such benefits.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For there to be Board jurisdiction over an OPM decision concerning a claim that VERA should have been offered by an agency to the appellant, it appears that there must be an application for retirement that is denied by OPM. Jurisdiction was lacking over the appellant's argument in an appeal involving OPM as respondent that OPM's regulations concerning VERA were invalid, <span class="Italic">Manning v. OPM</span>, PH-0831-17-0200-I-1 (NP 3/22/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that OPM exceeded its authority by limiting VERA eligibility based on employee grade level. PFR File, Tab 3 at 3-4 (citing An Act to Permit Immediate Retirement of Certain Federal Employees, Pub. L. No. 93-39, 87 Stat. 73 (1973) (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(2)(E)). She asserts that the only criteria permitted for a VERA in 1979 were age and years of Federal service. She further argues that her entitlement to the VERA is a right or interest under the CSRS regardless of whether she applied for the VERA. She reasons that if she was eligible for the 1979 VERA, she would be exempt from the Government pension offset (GPO), pursuant to which SSA reduced her spousal Social Security benefit to zero. Under the GPO, the amount of an individual's Social Security age-old benefit is reduced based on her receipt, as applicable here, of a CSRS annuity. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 402(k)(5)(A); <span class="Italic">Moriarty v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 280, 282 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd per curiam</span>, 989 F.2d 1202 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant apparently is not seeking an annuity based on her eligibility for voluntary early optional retirement. While she applied and was found eligible for an optional (other than early optional) retirement annuity, she has not alleged, and nothing in the record indicates, that she applied for an annuity under the 1979 VERA. Instead, the appellant seeks to have OPM issue an opinion as to her VERA eligibility to influence SSA's determination regarding her Social Security benefits. Thus, under these circumstances, the appellant has not met her burden to prove that OPM's February 9, 2017 decision implicates her rights or interests under CSRS. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6; 9 (2015) (determining that the Board lacks jurisdiction over OPM's decision not to waive collection of an annuity overpayment indirectly received by an individual who was without rights to the funds under CSRS); <span class="Italic">Moriarty</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 287-88 (adjudicating an employee's claim that his election to change retirement systems was involuntary as a result of OPM's misleading statements concerning the GPO); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A) (explaining that an appellant must prove jurisdiction over her appeal by preponderant evidence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a result, OPM's February 9, 2017 letter does not qualify as an appealable reconsideration decision, even though OPM characterized it as such. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(a) (granting "any individual or agency <span class="Italic">whose rights or interests under [CSRS] are affected</span> by an initial decision of [OPM]...[the right to] request OPM to review its initial decision" (emphasis added)). Further, without an actual claim for retirement benefits by the appellant, and an actual decision on that claim by OPM, any decision by the Board about what the appellant may or may not be entitled to would be an advisory opinion, which the Board is expressly prohibited from issuing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h); <span class="Italic">Blaha v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6; 11 (2007). The erroneous notification of appeal rights included in the February 9, 2017 letter does not confer Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Poole v. Department of the Army</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6; 20 (2012) (explaining that the mere fact that an agency informs an appellant of a right to appeal to the Board does not confer jurisdiction on the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, unless and until the appellant applies for voluntary early optional retirement and receives a decision from OPM on her application, we have no basis to find Board jurisdiction over this retirement matter. We therefore vacate the initial decision and dismiss the appellant's retirement appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Adams</span> and <span class="Italic">Dawson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, were the subject of further jurisdictional commentary concerning voluntary separation incentive payment (VSIP) claims, <span class="Italic">Cohn v. DOD,</span> DC-0752-14-0966-I-1 (NP 6/25/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant is challenging a VSIP denial, we find that this is not appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (the Board's jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation). In particular, we find that the denial of a VSIP is not an appealable agency action or order affecting an individual's rights under FERS. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1) (an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States under FERS administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may be appealed to the Board). As applicable here, VSIPs are governed by 5 U.S.C. chapter 35, subchapter II and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(f), not 5 U.S.C. chapter 84. Furthermore, if VSIPs were retirement benefits under 5 U.S.C. chapters 83 or 84, they would be paid from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, which they are not. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3523(b)(7) (reflecting that VSIPs are paid from "appropriations or funds available for...basic pay"), 8348(a)(1)(A) (reflecting that FERS benefits come from the Fund); Department of Defense (DOD) Instruction No. 1400.25, Vol. 1702, Enclosure (Encl.) 3, &#x00A7; 2.g. (June 13, 2008) (discussing possible funding sources for a DOD VSIP), <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/CPM_table2.html">http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/CPM_table2.html</a>. Nor are VSIPs to be a basis for payment or included in the calculation of any other type of benefit. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3523(b)(5), 9902(f)(5)(B). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction over the appellant's claim that the agency improperly denied him a VSIP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we agree with the appellant that, to the extent that his appeal concerns a voluntary early retirement denial, it may be appealable to the Board as a retirement claim, i.e., an administrative action or order affecting his rights or interests under FERS. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Adams v. Department of Defense</span>, 688 F.3d 1330, 1335-36 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">see also Dawson v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 495, &#x00B6; 16 (2014) (the appellant's voluntary early retirement claim was appealable as an administrative action or order affecting his rights under the Civil Service Retirement System).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">VERAs under FERS are generally governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.213. Under those provisions, an agency must request a VERA from OPM and provide specific information in support of its request. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.213(a)-(g). Once OPM approves the VERA, those employees who fall within the scope of the VERA's coverage and who meet the age, service, and other requirements prescribed by statute and OPM regulation are entitled to an immediate annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.213(k).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the ability to seek VERAs from OPM, the Secretary of Defense has separate statutory authority to establish a voluntary early retirement program to be administered according to regulations established by the Secretary. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(f)(1), (7); DOD Instruction No. 1400.25-Vol. 1702, Encl. 3, &#x00A7; 4. The age and service requirements for early retirement under &#x00A7; 9902(f) as implemented by the Secretary are the same as those for early retirement under &#x00A7; 8414(b) as implemented by OPM. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414(b), <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(f)(4), <span class="Italic">and</span> DOD Instruction No. 1400.25-V1702, Encl. 3, &#x00A7; 4.b. The main difference between VERAs under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414(b) and VERAs under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(f) is that, under the former, the agency must obtain authority from OPM, whereas under the latter, the agency itself has the power to grant the VERA to any number of its components.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VERA at issue in this appeal was established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(f). However, the record is not sufficiently developed for us to determine whether the appellant was entitled to early retirement under that section. Specifically, the record does not reflect the scope of the VERA, DOD Instruction No. 1400.25-V1702, Encl. 3, &#x00A7; 4.a.(3), or whether the appellant met the eligibility requirements, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 4.b. The burden of proving entitlement to retirement benefits is on the applicant for benefits. <span class="Italic">Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 791 F.2d 138, 140-41 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 70, &#x00B6; 7 (2006). On remand, the appellant will bear the burden of proving his entitlement to retirement benefits under the VERA, i.e., that he was within the scope of the VERA's coverage and met the age, service, and other requirements prescribed by statute and agency regulation.</p>
