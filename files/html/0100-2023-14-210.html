<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-211"><span class="space">2.</span> Definitions, Limitations of Offenses; Unlawful or Unsafe Work Orders</h4>
<p class="noindent">Proposals are negotiable that do no more than generally describe the conduct that is required of employees and state that management may take corrective action if an employee fails to follow applicable rules, policies, and procedures, or engages in professional misconduct or acts of professional ineptitude or inefficiency. The language parallels the bases for agency discipline established by law and agency regulation. The agency is not restricted in its right to impose discipline. <span class="Italic">New York State Nurses Ass'n and VA Bronx Med. Ctr.</span>, 30 FLRA 706, 764 (1987). <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses Ass'n and VAMC, N. Chicago</span>, 27 FLRA 714, 741-42 (1987), accepted as negotiable, noting particularly the absence of agency objection, a proposal that broadly defined discipline in a manner that did not restrict managerial authority. The proposed language was that "no nurse will be disciplined...except whenever an employee's performance of duty or personal conduct is unsatisfactory because of inaptitude, [sic] inefficiency, neglect, or unwillingness to comply with commonly accepted standards of personal conduct." FLRA went one better in <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses' Ass'n and VAMC, Hines</span>, 28 FLRA 212, 241-43 (1987), determining negotiable a proposal that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">No registered nurse covered by this Agreement will be disciplined by admonishment, reprimand, suspension, demotion or discharge except for reasons of professional misconduct, inaptitude or inefficiency, personal misconduct, or unwillingness to comply with instructions, policies, rules, or regulation.... Errors of professional nursing judgement [sic] when negligence is not involved, or cases of difference of professional nursing opinion, will not be the basis of any form of discipline....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 56 FLRA 69, 96 (2000), determined negotiable Proposal 20, precluding discipline (or performance-based action) if an employee did not report a computer system problem that the agency failed to define through a set of standards defined by the employer:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that the proposal would afford unit employees significant benefits in that it would bar discipline or consideration in a performance appraisal of a failure to report any problem that the Agency had not defined through a set of standards.&#x2003;This would reduce the number of such failures for which employees could be held accountable through a disciplinary action or in a performance appraisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, we conclude that the burdens that would be imposed on the exercise of management's rights to discipline, direct employees, and assign work by Proposal 20 are not significant. In order to hold employees accountable for reporting problems, the Agency would be required only to define the problems to be reported through a set of standards. While the Union intends the proposal to preclude the use of the generic "other" category in the existing Bug Report, there is no dispute that the Agency never set a standard for determining what problems would be encompassed by this wide-open term. There are no limitations in the proposal on the standards the Agency could promulgate to satisfy the requirements of Proposal 20.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we conclude that, on balance, the proposal does <span id="page_772"></span>not excessively interfere with the Agency's rights to discipline, direct employees, and assign work<span class="Italic">. See National Federation of Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 1214 and U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army, Headquarters, U.S. Army Training Center and Fort Jackson, Fort Jackson, South Carolina</span>, 51 FLRA 1362, 1367 (1996) <span class="Italic">(Fort Jackson). </span>Accordingly, Proposal 20 is within the Agency's duty to bargain as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 56 FLRA 69, 98-99 (2000) (approving as negotiable Proposal 30, essentially requiring agency to set standards defining abuse of automated system). A proposal was negotiable that did no more than repeat definitions of disciplinary actions in 5 USC 7512. <span class="Italic">SEIU Local 150 and VAMC, Milwaukee</span>, 35 FLRA 521, 536 (1990) (Provision 7).</p>
<p class="noindent">Specific definitions of discipline may be nonnegotiable if they preclude discipline for actions falling outside the defined circumstances. A proposal was nonnegotiable that defined absence without leave to exclude charging employees with a legitimate reason for being absent due to events no fault of their own. The proposal interfered with the right of management to discipline employees by restricting the substantive criteria for taking disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 15 and Army Armament Munitions and Chem.

But a broader definition of unexcused absence was negotiable in <span class="Italic">NFFE, Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 31 FLRA 360, 387 (1988). Proposal 2, that "courtesy" be defined in terms of a "universally accepted meaning," and applied consistently through the unit, was nonnegotiable. By negotiating on the meaning of that word, the union would be involved in negotiating a qualitative and quantitative standard determinative of acceptable performance. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Gen.

Carson</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 199 (1993), was Proposal 14, seeking agreement that action not be taken against employees on the basis of rumors or gossip. The proposal interfered with the agency's right to discipline. Although it was not advanced as a negotiable arrangement, in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1931 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Weapons Station, Concord</span>, 32 FLRA 1023, 1047-48 (1988), Provisions 20 and 22 excessively interfered with management's right to discipline. Those proposals prevented management from using anonymous information, confidential statements, and similar information at any stage in the disciplinary process.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal interferes with management's rights, although those rights may be subject to arrangements bargaining tests, that impedes the imposition of discipline, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1998 and Dept. of State, Passport Serv.</span>, 69 FLRA 626, 631-33 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting) (Proposal 8):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VII.&#x2003;Proposal 8</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;Wording</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Passport Specialists will not be negatively impacted for passport frauds they have issued in error due in part to:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">&#x0387; Late-issued social security numbers issued prior to 1950</p>
<p class="noindent-3">&#x0387; False "Match" returns generated by the TDIS system</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B.&#x2023;Meaning</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree that Proposal 8 identifies two inquiries that specialists make that might uncover indicators of fraud, but that the results of these inquiries are not always reliable. The Union explained that "TDIS" refers to the "Travel Document Issuance System," an electronic system that provides information on each applicant. "TDIS" may fail to recognize one indicator of fraud: "[l]ate-issued [S]ocial [S]ecurity numbers"--referring to Social Security numbers issued after the applicant was no longer a minor--issued prior to 1950. TDIS may also fail to recognize another indicator of fraud: a Social Security number that is not a "match" to from the Social Security Administration. When that occurs, TDIS may instead generate a "False Match." The parties agree that Proposal 8 would prohibit the Agency from taking any disciplinary or performance-based actions against a specialist if either of the inquiries results in--or should have resulted, but did not result in--a fraud indicator, and a specialist issued a "passport fraud." The Union defines a "passport fraud[ ]" as a passport that is issued to an applicant because of fraudulent information provided by that applicant. The Union clarified that performance-based actions include increased audits, performance-improvement plans, demotions, or terminations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">C.&#x2023;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-3">1.&#x2023;Proposal 8 impermissibly affects the Agency's right to discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-4">a.&#x2023;Proposal 8 affects the Agency's right to discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that Proposal 8 affects management's right to discipline under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). According to the Agency, the proposal affects this management right because it restricts the Agency from considering information regarding certain passport issuances made in error when making disciplinary decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that proposals immunizing employees from discipline for specified conduct affect management's right to discipline.[93] In addition, the Authority has found that proposals that prevent management from taking action based on certain types of information affect management's right to discipline.[94]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[93] <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1164</span>, 67 FLRA 316, 318 (2014) (<span class="Italic">Local 1164</span>) (holding that proposal immunizing employees from discipline for specified conduct excessively interfered with management's right to direct, discipline, and assign work); <span class="Italic">see also NATCA, AFL-CIO</span>, 62 FLRA 174, 181 (2007) (<span class="Italic">NATCA</span>) (holding that proposal immunizing employees for specified conduct excessively interfered with management's right to discipline); <span class="Italic">POPA</span>, 48 FLRA 129, 147 (1993) (<span class="Italic">POPA</span>) (Member Armendariz dissenting) (holding that proposals immunizing employees from accountability for their work performance for specified conduct, regardless of circumstances of that conduct, excessively interfered with management's rights to direct employees and to assign work).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[94] <span class="Italic">NATCA</span>, 61 FLRA 341, 346 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is no dispute that Proposal 8 would immunize employees from discipline or performance-based action for issuing "passport frauds" when one of the inquiries identified in Proposal 8 either resulted in--or should have resulted, but did not result in--a fraud indicator. Therefore, Proposal 8 affects management's right to discipline employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A).[95]</p>

<p class="noindent-4">b.&#x2023;Proposal 8 is not an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standards for assessing whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement are set forth above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the proposal is an arrangement, we find that it is not appropriate because it excessively interferes with management's right to discipline employees.[96] Regarding the proposal's benefits to specialists, the proposal is intended to ensure that specialists will not be "negatively impacted" by "[TDIS] flaws beyond their control" that may lead to a specialist issuing a "passport fraud[ ]" in error. Specifically, the proposal would protect employees from adverse consequences relating to disciplinary or performance-based actions, such as "increased audits, performance[-]improvement plans, demotions, or terminations." With regard to the proposal's burdens on management's right, the proposal would completely preclude management from disciplining and holding employees accountable for their work performance[99] for issuing "passport frauds...in error due"--even "in part"--to faults with either of the two indicators of fraud identified in the proposal. The proposal contains no exception that takes into account the seriousness of the "passport frauds" issued in error or deficiencies not identified in the proposal contributing, in part, to the "passport frauds" issued in error.[101] Therefore, the burdens on management's exercise of its rights are significant.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[96] <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Council of Prison Locals 33, Local 506</span>, 66 FLRA 929, 932 (2012) (assuming that proposal was arrangement, but finding it excessively interfered with management's right to determine internal-security practices).</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[101]<span class="Italic">See Local 1164</span>, 67 FLRA at 318.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Weighing the burdens placed on the Agency against the benefits to specialists, we find that the proposal excessively interferes with management's right to discipline under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A).[102] Accordingly, we find that the proposal is not an appropriate arrangement and, therefore, is outside the duty to bargain.[103]</p>

<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was a proposal that precluded management from instituting disciplinary action against any employee for supplying information, giving testimony, or acting as a representative. The proposal insulated from discipline employees who, as representatives, went beyond protected "robust debate," and it also precluded discipline against individuals who furnished information gathered in violation of the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1458 and DOJ, U.S. Attorney, S. Dist. of Florida</span>, 29 FLRA 3, 20-21 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Carson</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 201 (1993) (Proposal 15: same result as <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs</span>); <span class="Italic">UPTO and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Walla Walla</span>, 44 FLRA 1145, 1172-73 (1992) (nonnegotiable: first sentence of Proposal 10, providing that if employee complies with last order received, agency is precluded from disciplining her for failing to carry out prior, inconsistent order).</p>
<p class="noindent">A union could not require bargaining on a provision that disciplinary action be limited to violations of negotiated regulations or instructions, i.e., a negotiated table of offenses. An agency cannot be required to negotiate on the criteria it establishes for the imposition of discipline. <span class="Italic">Joint Council of Unions, GPO and GPO</span>, 25 FLRA 1033, 1036 (1987). The union could not compel negotiation of a proposal to further define a local instruction setting out guidelines for disciplinary actions by restricting the agency in taking disciplinary action against an employee for possession of marijuana, narcotics, or other controlled <span id="page_773"></span>substances to only those situations involving possession for personal use or intended sale. The proposal improperly established criteria for the imposition of discipline and directly interfered with management's right to discipline. <span class="Italic">FUSE, NAGE Local R1-144 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 30 FLRA 494, 495 (1987). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-247.html#sec6-248">Drug Use and Drug Detection</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">An interesting negotiability issue arose in <span class="Italic">Int'l Plate Printers Local 2 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 25 FLRA 113, 135-37 (1987). The union proposed a series of contract articles, exemplified by the condition that "an employee shall not be subject to disciplinary action by reason of failure or refusal in good faith to operate or handle any machine, device, apparatus or equipment for which there are reasonable grounds to believe that a real and imminent threat of death or serious injury exists and for which there is insufficient time, due to the urgency of the situation, to eliminate the danger through resort to the negotiated grievance or statutory enforcement procedures." The proposal and others like it were nonnegotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[The provisions] would insulate an employee from discipline for refusing to perform work when confronted with the safety hazards or violations enumerated. Further, the provisions enable an employee alone to determine that an unsafe working condition exists. These provisions do not concern an employee's defense to disciplinary action but rather totally prevent management from instituting discipline to determine whether the employee's actions were reasonable in the first place. Because these provisions would absolutely prohibit management from instituting discipline against an employee under certain circumstances, we find that they directly interfere with the Agency's right to discipline employees.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Int'l Plate Printers</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Carson</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 202-03 (1993), declaring nonnegotiable Proposal 15, that employees not be subjected to discipline because of disobedience to orders that would require an employee to place himself in danger of death or serious bodily injury:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the second disputed sentence of the proposal does not mirror 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1960.46(a), we reject the Agency's argument that the second sentence is nonnegotiable because it is inconsistent with the regulation. Although the proposal affords employees greater immunity from discipline than provided by section 1960.46(a), nothing in the regulation precludes agencies from granting employees such additional immunity. That is, although the regulation prohibits the Agency from disciplining employees in certain circumstances, it does require the Agency to discipline employees in other situations. As such, we will no longer follow the contrary holding in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1808 and Department of the Army, Sierra Army Depot</span>, 30 FLRA 1236, 1260-62 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we conclude that the second disputed sentence of Proposal 15 directly interferes with the Agency's right to discipline employees, as alleged by the Agency. It is clear, in this regard, that proposals that prevent management from disciplining employees for specified conduct directly interfere with management's right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, 44 FLRA at 1172. The second disputed sentence prevents the Agency from disciplining an employee who fails to follow a supervisory order "which would require the employee to place himself/herself in danger of death or serious bodily harm." By preventing management from disciplining an employee in those circumstances, the second sentence prevents the Agency from taking disciplinary action against an employee for failing to obey an order. As such, the second sentence directly interferes with management's right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">International Plate Printers, Die Stampers and Engravers Union of North America, AFL-CIO, Local 2 and Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C.</span>, 25 FLRA 113, 135-37 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming that the second sentence of Proposal 15 constitutes an arrangement, we find that it excessively interferes with the Agency's right to discipline. As noted above, employees are provided immunity from discipline, under applicable regulations, for refusing to obey orders in situations where they reasonably believe that following such orders would result in death or serious injury and there is insufficient time to seek redress. Also as noted above, the second disputed sentence of Proposal 15 does not simply mirror that regulatory immunity. In particular, the proposal neither requires a reasonable belief that harm would result from complying with the disputed order nor limits its application to situations where there is insufficient time to seek redress for the problem through normal procedures. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the proposal would provide employees with immunity from discipline in situations where there is no reasonable belief that harm would result from complying with management's orders and/or other procedures are available to timely redress the perceived problem.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that, by precluding the Agency from disciplining employees in these situations, the proposal would provide a significant benefit to employees but only as a result of severe and unwarranted restrictions on the Agency's right to discipline employees. As such, on balance, we conclude that the second disputed sentence of Proposal 15 excessively interferes with the Agency's right to discipline employees and is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 1815 and Army Aviation Ctr., Ft. Rucker</span>, 53 FLRA 606, 616-17 (1997) (Provision 8) (proposal infringed on management right to discipline that precluded action against employee for refusing to obey order that would endanger safety of himself or others).

<p class="noindent">But negotiable in <span class="Italic">UPTO and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Walla Walla</span>, 44 FLRA 1145, 1174-76 (1992), was a section of Proposal 10, preventing employees from being disciplined for refusing to obey unlawful orders:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second sentence of Proposal 10 provides that an employee will not be subject to discipline for refusing to obey an unlawful order.&#x2003;It appears from the record that the Union intends to preclude the Agency from disciplining employees for refusing to follow orders that "violate law." For the reasons discussed below, we find that the second sentence of Proposal 10 does not directly interfere with management's right to discipline. We also find that even if Proposal 10 directly interfered with the Agency's right, it would constitute an appropriate arrangement and, therefore, would be negotiable under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management may not discipline employees for refusing to obey an illegal order.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. United States</span>, 145 Ct. Cl. 632, 636 (1959) (<span class="Italic">Schmidt</span>). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Gragg v. Department of Air Force</span>, 24 MSPR 506, 509 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Gragg</span>) (where an agency's order directing an employee to follow an agency policy was in direct contravention of the Authority's order directing the agency to revoke the policy at the time the employee was ordered to comply with it, the supervisor's directive to comply with the order was not a "proper" supervisory order, and disobedience of the directive could not serve as a basis for discipline); <span class="Italic">Korowin v. Department of Justice</span>, 10 MSPR 17 (1982) (where an employee had no duty in law, rule, or regulation to obey agency directive, refusal to obey order did not constitute misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance and could not support charge of failure to carry out instruction). <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Bigelow v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 962, 965 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (discipline proper where supervisory order was not illegal).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the absence of any evidence to the contrary in the record of this case, we find that the second sentence would not preclude the Agency from disciplining an employee where the order that the employee refuses to follow is determined to be a legal order. Moreover, under the second sentence of the proposal, a mere claim by an employee that an order is illegal is not sufficient to preclude discipline for failing to comply with that order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By precluding the Agency from disciplining employees who refuse to comply with an unlawful supervisory order, the second sentence of Proposal 10 merely requires the Agency to discipline employees for failing to comply with an order in accordance with the standards for discipline established in controlling case law. Thus, consistent with <span class="Italic">Schmidt</span> and <span class="Italic">Gragg</span>, the second sentence of Proposal 10 simply requires the Agency to discipline employees in accordance with controlling case law. Because the Agency is required under section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute to exercise its right to discipline in accordance with applicable law, the second sentence of Proposal 10 does not directly interfere with management's right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even if the second sentence of Proposal 10 directly interfered with the Agency's right to discipline employees, we find, applying the analytical framework established in <span class="Italic">Kansas Army National Guard</span>, that the second sentence of Proposal 10 constitutes an appropriate arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to discipline employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Union, the second sentence of the proposal is intended to protect employees against a "prohibited personnel practice." We find that, by protecting employees from discipline when they fail to follow an illegal order, the proposal constitutes an arrangement, within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to discipline employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Without passing on whether an agency commits a prohibited personnel practice by disciplining an employee for failing to follow an illegal order, we find that the second sentence of Proposal 10 constitutes an appropriate arrangement. An agency's interest in disciplining an employee for failing to follow an order that is contrary to law is, at most, negligible. Balancing the negligible burden imposed on management's right to discipline against the benefit of the protection from discipline afforded employees who refuse to follow an order that is unlawful, we find that the second sentence of Proposal 10 does not excessively interfere with management's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. We conclude, therefore, that even if the second sentence of Proposal 10 directly interfered with management's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A), the proposal <span id="page_774"></span>constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiations may be sought concerning practices within an agency that indirectly bear upon discipline. In <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 250 and DHHS, Family Support Admin.</span>, 33 FLRA 61, 70-71 (1988), the proposals invited management to set up smoking areas. Discipline could be administered for employees who smoked where they should not. The proposals were not an infringement on management's right to discipline. FLRA elliptically opined that "[r]ather than creating a restriction on management's rights, this proposal concerns only the recognition by the Agency that employees who wish to smoke may do so in areas designated for smoking which have been negotiated by the parties." A union could require management to supply to the union "all patterns of leave use which management feels are leave abuse." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3884 and VA Med. and Reg'l Office Ctr., Fargo, N.D.</span>, 30 FLRA 10, 14 (1987).
