<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-30"><span class="space">5.</span> Format of Disapproval of Agreement; Service</h4>
<p class="noindent">Neither the Statute nor FLRA regulations specify any format for an agency head's disapproval of a negotiated agreement pursuant to &#x00A7; 7114(c). FLRA declined to impose a "reasonable content requirement" for allegations of nonnegotiability. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3172 and DHHS, SSA, San Jose Dist.</span>, 46 FLRA 322, 323-24 (1992). A letter stating that the contract is disapproved, without specific reasoning or specific statements as to the provisions disapproved, meets the statutory intent. The Statute only requires that the contract, not specific provisions of the contract, be disapproved by the agency head. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv. and NAGE Local R4-68</span>, 20 FLRA 537, 540 (1985). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760</span>, 28 FLRA 160, 161 (1987) (concerning form of disapproval of a local agreement). Under <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-68</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, assuming proper service of the disapproval of a contract, the agency should support its declaration and rationale with specificity after the agency has been served with a petition for review. Then the agency has 30 days to file a statement of position, specifying reasons for the allegation. FLRA's reasoning in the <span class="Italic">NAGE</span> case was affirmed in <span class="Italic">FLRA v. NAGE Local R4-68</span>, 802 F.2d 1484 (4th Cir. 1986): the agency's disapproval need not contain reasons; the union's petition for review need not contain reasons either. It is sufficient for the union to file the executed agreement and state that it had been disapproved. The court determined that: "The answer of the employer would put into issue 'precisely what is in dispute.'" Irrespective of the format of the communication, as long as the agency clearly and unmistakably notifies the union of disapproval of the provisions through express language stating that the communication served as an allegation of nonnegotiability, the union has been notified. Because disapproval of contract provisions by an agency head constitutes an allegation of nonnegotiability, the agency is not required to send a separate letter of transmittal to properly effect service of the disapproval notice. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2 and Army Material Dev. and Readiness Command, Harry Diamond Lab.</span>, 11 FLRA 359, 361 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to service of the agency's disapproval of a contract, a letter that is not timely postmarked or personally delivered, or that is not officially served on a proper union official, is ineffective to prevent the contract becoming effective on the 31st day after the agreement is executed. If the contract is not properly disapproved, FLRA dismisses a petition for review that challenges a belated contract disapproval. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2030 and Dept. of Interior, BLM, Idaho Falls</span>, 46 FLRA 291, 293 (1992). The 30 days allowed for service of disapproval by the agency head is not extended by weekends or holidays. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3172 and DHHS, SSA, San Jose Dist. Office</span>, 46 FLRA 1515, 1516 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">For purposes of a negotiability appeal, "the Authority has consistently held in cases such as here involved that the time limit for filing a petition for review begins to run from the day a copy of the agency's disapproval is served on the union." <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1445 and Ala. Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 12 FLRA 64, 65 (1983). It is not receipt, but service, that controls. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 4041 and DHHS, SSA, Albuquerque Teleservice Ctr.</span>, 45 FLRA 3, 4 (1992) (disapproval of memorandum of understanding). Refer to 5 CFR 2424.21, and 5 CFR Part 2429, Subpart B for service and filing requirements and time limitations in negotiability cases. The decisions that follow depend on the FLRA service regulations in effect at the time the cases originated.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA stressed strict procedural regularity as to contract disapproval in a case involving review of an arbitrator's award concerning the status of a contract, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing and Int'l Plate Printers, Wash. Plate Printers Union Local 2</span>, 44 FLRA 926, 934-35 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that section 2429.27(b) of the Authority's Rules and Regulations prescribes the means by which an agency head's disapproval of a collective bargaining agreement pursuant to section 7114(c) of the Statute must be served on the union....&#8197;Service of documents covered by section 2429.27(b) must be by certified mail or in person, and section 2429.27(b) prescribes that proof of service must be by a return post office receipt or other written receipt executed by the party or person served....&#8197;The Authority has further held that when an agency head fails to properly serve the union with the disapproval, the entire collective bargaining agreement becomes effective by operation of law on the 31st day after execution of the agreement, subject only to the Statute and other applicable law, rule, or regulation....&#8197;Furthermore, we have held that "[s]trict adherence to the regulatory requirements for service of a disapproval is necessary in order to determine whether a petition for review meets the statutory filing requirements contained in section 7117(c) of the Statute, as well as the procedural requirements set forth in part 2424 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations."...&#8197;Accordingly, we agree with the Arbitrator that the 1988 agreement became effective by operation of law in January 1989 as a result of the Department of the Treasury's failure to properly serve its disapproval of the agreement on the Union as required by the Authority's Rules and Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's claim that the Authority's Rules and Regulations should not be allowed to defeat the disapproval because no Union representatives were available for personal service and because the Union may have had actual notice of the disapproval. Actual notice has never satisfied the service requirements of section 2429.27(b)....&#8197;In addition, under section 2429.27(b), when personal service is unavailable, certified mail service may be utilized to satisfy the service requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's claim that the Authority's Rules and Regulations should not be allowed to defeat the disapproval because the Union failed to advise the Department of the Treasury or the Agency that the service was deficient....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_423"></span>FLRA provided greater explanation concerning the proper method of service (and if service is not proper, the contract is not considered to be disapproved), in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2354 and Dept. of Air Force, Warren AFB</span>, 40 FLRA 1232, 1232-34 (1991), determining to be ineffective disapproval by email under then-prevailing FLRA regulations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(c)(2) of the Statute provides that the head of an agency shall approve a collective bargaining agreement "within 30 days from the date the agreement is executed" if the agreement complies with applicable law and regulation. Any disapproval by an agency head must be served on the exclusive representative within the 30 days after the execution of the agreement....&#8197;The Authority's Regulations provide two methods of service. Specifically, service of any document, including "documents and papers served by one party on another," must "be made by certified mail or in person." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27(b). The date of service is the date a document is deposited in the mail or is delivered in person. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2427.29(d). Proof of service consists of a "return post office receipt or other written receipt executed by the party or person served...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27(b)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record in this case indicates that on January 16, 1991, in a computer message to local Agency officials, the Director of Personnel of the Strategic Air Command on behalf of the Agency head, disapproved three provisions of a collective bargaining agreement executed on December 17, 1990. However, nothing in the record establishes that the disapproval was timely served on the Union....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency, in its response to the May 9 Order to Show Cause, contends that a printed copy of the January 16 computer message was hand delivered to the Union's president. The Agency also states that it "did not obtain at that time, nor is it able to acquire now, a signed receipt from [the Union president] that the document was personally served."...&#8197;The Agency argues, however, that "there is sufficient evidence in the record to establish that the Union was timely served with the...disapproval." First, the Agency notes that the Union stated in its petition for review that it received the computer message on January 16. The Agency also notes that the Union included a copy of the computer message with its petition for review. The Agency argues that as the computer network used to transmit the disapproval message is accessible only by Agency personnel, the Union could not have obtained a copy of the message unless it was provided with one. Thus, the Agency asserts that "the wording of the Union's petition for review signed by the Union's attorney, coupled with a printed copy of the computer message, provides sufficient proof that the Agency's disapproval...was timely served on the Union."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In further support of its position, the Agency attached an affidavit by the Chief of Employee and Labor Relations at Warren Air Force Base in which he states that he personally hand-delivered the disapproval message to the Union president on January 16, 1991.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither party has responded to the Authority's Order with evidence that the Agency head's disapproval was served on the Union either by certified mail or in person, as required by section 2429.27(b) of the Authority's Regulations, within 30 days after the agreement was executed. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, National Veterans Affairs Council and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health and Research Administration, Washington, D.C.</span>, 39 FLRA 1055, 1058 (1991), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, 40 FLRA 195 (1991) (neither evidence of transmission of agency head disapproval by facsimile transmission (FAX) nor affidavits attesting to mail service within the 30-day period satisfied the requirements of section 2429.27(d) of the Authority's Regulations that documents and papers be served by certified mail or in person); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1332 and Department of the Army, Headquarters, U.S. Army Material Development and Readiness Command</span>, 5 FLRA 599 (1981) (telephonic disapproval within the 30-day period did not constitute a disapproval within the meaning of section 7114(c) of the Statute). Consequently, the entire agreement, as negotiated and executed, became effective and binding on January 17, 1991. Therefore, the Union's petition for review does not raise a dispute concerning an effective and binding negotiated agreement that is cognizable under section 7117 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's regulations on service should be checked; they have changed over time. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 2429.27 (2022).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Antilles Consol. Educ. Assn. and Dept of Defense DDESS</span>, 62 FLRA 147, 149-51 (2007), emphasized that service of the agency head's disapproval of a contract must be properly addressed to constitute timely, effective service:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Education. Ass'n, Overseas Education Ass'n, Fort Rucker Education Ass'n</span>, 53 FLRA 941 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Fort Rucker</span>), the Authority discussed the elements of proper service of an agency-head disapproval. As relevant, the Authority stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Proper service by mail on a party under section 2429.27 begins with the date on which the document is delivered to the Postal Service with an address that allows for delivery to be perfected. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2 and U.S. Department of the Army, Military Traffic Management Command, Falls Church, Virginia</span>, 48 FLRA 1394, 1396 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Military Traffic Management Command</span>). Proof of service is by a return post office receipt or other written receipt executed by the party served. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing and International Plate Printers, Die Stampers and Engravers Union, Washington Plate Printers Union, Local 2</span>, 44 FLRA 926, 934 (1992). The burden of providing the correct address for service of a document is on the party that is to be served with that document. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Bronx, New York and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1168</span>, 45 FLRA 789, 790 (1992). The question of whether the Agency head's disapproval was properly served thus becomes whether the disapproval was mailed to an address that allowed "for delivery to be perfected." <span class="Italic">Military Traffic Management Command</span>, 48 FLRA at 1396.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">53 FLRA 942-43.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts in <span class="Italic">Fort Rucker</span> reveal that the disapproval was addressed to the union and served on the union in care of the school superintendent at Fort Rucker. In finding that the disapproval was timely and properly served, the Authority noted that the parties' agreement specifically contemplated that mail would be sent to the union at the school. The Authority also noted that the union did not claim either that the disapproval was not properly addressed or that the union had received mail or had been served with documents at any other address. Therefore, the Authority found in <span class="Italic">Fort Rucker</span> that "service was perfected by depositing the correctly addressed disapproval in the mail within 30 days after the execution of the agreement." <span class="Italic">Fort Rucker</span>, 53 FLRA at 943.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority distinguished <span class="Italic">Fort Rucker </span>from its earlier decision in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, 28 FLRA 118, in which, as noted above, the Authority found untimely an agency-head disapproval that was mailed to the school superintendent, rather than the union, and then subsequently hand-delivered to the union president more than 30 days after the execution of the agreement. The Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Fort Rucker</span> that the disapproval in <span class="Italic">Antilles </span>was not timely served on the union because service was not perfected until hand delivery of the disapproval to the union president and that, as a result, the parties' agreement became effective and binding under the provisions of &#x00A7; 7114(c) (3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated earlier, in order to be considered timely, the Agency head's disapproval was required to be served on the Union no later than Friday, August 12. Under the Authority's Regulations, service may be accomplished by the U.S. Postal Service or by personal delivery. There is no dispute that the date on which the disapproval was delivered to and signed for by a Union consultant was August 18, well beyond the service due date of August 12. As such, whether or not the consultant was authorized to receive notices of disapproval on the Union's behalf, if the August 18 delivery constituted service of the disapproval, then it was untimely. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Locals 642, 1911, 1966 and 2024</span>, 38 FLRA 503, 504 (1990) (Authority rejected claim that disapproval could only be served "on specified Union officials" where personal service had been made on three of four locals involved in bargaining). There is also no dispute that the disapproval was postmarked on August 11. If that is the date of service, then the disapproval is timely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">Fort Rucker</span>, in order for August 11 to constitute the date of service of the disapproval, the address used must have allowed delivery to be "perfected." The Authority did not specify what it meant by the phrase "allow delivery to be perfected" in <span class="Italic">Fort Rucker</span>. We note, however, that in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the disapproval was mailed to the superintendent and would otherwise have been timely served, but for the fact that it was misaddressed. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, therefore, we find that<span class="Italic"> </span>the phrase "allow delivery to be perfected" requires that, in demonstrating timely service by mail based on the date that the document is postmarked, the document must be correctly addressed so that it is delivered by mail to the intended recipient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that delivery was not perfected--so as to permit the postmark date to constitute the service date--because the Agency head's disapproval was not sent to the proper address. Although the Union eventually received the disapproval on August 18, the issue here is one of proper <span class="Italic">service</span>, not <span class="Italic">receipt</span>. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2182</span>, <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO</span>, 26 FLRA 600, 601 (1987) ("It is `service' and not `receipt' which is the significant event in measuring the timeliness of an agency's disapproval.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, the Agency claims, with supporting affidavits, that, since November 2002, all official correspondence was required to be sent to the Brook Street address, and that the Agency has received notices sent to the Union at that address and then called the Union for delivery instructions or delivered the notices to the Union at its office. <span class="Italic">See</span> affidavits of Vega, Rodriguez and Ortiz. However, evidence submitted by the Union contradicts the Agency's claim. Specifically, the Union provided copies <span id="Page_424"></span>of official correspondence sent by various Agency officials <span class="Italic">subsequent</span> to November 2002 and addressed to the Union at its post office box. This correspondence includes a memo from the Office of the General Counsel, Department of Defense Education Activity, Pensacola, Florida, regarding ground rules for contract negotiations, as well as letters from DDESS in Peachtree City, Georgia, inviting the Union's comments on a particular matter prior to formal impact and implementation bargaining and seeking the Union's review on a proposed instruction. It is also noteworthy that the service sheet accompanying the Agency head's disapproval <span class="Italic">in this case </span>listed the Union's post office box address, even though the envelope containing the disapproval was addressed differently.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Union has supplied a document sent to the Union by the Department of Defense, Civilian Personnel Management Service Field Advisory Services Division, <span class="Italic">subsequent</span> to November 2002, at its base post office box. This office is the same that earlier sent the disapproval to the Union at the Brook Street address and now claims that documents can only be served at that address. This establishes that, contrary to the Agency's claim, all official correspondence has not been sent to the Brook Street address since November 2002. Although, as the Union concedes, mail may have occasionally been misaddressed to the Superintendent's Office and then forwarded to the union by the activity, this does not establish that the Union utilized the Superintendent's Office as an official mailing address. Consequently, consistent with the principle articulated in <span class="Italic">Fort Rucker</span>, the Union has met its burden of establishing its correct mailing address, and because the disapproval in this case was misaddressed, the postmark date does not constitute the service date. As such, the disapproval was untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, for the reasons set forth above, we find that the Agency head's disapproval was not properly served on the Union and that the petition for review should be dismissed. Consistent with &#x00A7; 7114(c)(3) of the Statute, "the agreement shall take effect and shall be binding on the agency and the exclusive representative subject to the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A reconsideration decision, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Mint Council and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Mint, San Francisco, Cal.</span>, 41 FLRA 1004, 1005, 1009-10 (1991), explained the basis for strict adherence to service requirements in contract disapproval cases, declaring ineffective fax delivery of an agency head's disapproval:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The parties were advised that under section 2429.27(d) of the Authority's Rules and Regulations, the date of service is the date the disapproval is deposited in the U.S. mail or is delivered in person....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency appears to suggest that service on a union of an agency head disapproval is comparable to service of exceptions on the opposing party and, therefore, that the Authority should determine whether the Union received the disapproval and assess whether there was any harm to the Union. In our view, the two situations are not analogous. Rather, the service of a disapproval is comparable to the initial filing of exceptions to an award with the Authority. Just as the filing of exceptions initiates the arbitral review processes of the Authority, the service of an agency head disapproval initiates the process culminating in the Authority's review of a negotiability determination. In other words, the filing of a union's petition for review with the Authority is triggered by the service on the union of a timely and proper agency head disapproval. Strict adherence to the regulatory requirements for service of a disapproval is necessary in order to determine whether a petition for review meets the statutory filing requirements contained in section 7117(c) of the Statute, as well as the procedural requirements set forth in part 2424 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations. In contrast, the Authority's ability to entertain a party's exception to an arbitrator's award is unaffected by the method or timeliness of service of those exceptions on the opposing party. None of the arguments advanced by the Agency in its motion for reconsideration persuades us that a departure from strict adherence to our regulations is warranted with regard to the service of an agency head disapproval.</p>
<p class="noindent">Facsimile service of an agency's disapproval of a contract was again disapproved, when there was no agreement of the parties authorizing that method of service, in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1301 and DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons</span>, 51 FLRA 1294, 1295, 1298-99 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether the petition for review had been timely filed, the Authority issued an order requiring the parties to submit information regarding, among other things, service of the Agency's disapproval. In response thereto, the Agency stated that it had transmitted its disapproval of that supplemental agreement to the Union by facsimile (FAX), and the Agency moved that the Union's petition for review be dismissed as being untimely filed with the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority determined that, as a FAX transmission does not constitute service within the meaning of section 2429.27(b) of the Authority's Regulations, the Agency had not properly served its disapproval within 30 days after the supplemental agreement was submitted for review and approval....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's argument that the dismissal is inconsistent with the parties' agreement that a FAX disapproval was permitted, apart from the Agency's bare assertion, there is no basis in the record on which to conclude that the parties agreed to define "service" as including FAX transmission. Indeed, the Agency's assertions in this regard are inconsistent. The Agency has asserted in this proceeding both that FAX service was not precluded by the parties' agreement, and that FAX service was <span class="Italic">"contractually required."</span> Insofar as the Agency is asserting that the parties have agreed to permit FAX service, there is no provision cited or apparent that evidences such agreement. In fact, the Agency stated specifically in its response to the Authority's August 31 Order that the agreement contained no requirements regarding the method of service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's argument that the Authority's Regulations establishing general service requirements do not apply in this case, it is well established that the parties may prescribe their own time limits for review and approval of local supplemental agreements under section 7114(c)(4) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 52 and Internal Revenue Service, Austin District</span>, 23 FLRA 720 (1986) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Austin District</span>)<span class="Italic">. See also National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1655 and U.S. Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau, Alexandria, Virginia</span>, 49 FLRA 874, 891 (1994). However, it is also well established that, if a higher-level agreement or agency regulation does not prescribe a different time limit, then the 30-day time limit in section 7114(c)(2) applies<span class="Italic">. IRS, Austin District</span>. No reason is argued or apparent to reach a different conclusion as to the method of service of disapproval. Accordingly, as the parties' master agreement does not prescribe methods of service, there is no basis for concluding that application of the Authority's regulatory requirements was erroneous.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2776 and DOD, Armed Forces Radio and Television Serv.</span>, 43 FLRA 184 (1991), <span class="Italic">denying reconsideration of</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2776 and DOD, Armed Forces Radio and Television Serv.</span>, 41 FLRA 1292, 1292-93 (1991) (service of agency head disapproval by fax was ineffective); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2776 and DOD, Armed Forces Radio and Television Serv.</span>, 41 FLRA 1292, 1292-93 (1991) (faxes and other means short of certified mail or personal delivery were inadequate); <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Mint Council and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Mint, San Francisco, Cal.</span>, 41 FLRA 220, 222 (1991) (hand delivery of fax disapproving contract was insufficient to meet regulatory requirements then in effect).</p>
<p class="noindent">Should the agency head's disapproval of a contract be ineffective because the disapproval is untimely--meaning that the contract goes into effect as a matter of law--matters are not necessarily at an end. The contract, consistent with &#x00A7; 7114(c), becomes the parties' agreement subject to the provisions of the Statute and other applicable laws, rules, or regulations. Questions as to the consistency of contract provisions with those laws and regulations may then be raised in "other appropriate proceedings." <span class="Italic">Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots and Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 36 FLRA 555, 564 (1990) (FLRA would not ordinarily decide a negotiability dispute when agency head fails to timely disapprove contract, then making exception for case before it involving a court remand). Other appropriate proceedings could include arbitration cases or, possibly, unfair labor practice proceedings. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-12-028.html#sec4-29">Disapproval of Agreement Imposed by FSIP or Interest Arbitrator</a>," concerning negotiability appeals arising from disapproval or rejection by agency heads of FSIP orders directing parties to include specific provisions into their contracts.]</p>
