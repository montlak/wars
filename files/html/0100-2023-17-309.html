<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-307"><span class="space">a.</span> General Restrictions</h5>
<p class="noindent">Although the agency has the right to take disciplinary action under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A), that right is exercised in accordance with the standards of 5 USC 7503(a), permitting an arbitrator to make judgments about the exercise of agency discretion. An arbitrator's findings concerning nexus for a particular offense will not be overturned on the basis of citations to court cases that might suggest a different result by another adjudicator. <span class="Italic">INS and AFGE</span>, 8 FLRA 248, 249-50 (1982); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VA Connecticut Healthcare Sys.</span>, 58 FLRA 501, 504 (2003) ("Because the Arbitrator found that the misconduct was related to the performance of his scheduled duties, the Union has not demonstrated that the Agency suspended the grievant for purely off-duty misconduct."); <span class="Italic">cf. NTEU Chap. 128 and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 62 FLRA 382, 383-84 (2008) (three-day suspension: award properly determined there was nexus between employee's off-duty debt problems and duties of job that involved fiduciary responsibilities). FLRA tends not to require arbitrators to precisely follow case <span id="page_2278"></span>law of the MSPB and Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 32 FLRA 765, 770 (1988) (rejecting agency's effort to require rigid interpretation of cases relating to mitigation of penalties).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an arbitrator's mitigation of a disciplinary penalty does not impermissibly interfere with an agency's right to discipline employees, and the arbitrator properly may determine that all or part of a disciplinary penalty is not for just cause and may set aside or reduce the penalty, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Norfolk and IAM Local 39</span>, 42 FLRA 322, 327 (1991), an arbitrator may not restrict the right of management to take future disciplinary action as part of the remedy in a case involving a specific disciplinary penalty. In <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1336</span>, 34 FLRA 670, 674 (1990), FLRA set aside a portion of an award that specified the penalty for a future violation of attendance requirements. When reversing a suspension, an arbitrator may not foreclose through his remedial order subsequent discipline not grieved without a finding that the subsequent discipline must fail as a result of the action on the discipline that was grieved. In <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 501</span>, 57 FLRA 677, 678-79 (2002), the employee had a series of suspensions followed by a removal. The arbitrator should not have reversed the removal upon finding an earlier suspension invalid without an affirmative determining that, but for the suspension, the removal would not have occurred:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the removal referred to the 14-day suspension and that, under <span class="Italic">Gregory </span>as well as "the progressive discipline system," that reference was improper. As a result, the Arbitrator is concluded that the removal should "be backed off one step." However, the Arbitrator expressly declined to order that remedy because the removal had not been grieved. The sole reason for the Arbitrator's reinstatement remedy was to "den[y] to the Agency the fruits of its illegal retaliatory conduct." This finding, however, does not establish, and nothing in the plain wording of Article 30 of the parties' agreement establishes, that the Agency would not have removed the grievant had it complied with Article 30 in connection with the 14-day suspension. In other words, the Arbitrator has not established that rescission of the 14-day suspension necessarily required rescission of the removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, the remedy of reinstatement does not reflect a reconstruction of what management would have done had it not violated Article 30 of the parties' agreement. Consequently, the award does not satisfy Prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework. We conclude, therefore, that the award is contrary to the Agency's right to discipline. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, </span>54 FLRA at 1235 (vacating award of reinstatement where arbitrator made no specific findings connecting agency's action with grievant's resignation). Accordingly, without addressing the Agency's other exceptions, we set aside the portion of the award reinstating the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an arbitrator sets aside or modifies an agency disciplinary penalty, particularly if a back pay remedy is involved, the arbitrator must--to avoid unduly infringing management's right to discipline--explain in her award how the remedy selected relates to a provision of the contract, or a law or regulation, within the purview of the arbitrator. If the award is not clear on the point, FLRA may send the award back to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator for clarification, <span class="Italic">DOD, DLA, Norfolk and IAM Lodge 97</span>, 54 FLRA 180, 183-84 (1998) (Member Wasserman dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's framework for resolving exceptions alleging that an award violates management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute is set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington</span>, <span class="Italic">D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 201</span>, 53 FLRA 146, 151-54 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Coatesville, Pennsylvania and</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R3-35</span>, 53 FLRA 1426, 1429 (1998) (<span class="Italic">VAMC, Coatesville</span>). Under prong I of this framework, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 153. If the award provides such a remedy, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong I of the framework and will then address prong II. Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Coatesville</span>, 53 FLRA at 1429. If the arbitrator's remedy reflects such a reconstruction, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong II.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to apply the analysis required by this precedent, it is essential to identify the law or contract provision that the Arbitrator determined was violated. Unfortunately, the award in this case is totally devoid of any reference at all to any law or contract provision. Instead, the Arbitrator stated his reliance on "Arbitrator Daugherty's suggested rules[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that it is possible to speculate that the Arbitrator was, in fact, interpreting and applying a relevant provision of the parties' agreement. As the Union points out, Article 25, Section 1 of the parties' agreement provides that disciplinary action shall be taken for just cause. However, we do not consider it appropriate to speculate in this way. Therefore, we are unable to undertake the analysis required by <span class="Italic">BEP</span>.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Contrary to the suggestion of our dissenting colleague, our decision does not require an arbitrator to use certain "magic words." Rather, our decision requires only that an arbitrator's award be clear as to the basis on which the award is grounded. Unlike our colleague, we do not believe that there is an "obvious intent of the Arbitrator" to which we should give effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we are reluctant to prolong resolution of this dispute, we are unable to resolve the Agency's exception that the award is deficient because it violates management's rights under section 7106(a). Accordingly, we remand the case to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for a clarification of the basis of the award. <span class="Italic">See U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Defense Dependents Schools and Federal Education</span> <span class="Italic">Association</span>, 53 FLRA 249, 255 (1997); <span class="Italic">National Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Employees, Local 1442 and U.S. Department of the Army</span>, <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot, Chambersburg, Pennsylvania</span>, 46 FLRA 1631 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">The dissent referenced by FLRA's Opinion in <span class="Italic">DLA</span> was that of Member Wasserman, who had the better view, 54 FLRA at 186-88:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I respectfully dissent, because I believe the Arbitrator's decision is clear. He stated that there was no "good reason to have the behavior of [the] grievant...elevated to this level of discipline." When read in connection with his findings of fact and analysis, it is evident to me that Arbitrator Cromwell determined that there was no just cause to support the discipline, which is consistent with the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I believe that we should be cautious in applying our precedent, so as to retain the essential qualities of arbitration that have made it such a useful form of dispute resolution. The majority correctly describes the requirements that we articulated in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, namely, that when an agency claims that management rights are implicated by an arbitrator's decision, we look to the two sources of limitations on those rights--the collective bargaining agreement and applicable law. However, I think it is wrong to apply so rigid a requirement of explicit expression to either prong of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> test that a choice of words different from our own would defeat the clearly intended meaning of an award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the majority is ordering a remand because the Arbitrator did not cite the portion of the collective bargaining agreement that contains the "just cause" requirement for discipline, nor did he state those precise words. It is also true that the Arbitrator followed a private sector arbitration case for the application of the just cause test. That does not mean that his award was not grounded in or does not enforce a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement that constitutes a negotiable matter pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b). To the contrary, his entire decision reflects an understanding and application of "just cause," because he does discuss whether the grievant engaged in misconduct and whether the agency responded properly to the grievant's actions in light of the surrounding circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, I believe that the analysis under Prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> test should be similar to that used when a party claims the award fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, which is one of the two exceptions here. To demonstrate that an award fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, the appealing party must show that the award: (1) is so unfounded in reason and fact, and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the agreement, as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; or (2) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (3) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense</span>, <span class="Italic">Dependents Schools and Overseas Education Association</span>, 53 FLRA 196, 208 (1997), <span class="Italic">citing, United States Department of Labor</span> <span class="Italic">(OSHA) and National Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 34 FLRA 573, 575-77 (1990). The Award clearly draws its essence from the parties' agreement, so we may properly infer that Prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> has been met through the arbitrator's enforcement of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has determined to follow the private sector precedent regarding cases involving an exception on the basis that the award failed to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.&#x2003;With respect to "essence" appeals, the Supreme Court has said:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he arbitrator's award settling a dispute with respect to the interpretation or application of a labor agreement must draw its essence from the contract and cannot simply reflect the arbitrator's own notions of industrial justice. But as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority, that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">United Paperworkers International Union, AFL-CIO v. Misco</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc.</span>, 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, here, Prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> standard is apparently being interpreted to require the Arbitrator to use certain "magic words" to show that he was applying the "just cause" standard of the contract. That is <span id="page_2279"></span>more than we would require under the essence standard, and it is more than we should be requiring when looking at a claim that management rights have been violated. If we can reasonably construe the arbitrator's award as finding a violation of an enforceable provision of the collective bargaining agreement, we should do so in order to give effect to the obvious intent of the arbitrator. If Prong I is satisfied, then we should go forward to Prong II, the reconstruction of what would have happened in the absence of a violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, I do not believe there is a need to remand the case. I would simply deny the Agency's exceptions, because the award does draw its essence from the parties' agreement, and it does not abrogate management's right to discipline. In responding to the issue of whether the discipline was for just cause, the Arbitrator determined that the suspension should be rescinded. In his view, the matter should have been handled through counseling,[2] which is equivalent to a reconstruction of what would have happened in the absence of the contract violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;The Arbitrators' conclusion that "[a] little 'jawing' would probably have solved the matter at the time," is consistent with the terms of Article 25, Section 1 of the parties' agreement, which provides for an "informal...verbal warning" when it will accomplish the same purpose as discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent">Remand was directed in <span class="Italic">SBA and AFGE Local 2959</span>, 70 FLRA 649, 651 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator's conclusions are unsupported. For example, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency violated Article 37 by issuing the two-day suspension. Although the Arbitrator asserted that her conclusion was based on "all of the evidence presented, including the credibility of the witnesses," she did not indicate: what evidence she considered; how she balanced that evidence; whose testimony she credited; or on what bases she made her credibility determinations. As a result, the Arbitrator failed to sufficiently support her determination that the Agency did not have "just and sufficient cause" to issue the suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See Dept. of Navy, Navy Pub. Works Ctr. and Tidewater Virginia FEMTC</span>, 59 FLRA 551, 553 (2003) (remanding to arbitrator for further explanation of analysis setting aside disciplinary suspension of three days so to allow FLRA to address exceptions by agency that award was contrary to law and did not draw its essence from agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent">When, as part of discipline against an employee, the agency removed duties from him and those duties were restored by an arbitrator who found that portion of the discipline was lacking in just cause, the arbitrator's award was sustained despite an agency challenge that the arbitrator interfered with the agency's statutory right to assign work. The arbitrator had the authority to set aside the disciplinary penalty, and that the award did not directly concern management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and FEMTC</span>, 5 FLRA 230, 233 (1981). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Buffalo VAMC and New York State Nurses Ass'n</span>, 32 FLRA 601, 604-06 (1988) (award canceling disciplinary assignment violated management's right to assign work), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. But when reassignment of an employee was apparently not grieved in conjunction with a grievance protesting a disciplinary suspension, the arbitrator lacked authority to set aside the reassignment when she set aside the suspension. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Asheville and AFGE Local 446</span>, 37 FLRA 1054, 1057 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">If a statute imposes a restriction on discipline, FLRA will not set aside an award enforcing the restriction. In <span class="Italic">SSA, Detroit Northeast Reg'l Office and AFGE Local 3239</span>, 56 FLRA 483, 484-85 (2000), the grievant was suspended for two days because of a complaint by a member of the public of rudeness of the employee. 5 USC 7503(a) allows management to suspend an employee for up to 14 days for cause promoting service efficiency. That statute states that cause may include discourteous conduct to the public confirmed by an immediate supervisor's report of four instances within a year or any other pattern of discourteous conduct. The arbitrator applied the statute and set aside the discipline because the agency did not demonstrate four instances or another pattern of discourteous conduct. Although noting that action could be taken against an employee on the basis of some other offense coupled with a single incident of discourtesy to the public, FLRA saw no error in the arbitrator's analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an arbitrator overturns a disciplinary action, he may order expungement of the employee's record. He may not interfere with the agency's right to maintain internal security by directing the destruction of agency investigation files. The employee is properly protected by an order directing the agency not to make any future use of any of the information from the investigation file against the employee. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Leavenworth and AFGE Local 85</span>, 28 FLRA 759, 761 (1987). But the internal security argument may not be expanded to preclude the arbitrator from reviewing discipline; an award setting aside a disciplinary penalty for lack of good cause will not be set aside because the award undercuts management's ability to maintain internal security. The award does not affect any internal security practice determining employees' duties or affecting other employees. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Prison Sys., El Reno FCI and AFGE Local 171</span>, 35 FLRA 329, 338 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">Analysis of an argument that an award interpreting a contract provision infringes an agency's right to determine its internal security was provided in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons FCI Coleman and AFGE Local 506</span>, 65 FLRA 730, 732-33 (2011), involving the method that misconduct investigations were documented in agency files:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recently revised the analysis that it will apply when reviewing management rights exceptions to arbitration awards.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. EPA</span>, 65 FLRA 113, 115 (2010) (Member Beck concurring) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>); <span class="Italic">FDIC, Div. of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Prot., S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA 102, 106-07, (2010) (Chairman Pope concurring). Under the revised analysis, the Authority assesses whether the award affects the exercise of the asserted management right. <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 115. If it does not, then the Authority denies the exception. <span class="Italic">E.g., Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 65 FLRA 523, 525-26 (2011) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to determine internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the authority to determine the policies and practices that are part of an agency's plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, or operations. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. DHS, Customs &#x0026; Border Prot. Agency, N.Y.C., N.Y.</span>, 61 FLRA 72, 76 (2005) (then-Member Pope concurring) (<span class="Italic">DHS</span>). Where an agency shows a link or reasonable connection between its objective of safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and, as relevant here, an investigative technique designed to implement that objective, the Authority will find that an arbitration award that conflicts with the policy or practice affects management's right to determine internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv., El Paso, Tex.</span>, 56 FLRA 398, 403 (2000) (Member Wasserman concurring) (<span class="Italic">Customs</span>). In this regard, although "techniques aimed at obtaining truthful and reliable information from interviewees [may] constitute internal security practices[,]" an agency must show a "link, or reasonable connection" between those techniques and the agency's internal security objectives in order to demonstrate that the award affects this management right. <span class="Italic">Customs</span>, 56 FLRA at 403. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Prison Council 33</span>, 51 FLRA 1112, 1116 (1996) (finding a connection between techniques designed to promote candid and truthful answers during investigations of employee wrongdoing and agency's internal security objectives).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an agency fails to demonstrate a link or reasonable connection between its investigative techniques and its security objectives, then the Authority will find no effect on management's right to determine internal security. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 65 FLRA at 526 (agency failed to show link between safeguarding computer system and practice of disallowing retired employee to have access to agency e-mail and a limited number of other programs). <span class="Italic">See also AFGE, Local 1547</span>, 63 FLRA 174, 176 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Local 1547</span>) (agency failed to show link between collecting Social Security numbers and dates of birth for parking registration and agency's plan to secure its personnel, physical property, and operations); <span class="Italic">DHS</span>, 61 FLRA at 76 (agency failed to demonstrate that the particular amount of ammunition available to employees to practice for firearms qualification had internal security ramifications); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2050</span>, 36 FLRA 618, 639-40 (1990) (agency failed to show link between notifying employees of criminal activity near agency office and agency's internal security practices).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency asserts that the award imposes limitations that "dictate[&#8197;] to the Agency the manner in which it conducts investigations and gathers information[,]" and asserts that "obtaining truthful and reliable information from interviewees" is an internal security practice. However, the Agency does not cite a security objective to which the Agency's asserted investigative techniques--specifically, declining to place a copy of an agent's questions and a guard-authored affidavit in a guard's investigation file--are connected. <span class="Italic">Cf. Local 1547</span>, 63 FLRA at 176 (agency "fail[ed] to explain even briefly how or why 'collection of information' is involved in its internal security procedures or policies"). In this connection, with regard to the third issue--whether a guard has the right to submit a guard-authored affidavit--the award does not affect the Agency's ability to conduct investigations and investigatory interviews as it always has, or to include agent-authored affidavits in a guard's investigation file as it always has, or to arrive at disciplinary decisions as it always has. In other words, the award does not alter the manner, scope, or results of any misconduct investigation. As the Agency has not demonstrated a link or reasonable connection between its asserted investigative techniques and its security objectives, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the award affects management's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See Local 1547</span>, 63 FLRA at 176. Further, <span class="Italic">Local 701</span>, 58 FLRA at 131, cited by the Agency, does not support a contrary conclusion, because the union in <span class="Italic">Local 701 </span>conceded that the provision at issue affected the right to determine internal security practices, and, accordingly, the Authority did not address the issue. <span class="Italic">See Local 701</span>, 58 FLRA at 132.</p>
<p class="noindent">Arbitrators are bound to follow the Back Pay Act when they correct disciplinary actions. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth and NAGE Local R4-19</span>, 36 FLRA 304, 309-10 (1990), a disciplinary suspension was set aside, and back pay ordered, on the condition that the appellant complete a weight loss program. The award was set aside:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In order for an award of backpay to be authorized under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, an arbitrator must determine that the aggrieved <span id="page_2280"></span>employee was affected by an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action and that such unwarranted action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction in the pay, allowances, or differentials that the employee would have otherwise received....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that "[c]ertainly, [the Agency] did nothing which one can fault" and that the "severity of the sanction was a judgment call." Although the Arbitrator affirmed the grievance on condition that the grievant lost weight and participated in a conditioning program, the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency's determination to suspend the grievant without that condition was in violation of law, regulation, or the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Rather, the Arbitrator developed his conditional award of backpay after stating that "[t]his is an unusual case, and a unique solution is called for, even at the slight risk of a modest usurpation of power by the [A]rbitrator."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not find that the suspension was unwarranted or unjustified.&#x2003;Such a finding is required under the Back Pay Act in order for backpay to be granted....&#8197;We will, therefore, order that the award be set aside....</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the component of the award in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span> conditioning back pay on the grievant's weight loss, 36 FLRA at 310-11:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator acknowledged that the Agency did not have the authority to mandate the grievant's weight loss. The Arbitrator's award conditions the discipline on a requirement that the Agency itself could not impose....&#8197;[T]he Arbitrator is, in effect, requiring the Agency to establish medical standards for the grievant's position in violation of a Government-wide regulation....</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator is required to adhere to OPM regulations when she decides a grievance challenging a disciplinary action. One case was remanded to an arbitrator who decided that an employee was properly disciplined for AWOL. The arbitrator should have determined whether the employee provided the agency with administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity that would have justified sick leave under 5 CFR 630.403. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC, Newington</span>, 51 FLRA 1720, 1723-24 (1996).</p>
