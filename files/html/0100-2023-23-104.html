<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-103"><span class="space">7.</span> Interim Earnings; Job Search, Relocation Cost; Replacement Earnings; Retirement Income; Fraudulent Earnings Information</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596(b)((1)(A), back pay is:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(i)&#x2003;an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that period;...</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Community Health Choice, Inc. v. United States</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200814138">970 F.3d 1364</a>, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2020) ("Our predecessor court held that in suits brought for improper discharge for federal employment, damages had to be reduced by the amount earned by the federal employee in the private sector under a mitigation theory. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Craft v. United States</span>, 589 F.2d 1057, 1068 (Ct. Cl. 1978) ("Unless there is a regulation or a statute that provides otherwise, cases in this court routinely require the deduction of civilian earnings [from a back pay award] on an analogy to the principle of mitigation of damages."); <span class="Italic">Laningham v. United States</span>, 5 Cl. Ct. 146, 158 (Ct. Cl. 1984) ("This rule has been utilized as an analog to the private contract law principle of mitigation of damages."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Motto v. United States</span>, 360 F.2d 643, 645 (Ct. Cl. 1966); <span class="Italic">Borak v. United States</span>, 78 F. Supp. 123, 125 (Ct. Cl. 1948).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 1201.181(b) (2022) requires that, as part of the compliance process, "[a]ppellants must provide agencies with all information necessary for compliance and should monitor the agency's progress towards compliance." It is likely that an agency will inquire of a reinstated employee concerning his interim earnings. If evidence on interim earnings is in conflict and resolution of that conflict depends on credibility determinations, a hearing should be held. <span class="Italic">Garibay v. VA</span>, 31 MSPR 258, 263-64 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency must deduct interim earnings from a back pay award. An appellant has an affirmative duty to provide a statement of interim earnings. <span class="Italic">Mascarenas v. DOD</span>, 57 MSPR 425, 431 (1993) (excusing delay in providing the appellant with back pay because of a delay in obtaining statement of interim earnings); <span class="Italic">Garibay v. VA</span>, 35 MSPR 327, 332 (1987) ("A prevailing employee is under an affirmative duty to provide the agency with a statement of interim earnings to assist it in the calculation of back pay."). If the appellant does not cooperate in back pay calculations, the appellant may have a problem, <span class="Italic">McDonald v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-0752-12-0344-C-1 (NP 8/5/2014) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">McDonald v. Dept. of Army</span>, 603 Fed. Appx. 960 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency calculates back pay, the Back Pay Act and the Office of Personnel Management's regulations require it to take certain deductions from gross back pay. The agency is specifically required to deduct the amount of any outside earnings that the appellant may have earned from its calculation of the appellant's back pay award. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(1). Thus, the agency needs documentation concerning the appellant's earnings, or it cannot calculate her back pay in a way that complies with the law. The appellant's refusal to provide the agency with the information it has requested means that the agency cannot calculate her back pay award. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge correctly denied the appellant's petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may show compliance with its restoration obligations by making a down payment to the employee as back pay details are worked out. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clinger v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 482, 484-85 (1995) (agency was in compliance with Board restoration order when, pending submission by appellant of records pertaining to back pay, agency issued to him a $6,000 check representing an advance of back pay due to appellant).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Timberlake v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 83, 86-87 (1999), the employee was required to provide clear information as to interim earnings, or erroneous payments received from the government, as a condition to receipt of the back pay promised under the settlement. When he did not supply the necessary information, his enforcement petition was denied by the Board, and that result was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Timberlake v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3351):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Agreement states that Mr. Timberlake "will be paid eight hours administrative pay for December 16, 1996 and back pay for December 30, 1996 through April 18, 1997." We give the words of a settlement agreement their ordinary meaning unless the parties mutually intended and agreed to an alternative meaning<span class="Italic">. See Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Thus, while the Agreement does not explicitly define the terms "administrative pay" and "back pay," we construe those terms to have their ordinary meanings, as defined by the regulations governing Mr. Timberlake's employment with the Agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties do not dispute that, as a veteran, Mr. Timberlake was a preference-eligible employee of the U.S. Postal Service at the time of the Agreement. As such, his entitlement to back pay was governed by the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(2) (1994). Therefore, because 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805 sets forth the proper method for computing back pay under the Back Pay Act, the Board did not err by requiring that Mr. Timberlake answer questions submitted to him by the Agency in accordance with that regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second question we address is whether the Board erred in dismissing Mr. Timberlake's petition to enforce the Agreement because he failed to comply with the Board's order. We review this action for abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See Mendoza v. Merit</span> <span class="Italic">Systems Protection Bd.</span>, 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992). We note that the Board has broad discretion to impose sanctions when a party fails to comply with an order. As we have previously explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A petitioner who ignores an order of the Administrative Judge does so at his or her peril. Litigants before the Board, whether rich or poor, whether resident abroad or in the United States, are obligated to respect the Board, its procedures, including deadlines, and the orders of the Board's judges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4916"></span><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Mr. Timberlake had two opportunities to provide the Board with the information it requested. Both times, he failed to do so. In its order of February 25, 1999, the Board provided a clear warning that "appellant's failure to comply with this order may result in the dismissal of his petition for enforcement."... We are not persuaded, therefore, by Mr. Timberlake's claim that he misunderstood the Board's request. Likewise, we will not entertain his assertion on appeal that he was not employed during the relevant back pay period, as we fail to see why such a simple fact could not have been provided to the Board when it was requested.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant's assertion that he received no income during the period of his removal was not credible in the face of agency testimony strongly corroborated by contemporaneously executed written documents. Appellant's flat denial failed to explain, rebut, or contradict his admissions. Indeed, in rejecting the appellant's version of the disputed facts at issue, the administrative judge affirmatively determined that appellant "did not cooperate" with the agency's efforts to compute the back pay amount, that he had a previous employer despite appellant's sworn statements to the contrary, that his assertion of receiving no employment income was not credible, that he is unlikely to provide truthful information concerning such earnings, and that a denial of a back pay award is necessary to serve the interests of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Comptroller General has ruled that honest omissions and misunderstandings of the principles governing offsets of interim earnings from back pay awards can occur, and claimants should be given the benefit of the presumption of honesty and fair dealing. Comp. Gen. Dec. No. B-217517 (July 28, 1986). If, however, based upon the facts of the particular case it appears that the claim for back pay is tainted by fraud or misrepresentation, the claim should be viewed as one of doubtful validity and should be disallowed, leaving the claimant to pursue the matter in the courts. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 44 Comp. Gen. 110, 115-16 (1964); 23 Comp. Gen. 907, 910 (1944).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge's recommendations and findings are tantamount to and supportive of the conclusion that appellant's sworn denials of receipt of interim earnings were made intentionally and with the purpose of defrauding the agency into paying a full back pay claim for the entire period following appellant's removal and prior to his reinstatement, despite the fact that appellant was not entitled to a full award based on his receipt of interim earnings. In seeking a full back pay award, appellant repeatedly swore to having received no employment earnings during the period in question. Yet the administrative judge, who had an adequate opportunity to evaluate appellant's demeanor and to otherwise assess all the evidence of record, found that appellant had deliberately declined to tell the truth of the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In inferring fraudulent intent from this evidence, "it is well to remember '[i]ntent, being a state of mind, can seldom be proved directly.

The record here establishes a cynical effort by appellant to swear to whatever "facts" he deemed necessary to obtain a full back pay award without regard to the truth of the matter. Appellant has tainted his back pay claim with fraud; as such, he has forfeited any right to back pay in any amount. Comp. Gen. Dec. No. B-217517, July 28, 1986.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Broadnax v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 219, 228 (1987), the appellant argued that some interim earnings should not be deducted because they were not "replacement earnings." As background, the National Labor Relations Board has often adjudicated back pay disputes, and in the process, has come up with the concept of "replacement earnings." If an employee holds a part-time job in addition to his regular employment and is then fired from his regular job, deductions from his interim earnings after his reinstatement will not include the part-time job earnings. Assuming the part-time job is continued after the dismissal from the full-time job, the only deductible interim earnings are those obtained to replace the full-time position. But there are variations on the theme. One variation concerns the employee who obtains a part-time job after being terminated and claims that the part-time position was not meant to replace the full-time job that was lost. Returning to <span class="Italic">Broadnax</span>, the MSPB essentially adopted the NLRB formulation on interim earnings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...This interpretation of the Postal Service's regulations is consistent with one of the principal cases in the private sector on the deduction of "moonlighting earnings," which holds that where the "moonlight" job could not have been held if the employee had obtained or remained in the position at issue, such earnings constitute interim earnings and must be deducted from the award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bing v. Roadway Express, Inc.</span>, 485 F.2d 441, 454 (5th Cir. 1973). Appellant has not shown that he could or would have worked any hours in his interim position as bus driver in the absence of his removal. In addition, since appellant regularly worked overtime hours in the position he would have remained in, but for his removal, it is unlikely that he could or would have worked overtime in the second job. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that appellant has ever worked in a second job during his tenure with the agency....</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-12-0547-I-6 (NP 3/9/2023) ("The appellant contends that the agency's rescinding his removal meant he had prevailed on appeal and that the agency was required to have allowed him outside or ‘moonlight' employment before his removal. The appellant has not shown, however, that he could or would have worked at his outside employment had he not been removed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Weber v. Department of Justice</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 345, &#x00B6; 11 (2001).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">LaBatte v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 586, 595-96 (1993), provided additional discussion of replacement earnings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument is that because he worked an unusual schedule as a Firefighter with 24 hours on, 24 hours off, and an extra day off every other weekend, he could have performed his limousine driver duties concurrently with his position and, to the extent that he worked as a driver on what would have been his regular days off as a Firefighter, no deductions for his salary for these periods should have been made from his back pay award. As the administrative judge found, however, this argument overlooks the fundamental principle that there is no hour to hour or day to day comparison in this situation. What is at issue here is whether the appellant's employment constitutes replacement employment for his federal job, after he was removed and before being restored to the agency on January 13, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 USC 5596(b)(1)(A), an employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, to receive for the period for which the personnel action was in effect--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's salary as a limousine driver represents "any amounts earned...through other employment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) implementing regulation at 5 CFR 550.805(e)(1) addresses computation of deductions from the back pay award. This regulation provides that an agency shall deduct: "Any amounts earned by an employee from other employment during the period covered by the corrective action." There is no dispute that the appellant took the interim employment because he had lost his federal job. He had not worked at another job while he was employed as a Firefighter. The Board has held, based upon the statute and regulations cited above, that an employee's interim replacement earnings must <span id="Page_4917"></span>be offset against his back pay award when it was clear that his interim employment was taken to replace his lost earnings as a Federal employee, and there was no showing that the employee could or would have worked at his interim employment had he not been removed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Broadnax v. US Postal Service</span>, 35 MSPR 219, 227-28 (1987)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 53 Comp. Gen. 824, 827 (1974).[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> FPM Supp. 990-2, Subchapter 8-7c(1) ("In other words, the only earnings from other employment that may <span class="Italic">not</span> be deducted from backpay are earnings from outside employment the employee already had before the unjustified suspension or separation.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's employment was replacement employment and was not moonlighting because it was not held in addition to his Firefighter position and, further, that there is no showing that the appellant worked any overtime in his interim employment. Therefore, as the administrative judge properly concluded, the various authorities cited by the appellant pertaining to moonlighting and/or overtime are simply not relevant to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we agree with the administrative judge that tips are deductible from back pay awards because they represent "any amounts earned...through other employment." In the absence of authority on this issue, we turn to the dictionary definition of "earned income" as closely on point. "Earned income is income from wages, salaries, fees, or the like, accruing from labor or services performed by the earner." <span class="Italic">See</span> Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary Of The English Language 448 (1989). A tip is "a special present of money given directly to someone for performing a service, or menial task"; "gratuity." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1487. Thus, tips are earned for services and are, by definition, earned income or "earnings." Because the appellant's tips were from his other employment with Sun Tan Tours, these tips fall within the definition of that which must be set off from a back pay award under 5 USC 5596(b)(1)(A)(i).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of replacement earnings was explored in an appeal involving deduction from a bonus payable as part of back pay earned from employment during the appellant's demotion, <span class="Italic">Deskin v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 684, 686-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In computing the amount of back pay due, the agency is required to deduct any amounts earned by the employee from other employment during the period covered by the corrective action. The agency must include as "other employment" any employment engaged in by the employee to take the place of employment from which the employee was separated. 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(1); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(1) and (2). In this case, the appellant's "other employment" was the position to which he was reassigned. In that capacity, he earned a craft award bonus and overtime pay and was paid accordingly. The appellant has successfully argued that his back pay award should not be offset by the overtime. He now argues that it should not be offset by the amount of craft award bonus he earned. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Replacement earnings" are what an employee earns to replace the wages lost because of an adverse action that unjustly prevented him from working in a particular position. <span class="Italic">Broadnax v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 35 MSPR 219, 227-28 (1987). Sums earned to replace earnings that would have been received in the desired position can be deducted from a back pay award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An agency is prohibited from deducting overtime pay earned in an interim position only to the extent that the interim overtime exceeded any overtime that the employee would have worked in his desired position. <span class="Italic">Rogerson v. Department of Transportation</span>, 35 MSPR 270, 272 (1987). In other words, overtime pay in interim employment can be deducted from a back pay award, if and to the extent that the overtime pay replaced compensation that would have been earned in the desired position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This principle can readily be applied to the bonus situation. In the present case, the $14,771 VPP bonus is properly included in the back pay award because the appellant would have earned it had he not been improperly reduced in grade. <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 80 MSPR 375, 379 (1998). His replacement earnings included a $400 craft bonus. That $400 bonus should be deducted from the back pay award because it represented replacement earnings. A bonus earned in interim employment, like any other form of compensation, should be deducted from a back pay award to the extent that it replaced compensation that would have been earned in the desired position but for the unjust personnel action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Replacement earnings were considered as to an agency's prior disapproval of outside employment, <span class="Italic">Weber v. DOJ</span>, 88 MSPR 345, 349-50 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Section 5596(b)(1)(A), an employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, to receive for the period for which the personnel action was in effect (i) an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, 5 CFR Section 550.805(e)(1) addresses the computation of deductions from the back pay award. This regulation provides that an agency shall deduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any outside earnings...received by an employee for other employment...undertaken to replace the employment from which the employee was separated...during the interim period covered by the corrective action. Do not count earnings from additional or "moonlight" employment the employee may have engaged in while Federally employed (before separation) and while erroneously separated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish that interim earnings should be viewed as "moonlight" employment and thus, not deductible from a back pay award, the employee must show that he could or would have worked at his interim employment had he not been removed. <span class="Italic">LaBatte v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 58 MSPR 586, 596 (1993). Contrary to the appellant's argument, the interim employment must be the same as the pre-removal employment and must be approved by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Groves v. United States,</span> 47 F.3d 1140 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (court limited interim earnings not subject to offset to those earnings attributable to work and hours authorized by agency); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 53 Comp. Gen. 824, 827 (1974) (even though appellant had received payment for written work prior to his removal, he was required to establish that he began working on a particular book prior to his removal in order to protect book-related earnings from offset).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At issue here is whether the appellant's employment with Visconti constitutes replacement employment for his federal job, or whether may be viewed as a continuation of his "moonlighting" employment as town policeman. We find under the circumstances here that the appellants employment with Visconti must be considered replacement employment. The record shows that: the agency initially approved the appellant's police work "moonlight" employment; the agency withdrew that approval April 27, 1997, and ordered the appellant to resign his "moonlight" position immediately; the appellant was subsequently removed, effective September 15, 1997. Thus, the appellant was not engaged in authorized "moonlighting" at the time of his removal. The appellants new employment as a driver for Visconti did not begin until January 1998, three months after removal, and continued to June 6, 1999, when the appellant returned to work. While the agency subsequently authorized the appellant to "moonlight" for Visconti in October 1999, we agree with the agency that its post-removal approval of the appellant's "moonlight" employment with Visconti does not demonstrate that he could or would have worked at this employment had he not been removed.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In Comp. Gen.

The agency should not gain from its improper action.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4918"></span>If an involuntary retirement is reversed, the remedy is the difference between the salary that the appellant would have received had he remained on active duty and the (disability) retirement pay he received. <span class="Italic">Gavette v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find it appropriate to address the form of relief that may be provided if the appellant should prevail on his claims of involuntariness and discrimination. When the Board determines that a resignation or retirement was involuntary, the relief ordinarily provided is to order the agency to cancel the appellant's separation and restore the individual to duty. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Drummonds v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 58 MSPR 579, 585 (1993) (resignation); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Army</span>, 49 MSPR 405, 414 (1991) (retirement). The appellant has not sought such relief in this case. Asserting that he is presently unable to return to the work place, he has sought to remain on disability retirement and collect compensatory damages, consisting of the monetary difference between his disability retirement annuity and the income he would have earned had he continued working for the agency. He asks that this differential income be provided until such unspecified time in the future when he should be able to return to work, or until he reaches the age when he would have been able to retire based on age and length of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board finds that the appellant's retirement was involuntary, or the result of disability discrimination, it would order the agency to cancel the appellant's separation by disability retirement, and such cancellation would result in a cessation of annuity payments. Cancellation would also mean that all of the disability retirement benefits the appellant has received to date would be considered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as an overpayment.[10] Although the law provides for waiver of an overpayment when the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience, 5 USC &#x00A7; 8346(b), a determination of whether waiver is appropriate is for OPM to make in the first instance. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1401-.1407.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;If the appellant is currently unable to perform useful and efficient service in an appropriate position, he could file a new application for disability retirement, but annuity payments under a new application would not be retroactive to the date he was formerly separated on disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the appellant would be entitled to back pay for any or all of the period following his 1991 separation is governed by the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596, and OPM's regulation at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(c)(1), which provides that no award of back pay can be made for any period during which an employee was not ready, willing, and able to perform his or her duties because of an incapacitating illness or injury. In the context of a case in which the Board finds that the agency committed disability discrimination by failing to accommodate a disabled employee, this means that the appellant must have been ready, willing, and able to work either in his former position, with modifications, or in another position to which he could have been reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Boomer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 540, 543 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has stated, both in the proceeding below, and in his petition for review, that he was unable to render useful and efficient service to the agency at the time he retired on disability, and that he has remained unable to perform such service to the present day. If these assertions should be supported by the evidence, the appellant would therefore not be entitled to an award of back pay.[12]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;The appellant may wish to consider these possible financial effects of prevailing on his appeal in deciding whether he wishes to continue to pursue his appeal, or whether he instead wishes to withdraw it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At least in civil rights cases, it may be that disability retirement benefits should not be deducted from a back pay award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Arneson v. Callahan</span>, 128 F.3d 1243, 1247-48 (8th Cir. 1997) (exploring the "collateral source" rule in a case brought by a discharged SSA employee). Ordinarily, however, an employee receiving back pay through retroactive reinstatement would owe retirement benefits received from the government during the period covered by the back pay. 5 CFR 550.805(e)(2)(i, ii) (2022) requires that an agency should deduct from back pay both retirement annuity payments and refunds of retirement contributions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grabis v. OPM</span>, 424 F.3d 1265 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("If he had never been removed, however, he would not have received any of the discontinued service annuities he was paid during his temporary separation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Day v. OPM</span>, 873 F.2d 291, 293 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (stating that "a retirement annuity cannot start until separation from service" and "separation from service [is] nullified by accepting retroactive reinstatement"); <span class="Italic">Riggs v. OPM</span>, 709 F.2d 1486, 1488 (Fed.
