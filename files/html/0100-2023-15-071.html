<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-72"><span class="space">a.</span> Air Traffic Controller</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considers appeals involving air traffic controller trainees who are demoted or removed when they fail their developmental training courses. An introduction to the training scheme was offered by the FLRA in <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 51 FLRA 192, 193 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pay of air traffic control specialists (controllers or ATCSs) depends on the level of difficulty of their work. Air traffic control facilities are classified from level 1 to level 5, with level 5 handling the greatest volume of traffic and having the most complex operations. The highest grade for a controller at a level 1 facility is GS-10 and at a level 5 facility is GS-14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A controller who has not satisfied all the training and qualification requirements for a particular facility is called a developmental controller (DC). A controller who has completed the required training program and thus can perform the full range of work at a particular facility is called a full performance level (FPL) or journeyman controller. If an FPL controller applies for and is chosen for a higher-graded position at a higher-level facility for which he or she is not fully qualified, the controller becomes a DC at that facility and must complete all phases of training to become an FPL controller at that facility. If a DC does not complete a training program, he or she may be removed from employment or reassigned and demoted to a lower-level facility. A demoted DC must requalify as an FPL controller at the lower-level facility in order to retain employment. A DC who gains or regains FPL status again becomes eligible for promotion and may repeat the training program process to become an FPL controller at a higher-level facility.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Air traffic controller trainees are removed for failing to complete developmental training. <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 33 MSPR 690, 695 (1987) (failure to complete air traffic control developmental training warranted removal); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Wright v. FAA</span>, 40 MSPR 355, 363 (1989) (upgrade training), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 900 F.2d 1541 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (acknowledging the "up or out" policy; reversal on other grounds); <span class="Italic">Davis v. FAA</span>, 39 MSPR 470, 480 (1989) (demotion for the failure to satisfactorily complete an air traffic control recertification course); <span class="Italic">Cortright v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 37 MSPR 565, 571 (1988) (air traffic control training; no abuse of discretion in failing to make an exception to national policy allowing a demotion in lieu of removal under certain circumstances); <span class="Italic">Coleman v. FAA</span>, 27 MSPR 212, 216 (1985) (recertification; special circumstances warranted cancelation of removal); <span class="Italic">Cupido v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 12 MSPR 553, 554 (1982) (appellant failed to respond to the possibility of a recommended assignment to a different position following failure to complete training); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Stenmark v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 59 MSPR 462, 467-69 (1993) (if the agency decided to use Chapter 43 rather than Chapter 75 to remove a developmental air traffic control specialist who did not successfully complete training, the agency was required to produce record evidence of its performance standards and an OPM-approved appraisal plan); <span class="Italic">Grassell v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 40 MSPR 554, 562 (1989) ("[W]e have recognized the paramount importance of a mandatory training program for individuals seeking to work in the critical field of air traffic control."); <span class="Italic">Billings v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 36 MSPR 421, 424 (1988) (no requirement of an improvement period in a Chapter 75 performance-based action involving a <span id="Page_2515"></span>development program encompassing a continuous opportunity to improve) (vacating 25 MSPR 201 (1984) (placing under Chapter 43 a removal action for the failure to complete a training program); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 289 Fed. Appx. 406 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) (removal of air traffic control specialist for failure to maintain an Air Traffic Control Specialist certificate as required by agency regulations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Courts approve FAA's practices concerning required advancement of controllers in developmental positions. <span class="Italic">Haje v. Hampton</span>, 549 F.2d 275, 276 (2d Cir. 1977):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The FAA acknowledges the extraordinary nature of this requirement, but points out that since the agency is the sole civilian employer of air traffic controllers, it must train its own personnel. To assure a continuous supply of qualified air traffic controllers, the FAA has made it a part of the lower-level specialists job to learn the skills required for the next higher level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Without a forced advancement system, there might not be room at the lower grades for persons willing and able to qualify for the essential high level positions.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It now need only be noted that plaintiffs' dismissal also did not infringe their rights under the Civil Service Commission regulations setting up a probationary period after which plaintiffs were entitled to be free from further examination of their qualifications, 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.801-.807 (1969), since such regulations, which were designed to afford the Government a limited period during which it might peremptorily dismiss new employees, were not intended to preclude a post-probationary dismissal for failure to complete successfully up-grade training where such requirement has a direct bearing on promoting "the efficiency of the service," 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.104 (1969). <span class="Italic">See Preble v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To the above, this caveat is added: this opinion necessarily deals only with the unusual, Commission-approved program whereby the Agency trains journeymen controllers; more particularly, with the GS-8 airways operations specialist (center) position.

<p class="Body-Text">Although an air traffic controller trainee may raise as a defense the refusal of the agency to retrain or retest the appellant when the agency allowed others that privilege, the employee must show that the charges and circumstances of the other individuals are similar to those of the appellant.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Radcliffe v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 57 MSPR 237, 241-42 (1993), involving removal of an air traffic control specialist for failure to complete training requirements, rejected mitigation ordered by the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has not previously answered the question of whether the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> mitigation analysis applies where the agency has taken a removal action after the employee failed to progress satisfactorily in an "up-or-out" training program.... <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hutchcraft v. Department of Transportation</span>, 55 MSPR 138, 147 (1992); <span class="Italic">Pawlak v. Department of Transportation</span>, 40 MSPR 546, 554 (1989) (remand of case was warranted for consideration of whether the Board had authority to mitigate removal penalty imposed pursuant to "up-or-out" training program). We do so now.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 864 F.2d 1579, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1989), the Federal Circuit held that, where a security clearance is a condition of employment, an employee has lost that clearance, and there is no agency policy of reassigning employees who unsuccessfully seek security clearances to nonsensitive positions, the Board has no authority to inquire into the feasibility of a transfer to an alternative position. <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>, at 1581; <span class="Italic">Lyles v. Department of the Army</span>, 864 F.2d 1581, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1989). Similarly, we find that, where the satisfactory completion of training is a condition of employment, as it is here, and there is no agency policy manifested by regulation obligating reassignment, the Board has no authority to determine whether reassignment or a lesser penalty would be appropriate under the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Consequently, we find reasonable, and well within the agency's authority, the removal of an employee who has to progress satisfactorily to the next stage of a training program as a condition of his employment and fails to do so. We further find here, however, that since the FAA had an existing policy regarding reassignment for failed developmentals, it was appropriate for the administrative judge to review whether the agency properly had applied its existing policy regarding reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the administrative judge referenced FAA Order 3330.30B, which provided that failed ATCS developmentals could be assigned to other positions within the agency. That order, established in 1971, was cancelled and replaced by FAA Order 3330.30C, dated September 27, 1984. FAA Order 3330.30C provides that the basic premise of the 1971 order remains, i.e., "failure to progress successfully in the training program may be the basis for separation from the occupation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at paragraph 5. FAA Order 3330.30C also expressly provides that exceptions to separation from the ATCS occupation are permitted for developmentals who show potential for work at the full-performance level in different facilities if general criteria are met. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at paragraph 8(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The general criteria for a position change include a recommendation by the manager of the "losing facility" and a suitable available vacancy. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at paragraph 8(c)(1). The record simply contains no recommendation by the manager of the losing facility. Although the administrative judge found it significant that the appellant's training supervisor recommended (to the Facility Manager) that the appellant be considered for reassignment, we find that this recommendation did not constitute the requisite recommendation by a facility manager. More importantly, there was no obligation by the agency to find another job for the appellant. Consequently, we need not reach the question of whether there was a suitable available vacancy since there was no requirement that the agency find another job for failed developmentals such as the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>, 864 F.2d at 1581. In the absence of any duty to find alternative employment for an employee who has failed an "up-or-out" training program, we find that the Board may not mitigate the agency's removal penalty....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Although it suggested that failure to properly train an employee is a mitigating factor rather than a prohibited personnel practice action under 5 USC 2302(b)(11) [now 2302(b)(12)], the Board determined in <span class="Italic">Wright v. FAA</span>, 40 MSPR 355, 363 (1989), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 900 F.2d 1541 (Fed. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">post</span>, that an allegation that an agency violated a merit system principle by ineffectively training an employee may be sustained if the appellant demonstrates that the agency abused its discretion by failing to allocate resources to provide additional or different training that would have provided the appellant with skills sufficient to pass developmental requirements. Regarding position changes, rather than removal, for air traffic controller trainees, the Board interpreted FAA Order 3330.30C, "Employment Program for Developmental Air Traffic Control Specialists," to mean:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]hat order provides that when an employee fails training, the only alternative to removal is, under certain limited circumstances, one position change, i.e., a reassignment or demotion to a less complex facility. This exception to separation is permitted for developmentals who do not progress to the full performance level, but who have <span id="Page_2516"></span>successfully completed enough of the training program to demonstrate that it would be beneficial for the agency to retain them in the program. All such position changes are contingent upon available vacancies, recommendation of the employee by the manager of the losing facility, indication of acceptance by the manager of the receiving facility, and voluntary acceptance by the employee. Therefore, in keeping with the unique nature of the agency's mission, penalties less severe than removal are not involuntarily imposed....&#8197;[T]he agency offered appellant two positions at lower level facilities, both of which she declined. We find, therefore, that the agency did meet its burden of showing that removal was, in this case, a reasonable penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal the Federal Circuit reversed the result in <span class="Italic">Wright</span>, concluding in <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 900 F.2d 1541, 1545 (Fed. Cir. 1990), that the Board improperly analyzed the case of FAA's self-imposed obligation to employees undergoing training. Ms. Wright had not received proper training in one phase of air traffic control work. The implication was that successful training at the lower rung of the training ladder was necessary for successful completion of the training step that she failed. The court determined that the agency had the burden of showing that it offered the necessary training to the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that the trainee had the burden to establish that "had she received all eight problems in Phase VIII, she <span class="Italic">would have passed</span> Phase XI."...&#8197;Not only did the Board set up an impossible standard for Wright to meet, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, to show she "would have passed," but also the Board committed an egregious error of law in misplacing the burden of proof....&#8197;[T]he agency bears the ultimate burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence throughout the case that the trainee was properly removed. No reason in law or logic warrants shifting the burden of proof (or persuasion) to the trainee to prove that, <span class="Italic">but for</span> the omitted training, he/she <span class="Italic">would</span> have passed to the next level. The agency set up the training requirements which, in its judgment, were a necessary foundation for achievement of successive levels of performance. In some instances, the burden of proof is properly shifted to a defendant with respect to matters peculiarly within his/her knowledge. However, the proof of the significance of specified training is a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of the FAA, not the trainee. Having specified that a prescribed course of instruction is necessary, the agency is hard pressed to say, in a removal proceeding, that all of the training is not necessary. We do not say that the FAA may not, in appropriate circumstances, urge that omitted training has no nexus to a trainee's failure, but we do hold that the FAA bears the burden of proof of that fact, not the trainee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having concluded that the Board erred as a matter of law in its placement of the burden of proof, nevertheless, we conclude that a remand for reconsideration by the Board on the merits under the proper standard is neither warranted nor necessary. The error in result here clearly rests on the legal error....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the FAA failed to establish that Phase VIII radar training had no nexus to Wright's failure at Phase XI. Accordingly, substantial evidence does not support that Wright's removal was for the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wright</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Grant v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 54 MSPR 285, 287 (1992) (removals were reversed because the agency failed to prove that instructors properly monitored the appellants). <span class="Italic">LeBlanc v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 60 MSPR 405, 414-15 (1994), analyzed an appellant's progress through air traffic control developmental training:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases involving the removal of an employee for failing to complete the requirements of an "up or out" training program such as the National En Route Training Program at issue in this appeal, the agency makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case for removal by showing that the developmental ATC "received the established training course and failed." If the agency did not provide all of the required training, it must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the omitted training bears no nexus to the developmental ATC's failure of the program. The ultimate burden of proof remains on the agency to show that it properly removed the developmental ATC. In other words, an appellant is not required to show that, but for the omitted training, he would have passed and moved on to the next phase of the training.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 64 MSPR 298, 301-02, 303-04 (1994), evaluated the burdens of proof in cases involving removal for failure to complete air traffic control training, and the associated defense of inadequate or omitted training:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held in the context of the ATCS training program that, if the agency fails to provide a trainee all of the required training, it must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the omitted training bears no nexus to the trainee's failure of the program. <span class="Italic">LeBlanc v. Department of Transportation</span>, 60 MSPR 405, 414 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also Wright v. Department of Transportation</span>, 900 F.2d 1541, 1545 (Fed. Cir. 1990). The appellant reasserts on review that the agency violated its training instructions by assigning him at least twenty on-the-job training instructors (OJTIs) during Phase XI of his training and that the violation had a nexus to his training failure. The specific agency training instruction that the agency allegedly violated states that "[n]o more than three additional OJTIs should be assigned to a developmental [ATCS] for a given position of operation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The training instruction set forth above limits the number of additional OJTIs that <span class="Italic">"should</span> be assigned" (emphasis supplied), but does not set an absolute upper limit on the number of additional OJTIs that may be assigned. "Should" is generally understood to denote a permissive act that involves the exercise of discretion....&#8197;Thus, the agency was not required to assign the appellant no more than three additional OJTIs. Accordingly, we find that, contrary to the appellant's assertions, the agency did not violate this training instruction by assigning the appellant at least twenty OJTIs<span class="Italic">. See LeBlanc</span>, 60 MSPR at 415-16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also reasserts on review that the agency erred by failing to designate a primary OJTI during Phase XI of his training. The agency's training instructions state that a developmental ATCS's first-level supervisor <span class="Italic">"shall...</span>[a] ssign one primary OJTI per developmental [ATCS] who should provide a large portion of the developmental's [on-the-job training] on the position involved." "Shall" is generally understood to denote a mandatory action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge shall make a reasoned finding regarding whether the appellant was assigned a primary OJTI under the agency's training instructions after Grebenschioff departed. In making this finding, the administrative judge shall consider the evidence set forth above, as well as any additional evidence he finds relevant. If the administrative judge finds that the agency failed to meet its burden of showing that the appellant received all of the required training, including the assignment of a primary OJTI, he shall determine whether the agency proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the omission had no nexus to the appellant's Phase XI training failure. <span class="Italic">See Wright</span>, 900 F.2d at 1545; <span class="Italic">LeBlanc</span>, 60 MSPR at 414, 416-17. If the administrative judge finds that the appellant did not receive all of the required training and also finds that the agency failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence and argument that the omission had no nexus to the appellant's Phase XI training failure, the administrative judge shall order the agency to cancel the removal action....</p>

"In cases involving the removal of an employee for failing to complete the requirements of an 'up or out' training program...the agency makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case for removal by showing that the developmental ATC 'received the established training course and failed.'" <span class="Italic">LeBlanc v.

The agency bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that any omitted training, including any failure to adhere to its training instructions, bears no nexus to the employee's failure of the training regimen. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Moore v. Department of Transportation</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 298, 302-03 (1994) (remanding for an assessment of whether the agency failed to assign an employee a primary on-the-job instructor as required by its training instructions). As with all chapter 75 removals, the ultimate burden of proof rests with the agency to show that it properly removed the developmental ATCS. <span class="Italic">LeBlanc</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 414.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both before the administrative judge and on review, the appellant has only offered generic statements that the agency failed to comply with its training program. Upon review of the record, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that it complied with its training program which requires, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the assignment of on-the-job training instructors and 160 hours of training for a developmental ATCS such as the appellant. As the administrative judge found, the appellant was assigned the required instructors during his training period and received the requisite number of training hours prior to the cessation of his training.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant suggests that he should have been granted additional time to complete the training program before being removed. Nothing in the agency's training program, however, requires the agency to offer the appellant additional time to complete his training; the agency's training instructions make clear that additional on-the-job training hours are not guaranteed and that the agency "<span class="Italic">may</span> assign additional OTJ [on-the-job] hours in cases where there is an expectation that certification will be accomplished within the additional period." In <span class="Italic">Moore</span>, the Board held that an agency's failure to abide by permissive training requirements, as opposed to mandatory ones, does not evidence the agency's failure to honor its training program or instructions. 64 M.S.P.R. at 301-02. The appellant's argument that the agency erred when it did not afford him additional, optional training hours is unsubstantiated. The appellant's remaining arguments on review--that he should have been shown leniency due to personal issues and that his prior service as an air traffic <span id="Page_2517"></span>controller outside of the agency should have been credited--also fail to establish a violation of the agency's training program or instructions which would warrant the reversal of his removal. <span class="Italic">See Moore</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 302-03.</p>
