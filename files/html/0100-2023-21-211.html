<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-211"><span class="space">C.</span> MEANING OF "RECOVERY"</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">To obtain restoration rights an employee must be able to return to work in some capacity. <span class="Italic">Woods v. USPS</span>, AT-0353-12-0684-I-1 (NP 3/7/2014) ("Here, the administrative judge found that the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs accepted a claim from the appellant in 1991, but the appellant failed to introduce any evidence concerning her current medical restrictions and, therefore, it was impossible to determine whether she is fully recovered, partially recovered, or not recovered at all. The appellant alleges on review that she is not required to show that she is either fully or partially recovered, but she is plainly mistaken. Because the threshold inquiry in any restoration case is whether the appellant is able to return to work in some capacity and the appellant here failed to show that she is currently able to work, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant failed to establish that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal."). <span class="Italic">Davis v. DOJ</span>, 61 MSPR 92, 96-99 (1994), provided definition to "recovery":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.303, "[a]n employee who was separated because of a compensable injury and whose recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date compensation began...is entitled to priority consideration for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of cessation of compensation." The term "recovery" is not specifically defined in 5 C.F.R. part 353. Section 353.303 provides, however, that the right to priority consideration is triggered by the "cessation of compensation," and section 353.102 defines "fully recovered" to mean that "compensation payments have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to perform all the duties of the position he left or an equivalent one." When these provisions are read together, along with the other provisions in part 353, it is apparent that "recovery" in section 353.303 refers to "full" rather than "partial" recovery from a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See Beltran v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 425, 429-30 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant maintained before the agency that he was a fully recovered individual entitled to priority consideration for restoration to his former Correctional Officer position. It is undisputed, however, that his OWCP compensation payments have not been terminated. We therefore agree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to show he was covered by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.303 as a fully recovered individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the appellant vaguely asserted for the first time that he might be a "partially recovered" individual under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304. This section requires agencies to "make every effort to restore, according to the circumstances in each case, an employee or former employee who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the term "partially recovered" is not defined in 5 C.F.R. part 353, it is defined in the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), ch. 353, subch. 2-2.e (Feb. 24, 1988), to mean that the individual, "though not yet able to resume the full range of his or her regular duties, has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements...." We find no basis for disagreeing with this definition in the FPM and will therefore defer to it. <span class="Italic">See generally Heinze v. Department of the Interior,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 375, 377-78, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 949 F.2d 375 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FPM's definition of a "partially recovered" individual is substantially similar to the OWCP's definition of an individual entitled to "partial disability" compensation, as one who is "unable to return to the position held at the time of injury (or to earn equivalent wages) but...is not totally disabled for all gainful employment...." 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.303(a). Unlike the definition of a "fully recovered" individual under section 353.102, however, the FPM's definition of a "partially recovered" individual is not necessarily linked to the corresponding determination of compensation eligibility by the OWCP. That is, a "partially recovered" individual is not necessarily one who is receiving partial disability compensation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the OWCP regulations and the restoration regulations indicates that this different treatment of fully recovered and partially recovered individuals may stem from the following factors. First, because a fully recovered individual, unlike a partially recovered individual, has a statutory right to mandatory restoration or priority consideration for restoration to his former or an equivalent position, such a statutory right should be based on a determination of full recovery by the OWCP, which has the statutory authority and the expertise to make such a determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8145, 8151(b); 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.2(a). Second, once an injured individual has sufficiently recovered to be able to perform job duties in some capacity, he and the employing agency are encouraged to cooperate in his return to suitable work as soon as practicable, without awaiting OWCP's potentially time-consuming determination of his compensation status. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 10.123, 10.124. Finally, the OWCP's determination of an individual's partial disability status may be facilitated by the individual's return to suitable work because the OWCP may then rely on his actual earnings to determine his wage-earning capacity--which in turn determines his partial disability compensation rate--rather than having to evaluate various other factors to determine his potential wage-earning capacity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.303.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the reasons discussed above, we conclude that an individual's current receipt of partial disability compensation would generally suffice to establish that he is a "partially recovered" individual under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304. We conclude further, however, that an individual's continued receipt of total disability compensation, as here, does not necessarily preclude his coverage under section 353.304.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we disagree with the administrative judge's finding that, "upon learning that [the] appellant was not fully recovered, it was the agency's obligation under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304 (1993) to determine the extent of his recovery and treat his request as one of a partially recovered employee...." We find no basis in the applicable statute, regulations, or case law for imposing such an obligation on the agency under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 16 M.S.P.R. 578 (1983), and <span class="Italic">Rivers v. Department of the Navy,</span> 7 M.S.P.R. 4 (1981), in finding that the agency should have treated the appellant as a partially recovered individual under the circumstances. In <span class="Italic">Montgomery,</span> the Board held that an individual whose compensation has been terminated, on the basis that he was capable of performing all of the duties of his former or <span id="Page_4462"></span>an equivalent position, is a fully recovered individual covered by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.303 (formerly section 353.307), even if he alleges that he is only partially recovered. 16 M.S.P.R. at 580-81. The Board reasoned that, since the only criterion for establishing full recovery for purposes of section 353.303 was that the individual's compensation be terminated on the appropriate basis, the appellant was a fully recovered individual despite his assertion of merely partial recovery. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This rationale is inapplicable here because, as discussed above, the criterion for establishing partial recovery for purposes of section 353.304 is that the individual be unable to resume the full range of his former regular duties but able to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements. The appellant has submitted no evidence whatsoever to satisfy this criterion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Rivers,</span> the Board found that the agency should have treated the appellant's request for reassignment in lieu of disability retirement as a request for restoration after a compensable injury, where no disability retirement application was pending but the OWCP had granted him compensation. 7 M.S.P.R. at 7. The evidence in <span class="Italic">Rivers</span> thus showed that the appellant was obviously mischaracterizing his restoration claim. The evidence in this appeal, however, does not show that the appellant was mischaracterizing his restoration claim. The evidence shows instead that the appellant was simply not covered by the restoration regulations. We therefore find that <span class="Italic">Montgomery</span> and <span class="Italic">Rivers</span> do not support the administrative judge's finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant has not shown that he was a "fully recovered" or "partially recovered" individual under 5 C.F.R. part 353.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dean v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 56, 58-60 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11, 2010 MSPB 187 (2010), added to the definition of "fully recovered":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under regulations issued by Office of Personnel Management (OPM), an employee's right to file a restoration appeal with the Board differs depending on the extent and timing of his recovery from his compensable injury. <span class="Italic">Smith v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 92, &#x00B6; 7 (1999); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b). An employee who fully recovers from his compensable injury more than 1 year after eligibility for compensation begins may appeal to the Board the agency's failure to afford him priority reconsideration in reemployment. <span class="Italic">McFarlane v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 126, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15, 20 (2008); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 302.501, 353.304(b). An employee who partially recovers from his compensable injury, or who is "physically disqualified"[3] and requests restoration more than 1 year after eligibility for compensation begins, may appeal to the Board "for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.301(c)-(d), 353.304(c); <span class="Italic">see Bynum v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6; 8 (2009),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> No. 20103055, 2010 WL 2600805 (Fed. Cir. June 14, 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3] Physically disqualified" means that for medical reasons, the employee is unable to perform the duties of his former position or an equivalent one, or there is a medical reason to restrict the employee from some or all essential duties due to possible incapacitation or risk of health impairment, and the condition is considered permanent with little likelihood for improvement or recovery. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge erred in analyzing this case as one involving an employee fully recovered after 1 year. Under OPM's regulations, "Fully recovered means compensation payments have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to perform all the duties of the position he or she left or an equivalent one." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. The appellant does not fit this definition because OWCP has not terminated his compensation payments. <span class="Italic">See Kravitz v. Department of the Navy,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 9 (2005) ("The requirement that OWCP first find an individual to be fully recovered is a prerequisite to a Board finding that an individual is fully recovered."), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Jinn v. Department of Justice,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 305 (2007), and <span class="Italic">Steinmetz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 277 (2007),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 283 F. App'x 805 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The record contains a letter issued by OWCP after the appellant filed the instant appeal, stating that the appellant continues to suffer from the condition that prevents him from returning to work in the Rochester P&#x0026;DC and his benefits "will continue on the same basis as in the past."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the record shows that the appellant has not fully recovered from his condition, the medical evidence does not indicate whether he is "partially recovered" or "physically disqualified," i.e., whether he is likely to recover fully from his condition in the future. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. Nevertheless, because the appellant first requested restoration more than 1 year after the date his eligibility for compensation began, he is entitled to the restoration rights accorded partially recovered individuals under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), <span class="Italic">see Kravitz v. Department of the Navy,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 483, &#x00B6; 5 (2007); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(c) (after 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation begins, a physically disqualified individual is entitled to the restoration rights accorded to individuals who fully or partially recover, as applicable). Therefore, no matter whether the appellant is partially recovered or physically disqualified, he may appeal to the Board only for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying him restoration.[4] <span class="Italic"> See Bynum,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6; 8;<span class="Italic"> Hankerson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 452, &#x00B6; 7 (2003); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Upon reemployment, a partially recovered employee may also appeal to the Board "the agency's failure to credit time spent on compensation for purposes of rights and benefits based on length of service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a). This basis for appeal is not implicated in the instant appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a claim that an employee is fully recovered, <span class="Italic">Kravitz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 98 MSPR 443, 447-48 &#x00B6; 9-10 (2005), noted that full recovery occurs when OWCP terminates benefits because of restoration of earnings capacity, not because the employee fails to comply with OWCP restrictions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For an individual to be considered fully recovered, OWCP payments must have been terminated on the basis that the individual is able to perform all of the duties he or she left, or the duties of an equivalent position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. The requirement that OWCP first find an individual to be fully recovered is a prerequisite to a Board finding that an individual is fully recovered. <span class="Italic">See id.; Carter v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 27 M.S.P.R. 252, 254-55 (1985) (OWCP benefits are terminated <span class="Italic">when an individual regains his or her earning capacity)</span> (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the AJ found, and our review of the record shows, that the appellant cannot be considered to be fully recovered under the definition in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. While it is true that the appellant now works in a shipboard position, his OWCP payments were not terminated because he established that he was able to perform all of the duties of his previous position. Instead, OWCP terminated his benefits because he dropped out of its training program, failed to comply with its job search directives, and accepted a shipboard position contrary to medical restrictions. Further, he admits that, while his symptoms abated after he ceased to be exposed to Amaron paints and petroleum products, he is nevertheless still allergic to these substances. Likewise, Dr. McKenna did not clear the appellant for exposure to such substances during his most recent examination, and he limited the appellant's work conditions to shore-side damage control officer or on MSC ships other than tankers. The appellant thus cannot be considered to be fully recovered and the Board cannot exercise jurisdiction on that basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Paszko v. USPS</span>, 119 MSPR 207, 213-14 &#x00B6; 13, 2013 MSPB 14 (2013) ("On the other hand, it may be that OWCP ruled the job offer unsuitable because it depended on a daily determination of work without reaching the issue of whether the offer comported with the appellant's medical limitations. As noted in <span class="Italic">Dean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6; 21 (2010), the Department of Labor's regulations at 20 C.F.R. part 10, subpart F and OPM's regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 353, subpart C are related, but they are not entirely commensurate. The administrative judge may consider an OWCP determination as to the suitability of a work schedule in determining whether the job offer was tantamount to a denial of restoration. However, the Board is not bound by OWCP's ruling in this regard because the ultimate question of whether the job offer constituted a denial of restoration falls squarely within the Board's 'own statutory sphere of authority.' <span class="Italic">New</span>, 142 F.3d at 1264.").</p>
