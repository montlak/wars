<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-152"><span class="space">a.</span> Union Officials</h5>
<p class="noindent">An employee acting in an official capacity as a union official is entitled to greater latitude in speech and action. The protection extends to strong, vigorous representation and robust debate on behalf of the union. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Bath and AFGE Local 491</span>, 12 FLRA 552, 576 (1983) (ALJ Decision). Whether statutory protection exists only for employees or officers of the union, or whether other supportive or cooperative relationships lead to statutory protection, is an open question. In <span class="Italic">VAMC Jamaica Plain and FOP</span>, 50 FLRA 583 (1995), <span class="Italic">remanded </span>52 FLRA 724 (1996), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 51 FLRA 871 (1996) (resulting in a ULP order directing rescission of a suspension), FLRA remanded a case for further development of the relationship between the charging party and the employer who disciplined an employee for making critical statements and threatening the agency with adverse publicity, 50 FLRA at 588-89 n.3:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent asserted before the Judge that "a letter written on behalf of other than the exclusive representative" cannot be protected. In support of this assertion, the Respondent cited a statement in <span class="Italic">Long Beach</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Shipyard, Long Beach, California and Long Beach Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Station, Long Beach, California</span>, 25 FLRA 1002, 1005 (1987), that under the Statute agencies may discipline a union representative "for activities which are not specifically on behalf of the exclusive representative...." As that case involved activity on behalf of an exclusive representative, the quoted statement was <span class="Italic">dictum</span> and did not constitute a holding that activity on behalf of a labor organization that is not an exclusive representative can never be protected under section 7102. By its terms, that section refers to "labor organization" and not "exclusive representative." Moreover, the Authority has found in some cases that activity on behalf of a labor organization that is a rival to the incumbent exclusive representative is protected under section 7102. <span class="Italic">E.g., Internal Revenue Service, North Atlantic Service</span> <span class="Italic">Center</span>, 7 FLRA 596 (1982) (distribution of union literature on behalf of a rival of the incumbent exclusive representative in the employee cafeteria during non-work time is protected under section 7102 of the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee's right to engage in protected activity permits leeway for impulsive behavior, balanced against the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff on the jobsite. To remove the conduct from the ambit of protected activity, the employee must have engaged in flagrant misconduct. The same protection extends to union representatives and employees who participate in grievance proceedings. The statement, "take the job and shove it," was not flagrant misconduct. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 6 FLRA 96, 106 (1981) (ALJ Decision). Inclusion of insulting and derogatory references to management officials in specific complaints does not remove union literature from the protection of the Statute; a different result might occur with literature stating only general insults to management without reference to or connection with working conditions or practices. <span class="Italic">IRS, N. Atl. Serv. Ctr. and NTEU, NTEU Local 69</span>, 7 FLRA 596, 603-04 (1982) (ALJ Decision). One decision reviewed the award of an arbitrator who distinguished false or malicious <span id="Page_1372"></span>statements about a supervisor from statements that were reasonably believed by the grievant to be true. <span class="Italic">See Dept. of Army, Norfolk Dist. and NFFE Local 1028</span>, 59 FLRA 906, 908 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Grissom AFB and AFGE</span>, 51 FLRA 7 (1995), <span class="Italic">post,</span> provided a multifactor analysis for assessing whether speech of union officials constitutes unprotected "flagrant misconduct":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employee's outburst was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the outburst was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language and conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">Loud speech was within the zone of protected conduct by a union official who, requested to attend an investigatory inquiry, ordered the employee being questioned to leave the room and not answer questions.

<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator Erred in Finding that the Grievant was not Acting in Her Official Capacity as a Union Representative when she Interrupted the Investigative Hearing.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Statute, a union official acting in a representative capacity may not be disciplined for actions taken in performing representative duties unless such actions exceeded the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Aerospace Maint. &#x0026; Regeneration Ctr, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz., </span>58 FLRA 636, 636 (2003). In determining whether an employee has engaged in conduct that exceeds the bounds of protection, the Authority balances the employee's right to engage in protected activity, which "permits leeway for impulsive behavior,...against the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff on the jobsite." <span class="Italic">Grissom, </span>51 FLRA at 11-12. Relevant factors in striking this balance include: (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employee's outburst was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the outburst was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language and conduct. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 12. The foregoing factors need not be cited or applied in any particular way. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union disputes the Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievant was not acting in a representative role when she interrupted the investigative hearing. The Arbitrator reached this conclusion because she found that the grievant was not presenting a grievance, and the witness whom the grievant was attempting to represent was not entitled to representation at the hearing. However, these facts do not demonstrate that, as a matter of law, the grievant was not acting in her official capacity as a Union representative. In this connection, the Statute does not limit the Union's right to be represented to only grievance proceedings. Moreover, the Statute expressly permits Union representation at "any examination of an employee in the unit...in connection with an investigation[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B).[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">An exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at...any examination of an employee in the unit by a representative of the agency in connection with an investigation if (i) the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee; and (ii) the employee requests representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is no dispute that the grievant, who was on 100 percent official time, was attempting to exercise her right to represent the witness at the investigative hearing because the witness originally had requested Union representation. The Arbitrator found that, at the hearing, the witness testified that she did not believe the examination would result in disciplinary action taken against her, and signed a waiver of her right to representation. However, the Arbitrator did not find, and there is no contention, that the grievant was aware of anything other than the witness' request for representation. In any event, it is undisputed that the grievant was attempting to exercise her right to attend the hearing as a Union representative. As such, the grievant was acting in her official role as a Union representative. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fed. Bureau of Prisons Office of Internal Affairs, Wash., D.C., </span>53 FLRA 1500, 1518-20 (1998) (union official's presence at counseling meeting protected).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the grievant was not acting in her official capacity as a Union representative when she interrupted the investigative hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Grievant's Conduct at the Investigative Hearing was Protected.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the grievant's conduct was not protected. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exceptions at 8 (<span class="Italic">citing Grissom</span>). Although the Arbitrator did not specifically address the <span class="Italic">Grissom</span> factors, the record shows, for the following reasons, that three of the four factors weigh in favor of the grievant's conduct being protected. With respect to the first factor, the record shows that the conduct took place in a room where an investigative hearing was taking place, and a bargaining-unit employee who had requested Union representation was testifying. There is no indication in the record as to how many people, other than the witness and the three board members that were conducting the hearing, were present in the hearing. However, there is no contention that the grievant's conduct interrupted the work of other employees. <span class="Italic">See Grissom</span>, 51 FLRA at 12 (the fact that an employee's conduct did not occur in a public area was a factor in finding that the conduct did not constitute flagrant misconduct). Moreover, the record shows that the investigative hearing, although delayed for an hour, ultimately was held with the witness testifying as originally planned. There is no claim that the delay negatively affected the Agency's operations, such that the grievant's actions would lose protection under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Cf. Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr. Birmingham, Ala., </span>35 FLRA 553, 560-61 (1990) (union representative properly subject to discipline for remaining on phone call to discuss union business after having been ordered to work on a life threatening emergency situation). As to the second <span class="Italic">Grissom</span> factor, there is no basis for finding that the grievant's conduct was designed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the fourth <span class="Italic">Grissom</span> factor--the nature of the intemperate language and conduct--the record shows that the grievant entered the hearing room and ordered the witness several times in a loud voice to "[g]et out[,]" to "[l]eave the room[,]" and to "not...testify. Under Authority precedent, as well as National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) precedent, using a loud tone of voice does not, in and of itself, exceed the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Grissom, </span>51 FLRA at 12 (loud use of profanity towards agency negotiator protected); <span class="Italic">Severance Tool Indus., </span>301 NLRB 1166, 1170 (1991), <span class="Italic">affd</span> 953 F.2d 1384 (6th Cir. 1992) (calling company president a profane name in a loud voice protected). In addition, the particular comments that the grievant made to the witness to leave the room and to not testify were not as extreme as other comments and conduct that the Authority has found to be protected, consistent with its precedent permitting union officials to use intemperate, abusive, or insulting language when performing representation duties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Agric., Food Safety &#x0026; Inspection Serv., Wash., D.C., </span>55 FLRA 875, 880-81 (1999) (calling supervisor "a little shithead" protected); <span class="Italic">Air Force Flight Test Ctr., Edwards Air Force Base, Cal., </span>53 FLRA 1455, 1456 (1998) (union representative leaning over a supervisor's desk and pointing finger at supervisor while engaged in protected activity was not "beyond the limits of acceptable behavior"). The grievant's conduct also is unlike other conduct that the Authority has found to be unprotected such as racially inflammatory comments and physical contact. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Veterans Admin., Wash., D.C. &#x0026; Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Cincinnati, Ohio, </span>26 FLRA 114 (1987) (upholding discipline of union official for using racially inflammatory comments in a union newspaper), <span class="Italic">aff 'd sub nom. AFGE, AFL-CIO Local 2031 v. FLRA,</span> 878 F.2d 460 (D.C. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, U.S. Marshals Serv. &#x0026; U.S. Marshals Serv., Dist. of NJ,</span> 26 FLRA 890, 890, 901 (1987) (finding that a physical response by union or management representatives in the context of labor-management relations would be beyond the limits of acceptable behavior). Here, there is no evidence that the grievant engaged in any such behavior.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;With respect to the third <span class="Italic">Grissom</span> factor, it is unclear from the record whether the grievant's comments were provoked by the employer. However, because the other three factors weigh in favor of protection, it is not necessary for the Authority to reach this factor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Arbitrator erred in concluding that the grievant's interruption of the investigative hearing was not protected activity and set aside the award to the extent it sustains the disciplinary action against the grievant for this conduct.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The dissent asserts that the statutory protection permitting "a union official, acting in a representative capacity, to speak plainly (and even discourteously) to management simply does not apply when a union official is communicating with a nonmanagement co-worker." As an initial matter, in issuing the challenged suspension, the Agency emphasized the grievant's disruption of the hearing, rather than the fact that her statements and conduct involved a "co-worker" as such. <span class="Italic">See</span> Suspension at 2 ("Disrupting a legitimate investigation and forcefully removing an employee from the process is a serious offense and will not be tolerated.") Moreover, nothing in the decisions cited by the dissent indicate that statements that would be protected when made to a management official would become unprotected when made to a co-worker. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat'l Ass 'n of Letter Carriers v. Austin, </span>418 U.S. 264, 276-79, 282 (1974) (allegedly defamatory statements about co-workers protected). In fact, the National Labor Relations Board has held that employees' protected concerted activity did not lose its statutory protection where the employees directed mocking, profane language toward a co-worker. <span class="Italic">See Morton Int'l, Inc., </span>315 NLRB 564, 567 (1994) (employees' written insults on a coworker's memo--including characterizing the co-worker as "chicken shit"--protected). Finally, the Merit Systems Protection <span id="Page_1373"></span>Board decisions cited by the dissent are inapposite because they do not involve employees who were engaged in statutorily protected activities when they allegedly committed acts of misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Bailey v. DOD,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 59 (2002); <span class="Italic">Kirkland-Zuck v. HUD, </span>90 M.S.P.R. 12, 19 (2001); <span class="Italic">Murphy v.

By relying on them, the dissent implies that the existence of statutorily protected activity is irrelevant. It is not.</p>
<p class="noindent">Member Beck, dissenting in <span class="Italic">VAMC Richmond,</span> argued that there was a distinction between loud remarks by a union representative toward a manager and the same level of remarks to a unit member, <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 669:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I agree with my colleagues that the Union president was acting in her official role as a Union representative when she arrived at the investigative hearing.&#x2003;I do not agree, however, that the Union president's conduct after she arrived--disrupting the investigative meeting by ordering her co-worker "in a loud voice" to "leave the room" and, when the co-worker did not comply, "scream[ing]" at her repeatedly to "get out" is protected by our Statute. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, Wash., D.C., </span>64 FLRA 410, 417 (2010) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Screaming at a co-worker generally constitutes actionable misconduct. <span class="Italic">Bailey v.

<p class="noindent-1">It has long been acknowledged in the law of labor relations that dealings between union representatives and management representatives can sometimes become "heated affairs" where emotions run high. <span class="Italic">Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat'l Ass 'n of letter Carriers v. Austin, </span>418 U.S. 264, 276-77 (1974) (<span class="Italic">citing Linn v. United Plant Guard Workers of Am., Local 114, </span>383 U.S. 53, 58 (1966)). In such circumstances--where union representatives are acting as equal parties in a bargaining relationship rather than as employees carrying out duties on behalf of the employer--union representatives are not required to act in complete conformity with the typical norms of the workplace such as, for example, the duty of loyalty or scrupulous respect toward supervisors. <span class="Italic">FAA, </span>64 FLRA at 417-18 (citing<span class="Italic"> Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat'l Ass 'n of Letter Carriers v. Austin, </span>418 U.S. 264, 276-77 (1974); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force v. FLRA, </span>294 F.3d 192, 201 (D.C. Cir. 2002)) (<span class="Italic">citing Adtranz ABB Daimler-Benz Transp. v. NLRB, </span>253 F.3d 19, 27-28 (D.C. Cir. 2001)). However, the latitude that a union representative enjoys when dealing with management does not constitute a license to subject a non-management co-worker to uninvited verbal abuse, as was the case here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rationale that permits a union official, acting in a representative capacity, to speak plainly (and even discourteously) to management simply does not apply when a union official is communicating with a nonmanagement co-worker. Accordingly, I conclude that the Arbitrator was correct in finding that the conduct was not protected.</p>
<p class="noindent">Vulgarity by a union official during a meeting with management over a grievance was not flagrant misconduct. Management representatives occasionally used equally vulgar language in the presence of their employees. The references by the union official to the management representative during the grievance meeting as racist, sexist, and ageist, although inherently inflammatory, were related to the grievant's concerns that her supervisor was discriminating against her. Although indelicate and intemperate language in the conduct of labor-management relations is not condoned, the statements representing views concerning the merits of a grievance were not flagrant misconduct. A letter of reprimand based on those statements was a ULP--interference with protected rights in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1). <span class="Italic">DHUD, San Francisco Area Office and NFFE Local 1450</span>, 4 FLRA 460, 466 (1980) (ALJ Decision). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Indian Affairs, Isleta Elementary Sch. and IEF</span>, 54 FLRA 1428 (1998) (union representative's business card did not contain unprotected language; critical words were directed to union representative (who characterized himself as a "son of a bitch"); symbol on card was not known to union official to be of such significance that its use on card would be offensive to representative of agency's client, to whom card was given by agency representative).</p>
<p class="noindent">One graphic case of protected speech is <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Grissom AFB and AFGE</span>, 51 FLRA 7, 24 (1995). FLRA determined that management improperly suspended a union official who used vulgar language toward a management representative after the union representative was angered by what he thought was an unjustified change in management's negotiating tactics. FLRA's ALJ described the situation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The use of the "f" word, as with other profane words, standing alone, does not constitute flagrant misconduct. Negotiations are not Sunday School exercises; nevertheless, vicious, vulgar, personal attacks of a highly sexual nature during negotiations is not protected activity. Messrs. Hartig and Smith combined in a vicious, uncouth, rude, vulgar and profane personal attack on Ms. Sula Smith. Mr. Hartig's voice was loud, his face red and his manner threatening when he shouted, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "We're going to shove this up your a--," and, "...the FLRA will shove this up your a--"; when Ms. Smith said that language was not appropriate, Mr. Hartig shouted in reply, "I don't give a f-- what you think." Mr. Smith joined in and said loudly, "you can't be that f-- stupid, lady"; and then yelled, "I always knew you was stupid, I knew you was god damn stupid" or "I always thought you were stupid and now I know it." Then, outside as they were leaving, Mr. Hartig told Ms. Smith, "You can suck my d--." Their language constituted flagrant misconduct; was not protected conduct; and both Mr. Hartig and Mr. Smith were disciplined for their flagrant misconduct....</p>
<p class="noindent">The language was protected, 51 FLRA at 11-13:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7102 of the Statute guarantees employees the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from such activity, without fear of penalty or reprisal. <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 44 FLRA 1402. A union representative has the right to use "'intemperate, abusive, or insulting language without fear of restraint or penalty'" if he or she believes such rhetoric to be an effective means to make the union's point. <span class="Italic">Naval Facilities Engineering Command</span>, 45 FLRA at 155 (quoting <span class="Italic">Old Dominion Branch No. 46, National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO v. Austin</span>, 418 U.S. 264, 283 (1984)). Consistent with section 7102, however, an agency has the right to discipline an employee who is engaged in otherwise protected activity for remarks or actions that "'exceed the boundaries of protected activity such as flagrant misconduct.'" <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916, AFL-CIO</span>, 34 FLRA 385, 389 (1990) (citation omitted) (<span class="Italic">Tinker AFB</span>).

<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether an employee has engaged in flagrant misconduct, the Authority balances the employee's right to engage in protected activity, which "permits leeway for impulsive behavior,...against the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff on the jobsite." <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency</span> <span class="Italic">Aerospace Center, St. Louis, Missouri</span>, 17 FLRA 71, 80 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, <span class="Italic">Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington</span>, 2 FLRA 54, 55 (1979) (<span class="Italic">Puget Sound)</span>). Relevant factors in striking this balance include: (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employee's outburst was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the outburst was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language and conduct. <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 17 FLRA at 80-81 (1985) (Authority adopted Judge's decision which noted the foregoing factors to be considered in determining whether an action constitutes flagrant misconduct). However, the foregoing factors need not be cited or applied in any particular way in determining whether an action constitutes flagrant misconduct. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2693</span>, 50 FLRA 212, 217-18 (1995) (Authority denied agency's exceptions contending that an arbitration award was contrary to law because the arbitrator did not apply all of the <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span> factors in determining that the grievant's language did not constitute flagrant misconduct).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, there is no contention that the remarks were made in front of other employees on the job site or that they disrupted the work of the unit. Moreover, it is undisputed that Smith's language was impulsive rather than designed. Although the extent to which Smith's comments were "provoked" by the Respondent's conduct is not clear, the record shows that the comments were made in reaction to a letter from the Respondent canceling certain previously agreed-upon negotiations about which the union had received no prior notification. In addition, while the remarks made by Smith were offensive and should not be condoned, when examined as a whole and in context, they were not of such an outrageous and insubordinate nature as to remove them from the protection of the Statute. In this regard, Smith's remarks are similar to remarks found not to constitute flagrant misconduct in other cases. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 44 FLRA at 1402 (grievant calling a supervisor an "asshole" and a "space cadet" did not constitute flagrant misconduct). <span class="Italic">Cf.

<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, and on the Statute, prior precedent compels us to find that Smith's remarks did not constitute flagrant misconduct. Therefore, the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (2) by disciplining Smith, based, in part, on those remarks....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Judge applied the <span class="Italic">Grissom </span>factors to conclude that the Shop Chairman's filing of the incident report was flagrant misconduct. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that, based on the record as a whole, the filing of the incident report did not constitute flagrant misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first factor--place and subject matter of the discussion--the Judge determined that the Shop Chairman was entitled to file an incident report concerning a threat or act of violence that appears to involve an imminent risk to physical safety. This finding supports a conclusion that the filing of the incident report was not flagrant misconduct. In addition, the facts that the allegations related to a labor relations matter rather than a personal matter, were not publicly made, and were confined to appropriate officials and witnesses, weighs against finding flagrant misconduct<span class="Italic">. See DLA, </span>50 FLRA at 216 (complaint not publicly announced); <span class="Italic">Air Force, </span>46 FLRA at 996-997 (letter not published); <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>7 FLRA at 603-604 (name calling as part of labor dispute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the second factor--whether the employee's outburst was impulsive or designed--the General Counsel disputes the Judge's determination that the preparation of the incident report was not impulsive. It is clear, in this regard, that the filing of the report was not a spontaneous occurrence; the incident report was not filed for nearly an hour after the incident and it is a written document that, by its nature, required consideration and preparation. However, it is also clear that the filing of the report was the culmination of an emotional, 4-hour dispute over the confiscation of the Union's computer disk containing a brief to be filed in a pending grievance. While an hour is not an insignificant period of time, the particular hour preceding the filing in this case was spent by the Shop Chairman discussing and recounting the confrontation with both Agency and Union officials. As such, it is reasonable to conclude that, even though an hour had elapsed, the Shop Chairman was not acting dispassionately in filing the report. That is, while the filing of the incident report was not purely impulsive, neither was its preparation so removed from the context of a heated labor-management dispute as to be intentionally designed. Thus, we find that this factor neither supports nor undermines a finding of flagrant misconduct. We note that, even if the filing of the report was not impulsive, that fact alone does not remove the filing of the report from protection under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See DLA,</span> 50 FLRA at 216.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the third factor--whether the outburst was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct--the Judge acknowledged that the Director's refusal to permit a Union representative to be present at the scanning of the disk resulted in the conduct which brought about the filing of the incident report. However, the Judge determined that the false and inflammatory statements made in the incident report were not a response to the provocation in this instance. While the Judge's finding that the particular disputed statements in the incident report were not provoked by the Respondent is supported by the record, the fact remains that the Respondent's actions in revoking access to the facility for the former employee to prepare the brief, confiscating the computer disk, and refusing to permit the Union officials to observe the scanning of the disk, provoked the overall dispute resulting in the filing of the incident report. Insofar as the Shop Chairman's filing of the incident report was the culmination of this heated dispute, it was provoked, at least in part, by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the fourth factor--the nature of the intemperate language and conduct--the Judge found that the assertions in the incident report were false and made with the intent to cause injury to the Director's reputation. These findings, which focus on the Shop Chairman's <span class="Italic">motivation </span>for filing the incident report and the <span class="Italic">accuracy </span>of the statements therein, are supported by the record. However, with one exception, the Judge did not apply the fourth factor with respect to the actual <span class="Italic">wording</span> used in the incident report. In this regard, the incident report is comprised in the main of allegations regarding the Director's actions during the incident, specifically allegations that the Director: (1) was violently waving his arms around in a threatening manner while yelling, and (2) rushed towards [the Union Chief Steward] yelling and waving his hands in an irrational and violent manner. The incident report characterizes the Director's behavior as violent and intimidating. These statements, while intemperate, are not unlike other statements that have been found protected and, standing alone, would not support a finding that the filing of the incident report constituted flagrant misconduct.<span class="Italic"> See DLA</span>, 50 FLRA at 216.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statements regarding the Director's alleged actions do not stand alone, however. In addition to those statements, the Shop Chairman included in the incident report the following statement, on which the Judge relied in finding that the filing of the incident report constituted flagrant misconduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We did not stay in the area because we were afraid [the Director] would become violent himself or have one of the persons in the area that carry a pistol shoot us.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge's findings that neither the Director nor anyone else in the vicinity of the incident was armed, and that the Shop Chairman was aware of that fact, are uncontested. As such, the Judge's conclusion that the statement was an affront to [the Director's] character and to his professional reputation and standing appears clearly correct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Inclusion in the incident report of the statement that the Shop Chairman was fearful about possible violence by the Director clouds an otherwise clear determination that flagrant misconduct did not occur.&#x2003;However, there is no contention that the incident report was publicly distributed or that the statement regarding the Shop Chairman's fear was widely known. Further, there is no contention that the statement affected the Respondent's ability to maintain discipline. The expression of fear also was merely a small part--one clause in one sentence--of a document that otherwise would be protected, and the statement was made in the context of an ongoing, heated series of confrontations. While the incident report may not have been filed impulsively, the fact that it was the product of an emotional and heated dispute supports a finding that it was also not filed in a deliberate or thoughtful manner....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In striking a balance between the statutory right of the Shop Chairman to engage in protected activity, on the one hand, and the Respondent's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff on the other, we conclude that the scale here tips--however slightly--against a finding of flagrant misconduct. As such, we find that the Judge erred in concluding that the conduct constituted flagrant misconduct and modify the Order to provide the Shop Chairman back pay for the entire five-day suspension....</p>
<p class="noindent">Finger pointing in the context of a discussion over official time was not encouraged, but it was not condemned as flagrant misconduct, <span class="Italic">Air Force Flight Test Ctr., Edwards AFB and AFGE Local 1406</span>, 53 FLRA 1455, 1456 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Judge's conclusion, for the reasons he stated, that the employee's behavior during the meeting with his supervisor did not constitute flagrant misconduct. We specifically reject the Respondent's characterization of the employee's conduct as "aggressively belligerent" in the circumstances presented. In so concluding, we find that the record supports the Judge's findings...regarding the employee's behavior during the meeting. In particular, the Judge found that the meeting lasted about 15 minutes; that most of the meeting consisted of conversation between the employee and the supervisor; and that only as the meeting ended did the employee lean over the supervisor's desk and point his finger at the supervisor. Although we do not condone such conduct, in our view it is not the type of unprovoked physical response in a labor-management dispute which the Authority has previously deemed <span id="Page_1375"></span>"beyond the limits of acceptable behavior." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Marshals Service and U.S. Marshals Service, District of New</span> <span class="Italic">Jersey</span>, 26 FLRA 890, 901 (1987). <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Labor, Employment and Training Administration</span>, 20 FLRA 568 (1985).</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOD, DLA and AFGE Local 2693</span>, 50 FLRA 212, 219 (1995), reviewing an arbitration award, provided a synopsis of the law governing union speech in the context of a letter to unit employees sent by the union president through the inter-office mail system. The letter stated the writer's opinion that various supervisors were liars, but the speech was protected. The writer said in the letter:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I have found both [first supervisor] and [second supervisor] to be somewhat less than honest or forthright in our meetings. In fact, [first supervisor] appears to derive a perverse pleasure from lying. The more flagrant and bare faced the lie, the more he appears to enjoy it. I have found both him and [second supervisor] to be overbearing and abusive in the treatment of their subordinates on a <span class="Italic">regular basis</span>. It is the quintessential and classic case of <span class="Italic">"management by</span> <span class="Italic">fear."</span> If anyone doubted TQM was dead, then based on their comportment, there should be no longer any doubt. The problem with liars is that they alter and fabricate "facts" and this precludes all possibility of reaching the truth and achieving a modicum of justice in any attempt at resolving disputes. Working as a team they represent a tremendous threat for the law requires a two level concurrence in any adverse action and, when two consecutive line supervisors as venal and malevolent as these two lie and scheme in concert, then just about any subordinate <span class="Italic">who does not take proper precautions</span> becomes fair game. (Emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA opined, <span class="Italic">DLA</span>, 50 FLRA at 215-16:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with section 7102 of the Statute, an employer has the right to discipline a union representative who is engaged in otherwise protected activities for actions which "exceed the boundaries of protected activity such as flagrant misconduct." <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916, AFL-CIO</span>, 34 FLRA 385, 389 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Tinker</span>). Only those remarks or actions which are of such an "outrageous and insubordinate nature" so as to remove them from the protection of the Statute constitute flagrant misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 390.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator erred in concluding that the grievant's statements were protected by the Statute. The Agency relies, in this regard, on <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency Aerospace</span> <span class="Italic">Center, St. Louis, Missouri</span>, 17 FLRA 71, 81 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Mapping Agency</span>), where the Authority adopted an Administrative Law Judge's decision which noted the following factors to be considered in determining whether an action constitutes flagrant misconduct: (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employees outburst was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the outburst was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language and conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the Judge in <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>, the balance between an employee's right to engage in protected activity and an employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff "must be struck in each case with an eye to the special facts presented by it." 17 FLRA at 81. The factors outlined in <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span> address how to assess such special facts. However, Authority decisions since the issuance of <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span> demonstrate that it is not necessary to cite the factors or apply them in any particular way.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, even if a requirement to apply the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span> existed, it is clear that the Arbitrator considered the factors and that his conclusion is consistent with section 7102 of the Statute. Specifically, although the Arbitrator found that the letter was not written impulsively or in response to a specific act by the supervisors, the Arbitrator also found that the grievant believed he was obligated as Union president to alert employees to a potential problem, that the letter was an attempt to warn employees of a legitimate concern, and that the letter was not an attempt to undermine the reputations of the supervisors. The Arbitrator also found that the grievant did not publicly announce his concerns but, instead, mailed individual letters only to the unit employees he thought were affected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with these arbitral findings, we conclude that the grievant's statements were not of such an outrageous or insubordinate nature as to remove them from the protection of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Tinker</span>, 34 FLRA at 390-91. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg, North Carolina and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1770</span>, 39 FLRA 1149 (1991) (exception denied to award upholding suspension of employee for discourteous and insubordinate conduct toward her supervisor; employee not engaged in protected activity at time of conduct).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Facilities Eng'g Command and NFFE Local 2096</span>, 45 FLRA 138, 155-57 (1992), determined to be protected a response by a union steward to management's notice of a RIF action that was distributed to union members. The letter contained derogatory comments laced with profanity concerning managers' motives and actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we find many of Teale's remarks, including his ethnic reference, offensive and we do not condone them. However, our sensibilities are not at issue here and the protections of the Statute are not extended only to such comments as we condone....&#8197;Teale's letter is protected unless Teale's remarks constitute "flagrant misconduct."...&#8197;In this regard, our task is to determine whether the remarks were "of such an outrageous or insubordinate nature so as to remove them from the protection of the Statute."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the issue before us is not whether the use of an ethnic reference constitutes protected activity. Instead, the issue is whether the use of such a reference removes activity from the protection of the Statute....&#8197;As such, it is necessary to examine Teale's letter as a whole, and in the context of the facts and circumstances of this case, to determine whether it is protected....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When examined as a whole and in context, it is clear that the thrust of Teale's letter was a condemnation of the Respondent's decision to conduct a major reduction in force. As indicated by its text, the letter was written on the same afternoon as Teale was informed of the particular individuals who were to be subject to the upcoming RIF. The letter mentions several individuals by name, both unit and nonunit employees, and requests unit employees to engage in various activities in response to the decision to conduct the RIF. As relevant here, the letter includes one ethnic reference to one individual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the newsletter article in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span>, Teale's letter was not replete with disparaging racial stereotyping and defamatory racial insults. Also, the "entire thrust of the newsletter" in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span> was criticism of one manager through racial epithets and stereotyping. 26 FLRA at 117. The thrust of Teale's letter, on the other hand, was criticism of management for its decision to conduct a RIF. We find that, read as a whole and in the context of the circumstances of this case, Teale's use of an ethnic reference did not remove the letter from the ambit of protected activity....</p>
<p class="noindent">Factors to be considered in determining what constitutes protected speech during grievance meetings include the place and subject matter of the discussion, whether the employee's outburst was impulsive, designed, or in any way provoked by the employer's conduct, and the nature of the language and conduct. Telling a supervisor to get screwed was unprotected when there was no provocation, the employee had been warned earlier against that type of language, and the language was not pertinent to the subject of discussion. Although there is leeway for emotional speech during a grievance proceeding, the employee went too far. <span class="Italic">DOD, DMA Aerospace Ctr. and NFFE Local 1827</span>, 17 FLRA 71, 82 (1985) (ALJ Decision). A steward who called her supervisor a fool in the course of representing another employee was not guilty of flagrant misconduct. There was no disruption to the job site. Although she exhibited a degree of disrespect for the supervisor, that fact had to be balanced against the supervisor's somewhat foolish actions while interacting with the employee who was represented. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Memphis Serv. Ctr. and NTEU</span>, 16 FLRA 687, 697 (1984) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DMA, supra,</span> was applied and explained in a decision that management improperly caused a union official to be removed from the worksite where he had a disagreement with a manager. The exchange involved profanity by the union official, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA 410, 411, 413-15 (2010) (over the dissent of Member Beck):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The president and his supervisor had an impromptu discussion concerning staffing levels for an upcoming shift and the president's belief that those staffing levels were insufficient under the parties' collective bargaining agreement. During this discussion, the supervisor told the president that a staffing decision had not been made yet but would be made later in the shift, and he repeated this statement after the president protested the lack of an immediate decision. During this conversation, which took place at the supervisor's "position" in the operations room, the president stated to the supervisor, "fuck you, I don't give a fuck." After the exchange, the president left the supervisor's work area.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thereafter, the supervisor summoned a security guard to escort the president back to the operations room. Once there, the supervisor informed the president that he was placing him on administrative leave and directed the security guard to escort the president off of the Respondent's premises. The president was so escorted in view of ten or more bargaining-unit employees.[2] A charge was filed, and a complaint issued alleging that the Respondent's conduct violated Section 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_1376"></span>[2]&#x2003;Subsequent to the president's removal from the premises, the supervisor called back the president to perform work on overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge stated that in order to determine whether the president lost the protection of the Statute, the Authority applies the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Dep't of Def., Def. Mapping Agency Aerospace Ctr., St. Louis. Mo.,</span> 17 FLRA 71 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span>). Consistent with that decision, the Judge stated that he would consider the following factors: (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the president's outburst was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the outburst was provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language or conduct. Decision at 9-12 (citing <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping,</span> 17 FLRA at 81).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, the Respondent does not except to the Judge's findings that the president was engaged in protected activity generally, or that the appropriate factors to apply are those set forth in <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping.</span> Rather, the Respondent argues only that the Judge misapplied the first, second, and fourth <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping </span>factors. Accordingly, we address only those three factors.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;We note that the Defense Mapping factors were affirmed in <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Grissom Air Force Base, Ind,</span> 51 FLRA 7, 12 (1995) (Grissom).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the first <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping </span>factor, the Authority considers the place and subject matter of the discussion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 17 FLRA at 81. In this case, there is no dispute that the discussion between the president and the supervisor occurred in the work place, at or near the supervisor's work space, in a somewhat open area. It also is undisputed that: the president and the supervisor spoke in normal conversational tones; only one other employee overheard part of the discussion; and that other employee did not hear any profanity. In addition, as the Judge found, the Respondent's operations were not disrupted, and the "subject matter of the discussion was within the scope of the [Charging Party's] legitimate concerns."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that, as discussions regarding work assignments are "a daily, mundane, and innocuous occurrence[,]" the president's actions do not deserve protection. However, the Respondent provides no basis for concluding that, even if true, that characterization of the discussion detracts from the significance of the undisputed facts and circumstances found by the Judge and set forth above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, much of the premise of the dissent--that the president was not engaged in protected activity--addresses an issue that is not before us.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, in agreement with the Judge, we find that the first Defense Mapping factor supports a conclusion that the president's conduct was protected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the second <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping </span>factor, the Authority considers whether the outburst was impulsive or designed. <span class="Italic">See Defense Mapping,</span> 17 FLRA at 81. It is undisputed that the supervisor wished to delay making any decision about the use of overtime on the next shift until he obtained additional information. It also is undisputed that the president sought an immediate decision and, when the supervisor refused, the president uttered the profanity in "frustrat[ion]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Addressing whether the president's conduct was impulsive or designed, the Respondent claims that the president's conduct and language were "calculated" flagrant acts of misconduct. Similarly, the Respondent argues that the president's use of profanity was "designed to humiliate and embarrass" his supervisor in front of subordinates and peers during the normal course of business. However, the Respondent cites no record evidence that supports its argument that the president's conduct was not impulsive. Based on the foregoing, the Respondent has not established that the president's utterance was designed, or planned, in any way. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def, Def Contract Mgmt. Agency, Orlando, Fla.,</span> 59 FLRA 223, 224, 227 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting) (union official calling employee a "liar" and "bad mouthing" a management official found to be impulsive). Accordingly, we find, in agreement with the Judge, that the second <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping </span>factor supports a conclusion that the president's conduct did not exceed the bounds of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fourth <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping </span>factor considers the nature of the intemperate language or conduct. <span class="Italic">See Defense Mapping,</span> 17 FLRA at 82. As the Judge noted, in analyzing the nature and context of the remarks, the Authority considers whether the conduct in question was brief or prolonged, the tone of voice, and whether there was any physical conduct or threat of violence. As applied here, the discussion between the president and the supervisor was conducted in a normal tone, and no other employees overheard the president's profanity. Although the president used profanity, the Authority has held that the use of profanity, standing alone, does not remove conduct or speech from the protection of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE,</span> 59 FLRA 767, 770 n.8 (2004) ("[I]t is not the words alone that are dispositive. Rather, it is the context, as established by other relevant factors, that determine whether the comment exceeds the bounds of protected activity."). <span class="Italic">See also Grissom,</span> 51 FLRA at 12 (union official calling respondent's negotiator "fucking stupid" did not constitute flagrant misconduct); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Agric., Food Safety &#x0026; Inspection Serv., Wash., D.C.,</span> 55 FLRA 875, 880 (1999), and cases cited therein.[11] Contrary to the Respondent's assertion, the Judge did not "ignore" the nature of the intemperate language; the Judge found that the supervisor's own testimony indicates that the burst of profanity was brief, delivered in a normal tone of voice, and not overheard by any other employee. Moreover, the Respondent's reliance on <span class="Italic">Felix,</span> 251 F.3d 1051, is misplaced. In that case, the court found that the NLRB's "offhand treatment" of an employee's repeated obscenity directed at his supervisor (that the supervisor was "a fucking kid") was inconsistent with NLRB precedent. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1065, 1053. Although the court found that the repeated obscenity "weigh[ed] against protection" and remanded for the NLRB to reconsider its decision, the court did not establish that all obscene statements are unprotected. Moreover, as the GC notes, on remand, the NLRB affirmed its prior decision that the respondent unlawfully fired the affected employee based on the statements. <span class="Italic">Felix Indus.,</span> 339 NLRB 195. In so doing, the NLRB found it "very significant" that as in the instant case the subject matter of the decision involved legitimate labor-management concerns. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 196. Accordingly, we find, in agreement with the Judge, that the fourth <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factor supports a conclusion that the president's conduct was protected.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">But see AFGE</span>, 59 FLRA 767 (2004) (then-Member Pope dissenting) (Authority majority found that employee's use of phrase "kiss my ass" was unprotected flagrant misconduct). We note that, in <span class="Italic">AFGE,</span> the Authority relied heavily on certain facts that are not present here, such as evidence regarding the "nature of the workplace" and evidence of provocation by the union. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 771. We further note that the Authority determines, "on a case-by-case basis" taking into account "the totality of the circumstances[,]" whether an employee's conduct exceeds the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 771. For these reasons, <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> is distinguishable from, and does not control, the instant case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent misconstrues congressional intent concerning the limits on language used in workplace debates.&#x2003;Congress intended, in both the private and federal sectors, to permit uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate, reaching beyond the strictly civil to encompass even language properly described as "intemperate, abusive, or insulting." <span class="Italic">Old Dominion Branch No. 496,</span> <span class="Italic">Nat 'l Ass 'n of Letter Carriers v. Austin,</span> 418 U.S. 264, 283 (1974) (<span class="Italic">Letter Carriers</span>).[12] Although, as discussed below, courtesy and respect are arguably more effective forms of address, nevertheless, well established private and federal sector precedent has consistently upheld these broader limits.[13] <span class="Italic">See AFGE,</span> 59 FLRA 767, 774 (2004) (then-Member Pope, dissenting) (citing and discussing cases). As a result, the dissent's effort to expand the definition of conduct that "exceeds the boundaries of protected activity" to include "any misconduct" is flawed. As we have acknowledged above, "flagrant misconduct" is not the only standard theoretically available for determining whether a union official's speech or other conduct loses the Statute's protection. <span class="Italic">See Air Force,</span> 58 FLRA at 636. However, the dissent's proposed "any misconduct" standard would be inconsistent with the principle, discussed above, that language may be "intemperate, abusive, or insulting[&#8197;]" and nonetheless be protected. <span class="Italic">Letter Carriers,</span> 418 U.S. at 283.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;The dissent implies that the rule set forth in <span class="Italic">Letter Carriers </span>is limited to situations such as "collective bargaining that takes place with union negotiators clearly and unequivocally in the role of union representative rather than in the role of subordinate employee, or an organizing campaign in which the employee is engaged in conduct that occurs outside of the workplace and outside of his regular work time. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Letter Carriers </span>or any other authority indicates that the rule is so limited. Further, although the dissent implies that <span class="Italic">KSL Claremont Resort,</span> 344 NLRB 832, 835 (2005), set forth a "workplace" exception to protected activity, <span class="Italic">KSL Claremont Resort</span> did no such thing. That decision stated that "[t]he standards for behavior in negotiations are much different than the standards of conduct for an employee in a luxury hotel[;]" it did not indicate that, merely because activity occurs in the workplace, it is not statutorily protected.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;The remaining decisions cited by the dissent are inapposite. Several of the cited decisions do not involve employees who were engaged in statutorily protected activities when they allegedly committed acts of misconduct. <span class="Italic">See McKowen v. MSPB,</span> 703 F.2d 14, 15 (1st Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Ramos v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 292 Fed. Appx. 910, 912 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Webster v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 911 F.2d 679, 688 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Pinegar v. FEC,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 677, 689 (2007); <span class="Italic">Beaudoin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 489, 495, <span class="Italic">on reconsid.,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 507 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 202 Fed. Appx. 460 (Fed. Cir. 2006). By relying on them, the dissent implies that the existence of statutorily protected activity is irrelevant. It is not. Moreover, one of the cited decisions actually supports our decision. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Beaudoin,</span> the Merit Systems Protection Board emphasized that, in certain settings <span id="Page_1377"></span>such as equal employment opportunity (EEO) counseling sessions employees are allowed 'more leeway' regarding disrespectful comments about agency personnel" because "EEO counseling sessions, by their nature, are emotionally charged settings in which employees are expected to complain about the conduct of other agency personnel." 99 M.S.P.R. at 15-16 (citation omitted). Labor-management discussions are similar to EEO counseling sessions in this respect.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">With regard to the additional NLRB decisions cited by the dissent, those decisions also are distinguishable from this case. In <span class="Italic">Aluminum Co.,</span> the NLRB found an employee's activity unprotected on the basis of several factors not present here, including the facts that: there was "sustained" profanity; employees overheard (and complained about) the outbursts; there was evidence that the profanity exceeded the type of profanity that otherwise was tolerated in the workplace; and the employer demonstrated that it had disciplined other employees for similar outbursts in the past. 338 NLRB at 22. With regard to <span class="Italic">Avondale Industries, Inc.</span>, 333 NLRB 622 (2001), that case involved racially inflammatory language. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 637 (employee called supervisor a "klansman"). Given the "clearly expressed public policy against racial discrimination in the workplace[,]" the Authority similarly finds that statements reflecting "racial stereotyping" exceed the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin., Wash., D.C.,</span> 26 FLRA 114, 116 (1987). However, the statement at issue here does not fall within, or even approach, that type of statement. As such, <span class="Italic">Avondale</span> is inapposite.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, as indicated above, that we hold the union representative's intemperate remark in this case protected does not imply we approve of the use of profanity in the workplace as a labor-management relations tactic. We have no quarrel with the dissent's preference for civility. However, we are bound to respect and enforce Congress's policy determinations protecting robust debate. Accordingly, we are compelled to reject the dissent's effort to convert good advice concerning workplace behavior into a statutory prescription.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Judge correctly applied <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping </span>and that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute as alleged. Consequently, we deny the Respondent's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The right of a union official to engage in correspondence with management and the threat of publicity of management's actions were considered in <span class="Italic">VAMC Jamaica Plain and FOP</span>, 50 FLRA 583, 593-95 (1995) (ALJ Decision). The statements and the threat to publicize the statements were protected. The case arose out of a letter from a local union official to his superior. The letter had its genesis in a workplace dispute:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As of right now you are holding the position of acting chief of the V.A. Police in Boston taking over for Robert LeBlanc who suddenly transferred to another duty station within the V.A. system.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There were many problems concerning the V.A. Police when Mr. LeBlanc was at the helm. You also were a source for the many problems concerning officers from this service. Recently you involved your-self [sic] in a matter that didnot [sic] concern you involving VA Police officers who attended a service for a fellow Police officer killed while on duty. I stated in a meeting in your office that I thought you were reaching very far for trouble, I left you a message on the in-house V.A. computer system regarding this matter and the problems you should be concerned with that are more important issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Your attitude showed thru with your response via a memo from your office.&#x2003;I now feel that the situation between you and certain officers are not going to change because of your vendetta attitude which is unprofessional. Because of this you should not be holding the position within the VA system. I believe [sic] that there will be more problems in the future that will hurt the VA Police service and it's members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Answer me this Mr Spirio, What would the Front office think if they saw a [sic] article regarding thier [sic] medical [sic] Center in the Federal Times concerning mismanagement and cronyism within the VA system but focusing on the Boston Police Service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What would the front office think if they saw your name mentioned several times stating FACTS over the last 3 years involving you and your so called investigations against officers who you have a dislike for.&#x2003;The F.O.P. has many pieces of evidence you have provided to us over the last several years. We believe that we were a force behind the departure of Robert LeBlanc the former chief of the VA Police in Boston.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Over the last few months the Federal Times has done articles regarding problems in the VA at certain medical centers concerning a rash of deferent [sic] issues within those medical centers. And in every situation, Washington sent investigators into those area,s [sic] and always removed those who were the heart of the problem.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As I stated to you in writing, you have more important issues at hand within the Boston VA area. Crime and incidents are on the rise, drugs are a major problem, the holidays are in the near future and robberies will be on the rise. This year alone the VA had a police officer shot, a [sic] officer held hostage and gun incidents are involving VA,s [sic] are climbing. The safety of the officers are at risk every day while they perform their duties. And all you can find time to do is see what pennyannie [sic] items concerning certain officers who do-not [sic] have respect for you. These will also be brought to the [sic] attention in this article.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Do you think the front office will support you concerning the issues that will be mentioned in the article.&#x2003;I [sic] sure they thought that the problems in the Police Service were over. Who's [sic] head do you think they will put on the chopping [sic] if someone has to be removed to solve the problems. The VA Police officers in Boston deserved [sic] someone who is honest, caring and supported [sic] of their officers, none of the qualities you possess. Your professional and personal life in the VA has many flaws which are well known. Those flaws will be brought to light if necessary by the F.O.P.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Police Administration and the Police officers must work together if the VA Police Service is going to improve to become a better service for the benefit of all concern [sic]. Your past evidence shows you do-not [sic] want to work together, your attitude is do what I say, not what I do. The F.O.P. has been very successful in bringing issues to light and to the proper authorities for action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This letter will be a show of proof that this F.O.P. local has tried to iron out issues that concern their membership and to improve the relationship between management and officers. If you do we are here and if you do-not [sic] then we will send and call our information and evidence to our contact at the Federal Times.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I hope we can end this past practice of vendettas and harrasment [sic] toward a certain group of officers for only the reason that they want to do their jobs as professional Police officers and be respected as such.</p>
<p class="noindent">The letter was protected under <span class="Italic">Jamaica</span> <span class="Italic">Plain</span>, 50 FLRA at 586-87:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7102 of the Statute, employees have the protected right to form, join, or assist any labor organization or to refrain from such activity. This right includes the presentation of the labor organization's views to "heads of agencies and other officials of the executive branch of the Government...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102(1). Under section 7102, employee action to publicize labor disputes or issues that have a direct bearing on conditions of employment is protected activity. <span class="Italic">E.g., Department of the Navy, Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Facilities Engineering Command, Western Division San Bruno</span>, <span class="Italic">California</span>, 45 FLRA 138, 148-49, 155 (1992) (Member Armendariz concurring in part and dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">Naval Facilities</span> <span class="Italic">Engineering Command</span>). It is well established that this protection extends to the publicizing of such disputes or issues through the media. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution (Danbury, Connecticut)</span>, 17 FLRA 696, 696-97 (1985) (<span class="Italic">FCI, Danbury</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with section 7102, however, an agency has the right to discipline an employee who is engaged in otherwise protected activities for actions that "exceed the boundaries of protected activity such as flagrant misconduct." <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916, AFL-CIO</span>, 34 FLRA 385, 389 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Tinker Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Base</span>). The Authority has found that remarks or actions that are of such an "outrageous and insubordinate nature" as to remove them from the protection of the Statute constitute flagrant misconduct. <span class="Italic">Naval Facilities Engineering Command</span>, 45 FLRA at 156; <span class="Italic">Tinker Air Force Base</span>, 34 FLRA at 390. With particular relevance to this case, statements to the media lose their statutory protection if, for example, they compromise an agency's ability to accomplish its mission, disrupt discipline or are disloyal. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Forces</span> <span class="Italic">Korea/Eighth U.S. Army</span>, 17 FLRA 718, 728 (1985); <span class="Italic">FCI</span>, <span class="Italic">Danbury</span>, 17 FLRA at 697-98. <span class="Italic">Cf. Kinder-Care Learning Centers</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc.</span>, 299 NLRB 1171, 1171 (1990) (under section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), employees' right to engage in protected activity includes communicating with third parties, such as news reporters and the public in general, regarding an ongoing labor dispute so long as the communications are not disloyal, reckless, or maliciously untrue).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the statements concerning Spirio contained in Giannetti's letter were not of such an outrageous and insubordinate nature as to constitute flagrant misconduct. Giannetti's statements were of the same tenor as the comments regarding two supervisors in a letter that was found to constitute activity protected under section 7102 in <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2693</span>, 50 FLRA 212 (1995). In that decision, the Authority found that the letter, which accused supervisors of lying and overbearing and abusive treatment of subordinates, was not flagrant misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 216. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dreis &#x0026; Krump Manufacturing</span> <span class="Italic">Company, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 544 F.2d 320, 328-29 (7th Cir. 1976) (employee's statements attributing "malice, gross negligence, carelessness and dissembling" to his supervisor were not so "offensive, defamatory or opprobrious so as to remove them from the protection of the [NLRA]"). <span class="Italic">Compare Tinker Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Base</span> (while employee's actions in refusing to leave a work area were insubordinate, they did not constitute flagrant misconduct) <span id="Page_1378"></span><span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2207</span>, 35 FLRA 553 (1990) (employee's conduct in remaining on the telephone to discuss union business while a life-threatening situation needed his attention was unprotected).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That Giannetti threatened to publicize allegations of mismanagement and cronyism does not alter our conclusion.&#x2003;In particular, we have no basis for assuming that the threatened disclosures would compromise the Respondent's ability to accomplish its mission, disrupt discipline, be disloyal or otherwise be of such an outrageous or insubordinate nature as to remove those disclosures from any statutory protection they might otherwise have. Moreover, the statutory protection of publicity concerning labor disputes and issues bearing on conditions of employment would be undermined if threats to engage in such protected conduct were not also protected. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Servette, Inc.</span>, 377 U.S. 46, 57 (1964) (Court held that the statutory protection for the distribution of handbills would be undermined if the threat to engage in that activity was not protected); <span class="Italic">Keokuk Gas Service Co. v. NLRB</span>, 580 F.2d 328, 335 (8th Cir. 1978) ("The threat to assert a &#x00A7; 7 right must be protected if the exercise of such right is to be fully secured. An employer's discharge of employees threatening to assert a &#x00A7; 7 right inherently discourages exercise of such right[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency improperly interferes with and restrains a union official by allowing a criminal citation to be issued to the official who does no more than engage in a disagreement with a government police officer at the site of a work disturbance. FLRA concluded that it had authority to direct the agency to seek rescission of the criminal citation by bringing FLRA's decision to the attention of the magistrate who issued the citation. <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard and FEMTC</span>, 25 FLRA 1002, 1005-07 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the Statute, the protected right to file a grievance does not give an employee a license to make unsubstantiated and defamatory accusations outside the grievance process. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Louisville Dist. and NTEU</span>, 20 FLRA 660, 662-63 (1985). Adopting language from a court opinion, an ALJ determined in <span class="Italic">DLA, Defense Depot Tracy and Laborers' Int'l Union Local 1276</span>, 16 FLRA 703, 715 (1984) (ALJ Decision), that although a grievance proceeding is not an audience, conditionally granted by a master to his servants, but a meeting of equals--advocates of their respective positions--discipline was warranted when at a group grievance session a union steward refused to obey some ground rules requiring people to allow each other to speak without demeaning one another. The ALJ determined that the steward was not attempting to voice his convictions about a particular grievance or problem; he "did no more than voice an unfocused rebelliousness, an unwillingness to be subject to any rules of disciplined discourse":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Particularly in the light of there being no rational discussion of either a grievance or its manner of presentation underway, and no semblance of provocation, or other mitigating factors, his conduct was in the circumstances indefensible. The reasons for the doctrine which affords employees broad latitude in grievance discussions are absent here, and the facts are in essence closer to garden-variety insubordination on the plant floor. The Union's right to be represented at such formal discussions was therefore forfeited....</p>
<p class="noindent">A union official did not have the right to misrepresent his pay grade during the course of representation concerning a security clearance denial. The misrepresentation might have led an adjudicator or other agency official to divulge more information than would have been provided had the representative's grade been correctly stated. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 25 FLRA 342, 351 (1987) (ALJ Decision). [Refer later in this chapter to, "<a href="0100-2023-16-172.html#sec8-172">Flagrant Misconduct</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-16-173.html#sec8-173">Protected Action Against Union Official</a>"; "<a href="0100-2023-16-171.html#sec8-171">Discipline of Union Official</a>"; "<a href="0100-2023-16-173.html#sec8-173">Protected Action Against Union Official</a>"; refer to the remarks of Member Abbott in <span class="Italic">VAMC Orlando and AFGE Local 2779</span>, 71 FLRA 13 (2019).]</p>
