<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-227"><span class="space">1.</span> What They Are</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ex parte</span> communications are defined and regulated by 5 CFR 1201.101-.103 (2022). Essentially, they are one-sided communications with the AJ about the merits of the case as opposed to Board procedures or case status. The regulation states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1201.101 <span class="Italic">Explanation and definitions</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Explanation</span>. An <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is an oral or written communication between a decision-making official of the Board and an interested party to a proceeding, when that communication is made without providing the other parties to the appeal with a chance to participate. Not all <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications are prohibited. Those that involve the merits of the case, or those that violate rules requiring submissions to be in writing, are prohibited. Accordingly, interested parties may ask about such matters as the status of a case, when it will be heard, and methods of submitting evidence to the Board. Parties may not ask about matters such as what defense they should use or whether their evidence is adequate, and they may not make a submission orally if that submission is required to be made in writing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Definitions for purposes of this section</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Interested</span> party includes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Any party or representative of a party involved in a proceeding before the Board; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Any other person who might be affected by the outcome of a proceeding before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Decision-making official</span> means any judge, officer, or other employee of the Board designated to hear and decide cases except when such judge, officer, or other employee of the Board is serving as a mediator or settlement judge who is not the adjudicating judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1201.102 <span class="Italic">Prohibition on ex parte communications</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Except as otherwise provided in &#x00A7; 1201.41(c)(1) of this part, <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that concern the merits of any matter before the Board for adjudication, or that otherwise violate rules requiring written submissions, are prohibited from the time the persons involved know that the Board may consider the matter until the time the Board has issued a final decision on the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1201.103 <span class="Italic">Placing communications in the record; sanctions</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Any communication made in violation of &#x00A7; 1201.102 of this part will be made a part of the record. If the communication was oral, a memorandum stating the substance of the discussion will be placed in the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;If there has been a violation of &#x00A7; 1201.102 of this part, the judge or the Clerk of the Board, as appropriate, will notify the parties in writing that the regulation has been violated, and will give the parties 10 days to file a response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;The following sanctions are available:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Parties</span>. The offending party may be required to show why, in the interest of justice, the claim or motion should not be dismissed, denied, or otherwise adversely affected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Other persons</span>. The Board may invoke appropriate sanctions against other offending parties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Our discussion of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications concerns communications with or information presented to the AJ or to the Board. The subject of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications to agency decisionmakers is discussed in Chapter 11. [Refer to Chapter 11, "<a href="0100-2023-18-092.html#sec11-93">Agency Decisional Procedures; <span class="Italic">Ex Parte</span> Communications</a>."] An <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication occurs between an AJ and a party. A conversation about a case between two Board AJs is not an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Edwards v. DOJ</span>, 87 MSPR 518, 525 &#x00B6; 16 (2001).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the regulation, <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications are "those that involve the merits of the case, or those that violate rules requiring submissions to be in writing." communication relates to the merits. <span class="Italic">Golden v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 462, 464-65, 7 MSPB 326 (1981), suggested that a communication concerning a discovery dispute fell within this category after the agency representative informed the AJ of the nature of some documents sought by the appellant. A communication qualifies as <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> if it discusses evidence. <span class="Italic">Miller v. OPM</span>, 7 MSPR 469, 474 n.8, 7 MSPB 333 (1981). An AJ's statement to an agency representative that the AJ intended to dismiss the case qualifies as an improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication, but the appellant must provide evidence of the conversation and show it likely had a harmful effect on the case outcome. <span class="Italic">Gala v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 474, 479 (1988). Unless there is a waiver of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, the prohibition extends to one-sided conversations with the AJ about settlement. <span class="Italic">Young v. VA</span>, 83 MSPR 187, 192 &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (error was not harmful, for "appellant was not overborne by administrative judge's statements since he did not agree to resign"); <span class="Italic">Muzzipapa v. VA</span>, 53 MSPR 53, 59 (1992) (similar to <span class="Italic">Young</span>). Discussions between the AJ and an agency representative involving procedural matters and the status of the appeal but that do not involve the merits do not violate rules requiring submissions to be in writing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boechler v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 109 MSPR 542, 550-51 &#x00B6; 16, 2008 MSPB 190 (2008).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication involving a communication between a party and the AJ occurs when that communication is made without providing the other parties a chance to participate. If an appellant refuses to participate in telephone conferences with the AJ because he does not have a private phone and will not use a public phone, telephonic conferences between the AJ and the other party are not <span class="Italic">ex parte</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Horton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 475, 480-81 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Communications unrelated to an issue or claim affecting the merits of the action being appealed are permitted, provided they do not constitute submissions that must be in writing. Procedural discussions are not considered <span class="Italic">ex parte</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ragland v. IRS</span>, 6 MSPR 674, 677, 6 MSPB 565 (1981) ("Because the discussion of the time for the hearing did not involve the merits of the case, and because there are no rules requiring such communication to be in writing, we cannot conclude that the presiding official engaged in prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications."). A conversation between an agency representative and the AJ concerning the scheduling of the hearing is not a prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication; it does not concern the merits. <span class="Italic">Deleon v.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 68, 73 (1993). Remarks or conversations about the availability of witnesses or the scheduling of a hearing are not <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications because they do not relate to the merits. <span class="Italic">Stec v.

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 213, 215 (1984)."). A conversation between the AJ and a representative concerning whether a party planned to file a response was a procedural matter, not an improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication. <span class="Italic">Vidal v.

<p class="Body-Text">Motions should be written unless made during a prehearing conference or at the hearing. 5 CFR 1201.55(a). Although a procedural discussion might not be <span class="Italic">ex parte</span>, an oral motion for a postponement of an event made <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> would not be permissible under the rule. The proper practice is to make the motion in writing or seek scheduling of a conference to make the motion. The decisions are not consistent on whether a call to the AJ explaining the need for an immediate extension of time is an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication--particularly when the other party cannot be immediately reached and assuming that substance of the call is immediately memorialized in writing, with service on the other <span id="Page_1215"></span>party. The call does not involve the merits of the case. But a motion for an extension is supposed to be in writing, and that requirement brings the call within the language of the regulation prohibiting <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. Given the usual availability of email and voicemail, the best practice if there is an emergency need for an extension is to leave an email or message with the opposing party who cannot be reached by phone, stating the need for an extension and the intent to call the AJ about the extension. The use of e-filing permits instant communication and (ordinarily) service of any motion, and the motion can be followed up with a phone call to the AJ stating that the motion was filed. The conduct of litigation must be tailored to exigencies, not constrained by rigid, counterproductive formalisms. Any Board regulation can be waived, unless the regulation states a statutory requirement. 5 CFR 1201.12 (2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fort v. Dept. of Navy,</span> DC-315H-10-0756-I-1 (NP 9/20/2011), noted of the grant of an extension of time that was challenged as an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant alleges that the administrative judge engaged in prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, without the participation of the appellant or her representative, when she granted the agency's motion for an extension of time to file its response to the appeal during a telephone conversation with agency counsel. The Board's regulations relevantly state: "<span class="Italic">[E]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">x parte</span> communications that concern the <span class="Italic">merits of any matter</span> before the Board for adjudication or that otherwise violate rules <span class="Italic">requiring written submissions</span>, are prohibited...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.102 (emphasis added). Furthermore, the Board's regulations authorize an administrative judge to grant or deny motions for extensions of time to file pleadings without providing the other party an opportunity to respond. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.55(b). The Board's decisions affirm that an administrative judge's discussions with a party regarding merely procedural matters, such as extensions of time, do not involve the "merits" of the appeal and are not prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. <span class="Italic">See Vidal v. Department of Justice,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 254, &#x00B6; 6 (2010); <span class="Italic">Boechler v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no evidence that the administrative judge engaged in any <span class="Italic">prohibited</span> <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact. The administrative judge documented her <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact with the agency in her "Second Order To Respond" dated August 30, 2010, stating: "On August 20, 2010, the agency filed a Motion.... By telephone, I granted the Motion to Delay Submission of the Agency File until [the]date for the agency's response on the jurisdictional issue." There is no suggestion that the administrative judge discussed the merits of the appeal during the telephone conversation. Also, nothing in the record suggests that administrative judge engaged in any communication that required submissions<span class="Italic"></span> to be in writing; the agency's motion had been filed in writing and served on the appellant and her representative. We therefore discern no error by the administrative judge when ruling on the agency's motion for an extension of time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Case management communications between an agency and the Board concerning treatment of furlough appeals were procedural, not substantive, and they did not violate the rule against <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, <span class="Italic">Dale v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 705 Fed. Appx. 990, 996 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mr. Dale appears to argue that the Navy engaged in improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with the Board. Board regulations prohibit "<span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that concern the merits of any matter before the Board for adjudication, or that otherwise violate rules requiring written submissions." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.102. As Mr. Dale correctly concedes, however, "under Board practice, <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications are not prohibited <span class="Italic">per se</span>." Mr. Dale does not does not persuade us that the Navy's communication with the Board was improper in this case. He cites four proposals that the Navy sent the Board on July 10, 2013, in anticipation of "the unprecedented volume of appeals from one DoD component alone." All four proposals, however, were procedural and not substantive. The July 10, 2013 communication did not concern the merits of Mr. Dale's appeal and thus was permissible. The Board's July 23, 2013 response to the Navy similarly discussed only procedural methods for managing the influx of appeals. We agree with the Board that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between the Navy and the Board were not improper.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the elusive line dividing substance and procedure, <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 504, 508 (1995), hedged as to a conversation between an agency representative and the AJ concerning the content of the agency's response to the appeal, but the Board saw no harm, applying a "harmful error" approach:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Ex parte</span> communications are those made to an interested party to the proceeding and are not prohibited if they do not involve the merits of the case or do not violate rules requiring submissions to be in writing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.101(a); <span class="Italic">Wyse v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 39 MSPR 85 (1988). Here, the administrative judge stated that he informed the agency's representative that the agency's submission was not "adequately responsive" to the appeal. The administrative judge's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights; the appellant did not show that the communication resulted in the agency's submission of information that impaired her ability to establish Board jurisdiction over her appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. OPM</span>, 87 MSPR 275, 279 n.2 (2000) (no prejudice by <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications; "sanctions are not warranted because OPM has not shown harm or an intent to violate the Board's prohibition on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts"); <span class="Italic">Ward v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 441, 444 (1984) (involving <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication between the agency and the AJ that brought to light an EEO complaint affecting Board jurisdiction and resulted in the cancelation of a hearing; all parties should have received simultaneous notice of the hearing's cancelation, but the error did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights); <span class="Italic">Peedin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 13 MSPR 647, 649 (1982) (conversation between the AJ and the agency counsel advising the agency that the appellant had a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bradley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 21 MSPR 334, 335 n.* (1984) ("Even if the allegations of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts are true, the agency has failed to establish that the presiding official was biased, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ragland v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 6 MSPB 565 (1981), or that the communications prejudiced its case in any manner.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A complaint to the Board about an AJ's conduct may be considered a prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication if the complaint is made during the pendency of the proceedings, if it is not served on opposing counsel, and if the complaint discusses the AJ's actions (including the content of his decisions) during adjudication of the appeal, <span class="Italic">Gubino v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 80 MSPR 442, 443-46 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following issuance of an August 27, 1998, recommendation granting in part the appellant's petition for enforcement in <span class="Italic">Gubino v. Department of Transportation</span>, MSPB Docket No. AT-0752-97-0455-C-1 (August 13, 1998), one of the appellant's attorneys submitted a letter with four attachments to the Board members but did not serve a copy on the agency. In the letter and Attachment A of the supporting documents he complained, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, of conclusions drawn by the administrative judge in the recommendation in this case as to the merits of his attorney fee request, conclusions which were rendered in language which the attorney asserted was so strong as to constitute an abuse of authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Nevertheless, the appellant's attorney stated that the submission was not a petition for review. In response, the Clerk of the Board sent an Order to the parties noting that because the submission related in part to a decision before the Board on review and was not served on the agency, there appeared to be a violation of the prohibition on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.103, the parties were notified of their right to file a response and address whether or not sanctions should be imposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations describe prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications as those communications made between a decision-making official of the Board and an interested party to a proceeding when the communication is made without giving the other parties to the appeal a chance to participate and where the communication involves the merits of the case. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.101. The regulation defines interested party to include a representative of a party in a proceeding before the Board. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.101(b)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the appellant asserts that the August submission was not an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication because it did not go to the merits of the case, but rather to the administrative judge's alleged mishandling of the case and abuse of authority. The appellant also argues that the communication should not be viewed as improper because his attorney did not ask the Board members to modify the recommendation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the appellant's characterization of the submission as going to the administrative judge's behavior rather than the merits of the case, the August letter and Attachment A refer to statements in the enforcement recommendation providing the rationale for the administrative judge's denial of a portion of the appellant's fee request, statements that refer to portions of the fee request as "frivolous" and "tantamount to padding." That the attorney did not ask the Board members to take action on this case is not dispositive, as the case was pending before the Board and the attorney's submission could have influenced their decision, whether or not he intended that effect. Thus we find that the attorney's criticism of the recommendation goes to the merits of this case and is properly viewed as a prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication. Further, the fact that some parts of the August submission referred to matters apart from the instant appeal does not require a different result. It is sufficient that a portion of the August submission pertained to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have found that the August submission constitutes a prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication, we find that it would be inappropriate to impose sanctions. In the absence of a showing of harm, or an intent to violate the Board's prohibition on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts, sanctions are not warranted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">LeBeau v. Department of Transportation,</span> 17 MSPR 160, 168 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom. Metzger v. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 776 F.2d 1060 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table) (the Board found that the presiding official correctly refused to impose a sanction for the agency's inadvertent violation of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> rule where no harm <span id="Page_1216"></span>was shown by the agency's service of the appellant's first representative rather than his new representative).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the agency requests that the Board impose sanctions but does not argue that it was harmed by the appellant's attorney's failure to serve the August submission on it. The Clerk ultimately served the agency with a copy of the August submission and provided the agency with an opportunity to respond. Thus, the agency had an opportunity to respond to the criticisms of the recommendation contained in the August submission, and it has not shown that it was otherwise harmed by the attorney's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant's response to the November 24, 1998, Order makes clear that his attorney did not intend to violate the prohibition on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication, but rather was seeking a vehicle through which to complain about what he perceived as improper adjudicatory behavior by the administrative judge. We note that the Board's regulations governing petitions for enforcement provide the normal vehicle for raising complaints about issues that arise during the administrative process. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.183. While we recognize that there may be extreme circumstances in which the regulations governing the petition for enforcement process will provide an inadequate remedy for the alleged wrong, there are no such circumstances here.[4] However, because it was not clear to the appellant's attorney that the method he chose to articulate his disagreement with the administrative judge's adjudicatory actions was improper, and because there has been no showing of harm to the agency, sanctions would not be appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;To the extent that the appellant's attorney believes that the appeal process cannot address his concerns, he could have avoided any <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> problems by waiting to file his complaint until a final decision issued because <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications are only prohibited during the pendency of a Board proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.102.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To avoid the problem of a complaint about an AJ in a pending case being considered an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact with the Board, first, the contact should be served on opposing counsel. The Board noted one possible route of protest--to the chief administrative judge (with a copy of the protest or notice of it to opposing counsel)--in a Federal Register rulemaking notice concerning scheduling of hearings, 77 Fed. Reg. 62349, 62355 (Oct. 12, 2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, a commenter reported that in his experience judges have displayed poor judgment by scheduling hearing and prehearing deadlines far before the completion of discovery, unilaterally setting hearing dates for personal convenience, and denying unopposed motions to reschedule hearings. This commenter also suggested that the MSPB has seemingly taken the approach of cutting short discovery to meet the prehearing dates selected by the judge. Parties may request a suspension under 1201.28 when additional time is needed for discovery. Concerns that a judge is improperly managing a particular case should be directed to the appropriate Regional Director or Chief Administrative Judge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Or a complaint could be directed to the Board's inspector general, but the OIG is not in the business of second-guessing Board adjudications.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As in <span class="Italic">Gubino</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board may determine that an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication was made but no harm was done to the other party. In <span class="Italic">Fickie v. Dept. of Army</span>, 86 MSPR 525, 533 &#x00B6; 16 (2000), the agency made an oral motion, without notice to the appellant, for additional time to respond to the appeal. The agency erred by using an oral rather than a written motion, and by submitting the motion <span class="Italic">ex parte</span>, but:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the agency's failure to submit the motion in writing, and the administrative judge's failure to ensure that the motion was made part of the written record and communicated to the appellant, was inappropriate, we see no indication that the appellant has been harmed by this matter, or that any further remedial action is warranted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication in <span class="Italic">Fickie</span> involved a discovery dispute. The Board noted but did not act on the error asserted, 86 MSPR at 533 &#x00B6; 18:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because these communications concern the merits of a matter that was before the administrative judge for adjudication, i.e., the appellant's entitlement to evidence he sought in connection with his appeal, they should not have been made on an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> basis. The appellant has not shown how he was disadvantaged by the communication, however; he evidently has been provided with copies of the agency's written communication to the administrative judge, and we therefore see no need to provide any further remedial action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Finally, as to one more <span class="Italic">Fickie</span> <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication, the remedy was to direct the AJ, who was receiving the case back on remand, to supply a letter from an unidentified third party to the parties for their response. 86 MSPR at 533 &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other cases demonstrate the application of a "harmful error" approach to arguably <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. A motion for extension of time was submitted orally and confirmed in writing in <span class="Italic">Kanner v. Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 130, 133, 4 MSPB 215 (1980). The AJ treated the verbal request as an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication and struck from the record some materials submitted by the agency representative. Although the Board accepted the conclusion that an oral request for an extension of time (violating the normal rule that the request be written) may be an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication, it observed that not all <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications are prohibited. In determining whether a communication is prohibited, a balance is struck between assuring fair and impartial adjudication and allowing flexibility in case processing. There was no prohibited conduct. The agency could not have filed its written request for an extension quickly enough for the request to have been of any use. There was no prejudice to the appellant. The appeal was remanded for consideration of the materials struck by the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Klein v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 366, 373 (1996) (an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication did not occur when one party faxed a communication to the AJ but only mailed it to the other party); <span class="Italic">Aldredge v. TVA</span>, 70 MSPR 141, 144 (1996) (AJ erred, although the error was harmless, when he granted an extension request: "[B]ecause the agency's motion for an extension of time was made orally, and the appellant not only had not acceded to the agency's request, but was apparently unaware of it, the administrative judge erred in granting the motion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.55."). [Refer to other decisions concerning <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications and bias allegations in Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-165.html#sec3-165">Remarks About Counsel, Party, Merits, Settlement; Remarks During Hearing; <span class="Italic">Ex Parte</span> Communication</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Submission of materials not decisionally significant to an AJ without service on the agency did not constitute procedural error warranting reversal of the AJ's decision in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. DODDS</span>, 3 MSPR 553, 555, 4 MSPB 70 (1980) ("The submission consisted of appellant's objection to the agency's filing of written notes summarizing his oral reply to the agency's deciding official, a copy of appellant's honorable discharge from the United States Army, a certificate awarded appellant for twenty years of federal service, and six satisfactory performance ratings. The presiding official correctly held that there was no error in the submission of the written notes by the agency, and did not in any way rely on the remaining materials in reaching her decision."). But if the materials transmitted <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> basis are decisionally significant, the Board may vacate its decision and reopen the record until the other party is served with the pleading and has an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 161, 162 (1982).
