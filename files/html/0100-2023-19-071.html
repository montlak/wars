<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-67"><span class="space">a.</span> Allergy</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A post-ADAAA case readily determined that an individual who suffered from asthma established a disabling condition caused by her breathing impairment, coupled with inappropriate discipline and lack of proper protective equipment in <span class="Italic">Santiago v. Dept. of Navy,</span> SF-0752-11-0193-I-1 (NP 3/2/2012). With the caution that the 2008 amendments to the ADA will result in different analysis with regard to some conditions, previously classified as transitory or capable of correction, <span class="Italic">Miller v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 473, 477-79 (1990), works a significant limitation on the disabled employee--a limitation that will often preclude those who suffer allergic reactions at their workplace from obtaining protection of the Rehabilitation Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The question on who is a handicapped person...is best suited to a "case-by-case determination,"...as courts assess the effects of various impairments upon varied individuals. The definitional task cannot be accomplished merely through abstract lists and categories of impairments. The inquiry is, of necessity, an individualized one--whether the particular impairment constitutes for the particular person a significant barrier to employment. Relevant to the inquiry are "the number and types of jobs from which the impaired individual...has reasonable access, and the individual's job expectations and training." <span class="Italic">Jasany v. USPS</span>, 755 F.2d 1244, 1249 (6th Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The fact that an impairment prevents an employee from meeting the demands of a particular job does not necessarily mean that she is handicapped; the impairment must foreclose generally the type of employment involved....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, the Philadelphia metropolitan area where the appellant lives and worked is the relevant geographical area. The evidence did establish that the appellant's allergy to dust rendered her incapable of functioning as a Distribution Clerk in at least two major work locales in the Philadelphia area....&#8197;The appellant presented no evidence, however, that would establish that her allergies substantially limited her employability generally in the Philadelphia area. To the contrary, she testified that her condition clears up when she is absent from her work environment, and that, except for her employment as a Distribution Clerk, she has no history of significant impairment from her allergies either on or off the job....&#8197;In addition, the appellant had limited training and job expectations as a Distribution Clerk, having occupied the position for only about two years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion that the appellant has failed to establish that she is handicapped is consistent with court and administrative decisions in similar cases. In <span class="Italic">Wright v. Tisch</span>, 45 FEP Cases 151 (E.D. Va. Oct. 20, 1987), the plaintiff developed severe respiratory ailments as a result of dusty working conditions in a new location after she accepted a permanent reassignment....&#8197;The plaintiff testified that she had no history of respiratory ailments, that her symptoms disappeared after leaving the work environment, and that she had no difficulty with outdoor activity, such as would be required of a letter carrier....&#8197;The court concluded that <span id="Page_3452"></span>the plaintiff's allergy restricted her "only from the unusual, if not unique, environmental conditions" of the new work area, and held that the plaintiff was not handicapped....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner in <span class="Italic">Gomez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, No. 03890007, slip op. (EEOC Jan 17, 1989), was removed following a fitness for duty examination when the agency physician determined that, as a result of his hypersensitivity to paint fumes, the petitioner was incapable of performing the essential job duties of his position as a painter. The...EEOC concluded that the petitioner was not handicapped because he had failed to show that the condition affected his employability generally:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]t cannot reasonably be concluded that because petitioner is unable to continue working in the narrow occupation of his choice, he has a substantial handicap to employment. The additional evidence submitted by the agency shows that petitioner held a variety of positions prior to his agency employment, and he only occupied the position of painter for a five-year period. Accordingly, although petitioner is disqualified from the field of painting, this disqualification does not drastically reduce his employability....&#8197;Considering petitioner, the extent of his allergy, and his job experience and expectations, the Commission finds that petitioner's allergy does not constitute an impairment which substantially limits a major life activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Commission stated that its construction of [29 CFR 1614.203(a)(1)] as to the existence of a handicapping condition was consistent with that of courts which have concluded that to permit those with minor impairments to avail themselves of the protections of the Rehabilitation Act would contravene the intent of the Act of protect those who are truly handicapped. The Commission's analysis in <span class="Italic">Gomez</span> is entitled to deference because EEOC was interpreting its own regulation....&#8197;The present case closely parallels <span class="Italic">Gomez</span> in several important respects. In both cases, allergic conditions rendered the employees incapable of performing essential duties of their jobs, but did not generally preclude them from pursuing other lines of work for which they were qualified or significantly affect their lives outside the workplace. In addition, both employees had limited time and training in the jobs from which they were removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant failed to establish by preponderant evidence that she is a handicapped person as defined in [29 CFR 1614.203(a)(1)], and that she failed to sustain her affirmative defense of handicap discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another pre-ADAAA decision, <span class="Italic">Vernon v. VA</span>, 54 MSPR 486, 490 (1992), applied <span class="Italic">Miller</span> to avoid setting aside the removal of a housekeeping aid who suffered reactions to the chemicals he used on the job:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "handicapped person" is one who: (1) Has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of his major life activities, (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a). The Board has held that, in determining whether an appellant is a "handicapped person," an inability to meet the demands of a particular job due to an impairment does not necessarily mean that an appellant is handicapped. The impairment must foreclose generally the type of employment involved, and constitute for the particular person a significant barrier to employment. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. US. Postal Service,</span> 43 MSPR 473, 477-78 (1990). <span class="Italic">See also Forrisi v.</span> <span class="Italic">Bowen,</span> 794 F.2d 931, 933 (4th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">E.E. Black, Ltd. v.</span> <span class="Italic">Marshall,</span> 497 F. Supp. 1088, 1100 (D. Haw. 1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant here has not met [the] burden of proving that he is a "handicapped person," and that he, therefore, has failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination....&#8197;[T]he appellant, a Housekeeping Aid, suffered from adverse allergic toxic reactions to various chemicals and cleaning agents. The appellant, however, did not experience any medical problems when not exposed to particular chemicals, and was able to work both as a Medical Aid before he requested a transfer to the present Housekeeping Aid position, and in the warehouse after he experienced the problems at issue in this appeal. Thus, the appellant has not shown that his condition constitutes a significant barrier to his employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. DOD</span>, 54 MSPR 641, 646 (1992) (applying <span class="Italic">Miller</span> in a Chapter 43 case; neurological defects, hearing loss, and other difficulties demonstrated impairment, but the impairment was not shown to generally foreclose the appellant's type of employment); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 45 MSPR 136, 141 (1990) (involving an electrician apprentice in the position of marine electrician, resulting in remand for further analysis of the relationship between an appellant's impairment, "sickle cell trait," and her "general employability for the type of work in question").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the ADAAA, severe allergic reactions did not justify an accommodation of a change in work site rather than dismissal for physical inability to perform work as a contract specialist in <span class="Italic">Groshans v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 629, 633-38 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge...found that the appellant suffers from a condition known as anaphylaxis which causes her to experience, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, difficulty in breathing when she is exposed to diesel fumes, any type or form of alcohol, or certain strong odors. He noted that the appellant suffered severe attacks at the workplace in CM-3 on January 6 and 25, 1994, and that because her physician had advised her that a future allergic reaction could be fatal, the appellant advised her supervisors that she could not return to work at the office location in CM-3. Thus, the agency had temporarily placed her in Crystal Mall Building 2 (CM-2) from January 3, 1994, until June 16, 1994, the date on which the agency proposed her removal and placed her on administrative leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sustaining the charge by preponderant evidence, the administrative judge found that despite her temporary placement at the CM-2 location, the agency showed that in order to effectively perform her duties, the appellant's presence at SSP headquarters was necessary because she served as team leader in the preparation, negotiation and monitoring of complex, high-level missile system contracts. Thus, she was required to interact extensively face-to-face with both contractors and SSP staff at CM-3. In addition, there were tasks that needed to be performed on a daily basis such as obtaining files for research and inputting data into various computer data bases, that she could not perform at CM-2. This negatively impacted on SSP productivity and morale because her co-workers had to perform the appellant's duties. Also, there were numerous training and staff meetings held at CM-3 which the appellant could not attend, and since there were some 18 employees in SSP, it was not feasible to hold these meetings at CM-2. The administrative judge therefore found that the appellant's duties could not be performed effectively and efficiently outside of CM-3. Accordingly, he sustained the charge of physical inability to perform the duties of the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is admittedly a close and difficult issue given the severe nature of the appellant's allergic reactions. Nonetheless, as detailed below, the overwhelming weight of authority supports the conclusion that, under the circumstances of this case, the appellant is not disabled within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. We need not address, therefore, whether the agency was obliged to accommodate her condition. Accordingly, we must reject the appellant's affirmative defense of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that while the evidence of record shows that the appellant suffers from an impairment to her breathing, she was not disabled from the major life activity of working because her medical condition does not affect her ability to work as a Contract Specialist in any location other than CM-3. Because he found that her condition did not constitute a significant barrier to her employment, he held that she was not disabled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant argues that her anaphylactic condition is not confined to CM-3 and that an attack could strike her anytime or anywhere that noxious fumes are present and that therefore she is disabled and within the coverage of the Rehabilitation Act. Based upon the evidence of record, however, we find that the appellant suffers from an impairment that does not constitute a disability and, thus, that the administrative judge correctly concluded that the appellant is not a disabled employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A disabled person is one who "(i) [h]as a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities; (ii) [h]as a record of such an impairment; or (iii) [i]s regarded as having such an impairment." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(1). A condition affecting the respiratory system may be a physical impairment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(2). The inquiry as to whether an individual is disabled for work is an individualized one focusing on whether the particular impairment constitutes for the particular person a significant barrier to employment; the impairment must foreclose generally the type of employment involved. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 60 MSPR 279, 282 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Miller v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 473, 477-78 (1990)). Relevant to this inquiry are the number and types of jobs from which the impaired employee is disqualified, the geographic area to which the employee has reasonable access, and the employee's job expectations and training. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez</span>, 60 MSPR at 282; <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 43 MSPR at 477, and cases cited therein. An inability to perform a particular job by a particular employee is not sufficient to establish a disability; the impairment must substantially limit employment generally. <span class="Italic">See Byrne v. Board of Educ., School of West Allis</span>, 979 F.2d 560, 565 (7th Cir. 1992), and citations therein; <span class="Italic">Battle v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 63 MSPR 403, 409 (1994). In the recent case of <span class="Italic">Heilweil v. Mount Sinai Hospital</span>, 32 F.3d 718, 723 (2d Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __U.S.__, 115 S. Ct. 1095, 130 L. Ed.2d 1063 (1995), the court noted that every circuit that has addressed the issue has ruled that "a person found unsuitable for a particular position has not thereby demonstrated an impairment substantially limiting such person's major life activity of working."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, as the court noted in <span class="Italic">Byrne</span>, of the cases it reviewed specifically dealing with respiratory ailments attributable to the working conditions <span id="Page_3453"></span>of a particular workplace, only one, a district court case, <span class="Italic">Vickers v. VA</span>, 549 F. Supp. 85 (W.D. Wash. 1982), had held such impairment to be a disability. <span class="Italic">See Byrne</span>, 979 F.2d at 565 &#x0026; n.3.[5] The court in <span class="Italic">Heilweil</span> further explored the subject of respiratory ailments as a disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Since the issuance of <span class="Italic">Byrne</span>, another district court has found asthma exacerbated by tobacco smoke to be a disability, but held that the accommodation of a smoke-free work environment was unreasonable. <span class="Italic">See Harmer v. Virginia Elec.</span> <span class="Italic">and Power Co.</span>, 831 F. Supp. 1300, 1305-07 (E.D. Va. 1993). <span class="Italic">But see Gupton v.</span> <span class="Italic">Commonwealth of Virginia</span>, 14 F.3d 203, 205 (4th Cir.) (allergy to tobacco smoke is not a covered disability unless the allergy makes the complainant incapable of pursuing the type of employment involved as opposed to her particular job assignment; the action was dismissed based upon the finding that the plaintiff, although unable to continue in her current position, failed to present evidence that her allergy foreclosed her from generally obtaining work in her field, and in fact she was offered a position in a nearby smoke-free office), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __U.S.__, 115 S. Ct. 59, 130 L. Ed.2d 17 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There, Ms. Heilweil, who suffered from serious asthma, was given responsibility for the hospital's blood bank and had allergic reactions to diesel fumes and natural gas entering the laboratory through the ventilation system. She was discharged from employment because she would not enter the laboratory and her job required that she enter it in order to continue to serve as its administrator. The court found that Heilweil suffered from a physical impairment, namely, asthma, affecting her respiratory system. It held, though, that this impairment did not rise to the level of a disability because Heilweil's breathing difficulty affected her only in a limited way since she could engage in exercise and was not restricted in her daily activities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Heilweil</span>, 32 F.3d at 723 (citing <span class="Italic">Byrne</span>, 979 F.2d at 565, holding that in a respiratory impairment case, evidence that a person participated in recreational activities undermines finding that the individual is disabled).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court also found that Ms. Heilweil's serious asthma and resulting breathing impairment did not constitute a significant barrier to employment because, based upon the record evidence, it limited her ability to work in only one particular place, the hospital laboratory, and there was no evidence showing that she was limited in employment in the general field of administration. <span class="Italic">See Heilweil</span>, 32 F.3d at 724<span class="Italic">. See also Cohen v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 46 MSPR 369, 374-75 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Heilweil</span>, the appellant here has not shown that her anaphylaxis affects her more than in a limited way either in breathing or in working. She testified at the hearing that her respiratory impairment does not affect her ability to exercise and she engages in scuba diving and swimming....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, there is abundant evidence that the appellant was/is not foreclosed from working at locations other than CM-3. Indeed, the appellant worked without an allergic reaction at the CM-2 location from January 31 through June 16, 1994. Certain medical documentation submitted by the appellant supports the proposition that she is able to work in alternate locations such as CM-2. Moreover, the appellant testified that she did not object to working at CM-2. She also testified that she could work as a Contract Specialist anywhere in the United States. It is undisputed that the appellant engaged in travel for work-related reasons and experienced no allergic reaction. Thus, the appellant has not shown that she is foreclosed generally from employment as a Contract Specialist.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;In one case, the Board held that allergies to dust or fumes in the working environment do not render an individual disabled. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vernon v. VA</span>, 54 MSPR 486, 490 (1992) (Housekeeping Aid suffered from adverse allergic toxic reactions to various chemicals and cleaning agents and was found not disabled because he did not experience any medical problems when not exposed to particular chemicals, and he was able to work both as a Medical Aid and in a warehouse position). <span class="Italic">See also Miller v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 473, 478 (1990) (the appellant's allergy to dust rendered her incapable of working at two major work locations in the Philadelphia area but she was not a disabled employee because no evidence established that her allergies generally limited her employability in the Philadelphia area). <span class="Italic">But see Rodriguez v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 60 MSPR 279, 282-83 (1994) (employee who suffered headaches due to allergic rhinitis because he was allergic to dust and solvents was held to be disabled because his condition disqualified him from performing the duties of almost all positions at his Base and similar agency installations; thus, he was foreclosed from a class of jobs for which he had trained and which had specialized job functions, which created a significant barrier to his employability in the area).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In several Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) decisions, that agency has also held that allergic reactions do not generally foreclose an employee from employment opportunities such as to establish that an individual is disabled with respect to the major life activity of working. <span class="Italic">See McCoy v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Petition No. 01932873 (Oct. 20, 1993); <span class="Italic">Coleman v. USPS</span>, EEOC Petition No. 01930855 (Sept, 30, 1993); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03920115 (Nov. 27, 1992); <span class="Italic">McGee v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Petition No. 01911668 (July 17, 1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Accommodative relief for reaction to smoke was not available to the appellant in <span class="Italic">Turner v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 212, 212 n.* (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of the instant case are clearly distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Parodi v. Merit</span> <span class="Italic">Systems Protection Board,</span> 690 F.2d 731 (9th Cir. 1982) and appellant's reliance on <span class="Italic">Parodi</span> is thus misplaced. Unlike the employee in <span class="Italic">Parodi,</span> the appellant has not shown that her absence from work was due to her intolerance of tobacco smoke, nor is there any evidence that the employing agency's offer to segregate smokers and non-smokers at the work site would not have accommodated the appellant sufficiently to allow her to return to work. Additionally, based on factors similar to those present in the instant case, the Board has found that providing an employee with a smoke-free environment was an undue hardship and therefore not required as a reasonable accommodation<span class="Italic">.
