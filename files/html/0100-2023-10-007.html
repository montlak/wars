<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-8"><span class="space">b.</span> No Material Disputed Facts</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The hearing is to resolve issues of fact. Oral argument, but not an adversarial hearing, may be provided if the only dispute is over interpretation of law, as in a retirement case, <span class="Italic">Jezouit v. OPM</span>, 97 MSPR 48, 53-55 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13 (2004) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Jezouit v. OPM</span>, 121 Fed. Appx. 865 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, who seeks a modification in his retirement benefits, bears the burden of proving his claim. <span class="Italic">See Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 791 F.2d 138, 140-41 (Fed. Cir. 1986). <span class="Italic">If</span> the appellant had a right to an evidentiary hearing before the AJ, it goes without saying that the hearing had to be a fair one, that is, one for which the appellant was given an adequate chance to prepare evidence intended to meet his burden of proof. <span class="Italic">See Merit Systems Protection Board Judges' Handbook</span>, ch. 9, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1, 3 (an AJ should hold at least one prehearing conference with the parties in order to explain Board procedures to them and to identify the issues for the hearing); <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00A7; 7 (when the appellant in a retirement appeal is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, the AJ has a "special burden" to ensure that the appellant "is not disadvantaged"). It appears that the appellant was surprised to learn during the January 7, 2003 status conference that the conference would also serve as the hearing, and it further appears that through no fault of his own he was not prepared for a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, any abuse of discretion on the AJ's part in the conduct of the hearing was not prejudicial, and therefore provides no basis for modifying the initial decision, because under the particular circumstances of this case the appellant did not have a right to an evidentiary hearing in the first place. To obtain reversal of an initial decision on the ground that the AJ abused his discretion in excluding evidence, the petitioning party must show on review that relevant evidence, which could have affected the outcome, was disallowed. <span class="Italic">See Roth v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 290, 295 (1992); <span class="Italic">Perez v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 32, 40 (1988). Here, any conceivable evidence that the appellant was prevented from presenting below because he was not provided sufficient advance notice that the hearing would take place on January 7, 2003, could not have been relevant and could not have affected the outcome. The appellant has never claimed that any of the pertinent details in his Individual Retirement Record (IRR) are inaccurate. Based on that undisputed IRR, OPM's calculations of the appellant's service credit and average pay were not legally erroneous and should not be disturbed. There were no witnesses with relevant testimony that the appellant could have offered because the propriety of OPM's method of computing the appellant's service credit and average pay are questions of law, not fact. <span class="Italic">See Hanks v. Federal Emergency Management Agency</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 567, 573 (1984) (testimony on a "determination of law" was properly excluded); <span class="Italic">see also Police Retirement System of St. Louis v. Midwest Investment Advisory Service</span>, 940 F.2d 351, 356-57 (8th Cir. 1991) (testimony on the meaning and application of a federal statute is inadmissible because interpreting the law "is the judge's job").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, the AJ was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing because this appeal presents solely issues of law. <span class="Italic">Cf. Crispin v. Department of Commerce</span>, 732 F.2d 919, 922 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (holding that an evidentiary hearing was required where the case presented a genuine issue of material fact). A status conference would have been sufficient if the AJ had given the appellant advance notice and offered him the opportunity to present oral argument. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bommer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 543, 552 (1987); <span class="Italic">accord Slater v. General Services Administration</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 378 &#x00B6; 13 (2004);<span class="Italic"> Conway v. Department of the Navy</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 502, 504 (1996);<span class="Italic"> Beam v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 54, 60 (1994). The AJ's procedural error (in not fully explaining the nature of the January 7, 2003 conference to the appellant in advance) was not prejudicial because this retirement appeal presents purely legal issues and the appellant, who bears the burden of proof on the merits of his claim, does not explain what evidence he would introduce at an evidentiary hearing that might affect the outcome. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carew v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 878 F.2d 366, 367-68 (Fed.

Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Affirming the Board, <span class="Italic">Jezouit v. OPM</span>, 121 Fed. Appx. 865, 867 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Ordinarily, a petitioner is entitled to a hearing on the merits of his case before the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1) (2000). The Board found that any abuse of discretion by the AJ in not giving Jezouit advance notice of the hearing was not prejudicial because the AJ decided only legal issues and therefore the AJ was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing. Under the circumstances presented by this case, we find no reason to disagree with the Board. The case involves no factual dispute that discovery or an evidentiary hearing would resolve, and Jezouit has not explained how the AJ's alleged failure to allow discovery and order an evidentiary hearing has prejudiced him.</p>

Whether an administrative judge must hold an evidentiary hearing or may hold a hearing consisting of the presentation of legal argument depends on whether there are genuine issues of material fact. <span class="Italic">Jezouit v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 182, &#x00B6; 13 (2006) (holding that an evidentiary hearing on the issue of discrimination need not be conducted when the discrimination issue does not present any genuine dispute of material fact). The Board has held that, in appeals where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the purpose of the hearing is merely to allow the appellant the opportunity to present oral argument, the administrative judge may hold a telephonic hearing on the legal issues involved in the appeal. <span class="Italic">Jezouit</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 13 (in a retirement appeal involving purely questions of law, a telephonic status conference conducted by the administrative judge would have been sufficient to satisfy the hearing requirement if the appellant received advance notice and was offered the opportunity to present oral argument).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, because the appeal did not present any genuine issues of material fact, the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion by denying the appellant's request for an in-person evidentiary hearing and instead scheduling a telephonic hearing to allow the appellant the opportunity to present oral argument on the legal issues involved in his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Jezouit</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 13. Specifically, the appellant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his entitlement to a discontinued service retirement annuity because he was precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel from establishing that his separation was involuntary under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(1) and because there were no genuine issues of material fact with respect to whether he was voluntarily separated under the conditions set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(2) The appellant was also not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his discrimination claim because his failure to show that OPM erred in applying the criteria for a discontinued service retirement annuity as set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d) precluded him from establishing that OPM discriminated against him. <span class="Italic">See Redd</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 182, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, although the appellant asserts on review and claimed at <span id="Page_1308"></span>one point during proceedings below that his request for an in-person hearing was based on his alleged hearing difficulties, he did not assert below or on review that his failure to appear for any of the three scheduled telephonic hearings was somehow due to these alleged hearing difficulties. Therefore, we further find that the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion by deciding the appeal on the written record because the appellant failed to appear, without good cause, for the telephonic hearing on three separate occasions. <span class="Italic">See Callahan</span>, 748 F.2d at 1559. Further, even if the appellant had established on review that his alleged hearing difficulties prevented him from appearing at the scheduled telephonic hearings, he has not shown that his failure to receive a hearing in which he was limited to presenting oral argument on the legal issues in his appeal would have affected the outcome of his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Jezouit</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Panter</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. at 282.</p>

[Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-274.html#sec1-269">Hearing Entitlement; Board Disposition</a>," for decisions involving the right to a hearing in USERRA and VEOA appeals.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Summary judgment, often employed in federal sector EEO cases assigned to EEOC administrative judges, and sometimes used by FLRA ALJs with unfair labor practice cases involving no factual disputes, is a paperwork exercise: a party submits a motion, containing a factual recitation and legal argument, accompanied by record references or by exhibits that create or buttress an existing record. There is no hearing. The purpose of the motion is to avoid a hearing. Although the Board does not entertain summary judgment motions other than in cases against ALJs and under the Hatch Act (both types of cases adjudicated under procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act), the Board does permit AJs to limit hearings, a practice that approaches but does not quite equate to summary judgment. The decisions noted in this subsection describe the practice, and that practice was confirmed, and its limitations expressed by Vice Chairman Wagner in a dissent, in <span class="Italic">Dyson v. DOD,</span> DC-0752-13-1235-I-1 (NP 12/8/2014) (Vice Chairman Wagner dissenting), involving an appellant who requested a Board hearing after being removed for loss of required access to sensitive classified information:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Without holding a hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision affirming the agency's removal action.[3] ...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The administrative judge did not hold an evidentiary hearing because he found that there were no genuine issues of material fact. He offered to hold a hearing limited to the presentation of legal argument but the appellant elected to have the appeal decided on the written record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the appellant's position required eligibility to access SCI and the agency revoked his eligibility for access to SCI.[4] Accordingly, the agency proved its charge by preponderant evidence....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;These are the only relevant factual disputes that can be raised regarding a charge based on the revocation of access to SCI. <span class="Italic">See Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 23 (where an agency proposes to indefinitely suspend an employee based on the suspension of his security clearance, the only relevant factual disputes that could be raised are whether the position required a security clearance and whether the clearance was suspended). Regarding the appellant's contention that the administrative judge erred in not making findings as to whether he was delusional, this issue relates to the merits of the security eligibility determination and therefore is not reviewable by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 526-30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that, where an adverse action is based on the failure to maintain a security clearance required by the job description, the action promotes the efficiency of the service because "the absence of a properly authorized security clearance is fatal to the job entitlement." <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 498 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Because the appellant's position required eligibility to access SCI, the revocation of his eligibility to access SCI was fatal to the job requirement. <span class="Italic">See Flores</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 12 (finding that the revocation of the appellant's eligibility to occupy a sensitive position was fatal to the job requirement where the appellant's position required eligibility to occupy a sensitive position). Moreover, consideration of the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981), would be inappropriate in determining the penalty in this case. <span class="Italic">See Munoz v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 483, &#x00B6; 15 (2014) (finding that the traditional <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor analysis does not apply in cases involving adverse actions based on security clearance or eligibility determinations). We therefore sustain the agency's action.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The appellant's contention that the administrative judge improperly denied him an evidentiary hearing does not provide a basis for review. Whether an administrative judge must hold an evidentiary hearing or may hold a hearing consisting of the presentation of legal argument depends on whether there are issues of material fact. <span class="Italic">Jezouit v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 13 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 121 F. App'x 865 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Because the appeal does not raise factual disputes, the appellant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. <span class="Italic">See Crispin v. Department of Commerce</span>, 732 F.2d 919, 922-24 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (remanding the case where the appellant's claim raised factual disputes and where the presiding official had denied the appellant an evidentiary hearing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Vice Chairman Wagner dissented, arguing that Mr. Dyson was improperly denied a hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I agree with the majority that the agency proved its charge of revocation of the appellant's Top Secret security clearance and access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), that it complied with the procedural requirements specified under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b), and that the appellant failed to establish that the agency violated any of its policies or regulations in effecting his removal. However, as further discussed below, I dissent from the majority's analysis of the appellant's constitutional due process claim and I would remand this appeal for an evidentiary hearing and further development of the record regarding that claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency proposed to remove the appellant based on the revocation of his Top Secret security clearance and access to SCI. Maintaining a Top Secret security clearance and access to SCI were conditions of employment with the agency. The appellant responded to the notice of proposed removal, and the deciding official thereafter notified the appellant of his decision to remove him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without holding a hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision affirming the agency's removal action, finding that the agency proved the basis for its charge, that it afforded the appellant his procedural rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, and that it established nexus and the reasonableness of the penalty. The administrative judge also found that the agency afforded the appellant a meaningful opportunity to respond to the allegations against him because it gave him detailed and specific notices explaining the bases for the security eligibility determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant contends, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the administrative judge erred in not holding an evidentiary hearing. I agree. It appears that the administrative judge found that he was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing and that he only offered the appellant a hearing limited to the presentation of legal issues. On review, the appellant's representative states that he declined the offer, in part, because the administrative judge informed him that the hearing would be limited to 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority states that whether an administrative judge must hold an evidentiary hearing or may hold a hearing consisting of the presentation of legal argument depends on whether there are genuine issues of material fact. It states that, because this appeal does not raise factual disputes, the appellant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. I strongly disagree and believe that this view is patently inconsistent with longstanding precedent to the effect that the Board lacks authority to dispose of appeals via summary judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Crispin v. Department of Commerce</span>, 732 F.2d 919, 922-24 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that the <span id="Page_1309"></span>Board does not have the power to grant summary judgment, i.e., a party appealing under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 is entitled to receive a hearing regarding his appeal. This is the case even where there is no dispute of material facts. <span class="Italic">See Bennett v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 685, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2013) (remanding the appeal for further adjudication of the appellant's due process claim where the record on this issue was insignificantly developed); <span class="Italic">Gowan-Clark v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 116 (1999); <span class="Italic">Coben v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 168, 170 (1991) (an appellant has a right to a hearing even where there is no dispute of material facts; however, the right to a hearing is subject to the authority of the administrative judge to make evidentiary rulings under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b), including the authority to exclude evidence determined to be irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, denying the appellant an evidentiary hearing on the ground that there are no material facts in dispute is tantamount to granting the agency summary judgment. Moreover, the appellant's contention that the deciding official lacked the authority to select an alternative to removal raises a disputed issue of material fact. The administrative judge did not address the appellant's constitutional due process claim in the initial decision, and the record does not establish whether the deciding official had the authority to select an alternative to removal.[6] The appellant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Jezouit v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 121 F. App'x 865 (Fed. Cir. 2005), is distinguishable. In that case, the Board, citing <span class="Italic">Carew v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 878 F.2d 366, 367-68 (Fed. Cir. 1989), determined that the administrative judge was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing in a retirement appeal that presented solely questions of law. In particular, the Board noted that there were no witnesses with relevant testimony that the appellant could have offered to contest the propriety of the agency's method of computing the appellant's service credit and average pay. <span class="Italic">Jezouit</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 12. Because this is not a retirement appeal, <span class="Italic">Carew</span> is not controlling. Moreover, unlike <span class="Italic">Jezouit</span>, the appellant's due process claim appeal does not present solely questions of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority's reliance on <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 584, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16 (2014), as a basis for denying the appellant an evidentiary hearing is also misplaced. Although the Board in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> determined that the appellant did not establish a due process violation in the absence of a showing that there were viable alternatives to his removal, in that case the appellant was afforded an evidentiary hearing. Moreover, extending the rationale in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> to serve as a basis for denying an evidentiary hearing serves as yet another unwarranted step toward relegating the Board's role in security-based adverse action cases to acting as a rubber-stamp of agency decisions without even maintaining a pretense of adhering to the process envisioned by the statute.</p>
