<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-165"><span class="space">1.</span> Sexual Harassment; Inappropriate Behavior</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Sexual harassment is a specific charge of misconduct distinct from charges of inappropriate or offensive conduct, or violations of agency policies or regulations not limited to prohibitions against sexual harassment. Sexual harassment can be examined as offensive conduct, akin to a threat or abusive speech, under the efficiency of the service standard of Chapter 75, or it may be examined as a prohibited personnel practice or under the law developed under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The two accepted methods of proof of sexual harassment under standards set by decisions interpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 include evidence either of a <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> (i.e., some employment benefit conferred in exchange for sexual favor or consideration) or a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">Viens v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 92 MSPR 256, 261 &#x00B6; 5 (2002). The Federal Circuit maintains that an agency may proscribe conduct characterized as sexual harassment that does not rise to the level of a Title VII violation. The proper focus is then on the efficiency of the service, not on a putative violation of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Marshall v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3383). If, however, the agency wishes to rely upon its own regulations defining prohibited conduct, the agency should specifically cite the regulations in its charges and not rely upon vague references to agency regulations coupled with a specific charge of sexual harassment in violation of EEOC regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 58, 64 (1992) [<span class="Italic">Hillen</span> involves a series of decisions, discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-15-167.html#sec8-166">Past Significance of Psychological Harm</a>," explaining in considerable detail the Board's view of misconduct of a sexual nature and sexual harassment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gregory v. Dept. of Army</span>, 114 MSPR 607, 619-20 &#x00B6; 31, 2010 MSPB 175 (2010), explained the nature of sexual harassment under Title VII:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has described the Title VII standard--conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment--as a "middle path between making actionable any conduct that is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993). To be actionable, conduct must be severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment; if the victim has not subjectively perceived the environment as abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim's employment and there is no Title VII violation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 21-22. Determining whether the environment is hostile or abusive must be made by examining all the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance, and whether it unreasonably interfered with an employee's work performance. <span class="Italic">Viens</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 10 (2002). Simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment that constitute sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency charges an employee with violating its sexual harassment policy and that policy references Title VII standards, the agency must prove the charged conduct violated Title VII, <span class="Italic">Booker v. VA</span>, 110 MSPR 72, 74-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-7, 2008 MSPB 216 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that when "an agency charges an employee with violating its sexual harassment policy and that policy explicitly references the Title VII standard, including creating a hostile working environment, the Title VII standard must be applied, and the agency is required to prove that the appellant's conduct violated Title VII." <span class="Italic">Viens v. Department of the Interior</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 6 (2002) (citing <span class="Italic">Salazar v. Department of Energy</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2001)). The agency also bears this burden if its sexual harassment policy tracks Title VII regulations, even if it does not explicitly reference them.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> This is in contrast to the situation where an agency policy does not refer to Title VII or track its regulations, in which case the agency must prove only that its policy was violated. <span class="Italic">Viens</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 6 (citing <span class="Italic">Alsedek v. Department of the Army</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 229, 234-35 (1993)); <span class="Italic">see also Campbell v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 480, 483-84 (1996). The agency may thus proscribe and penalize misconduct before it rises to the level of a Title VII violation. <span class="Italic">Pope v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 F.3d 1144, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (citing <span class="Italic">Carosella v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 816 F.2d 638, 41-42 (Fed. Cir. 1987)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, neither the agency's proposed removal nor its decision letter specified the definition of sexual harassment being utilized. On appeal, however, the agency produced a November 30, 2005 Memorandum entitled "Prevention of Sexual Harassment" in response to a discovery request from the appellant to "identify all agency policies prohibiting or defining sexual harassment or that formed the basis for concluding that <span id="Page_2651"></span>the Appellant had engaged in sexual harassment" and to provide copies thereof. The AJ's prehearing conference summary impliedly defined the issue of whether the charge was sustained as being whether the agency policy was violated, and the parties did not object.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's policy, contained in the November 30, 2005 memorandum, provides as follows in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]t is illegal and against the policies of the VA for any employee, male or female, to sexually harass another employee by (1) making acceptance of unwelcome sexual advances or request for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, a condition of an employee's continued employment, or (2) making submission to or rejections of such conduct the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee, or (3) creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment by such conduct....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Such conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The law recognizes three types of sexual harassment--<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>, hostile work environment, and sexual favoritism....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Hostile work environment is usually found where a general pattern of workplace behavior exists that is sexually-oriented and severe or pervasive. It usually involves actions of co-workers that interfere with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The policy defines severe behavior as "that which would be found to be objectionable to a 'reasonable person' under similar circumstances. One incident is generally not enough, unless extremely severe (such as physical assault)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's policy, i.e., the November 30, 2005 Memorandum, explicitly references Title VII, and its statement of what conduct was "illegal and against the policies of the VA" tracks the Title VII regulations regarding sexual harassment at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1604.11(a). Therefore, the AJ erred in not determining whether the agency met its burden to show a Title VII violation, as the appellant asserts on PFR. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980) (an ID must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and include the AJ's conclusions of law and legal reasoning, as well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.111(b). The appellant's petition for review is accordingly GRANTED. A remand for a determination by the AJ is not necessary where the record is sufficiently well-developed and the Board is not basing its findings on witnesses' demeanor. <span class="Italic">See Gregory v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 6 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 232 F.3d 912 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table); <span class="Italic">Uske v.

In this case, the record was fully developed at the hearing, and to the extent the Board's decision regarding the Title VII violation is based on witness demeanor, we defer to the AJ's credibility determination. Therefore, we find that we can adjudicate this appeal at the Board level. <span class="Italic">See Gregory</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 6.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Considerable debate occurs in the courts and at the Board on what is required to establish a Title VII sexual harassment case. The Board's struggle to define actionable misconduct can be traced in the several decisions in the <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> case, <span class="Italic">post</span>, and by the reviewing court's decision in <span class="Italic">King v. Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">post</span>. Practitioners hoped that the Supreme Court would provide a firm analytical model in the 1993 decision in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 17, 19-23, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993). The Court did not. Some guidance was provided, but the result was that harassment would be defined case by case. Of significance, the Court determined that as long as an environment can reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, there is no need for it to also be psychologically injurious. Justice O'Connor, who wrote the Opinion of the Court, explained the background and analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Teresa Harris worked as a manager at Forklift Systems, Inc., an equipment rental company, from April 1985 until October 1987. Charles Hardy was Forklift's president.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Magistrate found that, throughout Harris' time at Forklift, Hardy often insulted her because of her gender and often made her the target of unwanted sexual innuendos. Hardy told Harris on several occasions, in the presence of other employees, "You're a woman, what do you know" and "We need a man as the rental manager"; at least once, he told her she was "a dumb ass woman." Again in front of others, he suggested that the two of them "go to the Holiday Inn to negotiate [Harris'] raise." Hardy occasionally asked Harris and other female employees to get coins from his front pants pocket. He threw objects on the ground in front of Harris and other women, and asked them to pick the objects up. He made sexual innuendos about Harris' and other women's clothing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In mid-August 1987, Harris complained to Hardy about his conduct. Hardy said he was surprised that Harris was offended, claimed he was only joking, and apologized. He also promised he would stop, and based on this assurance Harris stayed on the job. But in early September, Hardy began anew: While Harris was arranging a deal with one of Forklift's customers, he asked her, again in front of other employees, "What did you do, promise the guy...some [sex] Saturday night?" On October 1, Harris collected her paycheck and quit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Harris then sued Forklift, claiming that Hardy's conduct had created an abusive work environment for her because of her gender. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, adopting the report and recommendation of the Magistrate, found this to be "a close case," but held that Hardy's conduct did not create an abusive environment. The court found that some of Hardy's comments "offended [Harris], and would offend the reasonable woman," but that they were not</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"so severe as to be expected to seriously affect [Harris'] psychological well-being. A reasonable woman manager under like circumstances would have been offended by Hardy, but his conduct would not have risen to the level of interfering with that person's work performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"Neither do I believe that [Harris] was subjectively so offended that she suffered injury....&#8197;Although Hardy may at times have genuinely offended [Harris], I do not believe that he created a working environment so poisoned as to be intimidating or abusive to [Harris]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In focusing on the employee's psychological well-being, the District Court was following Circuit precedent....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>...to resolve a conflict among the Circuits on whether conduct, to be actionable as "abusive work environment" harassment (no <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> harassment issue is present here), must "seriously affect [an employee's] psychological well-being" or lead the plaintiff to "suffe[r] injury."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it "an unlawful employment practice for an employer...to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 USC 2000e-2(a)(1). As we made clear in <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed.2d 49 (1986), this language "is not limited to 'economic' or 'tangible' discrimination. The phrase 'terms, conditions, or privileges of employment' evinces a congressional intent 'to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women' in employment," which includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 64, 106 S. Ct., at 2404, quoting <span class="Italic">Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart</span>, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13, 98 S. Ct. 1370, 1374, 55 L. Ed.2d 657 (1978) (some internal quotation marks omitted). When the workplace is permeated with "discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult," 477 U.S., at 65, 106 S. Ct., at 2405, that is "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, at 67, 106 S. Ct., at 2405 (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted), Title VII is violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct that is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. As we pointed out <span id="Page_2652"></span>in <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, "mere utterance of an...epithet which engenders offensive feelings in a employee,"...does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment--an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive--is beyond Title VII's purview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim's employment, and there is no Title VII violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A discriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees' psychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees' job performance, discourage employees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even without regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, religion, or national origin offends Title VII's broad rule of workplace equality. The appalling conduct alleged in <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, and the reference in that case to environments "'so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group workers,'" <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 66, 106 S. Ct., at 2405...merely present some especially egregious examples of harassment. They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore believe the District Court erred in relying on whether the conduct "seriously affect[ed] plaintiff's psychological well-being" or led her to "suffe[r] injury." Such an inquiry may needlessly focus the factfinder's attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not require. Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person's psychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 477 U.S., at 67, 106 S. Ct., at 2405, there is no need for it also to be psychologically injurious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test. We need not answer today all the potential questions it raises, nor specifically address the EEOC's new regulations on this subject, <span class="Italic">see</span> 58 Fed. Reg. 51266 (1993) (proposed 29 CFR 1609.1, 1609.2); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 29 CFR 1604.11 (1993). But we can say that whether an environment is "hostile" or "abusive" can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. The effect on the employee's psychological well-being is, of course, relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive. But while psychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is required.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Justice Scalia provided a concurrence in <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, lamenting the lack of firm guidance from the Court, 510 U.S. at 24-25:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed.2d 49 (1986), held that Title VII prohibits sexual harassment that takes the form of a hostile work environment. The Court stated that sexual harassment is actionable if it is "sufficiently severe or pervasive 'to alter the conditions of [the victim's] employment and create an abusive work environment.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 67, 106 S. Ct., at 2405 (quoting <span class="Italic">Henson v. Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897, 904 (CA11 1982)). Today's opinion elaborates that the challenged conduct must be severe or pervasive enough "to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment--an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive." <span class="Italic">Ante</span>, at 370.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Abusive" (or "hostile," which in this context I take to mean the same thing) does not seem to me a very clear standard--and I do not think clarity is at all increased by adding the adverb "objectively" or by appealing to a "reasonable person's" notion of what the vague word means. Today's opinion does list a number of factors that contribute to abusiveness, <span class="Italic">see ante</span>, at 371, but since it neither says how much of each is necessary (an impossible task) nor identifies any single factor as determinative, it thereby adds little certitude. As a practical matter, today's holding lets virtually unguided juries decide whether sex-related conduct engaged in (or permitted by) an employer is egregious enough to warrant an award of damages. One might say that what constitutes "negligence" (a traditional jury question) is not much more clear and certain than what constitutes "abusiveness." Perhaps so. But the class of plaintiffs seeking to recover for negligence is limited to those who have suffered harm, whereas under this statute "abusiveness" is to be the test of whether legal harm has been suffered, opening more expansive vistas of litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Be that as it may, I know of no alternative to the course the Court today has taken. One of the factors mentioned in the Court's nonexhaustive list--whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance--would, if it were made an absolute test, provide greater guidance to juries and employers. But I see no basis for such a limitation in the language of the statute. Accepting <span class="Italic">Meritor's</span> interpretation of the term "conditions of employment" as the law, the test is not whether work has been impaired, but whether working conditions have been discriminatorily altered. I know of no test more faithful to the inherently vague statutory language than the one the Court today adopts. For these reasons, I join the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc.</span>, 118 S. Ct. 998, 1003 (1998) (directing courts and juries to use common sense and "an appropriate regard to social context" to distinguish innocuous behavior from conduct that a reasonable person would find severely hostile or abusive) [discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-15-172.html#sec8-171">Homosexual Conduct</a>"] ; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Daigle v.

<p class="Body-Text">A pattern of behavior is not necessary to establish sexual harassment. The Board considers the severity of the misconduct along with its frequency to determine whether the conduct rises to the level of sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lowe v. DOJ</span>, 63 MSPR 73, 77 (1994) (four incidents over six weeks, two involving offensive touching (citing <span class="Italic">King v. Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d 1572 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is irrelevant that witnesses doubted the alleged victim's perception. The correct question regarding perception in such a case is whether the alleged discrimination would detrimentally affect a reasonable person of the same sex in that position<span class="Italic">. See King v. Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d 1572, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Moreover, the alleged victim must also subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive<span class="Italic">. See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.</span>, 114 S. Ct. 367, 370 (1993)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The RD also appears to ignore another basic tenet of law with regard to sexual harassment. When there are multiple incidents and victims, it is the cumulative effect of the offensive behavior that creates the hostile working environment<span class="Italic">. See King v. Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d at 1577, 1581 (discussing and applying "entirety of the offensive behavior" standard required by <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57 (1986)). Thus the correct legal methodology in exploring the issue of whether unwelcome sexual conduct created a hostile environment is to consider the totality of the circumstances, including the entirety of the alleged perpetrator's conduct towards all the alleged victims. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1582. It does not appear from the RD that the ALJ considered the entirety of the alleged offensive behavior. Rather, the RD appears to have considered the individual incidents in a piecemeal fashion....&#8197;The consistency or commonality with other evidence is also one of the factors to consider in assessing the credibility of witnesses<span class="Italic">. See Hillen</span>, 35 MSPR at 460. The ALJ's failure to make such an analysis was error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Definitions of sexual harassment become somewhat confused if an attempt is made to tie them to a particular statute or regulation. Definitions of sexual harassment vary. The term may be defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. A finding of sexual harassment does not require a personnel action to have been taken. A charge of sexual harassment does not require actual or threatened loss of job benefits by the victim. There can be lesser or other conditions of harassment. The issue is one of a "but for" analysis: whether the condition placed on a female relating to employment would have been placed on a male, or whether, but for the employee's womanhood, her participation in sexual activity would have been solicited. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Russell</span>, 28 MSPR 162, 171 (1985). A supervisor engages in sexual harassment if employment opportunities of subordinates are conditioned on acquiescence to advances or sexual propositions. Sexual harassment can occur even when the appellant does not retaliate; sexually-oriented conduct of an offensive nature is often tolerated by female employees to keep their jobs. It occurs if a substantially discriminatory work environment is created by offensive behavior against female employees. Sexual harassment also occurs as a result of sexually-oriented conduct that has the effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. <span class="Italic">Jones v. DOJ</span>, 24 MSPR 230, 234 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Walls v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 274, 277 (1982) ("In general, a supervisory employee engages in sexual harassment where employment opportunities of subordinates are conditioned on acquiescence to advances or sexual propositions. However, sexual harassment may also occur even if the supervisory employee does not retaliate against an employee who fails to reciprocate his advances, since sexually oriented conduct of an offensive nature is often tolerated by female employees in order to keep their jobs. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Tennessee Valley Authority,</span> 4 MSPR 411 (1980). As the court stated in <span class="Italic">Bundy v. Jackson,</span> 641 F.2d 934, 943-944, (D.C. Cir. 1981), sexual harassment occurs where a substantially discriminatory work environment is created by offensive behavior directed toward female employees, regardless of whether the complaining employees lost any tangible job benefits as a result of the discrimination.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On occasion the Board has some difficulty describing when sexual harassment occurs a work environment. Purely social occasions are not likely to support harassment charges against supervisors. In <span class="Italic">Grubka v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 858 F.2d <span id="Page_2653"></span>1570, 1572, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (following remand, 40 MSPR 31 (1989)), it was a Halloween party that made the case. A few agency supervisors attended the party, held after hours in a hotel, hosted to entertain some trainees. Someone brought a camera and a few pictures were posed of a trainee kissing a supervisor. The court, examining the evidence in some detail, determined that the AJ completely mischaracterized the intent of those involved in the party and improperly attributed sexual harassment to conduct that amounted to nothing more than what the court called "the prevailing atmosphere...loose and easy going, as could be expected at a Halloween party." The court concluded that the charges against the appellant were frivolous. But the court did not stop there; it went on to lambaste the Board's analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While it is true that ordinarily the question of credibility is left to the AJ, this is not an inflexible rule and will not be enforced if the credibility determination is inherently improbable or discredited by undisputed fact. We think that is the situation here. In his decision, the AJ stated, in referring to the actions of Grubka: "After going too far, he was caught." There is no basis for this statement. It shows undeniable bias on the part of the AJ against Grubka, and makes the AJ partisan against Grubka when he should have been neutral and nonpartisan. This statement tainted his decision on credibility in this charge, as well as in all of the other charges in this case....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerning the basic issue--sexual harassment--the <span class="Italic">Grubka</span> court said of a charge that the appellant sexually harassed one of the trainees after the party, 858 F.2d at 1574:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the merits of the stairwell charge, we point out that the mission of the IRS is to collect taxes for the Government. It is commendable on the part of that agency to desire in tax matters that its agents be above suspicion like Caesar's wife. But in this case the agency apparently departed from its tax collecting mission and assumed the role of chaperon of its agents at an after hour Halloween social party at a private hotel away from the workplace....&#8197;What happened there was a private matter between them and had nothing to do with their work or the agency's mission of collecting taxes, and was not a matter of official concern to the agency. We hold that the charge was unfounded, frivolous....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When conduct charged as sexual harassment occurs in the working environment, the conduct must be placed into the context of that environment, as the Federal Circuit explained when it resolved that removal of an individual with 25 years of service was unwarranted, <span class="Italic">LaFever v. USDA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2692):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The sustained charge of sexual harassment was serious, but there were significant mitigating factors. According to the presiding official, there was testimony by "numerous witnesses...that the atmosphere in petitioner's office could best be described as 'informal' or 'casual'; that joking and teasing among employees were commonplace occurrences; and that it was not unusual for male and female employees to be seen embracing and/or kissing. Most of the witnesses testified that they were comfortable with this type of environment and expressed the opinion that it did not adversely affect the productivity of the office; however, a few witnesses indicated that they were offended by this 'loose' atmosphere or felt uncomfortable in it. There was also testimony that some of the women employees "embraced petitioner at the office in what was described as a friendly manner with no sexual overtones." There appear to have been no previous actions against petitioner, or even warnings, with respect to his conduct toward female employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">LaFever</span> returned to the Board on remand at 31 MSPR 644, 647 (1986). The conduct was considered to fall in the lower range of the agency table of penalties category for harassment. A 30-day suspension was imposed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sexual harassment may involve a combination of offensive behaviors. One subordinate complained that the appellant constantly made invitations and advances, causing her to be put on medication and light duty. Another woman testified that the appellant's repeated physical and verbal advances shocked and scared her, putting her in fear of losing her job. Removal was sustained. <span class="Italic">Carosella v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 199, 202-03 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Carosella v. USPS</span>, 816 F.2d 638 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Agency sexual harassment policy was violated by an appellant's statements and behavior that interfered with an employee's performance and created an offensive environment when the Board linked the appellant's conduct to the employee's deteriorating work performance and general demeanor. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 309, 323-24 (1993).

USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 320, 325 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Harassment may include conduct that is sexual as well as nonsexual. The analysis is to encompass the totality of circumstances, as a private sector case, <span class="Italic">O'Rourke v. City of Providence</span>, 235 F.3d 713, 727-30 (1st Cir. 2001), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By its nature, a hostile work environment often means that there are a series of events which mount over time to create such a poisonous atmosphere as to violate the law....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[S]ex-based harassment that is not overtly sexual is nonetheless actionable under Title VII, so evidence of that sort may be admissible. "Alleged conduct that is not explicitly racial in nature may, in appropriate circumstances, be considered along with more overtly discriminatory conduct in assessing a Title VII harassment claim." <span class="Italic">Landrau-Romero v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico</span>, 212 F.3d 607, 614 (1st Cir. 2000), (citing <span class="Italic">DeGrace v. Rumsfeld</span>, 614 F.2d 796, 800 (1st Cir. 1980) (evidence of equipment sabotage and co-workers' "silent treatment" considered along with racially explicit notes)). That reasoning applies equally to sexual harassment: where a plaintiff endures harassing conduct, although not explicitly sexual in nature, which undermines her ability to succeed at her job, those acts should be considered along with overtly sexually abusive conduct in assessing a hostile work environment claim. <span class="Italic">See Lipsett</span>, 864 F.2d at 905 (conduct that was not explicitly sexual was "nonetheless charged with anti-female animus, and therefore could be found to have contributed significantly to the hostile environment")....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Courts should avoid disaggregating a hostile work environment claim, dividing conduct into instances of sexually oriented conduct and instances of unequal treatment, then discounting the latter category of conduct. Such an approach defies the <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> Court's directive to consider the totality of circumstances in each case and "rob[s] the incidents of their cumulative effect." <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 187 F.3d at 561. Moreover, such an approach not only ignores the reality that incidents of nonsexual conduct--such as work sabotage, exclusion, denial of support, and humiliation--can in context contribute to a hostile work environment, it also nullifies the harassing nature of that conduct. An employer might escape liability, even if it knew about certain conduct, if that conduct is isolated from a larger pattern of acts that, as a whole, would constitute an actionable hostile work environment....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of significance is not the intent of the employee charged with harassment but rather the reasonable perceptions of the victim of the alleged harassment. <span class="Italic">King v. Frazier</span>, 77 F.3d 1361, 1362-64 (Fed. Cir. 1996), emphasized the point that sexual harassment is examined from the perspective of the victim rather than the offender. That the offender believes his conduct is innocuous, or that the conduct is not carried out with evil intent, does not excuse the conduct or, apparently, ameliorate the severity of a penalty. The court explained as it reinstated a disciplinary suspension--initially set aside by an arbitrator--of an employee who repeatedly made offensive comments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he arbitrator stated that resolution of the case turned on whether Mr. Frazier knew or should have known that his conduct constituted sexual harassment. Based upon the evidence presented, the arbitrator decided that "Mr. Frazier did not know right from wrong," did not know that his conduct constituted sexual harassment, and was "not guilty" of sexual harassment. Therefore, the arbitrator reversed the agency's 60-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director of OPM appeals the arbitrator's decision to this court. We have jurisdiction to review his petition pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(d) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM first contends that the arbitrator incorrectly interpreted and applied the legal standard for sexual harassment in the federal workplace. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's policy statement defines sexual harassment as "deliberate or repeated unsolicited verbal comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature which are unwelcome." This statement tracks the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines, which we have interpreted in the past. In <span class="Italic">King v. Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d 1572, 1579-80 (Fed. Cir. 1994), we synthesized recent Supreme Court precedent with the EEOC guidelines for sexual harassment. We stated that sexual harassment exists "if the offensive conduct is based on the employee's sex, is unwelcome, and is sufficiently severe or pervasive to interfere with the employee's job performance or to create an abusive work environment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1580.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This test requires both an objective and subjective inquiry. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1582; <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.</span>, [510 U.S. 17], 114 S. Ct. 367, 370, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993). The objective inquiry requires the decisionmaker to determine whether a reasonable person would find the misconduct hostile or abusive<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The subjective inquiry requires the decisionmaker to determine whether the victim perceived the misconduct as creating a hostile or abusive environment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Both inquiries, however, require that sexual harassment be judged from the perspective of the one being harassed. <span class="Italic">King</span>, 21 F.3d at 1582-83; <span class="Italic">cf. Ellison v. Brady</span>, 924 F.2d 872, 878 (9th Cir. 1991) ("[I]n evaluating the severity and pervasiveness of sexual harassment, we should focus on the perspective of the victim.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon this precedent, the arbitrator should have evaluated whether Mr. Frazier's conduct created a hostile or abusive environment from the perspective of the one being harassed. Instead, it is apparent that he viewed the situation from Mr. Frazier's perspective by introducing intent as an element of the offense. By so requiring, the arbitrator improperly borrowed the <span class="Italic">mens rea</span> requirement from criminal law and interjected it into sexual harassment law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the arbitrator never applied this legal standard, we reverse <span id="Page_2654"></span>his decision on this charge. Remand is unnecessary, however, because the evidence presented satisfies the legal standard. Objectively, the arbitrator found that Mr. Frazier made "statements to another which are patently notoriously disgraceful and contrary to acceptable conduct by most of society." Subjectively, the arbitrator found that Mr. Frazier "made many statements of a sexual nature directly to the witnesses [the victims]...which they found distressful." Therefore, both the objective and subjective requirements of the sexual harassment test are met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also contends that the arbitrator erred by injecting an intent requirement into civil service law. On the facts of this case, and for the reasons explained below, we agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A governmental agency may discipline an employee "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a) (1994). This requires a showing that: (1) the employee engaged in misconduct; and (2) there exists a nexus between the misconduct and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 526-27 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Even if the case involves a collective bargaining agreement, the arbitrator may not apply legal standards which conflict with this standard. <span class="Italic">See Devine v. Levin</span>, 739 F.2d 1567, 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Devine v. Brisco</span>, 733 F.2d 867, 871 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, the arbitrator found that Mr. Frazier engaged in notoriously disgraceful conduct. After making this finding of fact, the arbitrator should have inquired whether Mr. Frazier's misconduct affected the efficiency of the service. Instead, the arbitrator cited <span class="Italic">Murray v. Department of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 250 (1989), for the proposition that the employee must have an intent to commit the misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator's reliance upon <span class="Italic">Murray</span> is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Murray</span>, the agency charged the employee with two separate offenses: (1) making false accusations against co-workers; and (2) creating a disturbance in the workplace through rude remarks. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 252. As to the first offense, the Board required a showing of wrongful intent because an intent to deceive is a specific element of that offense. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 255. As to the second offense, however, the Board explicitly stated that &#x00A7; 7513(a) does not require that the misconduct result from wrongful intent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 255-56. Similarly, intent is not an element of the notoriously disgraceful charge levelled against Mr. Frazier.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the arbitrator's failure to address the nexus requirement, we conclude that it is satisfied in the present case. Our precedent makes clear that the requisite nexus is presumed in cases where the employee's misconduct is so egregious that it speaks for itself. <span class="Italic">Brook</span>, 999 F.2d at 527-28; <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Department of Navy</span>, 727 F.2d 1535, 1539 (Fed. Cir. 1984). This presumption is bolstered in cases where the agency can prove that the employee engaged in sexual harassment, as is the case here. <span class="Italic">Cf. Cooper v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States</span>, 226 Ct. Cl. 75, 639 F.2d 727, 729-30 (1980) ("We do not quarrel with the Government's finding that sexual misconduct adversely affects the employer-employee relationship."). Because Mr. Frazier has introduced no evidence to rebut this presumption, we reverse the arbitrator's decision on this charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having found that Mr. Frazier engaged in egregious misconduct, the arbitrator was required to follow established precedent in evaluating the legal ramifications thereof. Instead, he excused Mr. Frazier because Mr. Frazier supposedly could not discern right from wrong. This approach was erroneous. Because the evidence amply supports the requirements of both charges, we reverse the arbitrator's decision and reinstate the agency's 60-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The presumption of nexus in <span class="Italic">King</span> was elaborated on in <span class="Italic">Pope v. USPS</span>, 114 F.3d 1144, 1147-48 (Fed. Cir. 1997), transforming the presumption of nexus arising from sexual harassment to a presumption of both harassment and impairment of service efficiency by proscribed sexual conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service responds that it need not prove that Mr. Pope's actions created a hostile work environment because our case law creates a presumption of harm once the agency has proven underlying actions of a sexual nature. In support of its position, the Postal Service cites our decision in <span class="Italic">King v. Frazier</span>, 77 F.3d 1361, 1363-64 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service's position is off the mark because it misinterprets our precedent in this area of law. Our precedent makes clear that in certain situations, <span class="Italic">once the charged misconduct has been proven</span> there exists a presumption that the proven misconduct harms the efficiency of the service. Sexual harassment is one such example; tardiness is another.[2] <span class="Italic">King</span>, 77 F.3d at 1364; <span class="Italic">Davis v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 792 F.2d 1111, 1113 (Fed. Cir. 1986). This presumption, however, is directed to the second requirement that an agency must meet, i.e., that the charged conduct harmed the efficiency of the service. This presumption does not in any way affect the agency's burden of proof on the charged conduct itself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;When the charged misconduct is sexual harassment similar to that defined in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines, an agency must prove that "the offensive conduct is based on the employee's sex, is unwelcome, and is sufficiently severe or pervasive to interfere with the employee's job performance or to create an abusive work environment." <span class="Italic">King v. Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d 1572, 1579-80 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Only after it has made this proof may an agency rely on the presumption of harm to the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service argues that, regardless, once it has proven that an employee engaged in actions of a sexual nature towards another employee, there should exist a presumption that those actions created a hostile work environment. In other words, the Postal Service argues that there should exist a double presumption for such cases: a first (new) presumption that the employee's actions created a hostile work environment, and a second (old) presumption that the hostile work environment harmed the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Postal Service that such a double presumption can exist in cases where the employee is charged with creating a hostile work environment through actions sexual in nature. This conclusion makes explicit what was implicit in our precedent, namely that certain actions of a sexual nature are presumed to harm the efficiency of the service <span class="Italic">because</span> they create a hostile or abusive work environment. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 77 F.3d at 1364 (citing <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 527-28 (Fed. Cir. 1993) and<span class="Italic"> Hayes</span>, 727 F.2d at 1539, for the proposition that harm to the efficiency of the service is presumed in cases where the employee's misconduct is so egregious that it speaks for itself); <span class="Italic">cf. Cooper v. United States</span>, 226 Ct. Cl. 75, 639 F.2d 727, 729-30 (1980) ("We do not quarrel with the Government's finding that sexual misconduct adversely affects the employer-employee relationship."). In other words, the same kind and degree of sexual misconduct that gives rise to a presumption of harm to the efficiency of the service will also give rise to a presumption that it created a hostile work environment. We emphasize, however, that by creating a new presumption (that certain actions of a sexual nature create a hostile work environment), we are not creating a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule whereby an agency automatically prevails. Instead, we merely allocate burdens of production.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under this approach, once an employee initiates review of the agency action at the Board, the agency bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee engaged in actions of a sexual nature, i.e., the specifications underlying the charge of creating a hostile work environment. If the agency does so, the Board may presume that those actions created a hostile or abusive work environment and that the hostile work environment harms the efficiency of the service. The appellant may rebut either presumption by producing evidence demonstrating that, on the facts of the particular case, the appellant's actions did not create a hostile work environment or did not harm the efficiency of the service.[3] Unless the appellant does so, the agency's action should be sustained as long as the penalty imposed is reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that throughout this process, the agency retains the burden of persuasion, i.e., it must prove the charged conduct by a preponderance of the evidence. The presumption governs only the burden of producing evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that our resolution of this case is driven by the nature of the Postal Service's charge, namely "creating a hostile work environment." As we have explained in the past, an agency need not wait until an employee's misconduct rises to something akin to a sexual harassment violation. <span class="Italic">Carosella v. United States Postal Service</span>, 816 F.2d 638, 642-43 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Instead, an agency may take adverse action against any employee whose misconduct harms the efficiency of its service. Whatever misconduct an agency chooses to charge, however, must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency charges an employee with violating its sexual harassment policy and that policy explicitly references the Title VII standard, including the creation of a hostile working environment, the Title VII standard must be applied, and the agency is required to prove that the appellant's conduct violated Title VII. <span class="Italic">Viens v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 92 MSPR 256, 261 &#x00B6; 6 (2002). An example of conduct not sustained under a charge of sexual harassment tied to Title VII definitions is <span class="Italic">Salazar v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 88 MSPR 161, 162-66 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-15 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency suspended the appellant for 30 days, and directed him to attend sexual harassment training, based upon the charge of inappropriate conduct that violated the "Savannah River Operations Office Policy on Sexual Harassment, SRP 98-04." Specifically, the agency charged that, upon seeing a picture of Stephanie Reel, an employee for a government subcontractor, in an agency newsletter, the appellant called Ms. Reel, told her several times that she was beautiful, asked if she was married, and when she replied yes, told her that her husband was a lucky man.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sexual harassment appeals, the Board gives careful scrutiny to the policy at issue, and to whether the policy tracks the Title VII requirements. Where an agency charges an employee with violating its sexual harassment policy, and not with violating Title VII, the agency is required to prove only that the appellant's conduct violated that policy. <span class="Italic">See Alsedek v. Department of the</span> Army, 58 MSPR 229, 234-35 (1993). In <span id="Page_2655"></span><span class="Italic">Alsedek,</span> the agency policy made no mention of the creation of a "hostile environment," as Title VII requires in pertinent part, nor did the agency proposal refer to it. The decision letter there explicitly stated that the agency was applying agency policy and not Title VII. Thus, the Board concluded that the administrative judge erroneously applied Title VII standards. The Board more recently followed the <span class="Italic">Alsedek</span> analysis in <span class="Italic">Cisneros v. Department of Defense,</span> 83 MSPR 390, 393-96 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> No. 993463, 2000 WL 1544772 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 10, 2000) (NP). There, the agency policy defined sexual harassment without specific reference to Federal law, except to state generally that covered conduct also violated state and Federal law. In both cases, because the agency's policy set forth a lower threshold for proving sexual harassment, the agency was required only to meet that standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, however, an agency policy explicitly references Title VII, and its standards, including creating a hostile working environment, Title VII standards must be applied and, to be actionable, the misconduct must violate those standards, notwithstanding the agency's statement in its notice and decision letters that the charged conduct violated agency policy. <span class="Italic">See King v. Hillen,</span> 21 F.3d 1572, 1572-79 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Similarly, where the agency regulation cited in the proposal notice mirrors the language of the Title VII's implementing regulations, the proper standard for judging the alleged misconduct is the definition of sexual harassment at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1604.11<span class="Italic">. See Lowe v. Department of Justice,</span> 63 MSPR 73, 76-77 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, a review of the agency's policy, and its proposal and decision letters, establishes that the agency's policy mirrors Title VII and its implementing regulation. The agency's sexual harassment regulation, SRP 98-04, first states that its objective is to provide a work environment free from sexual harassment and to ensure all employees are committed to this goal. It also states as a "Directive" that sexual harassment will not be tolerated, and that 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11 defines sexual harassment; it then sets forth that regulation's definition of conduct constituting sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11 states that sexual harassment violates Title VII, and defines circumstances constituting sexual harassment. It provides that "[u]nwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(a). The regulations also state that the EEOC will examine the record as a whole and the totality of the circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred, to determine whether the alleged conduct constitutes sexual harassment. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The policy statement also lists additional specific acts that "may" constitute sexual harassment at the agency. It states that sexual harassment "may" include the following conduct: letters, telephone calls, or distribution or display of materials of a sexually explicit suggestive nature; deliberate touching, leaning over, cornering, or pinching; sexually suggestive looks or gestures; requests, suggestions, or pressure for sexual favors; sexual teasing, jokes, remarks, questions, or other sexually offensive comments; or pressure for a dating or personal relationship. Finally, the policy statement reads that "whether invited or uninvited, such actions have no place in the [agency] environment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, this policy does not provide any greater restrictions on conduct than those found in Title VII and its regulations. Indeed, on its face, the policy merely quotes the elements of a sexual harassment charge under section 1604.11. While the statement includes a list of illustrative conduct, the list does not create a "stricter" standard by making actionable any conduct which does not otherwise violate the law or regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's proposal and decision letters further support the conclusion that the agency based its action on Title VII standards. The proposal notice alleges that the appellant's conduct was "pervasive," and the decision letter directly quotes section 1604.11, as that section is mirrored in the agency's policy. The decision letter also specifically concludes that the appellant created a hostile working environment through his alleged misconduct. We therefore conclude. that the agency's internal sexual harassment policy is co-extensive with Title VII standards, and that the agency must prove that the appellant's alleged misconduct constituted sexual harassment under Title VII.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has held that Title VII is violated when the workplace is permeated with unwelcome discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment. <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2405-06, 91 L. Ed.2d 49(1986). The Court has explained that this standard for determining whether conduct violates Title VII takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct that is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. It has said that mere utterance of an epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII, and that conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment--an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive--is beyond Title VII's purview. It has also stated that, if the victim has not subjectively perceived the environment as abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim's employment and there is no Title VII violation. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,</span> 510 U.S. 17, 114 S. Ct. 367, 370-71, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court has further indicated that the determination as to whether the environment is hostile or abusive must be made by examining all the circumstances. These may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance, and whether it unreasonably interfered with an employee's work performance. The Court also held that the effect on the employee's psychological well being is relevant to determining whether the victim actually found the environment abusive, but psychological harm is not required for a finding of harassment. <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 114 S. Ct. at 371. It has also explained that simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment that would constitute sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 2283, 141 L. Ed.2d 662 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the Court's decisions concerning sexual harassment under Title VII, and the provisions of section 1604.11, to the conduct at issue yields the conclusion that the agency has not proven a violation of Title VII. The appellant's misconduct, the single telephone call to Ms. Reel, does not violate Title VII because it was an isolated incident that was not extremely serious and did not appear to unreasonably interfere with Ms. Reel's work performance.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...An employer is not required to tolerate the disruption and inefficiencies caused by a hostile workplace environment until the wrongdoer has so clearly violated the law that the victims are sure to prevail in a Title VII action.

Sundowner Offshore Serv., Inc.</span>, 523 U.S. 75, 80 (1998) (emphasis in original). "The critical issue, Title VII's text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the district court that while Bowman recites a litany of perceived slights and abuses, many of the alleged harassing acts cannot be considered in the hostile environment analysis because Bowman has not shown that the alleged harassment was based upon his status as a male. Bowman, while alleging that Jahnke tormented him personally, has not show that the non-sexual harassment had an anti-male bias. In Title VII actions, however, it is important to distinguish between harassment and discriminatory harassment in order to "ensure that Title VII does not become a general civility code." <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775, 788 (1998) (citation omitted). In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, evidence that the plaintiff was ostracized on myriad instances when others were not, combined with gender-specific epithets used, such as "slut" and "fucking women," was sufficient to create an inference that her gender was the motivating impulse for her co-workers' behavior and allowed the non-sexual harassment to be considered in the hostile environment analysis<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 187 F.3d at 565-66. Unlike the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, Bowman has not alleged that Jahnke made a single comment evincing an anti-male bias. Besides a bare and unsupported assertion that some women employees were allowed to engage in work outside the University while he was not, Bowman has not shown that the non-sexual conduct he complains of had anything to do with his gender. While he may have been subject to intimidation, ridicule, and mistreatment, he has not shown that he was treated in a discriminatory manner because of his gender.</p>
