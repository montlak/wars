<p class="noindent">Revisiting the statute, under 5 USC 7111:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(f)&#x2003;Exclusive recognition shall not be provided to a labor organization:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;if there is then in effect a lawful written collective bargaining agreement between the agency involved and an exclusive representative (other than the labor organization seeking exclusive recognition) covering any employees included in the unit specified in the petition, unless--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;the collective bargaining agreement has been in effect for more than 3 years, or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;the petition for exclusive recognition is filed not more than 105 days and not less than 60 days before the expiration date of the collective bargaining agreement;. . .</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the regulation, 5 CFR 2422.12 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What circumstances does the Region consider to determine whether your petition is timely filed?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="italic">Election bar</span>. Where there is no certified exclusive representative, a petition seeking an election will not be considered timely if filed within twelve (12) months of a valid election involving the same unit or a subdivision of the same unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="italic">Certification bar</span>. Where there is a certified exclusive representative of employees, a petition seeking an election will not be considered timely if filed within twelve (12) months after the certification of the exclusive representative of the employees in an appropriate unit. If a collective bargaining agreement covering the claimed unit is pending agency head <span id="page_133"></span>review under 5 U.S.C. 7114(c) or is in effect, paragraphs (c), (d), or (e) of this section apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="italic">Bar during 5 U.S.C. 7114(c) agency head review</span>. A petition seeking an election will not be considered timely if filed during the period of agency head review under 5 U.S.C. 7114(c). This bar expires upon either the passage of thirty (30) days absent agency head action, or upon the date of any timely agency head action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="italic">Contract bar where the contract is for three (3) years or less</span>. Where a collective bargaining agreement is in effect covering the claimed unit and has a term of three (3) years or less from the date it became effective, a petition seeking an election will be considered timely if filed not more than one hundred and five (105) and not less than sixty (60) days before the expiration of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="italic">Contract bar where the contract is for more than three (3) years</span>. Where a collective bargaining agreement is in effect covering the claimed unit and has a term of more than three (3) years from the date on which it became effective, a petition seeking an election will be considered timely if filed not more than one hundred and five (105) and not less than sixty (60) days before the expiration of the initial three (3) year period, and any time after the expiration of the initial three (3) year period.</p>
<p class="noindent">The statute is designed to avoid lengthy contracts that bar outside unions from the opportunity to gain recognition status through elections. Many contracts are for terms of three years with automatic renewal (unless renegotiation is sought). Some contracts go on for decades. The automatic renewal provision may create problems for those trying to determine the open period for filing a representation petition. </p>
<p class="noindent">Contracts with automatic renewal clauses present complications concerning agency head review and the calculation of the "open window" for filing a petition for recognition by a competing union. Seeking to encourage the stability of contractual relations that is brought about by automatic renewal of contracts and seeking to provide a uniform means of determining the renewal date of those contracts, <span class="Italic">Kan. Army Nat'l Guard and ACT, Kan. Army Chap.</span>, 47 FLRA 937, 940-44 (1993), explained that unlike an initial or renegotiated agreement, the effective date of a renewed agreement is not necessarily the date of approval or the thirty-first day after execution. The effective date is the date previously set by the parties for the renewal of the agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the context of an agreement that is being negotiated for the first time or that is being renegotiated, we have held that for purposes of triggering the time limits for section 7114(c) review, the date of execution is the date on which no further action is necessary to finalize a complete agreement....&#8197;Once execution occurs, if the agency head neither approves nor disapproves the agreement within the prescribed 30-day period, the agreement takes effect automatically on the thirty-first day after execution....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally, an automatic renewal provision of a contract provides that the contract shall continue in effect after its expiration date if no action to amend or terminate it is taken within a specified period prior to its expiration date....&#8197;Such automatic renewal provisions typically operate based on a fixed anniversary date that constitutes the point at which the contract "rolls over" or renews itself....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Automatic renewal of agreements has long been a wide-spread practice in the private sector....&#8197;In the private sector, it has been observed that "[i]t has never been doubted that such agreements are in harmony with the policy of the [National Labor Relations] Act."...&#8197;It is our experience that such agreements are also a wide-spread practice in the Federal sector....&#8197;The availability of automatic renewal of agreements contributes to the stability of employer-employee relations....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find that in the context of such an agreement, the determination of, and the relationship between, the execution and effective dates of an automatically renewed agreement often operate differently than in the context of an initial or renegotiated agreement. Initially, we note that an automatically renewed agreement is subject to agency-head approval under section 7114(c) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1931 and Department of the Navy, Naval Weapons Station, Concord, California</span>, 32 FLRA 1023, 1071 (1988)....&#8197;In this regard, while the terms of the agreement do not change, it is possible that applicable laws and regulations with which the agreement must comply may have changed during its term. The purpose of section 7114(c) is to ensure that collective bargaining agreements conform to applicable laws and regulations....&#8197;That purpose applies to automatically renewed agreements as well as to initial or renegotiated agreements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As this case demonstrates, the principles that apply to the operation of section 7114(c) in the context of an initial or renegotiated agreement are incompatible with some of the fundamental aspects of agreements that are the result of automatic renewal. In particular, rigid application of those principles would preclude the establishment of a fixed, uniform anniversary date. For example, in this case, after the initial term of the agreement, the effective date of any renewal would become either the date on which the agency head approved the renewed agreement or the thirty-first day after execution of the renewed agreement. As a result, in all likelihood, the effective date would no longer correspond to the anniversary date referred to in the duration clause, creating ambiguity and confusion concerning the expiration date of the renewed agreement. Thus, the stability and predictability that the concept of automatic renewal offers would be seriously undermined.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a collective bargaining agreement automatically renews without further action by the parties, we hold that for purposes of triggering the time limits for section 7114(c) review, the execution date is the same as that which applies to initial or renegotiated agreements; namely, it is the date on which no further action is necessary to finalize a complete agreement. We find that in the circumstances of this case, that date was the point at which the time limits for making a request to renegotiate the agreement expired with no timely request forthcoming. However, we conclude that unlike an initial or renegotiated agreement, the effective date of a renewed agreement is not necessarily the date of approval or the thirty-first day after execution. Rather, the effective date is the date previously set by the parties for the renewal of the agreement. We find that this interpretation of section 7114(c) preserves the uniformity of the anniversary date and permits the orderly and predictable operation of automatic renewal provisions of collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We emphasize that in the context of automatically renewed agreements, an agency is limited to a period of thirty days running from the date of execution in which to conduct its review under section 7114(c) of the Statute. Thus, in the circumstances of this case, the period for agency head review under section 7114(c) commenced on February 11, 1992, the day after the expiration of the contractual window period for requesting renegotiation of the expiring agreement, and ended 30 days thereafter on March 11, 1992, well before the effective date of the renewed agreement. The record in this case does not establish that the parties intended the finalizing of an agreement to be dependent on further action. Thus, the circumstances present in this case are distinguishable from those present in <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span>, 44 FLRA at 57-58, where we found that it was evident from the record that the parties intended to have further action beyond what is normally construed to constitute execution of an agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the RD's conclusion that the provisions of Article 26 of the agreement involved in this case were merely a restatement of the agency's rights under section 7114(c) of the Statute. Under that section, the agency head is not obligated to conduct a review of an agreement entered into locally but is provided the opportunity to conduct a review<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Engraving and Printing</span>, 44 FLRA at 939 (1992) (Section 7114(c)(1) of the Statute states only that agreements shall "be subject to" agency head approval; the mechanics for approval of an agreement are management's responsibility; and an agency cannot avoid an agreement reached with a union based on its failure to seek agency head review.). Thus, we reject ACT's claim that the failure of the Activity to submit the renewed agreement for agency head review prevented the renewed agreement from going into effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we agree with the RD that the renewed agreement was in effect on the date that ACT's petition was filed. No party involved in this case denies that, if the agreement automatically renewed, under the terms set forth in Article 26 the effective date as well as the expiration date were clear and unambiguous. An agreement serves as a bar if its effective date, duration, and termination date are ascertainable from the agreement and relevant accompanying documentation, such as that relating to agency head approval of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration</span>, 44 FLRA 230, 244 (1992). Having concluded that the agreement between NAGE and the Activity did renew automatically, we find that the renewed agreement constituted a bar to ACT's petition. We recognize that ACT may have had to obtain information from a source other than the agreement itself concerning whether the agreement had in fact automatically renewed in order to determine whether the agreement was in effect. This fact, however, does not negate the validity of the agreement as a bar to the petition. This is no different than the action that any union contemplating a challenge to an incumbent exclusive representative must take to ascertain whether a collective bargaining agreement exists that could serve to bar a petition.</p>
<p class="noindent">A contractual rollover provision was a contract bar in <span class="Italic">NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 67 FLRA 670, 678-79 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to bar a petition, an agreement must contain a clear and unambiguous effective date and must clearly set forth its duration so that any potential challenging party may determine when the open period will occur.[128] In this regard, &#x00A7; 2422.12(h) of the Authority's Regulations provides that collective-bargaining agreements, including agreements that automatically renew without further action by the parties, "are not a bar to a petition seeking an election...unless a clear effective date, renewal date where applicable, duration, and termination date are ascertainable <span id="page_134"></span>from the agreement and relevant accompanying documentation."[129] The effective date of an agreement that automatically renews is "the date previously set by the parties for the renewal of the agreement."[130]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner claims that the RD erred by failing to find that the agreement lacks a clear and unambiguous effective date.&#x2003;For support, the Petitioner asserts that Article 37, Section 37.02's "use of the term 'expiration date' is in direct conflict with Section 37.01's use of the term 'continue in effect from year to year.'" In addition, the Petitioner claims that the RD erred by finding that the agreement renews from year to year. In this connection, the Petitioner notes that the agreement states that it "shall continue in effect from year to year unless amended, modified, or terminated," and does not use the words "renew, renewal, or rollover." According to the Petitioner, there are "significant legal difference[s]" between these various terms. Specifically, the Petitioner contends that the term "continue" does not imply that the agreement "expires annually and then automatically renews with a new effective date every year." Instead, the Petitioner asserts, "the effective date of the [agreement] remains October 23, 2000," and the agreement's "duration is seamless and has no expiration date."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, the RD found it "undisputed" that the effective date of the initial, three-year agreement was October 23, 2000, the date when NASA Headquarters approved it, and that this effective date appears on the cover and the signature page of the agreement. And, contrary to the Petitioner's claim, the terms of the agreement are not in conflict. In this regard, Article 37, Section 37.01 provides that the agreement continues "in full force and effect for three...years from the date of approval by the NASA Administrator"--October 23, 2000--"and thereafter shall continue in effect from year to year unless amended, modified[,] or terminated in accordance with this Article." Article 37, Section 37.02 provides that either party may give written notice and proposed modifications "not more than ninety..., nor less than sixty...[,] calendar days prior to the [three-year] expiration date and each subsequent expiration date," and that the agreement "will remain in full force and effect until modifications are agreed upon and approved by the NASA Administrator or his/her designee." Nothing in these two contractual sections, alone or in combination, is unclear. And the Petitioner cites no authority for the proposition that an agreement must use such words "renew, renewal, or rollover" in order to be considered agreements that terminate and then automatically renew. Accordingly, the Petitioner's arguments are without merit.</p>
