<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-73"><span class="space">6.</span> Constructive Demotion Through Reassignment; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Russell</span></span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text">We now take up the appeal by an the employee who is reassigned out of a position that is subsequently upgraded without change in duties. But for the reassignment, the employee would have been upgraded; he believes that he has in effect been downgraded by losing the enhanced grade. The resulting appeal is from a constructive demotion, and the analysis for that appeal is in <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 698, 6 MSPB 585 (1981), <span class="Italic">post</span>, a decision based on the (now defunct) Federal Personnel Manual and pre-Reform Act decisions from the Court of Claims and the Civil Service Commission. If the employee prevails in a constructive demotion appeal pursued under <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, the remedy includes back pay running from the date of the constructive demotion and cancelation of the reassignment, i.e., the employee is placed back in the position held prior to the improper reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Welch v. Dept. of Army</span>, 323 F.3d 1042 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (considering a <span class="Italic">Russell-</span>style appeal when, after the appellant did not achieve a higher-graded position, the appellant's position was abolished through a one-person RIF and he was assigned to another position); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Spicer v. DOD</span>, 59 MSPR 359, 369 &#x0026; n.9 (1993) ("The Board's jurisdiction over this appeal arises from the appellant's November 8, 1992, reassignment to the position of Industrial Property Management Specialist. We find no basis, however, on which to exercise jurisdiction over the agency's delay in implementing the February 20, 1991, classification action."). At issue is a reassignment, not a detail. <span class="Italic">Fallacaro v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> PH-0752-11-0186-I-1 (NP 1/6/2012) ("The appellant did not allege below that she was actually reassigned to another position, but only that she was detailed, that is, assigned to different duties. <span class="Italic">Rojas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 400, 405 (1996) (an employee is only entitled to the rights and benefits of the position to which he is officially appointed; by its nature, a detail is temporary and involves no formal appointment), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by</span> <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 5 n.1 (2007).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The basis of the <span class="Italic">Russell</span> appeal is limited: reclassification and grade or pay elevation of the pre-reassignment position, with no change in duties, based on classification error or the issuance of a new classification standard. The constructive downgrading through classification error is a pre-Reform Act relic having its genesis with the Federal Personnel Manual, as that guide was extant before the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act. The operative FPM section was noted in <span class="Italic">Bielec v. United States</span>, 456 F.2d 690 (Ct. Cl. 1972). The court quoted from FPM Chapter 335, Subchapter 4-3b:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Promotion to positions upgraded without significant change in duties and responsibilities.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency must provide for an exception to competitive promotion procedures to allow for the promotion of an incumbent of a position which has been upgraded without significant change in duties and responsibilities on the basis of either the issuance of a new classification standard or the correction of a classification error. If the incumbent meets the legal and qualification requirements for the higher grade, he must be promoted non-competitively unless removed from the position by appropriate personnel action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Ciambelli v. United States</span>, 203 Ct. Cl. 680 (1974), the Claims Court noted precedent in <span class="Italic">Vasey v. United States</span>, 128 Ct. Cl. 754, 756 (1954), and <span class="Italic">Nordstrom v. United States</span>, 177 Ct. Cl. 818, 825-26 (1966), stating that an employee is entitled to the benefits attributable to an upgrading or reclassification of a position that he would have been entitled to receive had he not been "transferred." The Federal Circuit has not explicitly validated what is known as the <span class="Italic">Russell</span> appeal--although it may question the validity of the theory of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of constructive reduction in grade was first considered by the Board in <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 698, 6 MSPB 585 (1981). The appellant was reassigned from the position of Supervisory Employee Development Specialist, GS-235-11, to Employee Development Specialist, GS-235-11. Five months later, the agency established a GS-12 Supervisor Employee Development Specialist position; the appellant was not selected. The appellant maintained that the GS-11 EDS job he held prior to reassignment and the GS-12 position were identical; he argued that he was constructively reduced in grade because the original GS-11 position he held should have been classified at GS-12. The agency maintained that the two positions were distinct. The agency challenged the Board's jurisdiction, claiming that the appellant was really contesting a reduction in rank, an action not appealable under the Reform Act. Declining to be bound by either party's characterization of the personnel action, the Board stated that it would make its own determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board examined the legislative history concerning abolition of reduction in rank appeals. The Board concluded on the basis of its review of the legislative history that the reduction in rank was eliminated in part to avoid appeal of insignificant personnel actions. Congress intended to eliminate only those appeals not concerning an employee's grade. By adding reduction in grade as a standard, Congress intended to enable employees to appeal personnel actions if a reduction in grade can be demonstrated through the application of position classification principles. Russell's situation was within those guidelines. The appellant claimed that if position classification criteria were properly applied to the job he lost through reassignment, the position would properly be classified at a GS-12 level.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board determined that the rights invoked by the appellant were substantive, citing <span class="Italic">McCourt v. Hampton</span>, 514 F.2d 1365 (4th Cir. 1975); <span class="Italic">Ciambelli v. United States</span>, 203 Ct. Cl. 680 (1974); <span class="Italic">Jarecki v. United States</span>, 590 F.2d 670 (7th Cir. 1979); and <span class="Italic">Leopold v. Comm'n</span>, 450 F. Supp. 154 (E.D.N.Y. 1978). Under those decisions, employees reassigned from positions subsequently upgraded and who, but for the reassignment, would have been promoted to the upgraded <span id="Page_2041"></span>position, suffered an injury compensable in back pay, remediable by an order directing their agency to promote them. The Board concluded that an employee who rests his or her appeal on constructive reduction in grade may demonstrate a substantive right in at least two ways: (1) by showing that he has suffered an injury that is plainly measurable and substantial in terms of pay, and (2) by showing that the personnel action being appealed would, if not voided, deprive him of a substantial benefit--a promotion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Next the Board considered the importance of the statutorily defined classification system. Classification principles establish entitlement to noncompetitive promotion should an individual's position be upgraded through a new classification standard or a correction of an erroneous application of a standard. From all of this, the Board determined that Russell's appeal was properly within the Board's jurisdiction. An employee is reduced in grade if he is reassigned from a position that is subsequently upgraded due to issuance of a new classification standard or correction of a classification error; and if he meets the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade; and if he is permanently reassigned to a position classified at a grade level lower than the grade level he would have held through promotion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Russell</span> summarized the jurisdictional components of the appeal, 6 MSPR 698, 711:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board concludes that where an employee is reassigned from a position which due to issuance of a new classification standard or correction of classification error is worth a higher grade, the employee meets the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade, and where the employee who held that position is permanently reassigned to a position classified at a grade level lower than the grade level to which the employee would otherwise be promoted, then the employee is reduced in grade. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(3). This conclusion renders Congress' statutory design fully effective in terms of the policy behind its enactment, and is totally consistent with the plain language of the statute. <span class="Italic">National Petroleum Refiners Association v.</span> <span class="Italic">FTC,</span> 482 F.2d 672, 689 (D.C. Cir. 1973).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To decide whether a reduction in grade took place in the instant case, the Board must still make the required findings of fact and conclusions of law. The facts at issue are: (1) whether the position appellant encumbered at the time of his reassignment was worth a higher grade due to a change in classification standard or classification error or whether the position was upgraded due to planned management action; and (2) if appellant's position was upgraded due to a change in classification standard or classification error, did appellant meet the legal and qualification requirements for promotion at the time of his reassignment.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;These are issues of jurisdiction. The appellant bears the burden of proof. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)].</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Russell</span> generally followed (without attribution) the reasoning of the court in <span class="Italic">Skrobot v. United States</span>, 534 F.2d 237, 240-41 (Ct. Cl. 1975), a decision interpreting then-applicable provisions of Chapter 335 of the Federal Personnel Manual:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that subchapter 4-3b may, in a proper case, create a legal entitlement to promotion. It is clearly cast in <span class="Italic">mandatory</span>, not permissive, form: "An agency <span class="Italic">must</span> provide for an exception to competitive promotion * * *. If the incumbent meets the legal and qualification requirement, for the higher grade he <span class="Italic">must</span> be <span class="Italic">promoted</span> noncompetitively * * *." (emphasis added). There is no room for agency discretion here. If the guidelines of 4-3b are met, an employee establishes a legal right to a promotion....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before an employee may obtain the benefits of subchapter 4-3b he must demonstrate that two conditions exist. First, the agency must have upgraded the position "without [a] significant change in duties and responsibilities." Second, the elevation must have resulted from "either the issuance of a new classification standard or the correction of a classification error." As we interpret these two conditions, plaintiff cannot demonstrate that they arise in this case and, therefore, fails to present a clear legal entitlement to promotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;"No duty change"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "no duty change" clause of sub-chapter 4-3b poses our first question for interpretation. Does this phrase require no change in duties and responsibilities of work <span class="Italic">actually performed,</span> or does it relate to no alteration of duties and responsibilities embodied in the employee's <span class="Italic">job description?</span> We prefer the latter interpretation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Construction of the "no duty change" language presents us with an uncomfortable dilemma. On one hand, we recognize that to compare old and new job descriptions to some extent exalts form over substance and may unfairly deny a promotion to a deserving employee who has diligently performed work above and beyond the call of his job description. However, the alternative is even more unpalatable. Thousands of government employees perform functions not formally established by their job descriptions. Indeed, in many instances, jobs grow gradually over the years, not through planned additions to duties, but because the exigencies of the moment require employees to assume added tasks. For us to read the "no duty change" of subchapter 4-3b as applying to duties <span class="Italic">actually performed</span> would raise the specter of a massive volume of constant civilian pay litigation and administrative chaos from thousands of grievance hearings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, subchapter 4-3b creates an <span class="Italic">exception</span> to the general policy of competitive promotion in the government civil service merit system. If we are to avoid irreparable damage to this fundamental principle upon which the merit system is based, we must read such an exception narrowly. Therefore, we conclude that the "no duty change" language of subchapter 4-3b refers to job descriptions, rather than to actual duties performed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;"Classification error"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the same policy considerations that compelled us to read the "no duty change" clause of subchapter 4-3b narrowly, we are forced to give a similar narrow construction to the "classification error" language. We construe the term "classification error" as limited to errors in the classification <span class="Italic">process.</span> It does not apply to instances where actual duties performed do not match job descriptions because the agency has added or taken away responsibilities in the course of day to day work. In other words, we confine "classification error" to the situation where the official responsible for classifying the position has erred. Otherwise we would put this court in the position of holding that thousands of employees engaged in daily tasks differing only in minute detail from their job descriptions are the victims of classification errors. Such a decision would drive the civil service system to its knees under the burden of a multitude of grievances filed by "erroneously classified" employees and would grant countless noncompetitive promotions. We decline to create such a situation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The ultimate jurisdictional predicate for reversal by the Board of a <span class="Italic">Russell-</span>style constructive downgrading is the agency's failure to provide constitutionally mandated due process protections for the employee who suffers the reduction in grade or pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bittner v.

Department of Transportation</span>, 421 F.3d 1339, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2005). If an employee voluntarily transfers out of a position that is subsequently upgraded, the employee cannot properly complain that the transfer constituted a demotion. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> An appellant may establish that her reassignment decision was involuntary if she could show that she was placed under unreasonable time constraints, that she relied on agency misinformation in reaching her decision, or that the agency could not substantiate a threatened removal or other adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Soler-Minardo v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board first addressed the concept of constructive demotion in <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of the Navy,</span> 6 MSPB 585, 6 M.S.P.R. 698 (1981). There, the Board held that an employee would be deemed to have suffered a reduction in grade where he was reassigned from a position which, due to issuance of a new classification standard or correction of a classification error, was worth a higher grade; the employee met the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade; and the employee who held the position was permanently reassigned to a position classified at a grade level lower than the grade level to which the employee would otherwise have been promoted. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 711. The theory was that the employee was entitled to a noncompetitive promotion prior to his reassignment, and, therefore, his reassignment from the position was effectively a demotion<span class="Italic">. See Manlogon v. Environmental Protection Agency,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 653 &#x00B6; 7 (2001). A classification error cannot be established merely by showing that, because of an increase in duties, the position should have been reclassified prior to an employee's reassignment. S<span class="Italic">ee Artmann v. Department of the Interior</span>, 926 F.2d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Addressing inconsistencies in the application of the constructive demotion doctrine, the court in <span class="Italic">Hogan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 218 F.3d 1361, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2000), held that if an agency has not actually upgraded the employee's prior position to correct an error, as distinct from creating an upgraded position, a reassignment will not be deemed a constructive demotion. In <span class="Italic">Manlogon</span>, the Board specifically overruled the Board's requirement that a reclassification occur "subsequent to" an employee's reassignment. <span class="Italic">Manlogon</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 653 &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction here, the appellant must present nonfrivolous allegations showing that his former GS-0475-11 position was actually upgraded to the GS-1165-12 position to correct a classification error that occurred when his former position was last classified prior to the current classification as a GS-12 position, or to apply new classification standards, rather than created as a new upgrade position with additional duties and responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Hogan</span>, 218 F.3d at 1366; <span class="Italic">Artmann</span>, 926 F.2d at 1121....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, two questions must be answered to determine whether, under the circumstances, a reduction in grade occurred: (1) whether the position the appellant held at the time of his reassignment warranted a higher grade due to a change in classification standard or classification error, or whether the position was upgraded due to planned management action; and (2) whether appellant's position was upgraded due to a change in classification standard or classification error, whether the appellant met the legal and qualification requirements for promotion at the time of his reassignment. <span class="Italic">Justice v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The constructive demotion theory was first developed by the Board in <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 6 MSPR at 700-01, based on the classification principles underlying the term "reduction in grade" at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512(3). It was intended to cover situations where a facial reassignment has the effect of a reduction in grade, <span class="Italic">viz.</span>, a demotion. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 704-11; 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(3), 7513(d); <span class="Italic">Artmann</span>, 926 F.2d at 1122-23. The theory is that, "if a position originally was classified erroneously or a change in classification standards would have mandated a change in grade, it [i]s proper to view the employee as if that error had been rectified, so that the employee would be occupying a position with a higher grade than he actually had." <span class="Italic">Artmann</span>, 926 F.2d at 1123. "The employee's grade therefore was reduced when the employee was reassigned at the same grade because, had the position been properly classified at the higher grade, that reassignment would have reduced the grade." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, a constructive demotion is simply any assignment away from a position that should have been classified at a higher grade--either because it was originally classified erroneously or because new classification standards should have been applied, rather than merely because of the addition of duties or a planned management action--where the employee met the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Artmann</span>, 926 F.2d at 1123-25; <span class="Italic">Russell,</span> 6 MSPR at 711.

<p class="Body-Text">Downgrading does not occur when the employee is reassigned out of a position held by temporary promotion or detail. <span class="Italic">Bielec v. United States</span>, 456 F.2d 690 (Ct. Cl. 1972).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Artmann v.

Dept. of Interior</span>, 926 F.2d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The court concluded the Board's views concerning classification errors and planned management actions were reasonable constructions of its jurisdiction over reductions in grade. The court affirmed the Board's determination that the position was upgraded because of additional duties rather than a classification error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's framing of the test for determining whether a reassignment at the same grade constitutes a "constructive demotion" in terms of whether there had been a classification error or a new classification standard indicates the Board's rationale for departing from the literal language of the Reform Act that the Board has appellate jurisdiction <span id="Page_2043"></span>over only "reductions in grade." The Board's theory apparently is that if a position originally was classified erroneously or a change in classification standards would have mandated a change in grade, it was proper to view the employee as if that error had been rectified, so that the employee would be occupying a position with a higher grade than he actually had. The employee's grade therefore was reduced when the employee was reassigned at the same grade because, had the position been properly classified at the higher grade, that reassignment would have reduced the grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This interpretation by the Board of the statutory term "reduction in grade" is a reasonable implementation of the Board's broad authority to interpret and apply the statutory provisions it administers.... Moreover, since the Board created the concept of "constructive demotion," the agency also has considerable discretion to define the perimeters of the concept.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the Board here acted within its authority in concluding that the determination whether there had been a classification error was to be made with respect to the grade at which the position most recently had been classified, and that a classification error could not be established by showing that, because of an increase in duties, the position should have been upgraded through reclassification prior to the employee's reassignment. This narrow scope of "classification error" accords with and furthers the congressional policy reflected in the Reform Act to "increase the flexibility of agencies to assign employees to positions and duties where they are needed without having to take an adverse action against an employee when the job title or duties have changed, but the grade has not."...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Artmann</span>, the classification action predicating a constructive demotion becomes effective when a person with properly delegated authority signs the OF-8 (the cover sheet of the standard position description), certifying that a position has been properly classified. <span class="Italic">Spicer v.

The crucial issue is not simply whether the position should have been upgraded prior to the appellant's reassignment, but whether it should have upgraded due to a classification error. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1125. A classification error must be shown as of the time the position was last classified before the employee's reassignment.</p>

Cir. 2003 NP), illustrates the sometimes subtle distinctions between reassignments coupled with upgradings of positions based on new duties and position upgradings based on correction of classification errors:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general matter, the MSPB "does not have appellate jurisdiction over reassignments not constituting a reduction in grade or pay, even though the reassignment reduces the employee's status, duties, or responsibilities." <span class="Italic">Artmann v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, 926 F.2d 1120, 1122 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The MSPB has stated, however, that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">where an employee is reassigned from a position which due to issuance of a new classification standard or correction of classification error is worth a higher grade, the employee meets the legal and qualification <span id="Page_2044"></span>requirements for promotion to the higher grade, and where the employee who held that position is permanently reassigned to a position classified at a grade level lower than the grade level to which the employee would otherwise be promoted, then the employee is reduced in grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Russell v. Dept. of the Navy,</span> 6 MSPB 585, 6 M.S.P.R. 698, 711 (M.S.P.B. 1981). That is a constructive demotion. <span class="Italic">Artmann</span>, 926 F.2d at 1123.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The constructive-demotion rule, however, is "strictly defined and narrow." <span class="Italic">Hogan v. Dept. of the Navy,</span> 218 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Constructive demotion embraces "only instances where a position has been upgraded to correct an error, not those in which an agency has added new duties to the position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1366. Constructive demotion requires that "the agency itself has actually upgraded the petitioner's prior position to correct an error," <span class="Italic">id</span>. (emphasis added); it is not enough to argue or even to show that an employee's "previous position <span class="Italic">should have</span> been reclassified upward," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1365 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We stated in <span class="Italic">Hogan</span> that "only if the agency itself has actually upgraded the petitioner's prior position to correct an error, as distinct from creating an upgrade position, could the reassignment possibly be deemed a 'constructive demotion."' 218 F.3d at 1366. Here, Kozak's old position was never upgraded--to the contrary, as part of the DFEM reorganization' the agency created a new and different Director, DFEM position. As the administrative judge found:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On October 27, 2000, the agency told the appellant the DFEM was to be reorganized. The reorganization of the DFEM resulted in the establishment of two separate branches, the Engineering Branch and the Operations and Maintenance Branch. A GS-14 Branch Chief position was created to supervise each branch. A GS-15 Director, DFEM position was <span class="Italic">established</span> to oversee the two branches....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On October 31, 2000, the agency issued a vacancy announcement for a Supervisory General Engineer, GS-801-15, to serve as the Director, DFEM, for NCTR. The appellant applied for the GS-15 Director position and was found to be highly qualified. The appellant was not selected for the new GS-15 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Kozak</span>, Mar. 20, 2002 slip op. at 6 (emphases added). <span class="Italic">See also id</span>. ("King was the Personnel Management Specialist who classified the <span class="Italic">new</span> GS-15 Director, DFEM, position.... He stated that the principle [sic] reason for the <span class="Italic">new</span> GS-15 position description was because of the new branch structure and not to correct errors in the appellant's old Director, DFEM, position.") (emphases added); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 7 ("[Kozak] presented no evidence to challenge the agency's assertion that the <span class="Italic">new</span> GS-15 Director, DFEM, position was <span class="Italic">created</span> due to a reorganization.") (emphases added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the undisputed facts demonstrate that the pre- and post-reorganization Director, DFEM positions did not have the same duties. Kozak admits that the reorganization involved "the addition of one subordinate supervisor" (i.e., a Branch Chief) over whom the new 'Director, DFEM had supervisory responsibility--a duty Kozak did not have in his old position. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Hogan</span>, "constructive demotion comprises only instances where a position has been upgraded to correct an error, not those in which an agency has added new duties to the position." 218 F.3d at 1361. Kozak asserts that the new Director, DFEM's supervisory responsibilities did not account for the grade differential between his old GS-14 position and the new GS-15 position, and that the true reason for the grade of the new position was that the agency realized his old responsibilities warranted a GS-15 grade. But at the hearing, several agency personnel gave unrebutted testimony that the new DFEM structure and the corresponding second level-supervisor duties of the new Director, DFEM accounted for the new position's GS-15 grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not reach Kozak's argument that the administrative judge erred by preventing him from questioning agency employee Mary Ann Hutchinson about the correctness of the classification of his original position, as the correctness <span class="Italic">vel non</span> of the classification of Kozak's old position was moot, in light of the unrebutted testimony that the agency created and classified the new Director, DFEM position pursuant to a planned management action (ie., the reorganization of DFEM). <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Hogan,</span> 218 F.3d at 1366. For example, Dick King, "the Personnel Management Specialist who classified the new GS-15 Director DFEM, position," testified that the principle [sic] reason for the new GS-15 position description was because of the new branch structure and not to correct errors in the appellant's old GS-14 Director, DFEM, position." <span class="Italic">Kozak</span>, Mar. 20, 2002 slip op. at 6-8.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Russell</span> appeal is narrowly circumscribed. It is not established because an individual is led to believe that he may obtain a pay raise in a position and reassignment forecloses future pay raises. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McEnery v. MSPB</span>, 963 F.2d 1512 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (discussed in Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-207.html#sec1-205">Loss of Earnings Opportunities; Change in Work Schedule</a>"). <span class="Italic">Best v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 670, 674-75 (1993), cautioned that "[i]f the position was correctly classified when the appellant occupied it, however, and the reclassification resulted from the application of a new standard that was not issued until after the appellant was reassigned, the reassignment would not constitute a constructive demotion under our decision in <span class="Italic">Russell</span>." Under <span class="Italic">Best,</span> if the appellant establishes an appealable action, the AJ must allow the appellant to develop and prove an allegation of discrimination.<span class="italic">See Zachariasiewicz v. DOJ</span>, 48 F.4th 237, 248 (4th Cir. 2022) (Judge Diaz dissenting) ("Appellant alleges that he was stuck at the GS-14 classification level due to the DEA's failure to promote him. As such, Appellant's involuntary transfer constituted neither 'a reduction in grade' nor 'a reduction in pay' that would be directly appealable to the MSPB pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. '[T]he right to appeal reductions in pay and grade...has been narrowly construed,' and consistent with the statutory definitions of those terms, the employee must 'show a demonstrable loss, such as an actual reduction in pay, to invoke [the MSPB's jurisdiction].' <span class="italic">Broderick v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 254, 258 (1992).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A constructive demotion did not occur under <span class="Italic">Russell</span> when the person moving into the appellant's prior position is given a higher grade as an accommodation rather than as a result of a classification error or new standard, <span class="Italic">McCollum v. VA</span>, 80 MSPR 166, 168-70 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10 (1998) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">McCollum v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3067), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a claim of constructive demotion, an appellant must show that, at the time of his reassignment, his former position was misclassified and should have been upgraded because of a classification error or a change in the classification standards, rather than because of a planned management action, and the appellant meets the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade<span class="Italic">. See Artmann v. Department of the Interior</span>, 926 F.2d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Bittner v. National Credit Union Administration</span>, 76 MSPR 380, 383 (1997); <span class="Italic">Pritchett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 MSPR 35, 38-41 (1996). A constructive demotion is simply any reassignment away from a position that should have been classified at a higher grade, either because it was previously classified erroneously or because new classification standards should have been applied, rather than because of the addition of duties or responsibilities through a planned management action, where the appellant met the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade<span class="Italic">. Bittner</span>, 76 MSPR at 383. In such a situation, the employee was entitled to a noncompetitive promotion prior to the reassignment and reassignment away from that position had the effect of a demotion<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued below that the Fort Logan Cemetery Administrator position was upgraded to a GS-13 grade to accommodate the placement of Napton, whose position at Fort Snelling had been upgraded to a GS-14 and filled competitively. According to the agency, OPM classification guidelines permit consideration of the impact of the person on the job in classifying positions. The agency argued that the Fort Logan Cemetery Administrator position was entitled to a GS-13 grade because of the particular abilities of Napton.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the upgrading of the Fort Logan Cemetery Administrator position must have been the result of the correction of a classification error. This conclusion was based on findings that there was no evidence to show that it was based on the application of a new classification standard, and that, because the duties of the position had not changed, it was not the result of a planned management action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that neither the appellant nor the agency introduced evidence to show that the upgrading was the result of a change in classification standards. Nor has either party alleged that the change resulted from a planned management action. The remaining basis for a claim of constructive demotion is the correction of a classification error. However, it remains the appellant's burden to prove that his former position was upgraded to correct a classification error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, for the purposes of Board jurisdiction over this appeal, the issue is whether the position should have been classified at the GS-13 level when the appellant occupied it. The evidence in the record does not show that, when the appellant occupied the GS-12 Cemetery Administrator position, it was misclassified and should have been classified as a GS-13 position. The appellant rewrote his position description in 1993 and submitted it to the agency for a determination of the proper grade level. Classifier Nancy Strouse determined that the position was properly graded at the GS-12 level, although its duties would place it at the top of the GS-12 level. Although Strouse classified the position as a GS-13 in 1995, she stated in a June 27, 1995 position report that "the position has been evaluated to be at the top of the range for a GS-12." She gave as the reason for the upgrading the desire of management to accommodate the placement of William Napton from Ft. Snelling National Cemetery, and advised that the position should be reevaluated and staffed at the proper level, when Napton leaves it. Thus, the evidence shows that in 1995 Strouse still believed that the position was a GS-12. Both the appellant and the agency gave as the explanation for upgrading the position the preferential treatment of Napton. Even if the agency acted impermissibly in upgrading the position to accommodate Napton, that circumstance does not prove that the duties of the position warranted a GS-13 grade when the appellant occupied it. We find that the appellant has not shown that his Fort Logan Cemetery Administrator position was misclassified as a GS-12 position as the result of a classification error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On review, <span class="Italic">McCollum</span> was affirmed. <span class="Italic">McCollum v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3067) (the court acknowledged the agency's argument that "OPM classification guidelines allow classifiers to take into account the change in the duties of a position that results from the qualifications of the particular person assigned to that position. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management, Introduction to the Position Classification Standards</span> 18 (1991).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A <span class="Italic">Russell-</span>type appeal may be foreclosed if the reassignment complained of is done with knowledge of, and acquiescence to, the agency's classification action on the first position. The appellant is not constructively demoted if he voluntarily agrees to accept reassignment from a position the agency acknowledges warrants a higher grade, as, for example, when the appellant leaves the position because of a settlement of a personnel dispute. The reassignment and constructive downgrading are voluntary unless the appellant alleges that he entered into the agreement based on misinformation regarding the effect of the reassignment. <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Dept. of Army</span>, 45 MSPR 151, 154-55 (1990). A voluntary reassignment, for what seemed to the employee good reasons at the time does not support a constructive adverse action appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Elmore v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 421 F.3d 1339, 1343-44 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Rosso v. DHS,</span> CH-0752-09-0698-B-2 (NP 9/25/2012), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Conversely, the appeal is not precluded only because the agency did not know at the time of the reassignment that the prior position would be upgraded by direction of OPM; it is the result rather than the intent that controls the appeal. <span class="Italic">Savelly v. GSA</span>, 49 MSPR 84, 88 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A claim of a constructive demotion must be addressed in the initial appeal. It will not be adjudicated by the Board if it is not litigated before the AJ and if it is addressed initially only at the PFR stage. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robins v. DOJ</span>, 48 MSPR 644, 649 (1991) (still considering the allegations and holding against the appellant).</p>
