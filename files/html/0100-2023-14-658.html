<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-659"><span class="space">4.</span> Other Factors Affecting Appraisal</h4>
<p class="noindent">FLRA considers to be negotiable proposals that carefully craft application of performance standards to specific work situations. The most extensive example of a set of proposals demonstrating the breadth of negotiability in this area is <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 41 (1993) (Provisions 14 and 15), essentially updating and reaffirming the negotiability of similar proposals in <span class="Italic">POPA and PTO</span>, 25 FLRA 384, 401-02 (1987) (Sections 4G, H &#x0026; I). In the 1993 <span class="Italic">POPA</span> decision, the proposals were, 47 FLRA at 41-42:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;No employees shall be evaluated on the basis of production constancy unless the evaluation explicitly takes into account <span class="Italic">all</span> job functions the employee is expected to perform and the actual amount of time available to perform those functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;The following are examples of situations in which it shall be unreasonable to adversely evaluate an examiner for failure to meet a particular timeliness standard:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;the action or actions required more time than the actual amount of examining time available to the examiner.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;an action which the examiner certifies requires a large block of uninterrupted time, such as a particular Examiner's Answer, must be prepared, and the required large block of uninterrupted time is not available to the examiner.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;the examiner did not have an adequate amount of examining time because he was unavailable due to leave or he was directed or authorized to perform other functions. An examiner is, however, expected to plan his work in anticipation of expected absences.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;the patent applicant or his representative made an appointment to hold an interview or stated an intention to file a further paper.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;the application to which the standard applies is unavailable.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.&#x2003;material necessary for the preparation of an action (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, a related application necessary for taking action, a translation of a reference, or a reference on order through the interlibrary loan system) is unavailable but ordered. The examiner should make a reasonable attempt to obtain the needed material. Once it appears impossible to obtain the needed material, the examiner must act on the application.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">7.&#x2003;completion of the action is dependent upon the action of another employee over whom the examiner has no control (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the application is out for terminal disclaimer processing, classification disputes, etc.).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E.&#x2003;For employees other than patent examiners, it shall be unreasonable to adversely evaluate the employee under circumstances analogous to those set forth in subsection [D] above.</p>
<p class="noindent">The 1993 <span class="Italic">POPA</span> decision reaffirmed, after a bit of updating of the law, what was determined in the 1987 decision. In 1993 FLRA explained, 47 FLRA at 43:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument provides no grounds for reassessing the conclusion reached in <span class="Italic">POPA I</span> concerning the counterparts of Provisions 14 and 15. In this regard, the cases the Agency relies on are inapposite. In <span class="Italic">Coordinating Committee of Unions and Department of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 29 FLRA 1436, 1444-46 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving</span>), the disputed portion of Proposal 4 prevented the agency from basing a performance appraisal on performance of certain duties. In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 32, AFL-CIO and Office of Personnel Management</span>, 28 FLRA 714, 716-18 (1987) (<span class="Italic">OPM</span>), Proposal 3 restricted management from changing the type and percentage of work reviewed for performance appraisal purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the proposals in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving, OPM</span>, and Provision 11, in this case, which address the content of performance standards, Provisions 14 and 15 concern the application of performance standards. Accordingly, we conclude that these provisions do not directly interfere with management's right to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) and are negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">POPA and PTO</span>, 25 FLRA 384, 401-02 (1987), reviewed negotiability of the same proposals (FLRA was forced to rerun its analysis in 1993 because of complications in the negotiability and impasse proceedings involving the POPA contract):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4.G. is concerned with the effect on the evaluation of employee performance of the establishment of a particular performance standard, in this instance, a possible standard of "production constancy" for professional employees. Based on the record, such a standard would be designed to measure the consistency with which employees perform a given job function. The intent of the proposal is to require management, when evaluating employees under the standard, to take into account all the other job functions which are assigned to those employees and to make allowances for the amount of time which such additional functions take away from the time they are able to devote to achieving "production constancy."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4.G. therefore does not concern and would not restrict management's decision as to <span class="Italic">what</span> it will require with respect to "production constancy," but rather is addressed to <span class="Italic">the manner in which</span> the requirements management does impose are <span class="Italic">applied</span> to employees in evaluating them under the standard. The proposal attempts to mitigate the effects of any possible rigid application of such a standard to circumstances in which employees must meet a variety of work-related responsibilities, over many of which, as the Union maintains, employees themselves have no control, by requiring management to make allowances for those circumstances in its appraisal of employees' work under the standard. Like Union Proposal 2 in <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Chicago Region</span>, 7 FLRA at 223-25, Section 4.G. would apply only in the context of the application to an employee of performance standards established by management. Like that proposal, Section 4.G. constitutes a more specific statement of the "fair and equitable" criterion to be utilized in the review of management's application of its performance standards to an employee. For the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Chicago Region</span>, Section 4.G. does not directly interfere with management's right to establish performance standards and is within the Agency's duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sections 4.H. and 4.I. specify circumstances under which examiner and non-examiner unit employees, respectively, will not be adversely evaluated for failure to meet timeliness standards. In essence, these proposals require management to make allowances in its evaluations of employees so as to not to rate them adversely on the performance of work which, for the reasons stated, it is not possible to perform or which would require more time to perform than is actually available under the standard. These proposals do not concern the content of the timeliness standards under which employees perform their work, therefore, but rather the application of such standards to the differing work situations of those employees. These proposals, like Section 4.G., establish criteria whereby the application of timeliness standards to an employee may be reviewed in a grievance. For the reasons set forth in the discussion of Section 4.G., Sections 4.H. and 4.I. likewise are within the Agency's duty to bargain. Moreover, because these proposals do not interfere with management's rights, we need not decide whether they constitute "appropriate arrangements" under section 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1993 FLRA shifted from the procedural analysis under <span class="Italic">POPA</span> to an arrangements analysis when faced with proposals calling on management to take various specific factors into account during performance appraisal. In an opinion that included the dissent of Member Armendariz, FLRA decided that Provision 4 was negotiable as an arrangement, <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals</span>, 47 FLRA 705, 720 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1103"></span>Staff Attorneys' performance evaluations shall take into account all job functions the Staff Attorney is expected to perform and the actual amount of time available (or not available) to perform those functions. Factors to be considered shall include, but are not limited to, leave, training, official time, prehearing conference activities, participation in AWS (Alternative Work Schedule) and other duties as assigned.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU</span> declared, 47 FLRA at 722-29:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he establishment of critical elements and performance standards are among the ways that management supervises employees and determines the quantity, quality, and timeliness of work required of employees and, consequently, constitutes an exercise of management's rights to direct employees and assign work.... Proposals or provisions that restrict an agency's authority to determine the content of performance standards directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work.... On the other hand, provisions that concern only the application of performance standards do not directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work.... Accordingly, the task in deciding the negotiability of a provision similar to Provision 4 "'is primarily one of determining, based on the record, whether [it] concern[s] substantive matters, such as the content of performance standards and critical elements, or whether [it] concern[s] the application of those standards and elements and other nonsubstantive matters such as procedures.'" <span class="Italic">Food and Nutrition Service</span>, 42 FLRA at 974 (brackets in original, quoting <span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office I</span>, 25 FLRA at 387).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even though it may be couched in terms of application, a provision nonetheless directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work if it prescribes substantive criteria that govern the content of performance standards. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Food and Nutrition Service</span>, 42 FLRA at 981. Similarly, provisions couched in terms of application that require an agency to change or adjust its performance expectations in light of specified factors directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work because they constitute a substantive limitation on an agency's ability to determine the content of performance standards. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs, Portland</span>, 46 FLRA at 1171-72.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 4 requires that performance evaluations shall "take into account" all of an employee's job functions and the actual amount of time available, or not available, to perform them, and further specifies certain factors that are "to be considered."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Office of Hearings and Appeals</span>, 34 FLRA at 1005-06, we discussed the meaning and significance of the terms "take into account" and "consider." We held that the "phrase 'to take into account'...connotes that management's decision will be based, at least in part, on the specified factors." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1006. The term "consider," on the other hand, "connotes that management will review the specified factors but will remain free to base its decision on grounds other than those factors." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1005-06.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union has stated that under this provision "an evaluation will be based, at least in part, on all job functions the employee is expected to perform and the amount of time available to perform those functions." Elsewhere, the Union claims that this provision would "not require management to make adjustments or changes in performance expectations for the reasons listed." However the Union also describes this provision as requiring the Agency to weigh the amount of time an employee has to perform his or her work, as limited by the factors listed in the provision, in order to ensure that the employee is neither penalized for availing himself or herself of statutory benefits such as leave nor negatively evaluated based on matters beyond their control.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the provision is to have the effect both of requiring that the evaluation of an employee be based at least in part on the matters specified by the provision and ensuring that employees are neither penalized nor evaluated negatively because of other demands on their time, it necessarily requires that the Agency adjust its performance expectations to allow for those competing demands on the employee's time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that this provision, as explained by the Union, requires management to base its assessment of employee performance, at least in part, on factors such as those listed in the provision. Consequently, we conclude that this provision requires the Agency to change or adjust its performance expectations in light of those factors and, thereby, constitutes a substantive limitation on the Agency's ability to determine the content of the standards. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs, Portland</span>, 46 FLRA at 1171-72; <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>, 40 FLRA at 579-83. Accordingly, Provision 4 directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we note that the language in Provision 4 is similar to that in Section 4.G. in <span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office I</span>. Section 4.G. was intended to require management, when evaluating employees under a performance standard for "production constancy" to take into account all the other job functions assigned to employees and to make allowances for the amount of time that such additional functions take away from the time that employees are able to devote to achieving "production constancy." The Authority concluded that Section 4.G. concerned only the application of performance standards and did not concern or restrict the content of the standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Insofar as the analysis concerning Section 4.G. suggests that proposals that require an evaluation to take into account, or make allowances for, specific factors and circumstances do not directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work, it is inconsistent with other decisions. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs, Portland</span>, 46 FLRA at 1171-72; <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 40 FLRA at 579-83. Moreover, such analysis does not recognize that a requirement that an evaluation take into account, or make allowances for, particular matters, necessarily requires that corresponding adjustments be made in the performance expectations that constitute the content of the relevant performance standard. Consequently, the Authority's decision concerning Section 4.G. in <span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office I</span> will no longer be followed. Rather, where a proposal or provision dictates that an evaluation be based, at least in part, on specified factors and circumstances and necessarily requires an adjustment in performance expectations to accommodate those factors and circumstances, we will find that such proposals and provisions directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now turn to the question of whether this provision is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute notwithstanding the fact that it directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee's performance appraisal is management's pronouncement on the quality of the employee's performance for the rating period.... [A]n employee's performance appraisal has far-reaching consequences for the employee's employment relationship.... [T]he rating that an employee receives is one factor used in determining whether the employee will undergo separation, demotion, or reassignment during a RIF. An employee's performance appraisal can also be determinative of the employee's success in competing with other employees for promotions and other career enhancement opportunities. As we have pointed out, an employee's performance appraisal can also determine whether the employee is eligible for performance awards and the monetary payments that they bring.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee's summary rating and the ratings assigned to performance elements will affect the employee's standing relative to other employees with whom the employee is competing for retention or for career opportunities such as promotions. In addition, judgments of an employee's standing relative to other employees with whom he or she will compete for career opportunities may also be influenced by the nature of any narratives that accompany those ratings. For example, if two employees have the same ratings but the narrative concerning one employee is more laudatory than that concerning the second employee, the first employee is likely to enjoy a competitive advantage. In sum, the effect of all aspects of an appraisal on the employee's career is pervasive and performance appraisals "will surely have adverse effects on some employees." <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Thus, we find that the potential adverse effects that can flow from a failure to allow for competing, legitimate demands on employees' time when evaluating their performance are more than hypothetical and speculative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">West Point Elementary School Teachers Ass'n, NEA and United States Military Academy, West Point Elementary School</span>, 34 FLRA 1008, 1012 (1990) (purely speculative or hypothetical concerns are excluded from being considered as arrangements). That is, the adverse impact that Provision 4 seeks to ease is reasonably foreseeable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Minerals Management Service v. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1162, the court noted that the Authority had failed to consider whether "the balm provided by the proposal would be administered only to hurts arising from the [drug testing] program, and to employees suffering such harm." Without deciding how we will apply <span class="Italic">Minerals Management Service v. FLRA</span> in all cases, we conclude that Provision 4 targets a specific "hurt" that is reasonably foreseeable. Specifically, this provision addresses the problem faced by employees when they are subjected to performance expectations that do not allow for competing, legitimate demands on their time that limit the time available to them to perform evaluated work. Put another way, this provision is concerned with employees who are subject to performance expectations that are based on unrealistic or inaccurate estimates of the time available to meet them. The provision's purpose is to ease the harm that that circumstance could cause to an employee's performance appraisal and, by extension, to the employee's career. By virtue of the fact that Provision 4 is limited to addressing a specific, identified hurt, we find that this provision necessarily targets employees who are subject to that hurt and would operate to benefit only those employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We acknowledge that on its face this provision includes within its scope <span id="page_1104"></span>employees who may not suffer an adverse effect as a consequence of being subjected to performance expectations that make no allowances for competing demands on their time.&#x2003;That is, some employees may have minimal or no such demands on their time. Also, the extent to which those competing demands actually would result in a less favorable performance appraisal will vary among employees. Certainly, it is difficult to say that any employee whose performance appraisal suffers no negative effect because of competing demands on his or her time incurs any adverse effect. However, the whole point of this provision is to help or benefit those employees who are or would be adversely affected by the circumstances addressed by the proposal. The impact of this provision with regard to those employees who would suffer no adverse effect is neutral. The inclusion of these latter employees within the scope of this provision is purely incidental to the fact that every employee in the unit has the potential to come within the class of employees who would be adversely affected by the circumstances addressed by the provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that it is virtually impossible to predict in advance the actual effects of competing demands on an employee's performance appraisal. We do not find that it is necessary for the provision to be so precisely tailored that it predicts and pinpoints only those employees who would actually suffer a less favorable performance appraisal as a result of competing, legitimate demands on their time in order for it to qualify as an arrangement. We find that it is sufficient that this provision is limited in its scope to easing a specifically identified hurt that poses a threat to employees generally and that, consequently, it is sufficiently tailored to qualify as an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute notwithstanding the fact that some employees may escape actual harm....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we consider whether the proposed arrangement is appropriate or whether it excessively interferes with management's rights. Under the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> analysis, this requires a determination of whether the negative impact of the provision on management's rights is disproportionate to the benefits conferred on employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This provision offers a significant benefit to employees by requiring that their performance evaluations be based on the amount of time actually available to them to perform the work on which they are being evaluated.&#x2003;Thus, this provision protects employees from performance demands that are based on an inflated assessment of the amount of time available to meet those demands. This provision serves to minimize the extent to which competing, legitimate demands on an employee's time have a negative impact on the employee's evaluation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under this provision the Agency retains the right to determine which aspects of an employee's work will be evaluated and what performance requirements relating to quantity, quality, and timeliness will be placed on the employee, provided that appropriate allowance is made for competing demands on the employee's time. The provision does not prescribe the specific weight that must be given the matters that the provision requires management to take into account. Thus, the provision requires management to do no more than what is reasonable when evaluating an employee's work. Nor does the provision require the Agency to make allowances for time spent in any activities that it has not approved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the Agency that this provision places a severe restriction on its ability to hold employees accountable for their performance.&#x2003;The Agency remains free to hold employees accountable for their performance; it is required only to make an appropriate allowance for competing, legitimate time demands that affect the amount of time available for the performance of work on which the employee is evaluated. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office III</span>, 41 FLRA at 815 (provisions that effectively prohibit any formal evaluation of work performed during a specified period severely hamper the agency's ability to hold employees accountable for work performed during that period). We find that the burden placed on management's right to direct employees and assign work is slight.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we conclude that the benefits afforded employees by Provision 4 outweigh the burden on management's rights to direct employees and assign work. Accordingly, Provision 4 does not excessively interfere with management's rights and is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs, Portland</span>, 46 FLRA at 1172-74; <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 40 FLRA at 582-83.</p>

A proposal that required an agency to grant additional time for certain tasks or not to count certain time when making determinations as to the quantity and timeliness of the employees' work product was nonnegotiable. It interfered with the rights of the agency to assign and direct work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 18 FLRA 305, 306 (1985).</p>
