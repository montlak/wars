<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-346"><span class="space">a.</span> Application of the "Covered By" Doctrine</h5>
<p class="noindent">The "covered by" doctrine is implicated when a ULP charge asserts a statutory failure to bargain over a change in employment conditions and the defense is raised that the change is permitted or "covered by" the contract. If the assertion in a grievance is that the failure to bargain violates a contract bargaining obligation, the "covered by" doctrine has no application; the matter is one of contract interpretation for an arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Combat Dev. Command and AFGE Local 1786</span>, 67 FLRA 542, 546 (2014) (Member Pizzella dissenting) ("The 'covered-by' doctrine applies as a defense to an alleged failure to satisfy a statutory bargaining obligation. Where a grievance involves only a dispute as to whether a contractual--as opposed to a statutory--bargaining obligation has been violated, "the issue of whether the parties have complied with the agreement becomes a matter of contract interpretation for the arbitrator."). Under <span class="Italic">DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau and ACT Local 74</span>, 57 FLRA 934, 936 (2002), the "covered by" defense is inapplicable to a contractual, as opposed to statutory, bargaining obligation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "covered by" doctrine applies as a defense to an alleged failure to satisfy a statutory bargaining obligation.[7] <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin. Headquarters, Balt., Md.,</span> 57 FLRA 459, 460 (2001). In resolving a grievance alleging such a failure, an arbitrator must apply the same standards and burdens applied by an administrative law judge in a proceeding under &#x00A7; 7118 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 168, </span>55 FLRA 237, 241 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Under the first prong of the "covered by" doctrine, the Authority examines whether the subject matter of the change is expressly contained in the agreement; under the second prong, the Authority determines whether the subject is inseparably bound up with, and plainly an aspect of, a subject covered by the contract. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human</span> <span class="Italic">Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md., </span>47 FLRA 1004, 1018 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By contrast, where a grievance involves only a dispute whether a contractual--as opposed to statutory--bargaining obligation has been violated, "the issue of whether the parties have complied with the agreement becomes a matter of contract interpretation for the arbitrator." <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md.</span>, 55 FLRA 1063, 1068 (1999) (parties created contractual obligation to bargain over matters contained in &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute). In those circumstances, the Authority applies the deferential "essence" standard to the arbitrator's contract interpretation. [8] <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 1069-70. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3937, </span>49 FLRA 785, 790-91 (1994) (where issue before arbitrator was contractual, not statutory, duty to bargain, arbitrator correctly analyzed only contractual issue, and that analysis was reviewed under "essence" standard).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The Authority has held that, where a contract provision restates a provision of the Statute, the Authority "must exercise care" to ensure that an arbitral interpretation of the contract provision is consistent with Authority interpretation of the statutory provision. <span class="Italic">See Gen. Servs. Admin., Region 9, Los</span> <span class="Italic">Angeles, Cal., </span>56 FLRA 683, 685 (2000). Here, the Agency does not allege, and there is no basis for concluding, that either Article 23-1 (relied on by the Union to establish the bargaining obligation) or Article 10-5 (relied on by the Agency for its "covered by" argument) restates a provision of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no basis for concluding that this case involves a claim that the Agency failed to meet its bargaining obligation under the Statute....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In a grievance alleging an unfair labor practice (ULP) by an agency, the union bears the burden of proving the elements of the alleged unfair labor practice by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Admin.

Here, the Union alleged that the Agency committed a ULP by refusing to bargain over the Union's leave swapping proposal and the Agency claimed it had no duty to bargain over the proposal because it was covered by the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "covered by" doctrine is a well established defense to a claim that an agency failed to provide a union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over changes in conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Interior, Wash., D.C.</span>, 56 FLRA 45, 53 (2000).

Under the second prong, if a matter is not expressly addressed by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, but is nonetheless inseparably bound up with and, thus, an aspect of a subject covered by the terms of the agreement, then the other party may also properly refuse to bargain over the matter. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's leave swapping proposal would allow an employee who does not wish to use approved leave to transfer the leave period to another employee, without regard to whether that employee has approved leave or whether management has approved that employee's absence. By its plain terms, the proposal involves not only the disposition of leave already granted to one employee, but also the granting of leave to another employee--namely, the recipient of the swapped leave--by allowing the employee with approved leave to give that leave to another <span id="page_2358"></span>employee, whether or not the recipient has been granted leave. That is, contrary to the Arbitrator's conclusion, the proposal concerns not only the disposition of leave already granted to one employee, but also the granting of leave to a second employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also contrary to the Arbitrator's conclusion, Article 32 does not concern only the Agency's role in initially granting leave. As plainly worded, Article 32 concerns the Agency's role in both granting and denying annual leave. As relevant here, Article 32, &#x00A7; 1.C provides that "the [Agency] will resolve a conflict in requests" for annual leave "by granting preference to the employee with the most service...." As such, Article 32, &#x00A7; 1.C permits the Agency to approve and deny annual leave requests. Furthermore, this provision dictates that, where more than one employee requests leave for the same time period, the request of the most senior employee requesting leave for that time period should be granted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that, as argued by the Agency, the Union's proposal would circumvent the process set forth in Article 32, &#x00A7; 1(C) by permitting an employee with approved annual leave who decides not to use that leave to grant annual leave to any employee, whether or not there is a more senior employee who has requested leave for that same period. Consequently, we conclude also that the Arbitrator erred in determining that the Union's proposal "covers an entirely different subject[.]" As the standards for granting leave are expressly addressed by the parties' agreement, the Union's leave swapping proposal is covered by the agreement and the Agency has no duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's arguments, in reliance on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, do not compel a different result. In <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, the Authority explained that, under prong 1 of the "covered by" doctrine, if a contract provision does not expressly encompass the subject matter addressed in a proposal, then it will, pursuant to prong 2, examine the parties' bargaining history and intent to determine whether the matter sought to be bargained is an aspect of matters already negotiated. <span class="Italic">See Customs Service, </span>56 FLA at 814. This analysis is unnecessary in this case because the matter the Union sought to negotiate is expressly encompassed by the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's <span class="Italic">de novo </span>analysis of a "covered by" issue arising in arbitration was affirmed in the D.C. Circuit in the <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> litigation, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 452 F.3d 793, 794-98 (D.C. Cir. 2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I.&#x2003;Background</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union and the IRS are parties to a national collective bargaining agreement that governs the terms and conditions of employment at, among other locations, the Service's call site in Denver, Colorado. Article 32, Section 1.C of that agreement provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Employer will resolve a conflict in requests by employees in the same occupation for scheduled annual leave by granting preference to the employee with the most service as determined by enter on duty (EOD) date.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Denver, Colo.</span>, 60 F.L.R.A. 572 app. at 574 (2005) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>). The managers at the Denver site scheduled local employees' annual leave in accord with their seniority, per Article 32, and with the scheduling requirements set centrally by the business operating division of the IRS, which requirements dictated the number of employees needed to answer calls on any given day.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employees who believed their requests for leave had been unfairly denied complained about this arrangement.&#x2003;Ms. Patience Ellis, the senior official at the Denver call center, created a committee of union and management representatives to consider the issue. The committee developed a consensus "Leave Swapping Program" under which one employee could transfer his approved leave to another employee with the same job skills, regardless of either employee's seniority. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 575.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Representatives of the Union took the position that the leave-swapping program was a binding collective bargaining agreement, but management refused either to implement or to bargain further over it on the ground that the subject was already covered by Article 32 of the national agreement. This prompted the Union to file a grievance claiming the IRS had violated the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (5), by "refus[ing] to consult or negotiate in good faith." When the Union and the IRS were at an impasse over the grievance, the Union demanded arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arbitrator concluded the national agreement "does not cover the leave swapping program"; rather, it "only governs how the agency will initially assign annual leave" and does "not speak to the situation in which an employee chooses not to use approved leave." Unlike the national agreement, the arbitrator explained, the leave-swapping program involves only "voluntary swaps among willing employees"; seniority "is not a consideration" because "there is no conflict [when] both employees want to make the swap." It followed that, because the leave-swapping proposal was not "covered by" the national agreement, the agency had violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) by refusing to bargain over it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The IRS appealed to the Authority, which held "the Arbitrator erred in determining [the leave swapping program] 'covers an entirely different subject'" than does the national agreement. <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> 60 F.L.R.A. at 574. In the Authority's view, the proposed leave-swapping program "would circumvent" the system of seniority established by the national agreement because it would "permit[&#8197;] an employee with approved annual leave...to grant [that] annual leave to any employee, whether or not there is a more senior employee who has requested leave for that same period." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, the Authority concluded, the national agreement having "expressly addressed" the standard for determining who gets leave when not all requests can be granted, "the Union's leave swapping proposal is covered by the agreement and the Agency has no duty to bargain" over it. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing the Authority had failed to defer to the arbitrator's interpretation of the national agreement, as required by precedent. The Authority denied the motion, explaining that "although the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings and contract interpretations, the Authority does not defer to an arbitrator's conclusions as to the legal effect of those findings and interpretations." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Denver, Colo.</span>, 60 F.L.R.A. 893, 894 (2005). In this case, the Authority explained, it had disagreed only with the arbitrator's application of the "covered by" doctrine, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, which application it reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, <span class="Italic">see,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Employees Union Chapter 168,</span> 55 F.L.R.A. 237, 241-42 (1999). The Union petitions for review of both the Authority's orders denying relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II. Analysis</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will not set aside an order of the Authority unless it is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A); <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 7123(c) (adopting standard in &#x00A7; 706); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA,</span> 414 F.3d 50, 57 (D.C. Cir. 2005). The Union argues the Authority acted arbitrarily because it failed to defer to the arbitrator's interpretation of the national agreement, even though in the past the Authority has "consistently declined to overturn arbitral interpretations of collective bargaining agreements." As evidence of this alleged failure to defer, the Union notes the Authority (1) twice described its own decision as "contrary to the Arbitrator's conclusion," <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> 60 F.L.R.A. at 574, and (2) ignored Ms. Ellis's testimony that the national agreement did not "address" whether employees were required to consider seniority if they wanted to trade leave. In sum, the Union argues the Authority's decision cannot stand because it is "fabricated out of whole cloth," with "nothing in the record evidence" to support it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority argues the "Union misapprehends the issue in this case": The Authority rejected "the arbitrator's legal conclusion as to the interrelationship between the proposal and [the national agreement], not his interpretation of the agreement." The Authority maintains it (1) owes no deference to the arbitrator's application of the "covered by" doctrine, which it accordingly reviewed <span class="Italic">de novo,</span> and (2) reasonably concluded a proposal that would allow an employee to transfer his leave to another, notwithstanding the request of a third employee with greater seniority than that of the transferee, would "effectively nullify the operation of [Article 32, Section 1.C]" of the national agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we recently explained in another case brought by the same Union, an agency's "duty to bargain [over disputes arising] mid-term derives from the...command [of the Statute] to both labor and management to 'meet and negotiate in good faith.'" <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA,</span> 399 F.3d 334, 337 (2005). Such bargaining is not required, however, with respect to a matter "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement already in place. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority uses a two-step analysis to determine whether a proposal for mid-term bargaining is "covered by" an existing collective bargaining agreement. First the Authority considers whether the subject matter "is expressly addressed by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Employees Union,</span> 59 F.L.R.A. 217, 218 (2003). The Authority does not require an "exact congruence" between the matter proposed for bargaining and the text of the existing agreement; "if a reasonable reader would conclude that the provision [in the agreement] settles the matter in dispute," then the matter is "covered." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md.</span>, 47 F.L.R.A. 1004, 1017-18 (1993). Second, if the Authority determines the matter is not expressly addressed in the agreement, then it must decide whether the matter is "inseparably bound up with...a subject expressly covered by the contract." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1018. In this case the Authority concluded, pursuant to the first step of the analysis, that the "standards for granting leave are expressly addressed" in, and are therefore "covered by," the national agreement. <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> 60 F.L.R.A. at 574.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are not persuaded by the Union's arguments that the Authority erred in so holding. To begin, we agree with the Authority that the Union has mistaken the arbitrator's application of the "covered by" doctrine for an "interpretation" of the national agreement. Application of the "covered by" doctrine is an exercise in construction; it requires the adjudicator of a dispute over the meaning of a collective bargaining agreement to <span id="page_2359"></span>determine how broadly or narrowly the agreement should be read in view of the policies embodied in the statute establishing the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Ga. v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 48, 58-59 (D.C. Cir. 1992) ("covered by" doctrine should be applied to further the "stability and repose" the Statute is intended to promote). In short, whether a subject is "covered by" an existing agreement is a question of law. <span class="Italic">See Garden State Tanning, Inc. v. Mitchell Mfg. Group, Inc.</span>, 273 F.3d 332, 335 (3d Cir. 2001) ("construction" "determines [the] legal operation" of agreement; "interpretation" of agreement resolves any ambiguity in terms used).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The "covered by" analysis is thus analogous to the inquiry we make in order to determine whether a federal statute impliedly preempts related state law; rather than focusing only upon the meaning of a particular word or words in search of congressional intent, as we might in a case of statutory interpretation, <span class="Italic">see,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. EPA</span>, 446 F.3d 140, 142 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (word "daily" as used in the Clean Water Act "means daily, nothing else"), "the entire scheme of the statute must...be considered...&#8197;If the purpose of the [federal] act cannot otherwise be accomplished[,]...the state law must yield." <span class="Italic">Crosby v. Nat'l Foreign Trade Council,</span> 530 U.S. 363, 373, 120 S. Ct. 2288, 147 L. Ed. 2d 352 (2000) (internal quotation marks removed); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Sheridan Kalorama Historical Ass'n v. Christopher,</span> 311 U.S. App. D.C. 16, 49 F.3d 750, 757-58 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (considering "comprehensive scheme[s]" provided by federal statute and D.C. law and holding federal law controlled). Therefore, although the Authority defers to an arbitrator's interpretation of a contract, it properly reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the arbitrator's application of the "covered by" doctrine. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Treasury Employees Union Chapter 168,</span> 55 F.L.R.A. at 241-42; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bldg. &#x0026; Constr.

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Union here argues the Authority did not defer to the arbitrator's interpretation of the national agreement, the Union has not pointed to any word or phrase in that agreement to which the Authority attributed a different meaning than had the arbitrator. The Authority disagreed with the arbitrator only with regard to what the national agreement "speak[s] to," "governs," and "address[es]"--in other words, what the agreement, or more specifically Article 32 of the agreement, "covers." Because the Authority properly decides <span class="Italic">de novo</span> what the agreement covers, it did not err in failing to defer to the arbitrator in this regard; nor for the same reason was it required, as the Union implies, to rely upon Ms. Ellis's testimony regarding what she believed the national agreement addressed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore the Authority's decision cannot fairly be described, the Union's assertion notwithstanding, as having been "fabricated out of whole cloth" and without "record evidence" to support it. The Authority reasoned that the Union's leave-swapping proposal would depart from the criterion of seniority to which the parties had subscribed in the national agreement. <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> 60 F.L.R.A. at 574. Under the Union's proposal an employee with leave approved on the basis of his seniority could trade that leave to an employee other than the next most senior employee who had requested, but was denied, leave for that same period. Consistent with its past decisions, therefore, the Authority concluded the leave-swapping program was "covered by" the national agreement, which had established seniority as the sole criterion upon which employees would qualify for leave when not all who wanted leave for a particular period could be accommodated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Prof'l Airways Sys. Specialists,</span> 56 F.L.R.A. 798, 804 (2000) (proposal to train employees who could not sustain a certain level of pay due to lack of training was "covered by" provision of agreement setting forth agency's obligations to provide training and to compensate employees unable to sustain that level of pay). That conclusion, if not compelled, was eminently reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE SSA Gen. Comm.</span>, 66 FLRA 569, 572-73 (2012) (applying "covered by" doctrine, sustaining a contract violation but striking portion of award finding that agency failed to bargain on procedure for submitting applications for internal vacancies: "The subject matters of the disputed change concern the procedures for: (1) employees to apply for competitive promotions, including the use of automated applications and forms, and (2) the Agency to rate and rank candidates. A reasonable reader would--and, in effect, the Arbitrator did--conclude that Article 26 settles the matters of how employees apply for positions and how the Agency will rate and rank their applications. As such, Article 26 expressly contains the subject matters of the disputed change, and prong I of the "covered by" doctrine is satisfied. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Balt.</span>, 47 FLRA at 1018.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The "covered by" doctrine relates to refusals to bargain. It does not apply when the union does not seek bargaining, <span class="Italic">SSA, Hq., Baltimore and AFGE, Gen. Com.</span>, 57 FLRA 459, 460-61 (2001) (grievance protesting unilateral change in working conditions):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "covered by" doctrine is a well established defense to a claim that an agency failed to provide a union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over changes in conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See United</span> <span class="Italic">States Dep't of the Interior, Wash., D.C., </span>56 FLRA 45, 53 (2000). In this regard, the covered by doctrine excuses parties from bargaining on the ground that they have already bargained and reached agreement concerning the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">See HHS, </span>47 FLRA at 1015; <span class="Italic">see also, AFGE, Local 225, </span>56 FLRA 686, 689 (2000) (covered by doctrine operates to prevent, not require bargaining).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the "covered by" doctrine operates as a defense to an alleged unlawful refusal to bargain--by an agency under &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5) or by a union under &#x00A7; 7116(b)(5) of the Statute--the Union's reliance on the doctrine in this case is misplaced. In particular, neither the Union nor the Agency is asserting that the other party illegally refused to bargain. While the Agency offered the Union the opportunity to bargain over the proposed change, it did not object when the Union declined to bargain. The Union is, thus, not raising the "covered by" doctrine as a defense to an alleged unlawful refusal to bargain. Further, while the Union asserts that the contract did not permit the Agency to implement the Table, it does not seek bargaining. As neither party is asserting that the other is obligated to bargain, the covered by doctrine does not apply. Therefore, the Union's "covered by" argument does not provide a basis to find the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force Whiteman AFB and AFGE Local 2361</span>, 66 FLRA 357, 363 (2011), if a grievance is resolved on a basis not applying the covered by doctrine, FLRA will reject an exception based on that doctrine:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is based on a nonfact because the Arbitrator erroneously applied the Authority's covered by doctrine to conclude that: (1) the issue of uniform wear by technicians was part of the agreement; and (2) the agreement would have precluded further bargaining on uniform wear, particularly because the parties never discussed uniforms. We construe the Agency's claims as assertions that the award is contrary to law, specifically, the covered by doctrine.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award is not contrary to the covered by doctrine.&#x2003;The Arbitrator did not actually rely on, or otherwise apply, the Authority's covered by doctrine. The Arbitrator stated that the contractual issue before him was "similar to, but someways different from, statutory legal standards under the [Authority's] 'covered by' doctrine." He further stated that, through the agreement, the parties agreed to matters that otherwise would be addressed by Authority precedent concerning the covered by doctrine. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">SSA Balt., </span>47 FLRA 1004). The Arbitrator, therefore, unequivocally expressed that application of the covered by doctrine was unnecessary to his award. Consequently, we find that the Agency's exception provides no basis for finding that the award is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soc. Sec. Admin., </span>65 FLRA 339, 342-43 (2010) (denying agency's claim that award was contrary to covered by doctrine because agency failed to establish that arbitrator actually relied on it).</p>

FLRA</span>, 647 F.3d 359, 364-66 (2011)) (the "covered by" doctrine applies only to collective bargaining agreements; RNIAP is not negotiated agreement).</p>
