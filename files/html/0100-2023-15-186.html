<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Berkner v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BERKNER_BONNY_DC_0752_09_0667_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_578467.pdf">116 MSPR 277</a>, 278-85 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-17, 2011 MSPB 27 (2011), resolved that statements related by the appellant to a union representative lacked privilege or protection when the representative informed management of the statements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 22, 2009, the agency proposed to remove the appellant, a Geographer with the U.S. Census Bureau, based on a charge of making inappropriate statements. Specifically, the agency charged:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On Friday, April 17, 2009, [the appellant] met with Franklin Silberstein, Chief Steward, AFGE local 2782, at approximately 12:15 <span class="small">P.M.</span> [regarding her then-pending discrimination complaint.] During that meeting, [the appellant] clearly stated to Mr. Silberstein, "If I get fired, I'll kill myself." [Silberstein] asked [the appellant] not to do that. [The appellant] explained that when [she] kill[s] [her] self, [she] will return and haunt people, perhaps even being born again and getting even that way. [The appellant] also stated that [she] might take others with [her], adding, "Not here, I know where they live."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">After Mr. Silberstein asked [the appellant] to not take things into [her] own hands and asked [her] to recant [her] statement, [she] replied, "I recant it, but I will do what I will do. I'll do what I do."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's communications with her union representative were not privileged.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant asserts that the administrative <span id="Page_2692"></span>judge erred in denying her motion <span class="Italic">in limine</span> and in finding that her communications with Mr. Silberstein as her union representative were not privileged. The appellant asserts that the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) has determined that communications between a union representative and a bargaining unit employee are privileged against disclosure to management for purposes of disciplining the employee. (citing <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury Customs Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. 1300, 1308 (1990)). The appellant further asserts that the Board should defer to the FLRA on this issue and should not create a disparity between its own case law and that of the FLRA. She thus encourages the Board to hold that "communications between an employee and either an EEO representative or a union representative are privileged and may not serve as the basis for any adverse employment action against the employee." She further encourages the Board to extend the FLRA's reasoning to hold that the only party who may waive the privilege is the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed more fully below, because we believe that the facts in the instant case do not support the application of a privilege between a union representative and a bargaining unit employee, even as recognized by the FLRA, the Board need not determine whether to establish such a privilege under Board law.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;The Board has stated that "evidentiary privileges should not be lightly granted." <span class="Italic">See Gangi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 23 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's communications with her union representative are distinguishable from those held to be privileged under FLRA law.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although FLRA decisions are not binding on us,<span class="Italic"> Fanelli v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 11 (2008), we have relied upon the FLRA's reasoning in certain contexts, as appropriate, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Smith v. Department of Energy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 430, &#x00B6; 10 (2001). The appellant correctly points out that the FLRA has found that the "content or substance of statements made by an employee to [her] Union representative in the course of representing the employee in a disciplinary proceeding" is protected as privileged. <span class="Italic">See Customs Service</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. at 1308 (finding that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) by requiring a union representative to disclose, under threat of disciplinary action, the content of statements made by an employee); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1). An agency may not interfere with the confidentiality of such communication unless the right to maintain the confidentiality of the conversations has been waived or some overriding need for the information is established<span class="Italic">. Long Beach Naval Shipyard and Federal Employees Metal Trades Council AFL-CIO</span>, 44 F.L.R.A. 1021, 1038-40 (1992) (finding that conversations between a bargaining unit employee and a union representative constituted protected activity and that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) by threatening a union representative with disciplinary action for refusing to disclose the content or substance of statements made to him by a bargaining unit employee).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant is correct that the FLRA recognizes such a privilege, even the FLRA limits the scope of protection. The FLRA has recognized that an agency's need for information regarding protected conversations may arise in the context of an investigation of employee misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Department of Treasury United States Customs Service Customs Management Center and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 57 F.L.R.A. 319 (2001) (finding that the agency established a sufficient need to justify questioning a bargaining unit employee concerning the advice given by a union vice president in light of an allegation that the vice president advised the employee to lie in the course of an earlier investigation). Further, in a case with facts similar to the instant case, the FLRA found that an agency established an extraordinary need to conduct an investigation and question bargaining unit employees regarding an alleged incident at a union meeting following the agency's receipt of a sworn affidavit from an employee alleging that physical violence had been threatened by one employee against another on the premises. <span class="Italic">See Federal Bureau of Prisons Office of Internal Affairs and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 53 F.L.R.A. 1500, 1510 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, <span class="Italic">Customs Service and Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>, in which the FLRA recognized as privileged communications between an employee and a union representative, are factually distinguishable from the instant appeal and thus do not establish that the appellant's statements to Mr. Silberstein are privileged. In both <span class="Italic">Customs Service and Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>, the agency was seeking, under the threat of discipline, to <span class="Italic">require</span> disclosure of confidential information that otherwise would be protected, and the union representative objected to being interrogated regarding his conversation with a bargaining unit employee. <span class="Italic">See Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>, 44 F.L.R.A. at 1039; <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. at 1308-09. In <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, the agency sought to interview a union representative regarding the statements of a union employee, who was charged with dishonest conduct and attempted theft, to the representative concerning the employee's recollection of relevant events. <span class="Italic">See Customs Service</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. at 1301-02. The union representative protested the interview, and the agency cautioned the representative that he was required to disclose information relating to the investigation of the union employee and that he could be subject to disciplinary action if he refused. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1302. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>, the agency sought to require a union representative to disclose, under threat of disciplinary action, the content of statements made by a union employee to the representative regarding whether the employee was engaged in outside employment during his period of removal. <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>, 44 F.L.R.A. at 1038. The union representative objected to being interrogated concerning his conversations with the union employee. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1039.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, Mr. Silberstein voluntarily reported the appellant's comments to the agency's labor relations department and drafted a memorandum detailing the conversation. Further, as noted above, the statements in the instant case were analogous to those at issue in <span class="Italic">Federal Bureau of Prisons</span> in which the FLRA found that the agency had an extraordinary need to conduct an investigation. Thus, the instant case is factually distinguishable from those such as <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> and <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span> in which the FLRA has recognized and enforced a privilege protecting communications between a union representative and a bargaining unit employee. Accordingly, the appellant's suggestion that our failure to find her communications privileged in the instant case would create a disparity between the law as applied by the Board and the FLRA is without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's communications are not protected under Board law.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In asserting that the Board should recognize a privilege for communications between a union representative and a bargaining unit employee, the appellant relies on the Board's decision in<span class="Italic"> Daigle v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 625 (1999), as evidence that the Board recognizes the importance of confidential communications between an employee and an EEO counselor. In <span class="Italic">Daigle</span>, the agency proposed to remove Mr. Daigle based on, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a charge of disrespectful conduct toward agency personnel after Mr. Daigle, during an EEO counseling session and in referring to a supervisor, stated that "[i]f I wasn't a sane man, I'd take a weapon and blow the motherfucker's brains out." <span class="Italic">Daigle</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6; 2. In refusing to sustain the charge, the Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Given the fact that EEO counseling sessions are a semi-confidential means through which employees complain about the conduct of other agency personnel, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105, and the fact that complainants are likely to be emotionally distraught when they are reporting perceived discrimination to the EEO counselor, these sessions are one of the contexts in which it is reasonable to afford employees more leeway with regard to their conduct than they might otherwise be afforded in other employment situations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find a distinction between venting about the actions of a particular supervisor in the course of an EEO counseling session and the appellant's statements that she would kill herself, return to haunt people, and possibly take others with her if the agency removed her. While Mr. Daigle's statements were disturbing, in addition to profane, it was implicit in his statement that he would not actually harm his supervisor as he stated that he would take such actions if he were <span class="Italic">not</span> a sane man. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6; 2. Mr. Daigle also was clearly venting his frustrations with respect to a particular supervisor as it directly related to his EEO matter as opposed to the appellant's statements threatening suicide and broadly indicating a willingness to harm multiple agency employees, potentially even at their residences, if the agency removed her. Moreover, ignoring or excusing the appellant's statements that she would kill herself and potentially others if she were removed goes far beyond extending employees additional "leeway" in their conduct while speaking with an EEO counselor. Accordingly, the fact that the appellant's inappropriate statements were made during the course of a meeting with her EEO representative does not excuse her inappropriate statements or prevent the agency from relying on such statements in its removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that we have previously expressed concern with an agency taking an adverse action against an employee on the basis of statements made to medical professionals and employee assistance program (EAP) counselors. <span class="Italic">See Larry v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 348 (1997); <span class="Italic">Powell v. Department of Justice</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 29 (1997). In <span class="Italic">Larry</span>, the agency charged Mr. Larry with, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, threatening a supervisor based on statements that Mr. Larry made to a psychotherapist in the agency's EAP. <span class="Italic">Larry</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 355. The Board found that the agency failed to prove that the appellant made a threat under the elements set forth in <span class="Italic">Metz v. Department of Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001 (Fed. Cir. 1986), because the evidence showed that the appellant made the statements in the course of psychotherapy with the intent to obtain professional treatment for his violent feelings and not with the intent to threaten anyone. <span class="Italic">Larry</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 358. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, the agency charged the appellant with threatening to kill five agency employees based on statements he made in a telephone conversation with an EAP counselor. <span id="Page_2693"></span><span class="Italic">Powell</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 32. In considering whether the agency proved its charge under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, the Board noted that it was "particularly troubled by the agency's use of the appellant's conversation with an EAP counselor as the basis for his removal," reasoning that the agency advertised its EAP as a confidential program where employees could obtain assistance. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 35.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Larry</span> and <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, however, are distinguishable from the instant case in important aspects. First, <span class="Italic">Larry</span> and <span class="Italic">Powell</span> both involved threat charges and required analysis under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>. <span class="Italic">See Gray v. Government Printing Office</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6; 11 (2009) (recognizing a distinction between <span class="Italic">Powell</span> and <span class="Italic">Larry</span>, in which the agency was required to prove a threat charge under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, and a charge of making statements that cause anxiety in the workplace). Here, the appellant was charged only with inappropriate statements. Moreover, the appellant here made her statements to her union and EEO representative, not to a licensed psychotherapist or EAP counselor. <span class="Italic">Cf. Jaffee v. Redmond</span>, 518 U.S. 1 (1996) (recognizing a federal licensed psychotherapist-patient privilege). Accordingly, we perceive no support in Board case law for finding that the appellant's statements to her union representative were privileged.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's statements would not be protected under the attorney-client privilege.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The attorney-client privilege is the oldest privilege recognized for confidential communications at common law and is intended "to encourage full and frank communications between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and the administration of justice." <span class="Italic">Upjohn Co. v. United States</span>, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981); <span class="Italic">Grimes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 7, &#x00B6; 6 (2005). When considering claims of attorney-client privilege, we have relied on the following elements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The privilege only applies if (1) the asserted holder of the privilege is or sought to become a client; (2) the person to whom the communication was made is (a) a member of a bar of a court, or his subordinate, and (b) in connection with the communication is acting as a lawyer; (3) the communication relates to a fact of which the attorney was informed (a) by his client (b) without the presence of strangers (c) for the purpose of securing primarily either (i) an opinion on law or (ii) legal services (iii) or assistance in some legal proceeding, and not (d) for the purpose of committing a crime or tort; and (4) the privilege has been (a) claimed and (b) not waived by the client.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Grimes</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 7, &#x00B6; 9 (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.</span>, 89 F. Supp. 357, 358-59 (D. Mass. 1950)); <span class="Italic">Gangi</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 24.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying this standard, even if Mr. Silberstein had been the appellant's attorney, rather than her union and EEO representative, the appellant's communications to him would not have been privileged under the high confidentiality standards imposed under the attorney-client relationship. The appellant's statements that she would kill herself and potentially others if she were removed were not communications made in order to obtain legal advice and fall within the future crime exception to the attorney-client privilege. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Alexander</span>, 287 F.3d 811, 816 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that a client's threats to harm others, as communicated to his attorney by telephone and letter, were not communications made in order to obtain legal advice, constituted threats to commit future crimes, and were therefore not protected by the attorney-client privilege). Accordingly, the appellant's statements would not have been protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>
