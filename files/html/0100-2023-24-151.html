<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-147"><span class="space">11.</span> Injunction Action</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Administrative remedies have their limitations, and it may be that administrative remedies are nonexistent. Pursuing a case through OSC, the MSPB, or EEOC can take many months, or several years, while the former employee may languish without employment and with poor prospects of obtaining new employment. The urge to obtain quick and meaningful relief from the courts can be strong. But the civil servant attempting to secure a judicial injunction may find the going tough. In <span class="Italic">Sampson v. Murray</span>, 415 U.S. 61, 94 S. Ct. 937 (1974), involving a probationer's claim that her termination was procedurally irregular, the Court held that humiliation and reputational damage coupled with loss of earnings will not ordinarily constitute the irreparable injury necessary to justify a judicial stay or injunction. The Court left open the possibility that there might be some basis for an injunction in some undefined circumstances, 94 S. Ct. at 953 n.68:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that cases may arise in which the circumstances surrounding an employee's discharge, together with the resultant effect on the employee, may so far depart from the normal situation that irreparable injury might be found. Such extraordinary cases are hard to define in advance of their occurrence. We have held that an insufficiency of savings or difficulties in immediately obtaining other employment--external factors common to most discharged employees and not attributable to any unusual actions relating to the discharge itself--will not support a finding of irreparable injury, however severely they may affect a particular individual. But we do not wish to be understood as foreclosing relief in the genuinely extraordinary situation. Use o the court's injunctive power, however, when discharge of probationary employees is an issue, should be reserved for that situation rather than employed in the routine case....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With the cautionary note that older cases may not be reliable predictors of the outcome of litigation because of the more recent tendency of the Supreme Court and circuit courts to dismiss actions for injunctions by federal employees as preempted by the remedial structure of the Civil Service Reform Act, we note some decisions consider actions for injunctions or other equitable relief. <span class="Italic">Spagnola v. Mathis</span>, 859 F.2d 223 (D.C. Cir. 1988), discussed the availability of direct injunctive suits in court against the government (as opposed to suits for damages against officials) to remedy constitutional violations. Of significance was a determination made in <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. EPA</span>, joined with <span class="Italic">Spagnola</span> and reported at 859 F.2d 223, permitting a suit brought to enjoin the agency's failure to hire Mr. Hubbard because of his exercise of First Amendment free speech rights. Although a court's injunctive authority is available for constitutional claims, if those claims are intertwined with claims cognizable by CSRA agencies, e.g., First Amendment claims within the prohibited personnel practice jurisdiction of the Special Counsel, the plaintiff may be required to first exhaust the administrative remedy that could correct the injustice before resorting to federal court on the constitutional issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Steadman v. Governor, Soldiers' and Airmen's Home</span>, 918 F.2d 963 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (concerning constitutional claims mixed with unfair labor practice issues involving the duty of fair representation). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-18-012.html#sec11-13">Constitution</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The D.C. Circuit authorized a First Amendment injunctive challenge to a disciplinary suspension of an excepted service employee, <span class="Italic">Williams v. IRS</span>, 745 F.2d 702, 705 (D.C. Cir. 1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Bush</span> rested in large measure on the meaningful, even if less than optimally effective, statutory remedy Congress made available to the complainant, one that afforded him retroactive reinstatement and back pay. Williams is differently situated; he has no CSRA-conferred guarantee of an administrative adjudication outside the Service or of direct court review. Nor does he sue for damages as a substitute for or supplement to civil service remedies. He seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief. For his situation, our most instructive precedent is <span class="Italic">Borrell v. United States International Communications Agency</span>, 682 F.2d 981 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (CSRA procedures did not supplant pre-existing judicial remedy for first amendment claim where statute afforded complainant probationary employees no appeal to Merit Systems Protection Board or judiciary).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weaver v. USIA</span>, 87 F.3d 1429, 1432-35 (D.C. Cir. 1996), affirmed a district court's jurisdiction to consider the First Amendment implications, and associated request for injunctive relief, as to prepublication review requirements and associated personnel actions. Yet the court also concluded that a plaintiff must exhaust OSC remedies before obtaining judicial review of a disciplinary action arguably based on First Amendment considerations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Non-judicial remedies for adverse personnel decisions by government employers stem from two sources: the Civil Service Reform Act ("CSRA") of 1978, Pub. L. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5 USC), and provisions of collective bargaining agreements affording grievance rights to covered employees (the latter strongly bolstered by the CSRA itself). <span class="Italic">See Suzal v. Director, USIA</span>, 32 F.3d 574, 578-82 (D.C. Cir. 1994). In this case only the CSRA's direct remedies are relevant; the collective bargaining agreement covering Weaver and other members of the bargaining unit of Local 1812 of the American Federation of Government Employees expressly exempts "admonishments" from the category of personnel actions giving rise to grievance rights....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA provides remedies for any "prohibited personnel practice." Such practices include "tak[ing] or fail[ing] to take any...personnel action if the taking of or failure to take such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in section 2301 [of title 5]." 5 USC 2302(a)(1) &#x0026; (b)(11). Among the merit system principles in &#x00A7; 2301 is the requirement that all employees be treated "with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2). So it is a "prohibited personnel practice" to take a personnel action that unconstitutionally burdens an employee's speech. <span class="Italic">Suzal</span>, 32 F.3d at 580; <span class="Italic">Spagnola v. Mathis</span>, 859 F.2d 223, 225 &#x0026; n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It also appears that an admonishment is a "personnel action" (and thus the sort of act that can qualify as a "prohibited personnel practice") as the term has been interpreted by the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB"), the administrative body charged with implementing the CSRA. The statute defines "personnel action" to include "an action under chapter 75 of this title [governing dismissals, suspensions, grade or pay reductions, and furloughs] <span class="Italic">or other disciplinary or corrective action."</span> 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(iii) (emphasis added). The MSPB at one time applied the principle of <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span> to read "other disciplinary or corrective action" as limited to acts "in the nature of a Chapter 75 action," i.e., acts of a similar type and seriousness. <span class="Italic">Caddell v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 52 MSPR 529, 532-33 (1992). Now, however, it views admonishments as "personnel actions" and apparently does not distinguish between oral and written ones. <span class="Italic">Cochran v. Dep't of Veterans</span>, 67 MSPR 167, 174 (1995) (letter of admonishment); <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev.</span>, 64 MSPR 314, 319 (1994) ("an official reprimand"). The MSPB's interpretation is entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 840 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Thus, if the review requirement giving rise to Weaver's oral admonishment is unconstitutional, as she says, then the admonishment is a "prohibited personnel practice."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the oral admonishment is not one of the relatively drastic personnel actions that entitle the affected employee to appeal to the MSPB, <span class="Italic">compare</span> 5 USC 4303(e), 7513(d) (permitting appeal in the case of dismissal and other serious actions), Weaver's remedy under the CSRA consists of the right to file a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel ("OSC"). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(1)(A). If the OSC finds "reasonable grounds" to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, it must report its determination to the agency involved and the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(B). If the agency fails to correct the practice within a reasonable period of time, then OSC may--but need not--seek corrective action by the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(C). The OSC is required to act on allegations of prohibited personnel practices within 240 days, with an exception for situations in which the person making the allegation agrees to an extension of time. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the CSRA gives the OSC discretion whether to seek corrective action, our circuit's law affords employees in Weaver's position a right to federal court review of their constitutional claims at the end of the line. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Spagnola</span>, 859 F.2d at 229-30; <span class="Italic">Griffith v. FLRA</span>, 842 F.2d 487, 494-95 (D.C. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">cf. Webster v. Doe</span>, 486 U.S. 592, 603, 108 S. Ct. 2047, 2053-54, 100 L. Ed.2d 632 (1988) (general presumption of reviewability for constitutional challenges). <span class="Italic">But cf. Saul v. United States</span>, 928 F.2d 829, 843 &#x0026; n.27 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding unreviewable a constitutional claim intertwined with a CSRA claim, and noting the departure of this circuit from other circuits' rulings on the issue); <span class="Italic">Pinar v. Dole</span>, 747 F.2d 899, 909-12 (4th Cir. 1984) (similar). But first the plaintiff must exhaust available administrative remedies. <span class="Italic">Steadman v. Governor, United States Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 918 F.2d 963, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Weaver, in declining to challenge her oral admonishment with the OSC, indisputably failed to satisfy this requirement. The question is the effect of that failure as to each of the counts in her complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5388"></span>Under the CSRA, exhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 966-68; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 108 S. Ct. 668, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988) (holding that the CSRA, in failing to provide explicitly for administrative or judicial remedies for certain decisions affecting nonpreference excepted service employees, implicitly bars judicial remedies). The exhaustion requirement clearly applies to Weaver's claim for relief from the oral admonishment (which as we have seen is remediable under the CSRA), and thus Counts II and III of her complaint must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The exhaustion requirement generally applies as well to claims arising directly under the Constitution (such as Weaver's claim for declaratory and injunctive relief from the prepublication review requirement) when such claims are "'premised on the same facts'" as the plaintiff's CSRA claims and "the CSRA remedy 'would have been fully effective in remedying the constitutional violation.'" <span class="Italic">Steadman</span>, 918 F.2d at 967 (quoting <span class="Italic">Andrade v. Lauer</span>, 729 F.2d 1475, 1493 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). Here, Weaver's constitutional claim is intertwined with her CSRA claim in the most absolute manner imaginable: it is its sole basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But Weaver disputes the effectiveness of the CSRA remedy, saying that only a court can provide an injunction against enforcement of the prepublication review requirement. In requiring that the CSRA remedy be effective, however, we do not think <span class="Italic">Steadman</span> and <span class="Italic">Andrade</span> intended so high a standard, for under that standard the CSRA remedy would be inadequate whenever the plaintiff sought injunctive relief. Further, Weaver's view that the inability to grant injunctive relief is material assumes that the government would continue to enforce the review requirement even after an unreversed administrative finding that the requirement was unconstitutional. Weaver also points to the uncertainties in the CSRA remedy--the possible delays and the dependence on a favorable exercise by the OSC of its discretion whether to take the case to the MSPB. But the delays seem no more than the normal concomitant of an exhaustion requirement--perhaps less, in view of the statute's deadline for OSC action. Although the OSC discretion adds an element of uncertainty that is distinct from the ordinary vicissitudes of agency proceedings, Congress evidently thought it adequate in view of the relatively minor character of the wrongs whose redress it left to OSC discretion, perhaps fearing that a universal right of appeal to the MSPB would cause trivial claims to delay and crowd out more serious ones. In any event, in this circuit there is, as we have seen, the opportunity for judicial relief at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Weaver has not established that the CSRA remedy would be ineffective, she is nevertheless entitled to pursue her non-CSRA claim for declaratory and injunctive relief without having exhausted her administrative remedies for the oral admonishment. This is so because, in contrast to the situation contemplated in <span class="Italic">Steadman</span>, the count of her complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief stands independently of the admonishment; indeed it is virtually identical to the original complaint she filed before the oral admonishment had occurred. Thus, if we simply affirmed the dismissal of the amended complaint on exhaustion grounds, Weaver would be free to--and almost certainly would--promptly refile her complaint shorn of references to her refusal to observe the review requirement and the resulting admonishment. As in <span class="Italic">United States v. Nat'l Treasury Employees Union</span>, [513 U.S. 454], 115 S. Ct. 1003, 130 L. Ed.2d 964 (1995) <span class="Italic">("NTEU")</span>, and <span class="Italic">Sanjour v. EPA</span>, 56 F.3d 85 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), the district court would have jurisdiction over such a suit, framed as a simple pre-enforcement attack on a regulation restricting employee speech. This feature of Weaver's challenge distinguishes it from the ordinary case of a failure to exhaust CSRA remedies, in which the employee would have no claim that she could file directly in federal court if isolated from her claims for relief from a personnel action against her. We see no reason for disabling Weaver from pursuing in federal court a constitutional claim that under First Amendment principles is as final, ripe and free from exhaustion difficulties as it need be, and that she has standing to pursue, merely because she has also experienced a personnel action related to that claim....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bonds v. Heyman</span>, 950 F. Supp. 1202, 1217 (D.D.C. 1997) (permitting employee to seek injunction without going through administrative procedures when personnel action alleged to be discriminatory or retaliatory is threatened during course of Title VII litigation; court balances plaintiff's likelihood of success, the level of injury that would be suffered by the plaintiff, and the public interest).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The First Circuit suggested in<span class="Italic"> Irizarry v. United States</span>, 427 F.3d 76, 78-80 (1st Cir. 2005), providing some guidance concerning the availability of injunctive relief to federal employees, that if resort to the courts was to be allowed by reason of constitutional (First Amendment) concerns as to a geographical transfer of an agency employee, a precondition to the suit would be resort to the Office of Special Counsel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee may not challenge a transfer by means of a direct appeal to the MSPB. Instead, she must file an administrative complaint with the OSC. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1212(a)(2), 1214(a)(1)(A), 2302(a)(2)(A)(iv). The OSC must "investigate...to the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel action has occurred, exists, or is to be taken." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1214(a)(1)(A). If the OSC determines that such grounds exist, it may request that the agency rescind the action and, if the agency declines, petition the MSPB to take appropriate remedial steps. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(B),(C). The OSC is generally required to act on an administrative complaint within 240 days. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(A). If the OSC terminates the investigation because it does not find reasonable grounds to conclude that a prohibited personnel action has or will occur, the OSC must tell the complaining employee the reason for its action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 1214(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA does not provide for review by the MSPB or an Article III court of an OSC decision to terminate an investigation into an employee's complaint. The government argues that this congressional silence indicates that the OSC procedure is the exclusive avenue to relief. Irizarry counters that, because the OSC's decision to intervene is discretionary, the CSRA does not provide an adequate remedy to vindicate constitutional rights. Therefore, Irizarry contends he may sue in federal court to vindicate his constitutional claim. We assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that some form of Article III review is available to Irizarry, even though it is not expressly provided for by the CSRA. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dugan</span> <span class="Italic">v.</span> <span class="Italic">Ramsay</span>, 727 F.2d 192, 194-95 (1st Cir. 1984) (federal civil servant applicant held entitled to obtain review of a personnel decision in federal court because, under the CSRA, the claim could not find its way to the MSPB).[2] Nevertheless, as we will explain, Irizarry's complaint was properly dismissed because he did not exhaust his remedies by first filing a complaint with the OSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Because we affirm on other grounds, we do not address the government's contention that <span class="Italic">Dugan</span> is so out-of-step with recent Supreme Court precedent that it is no longer good law. We do note, however, that <span class="Italic">Dugan</span> was decided several years before the Court recognized the preclusive effect of the CSRA in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 455. We note also that several (although not all) of our sister circuits have concluded that the CSRA precludes federal lawsuits filed after the OSC has declined to act on an employee's claim. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Saul</span> <span class="Italic">v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 928 F.2d 829, 835-843 (9th Cir. 1991) (barring action); <span class="Italic">Lombardi</span> <span class="Italic">v.</span> <span class="Italic">Small Business Admin.</span>, 889 F.2d 959, 961 (10th Cir. 1989) (same); <span class="Italic">Pinar v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">While we do not decide whether <span class="Italic">Dugan</span> remains good law, we do reject the government's assertion that we effectively overruled <span class="Italic">Dugan</span> in <span class="Italic">Berrios</span> <span class="Italic">v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army</span>, 884 F.2d 28 (1st Cir. 1989).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies serves important purposes. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCarthy v.

Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These policy goals, and the lack of countervailing interests, favor requiring a federal employee to file a claim with the OSC before repairing to federal court. "The CSRA established a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel actions taken against federal employees." <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 455. Permitting an employee to bypass the OSC entirely would permit the employee to avoid the remedial scheme that Congress enacted, even though nothing in the CSRA suggests that Congress intended resort to the OSC to be optional. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Velazquez-Rivera v. Danzig</span>, 234 F.3d 790, 794 (1st Cir. 2000) (ruling that plaintiff forfeited any federal court review of his termination by not following the procedures set forth in the CSRA). By contrast, requiring exhaustion permits the federal agency to correct the violation or to explain its decision. This promotes agency authority and accountability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Martin v. United States Env. Protection Agency</span>, 271 F. Supp.2d 38, 45 (D.D.C. 2000). Moreover, the OSC remedy provides a method for resolving many employment disputes without turning them into federal cases. This reduces the caseload of the federal courts and relieves the courts from serving as "super personnel boards." <span class="Italic">DiPrio v. Taft</span>, 584 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1978).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Several courts, which may permit an employee in Irizarry's position to sue in federal court, require administrative exhaustion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Weaver v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A discriminatory transfer of the sort Irizarry allegedly suffered is not a trivial slight.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Noting that <span class="Italic">Sampson</span> involved lack of procedural due process and discharge in violation of Civil Service Regulations, as opposed to an action under title VII, the district court herein held that the strict standards of <span class="Italic">Sampson</span> did not apply to the instant case and that irreparable injury was established herein by the alleged damage to Stewart's family relationships, his inability to support his family, and the possibility that others might be chilled in exercising their rights as a result of alleged retaliatory action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the <span class="Italic">Holt</span> court follows <span class="Italic">Sampson</span> and suggests, in <span class="Italic">dictum</span>, that there may be exceptions to the <span class="Italic">Sampson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Herein, Stewart has plainly failed to demonstrate the existence of "extraordinary circumstances" sufficient to avoid application of the strict standards articulated in <span class="Italic">Sampson</span>. According to appellee, the INS' action caused him irreparable harm by, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, degrading and humiliating him in the eyes of his peers, family, and community, thereby damaging his reputation and self-esteem, by causing his family to suffer undue hardship, and by preventing him from adequately providing for his family. Such unfortunate effects either alone or in combination do not constitute irreparable harm sufficient to justify injunctive relief. Concerning injury to Stewart's reputation, the <span class="Italic">Sampson</span> Court stated that damage to reputation "falls far short of the type of irreparable injury which is a necessary predicate to the issuance of a temporary injunction." <span class="Italic">Sampson</span>, 415 U.S. at 91-92, 94 S.

With regard to the hardship imposed on Stewart's family and his inability to financially provide for them, while we concede the harm resulting to individuals in this situation, it is exactly this type of harm which the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Sampson</span> stated would be insufficient to demonstrate the irreparable harm required for injunctive relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the district court herein alluded to the possibility that denying Stewart relief might produce irreparable harm by chilling future actions by other employees alleging discrimination.

In <span class="Italic">Holt</span>, however, this Court expressly rejected the notion that a chilling effect sufficient to warrant a finding of irreparable harm presumptively exists in every employee discharge case alleging retaliation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 91. Rather, the <span class="Italic">Holt</span> court remanded the case to the district court for an explicit determination as to whether in the particular circumstances therein, the risk of irreparable harm existed as the result of a potential chilling effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above, even if the district court herein had jurisdiction over Stewart's claim regarding his suspension without pay, we would conclude that the district court erred in failing to apply the <span class="Italic">Sampson</span> standards.

<p class="Body-Text">The Third Circuit permitted a suit for injunctive and declaratory relief arising from violations of federal employees' constitutional rights, <span class="Italic">Mitchum v. Hurt</span>, 73 F.3d 30, 31-36 (3d Cir. 1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The three appellants in this case are Kenneth L. Mitchum, previously Chief of Medical Services of the VAMC; Deborah L. Webb, Assistant Chief Nurse for Special Projects; and Steven J. Krumholz, Staff Assistant to the Associate Director. All three appellants could have pursued administrative remedies to vindicate the alleged violations of their First Amendment rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Krumholz enjoyed the protection of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. 95-454 (codified at various sections of Title 5 USC), and the Whistle-Blower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. 101-12 (codified at various sections of Title 5 USC). Under the CSRA, retaliation against a "whistleblower" is a "prohibited personnel practice." 5 USC 2302(b)(8). An allegation of a "prohibited personnel practice" may be submitted to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) of the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB). 5 USC 1212(a)(2), 1214(a)(1)(A). The OSC must investigate such an allegation and determine "whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken." 5 USC 1214(a)(1)(A). If the OSC determines that no such grounds exist, the person who submitted the allegation must be notified. 5 USC 1214(a)(2)(A). While the investigation continues, the OSC must periodically notify the person who made the allegation of its status. 5 USC 1214(a)(1)(C). If the OSC determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the prohibited personnel action was or is to be taken, the OSC may petition a member of the MSPB for a stay and may recommend "corrective action" to the agency involved, the MSPB, and the Office of Personnel Management. 5 USC 1214(b)(1)(A)(i), (2)(B). The OSC may also recommend disciplinary action against an employee who is reasonably believed to have committed a prohibited personnel practice. 5 USC 1215(a)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where the allegation submitted to the OSC concerns retaliation for whistle-blowing, review by the MSPB is always available. If the OSC notifies the person making the allegation that the investigation has been terminated or if the OSC does not notify this person within 120 days that corrective action will be taken, the person may seek corrective action from the MSPB (5 USC 1214(a)(3), 1221(a)), and the MSPB may issue a stay and order "such corrective action as [it] considers appropriate." 5 USC 1214(b)(4)(A). A final order or decision of the MSPB is subject to judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 5 USC 1221(h), 7703(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mitchum and Webb were appointed to their positions under 38 USC 7401(1) and were subject to a different statutory scheme. Under this scheme, the most extensive review is available in a case involving a "major adverse action" based on "conduct or performance." The term "major adverse action" is defined as including a suspension, transfer, reduction in grade or basic pay or discharge. 38 USC 7461(c)(2). A question of professional conduct or competence is defined as a question involving "[d]irect patient care" or "[c]linical competence." 38 USC 7461(c)(3). In a case concerning a "major adverse action" based on "conduct or performance" or in a so-called "mixed case"--i.e., one involving both a "major adverse action" based on "conduct or performance" and other adverse actions (<span class="Italic">see</span> 38 USC 7462(a)(3))--the appointee may appeal to a Disciplinary Appeals Board (DAB). 38 USC 7462(a). After the DAB renders a decision, the Secretary may, pursuant to that decision, "order reinstatement, award back pay, and provide such other remedies as the Board [finds] appropriate..., including expungement of records relating to the action." 38 USC 7462(d)(1). An appointee adversely affected by a DAB decision, as reviewed by the Secretary, may obtain judicial review. 38 USC 7462(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Grievances not involving a "major adverse action" based on "conduct or performance" or a "mixed case" proceed through internal VA administrative channels or those specified in an applicable collective bargaining agreement. 38 USC 7461(b)(2), 7463.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead of pursuing these remedies, the appellants filed an action in district court against the VAMC's director, chief of staff, associate director, chief of nursing service, and chief nurse, as well as the regional chief nurse of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The complaint contained five counts, but only the second is involved in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Count II alleged that in 1991 Mitchum began to criticize the manner in which patients were treated at the VAMC. According to the complaint, Mitchum complained about efforts to close a unit of the facility, a general decline in patient care, the death of a patient in June 1992, patient nutrition, and the "warehousing" of psychiatric patients in the non-psychiatric unit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of these criticisms, the complaint asserted, Mitchum's superiors took retaliatory measures against him. According to the complaint, Mitchum had received at least "highly satisfactory" evaluations in the years before 1992, but he received only a "satisfactory" rating in his 1991-92 performance review....&#8197;Count II alleged that, at about the same time, Webb began to criticize the manner in which patients were treated and was likewise targeted for retaliation. According to the complaint, Webb had received promotions and outstanding performance evaluations until 1992, but in September 1992 she received a written "Counseling for Performance" and was subsequently demoted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The complaint alleged that Krumholz had complained in September 1992 to the Department of Veterans Affairs Inspector General's office that his boss had committed plagiarism and that there had been an attempt to serve outdated food to patients. Although Krumholz had previously received excellent evaluations, the complaint alleged, he was subsequently given oral and written counselings and was demoted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Count II purported to assert a claim under 42 USC 1983 and sought various forms of injunctive and declaratory relief, including an order directing the defendants to cease and desist from retaliation, harassment, and reprisal; an order directing the removal of certain documents from the plaintiffs' files; and an order directing the appointment of a permanent community-based board of overseers to monitor the operations of the facility. Webb and Krumholz also sought reinstatement to their prior positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The defendants moved for dismissal or in the alternative for summary judgment, and the magistrate judge to whom this motion was referred recommended that it be granted....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, a federal employee asserted a First Amendment claim that was quite similar in all respects but one to the claim of the appellants in this case. In <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, the employee contended that he had been suspended in retaliation for whistle-blowing, and although he had been restored to his prior position with backpay as a result of administrative proceedings, he sought to obtain damages and attorney's fees in a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action. 462 U.S. at 369-72 &#x0026; nn. 8 and 9, 103 S. Ct. at 2406-2409 &#x0026; nn. 8 and 9. The Supreme Court, however, declined to create the "new judicial remedy" that he sought. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 368, 103 S. Ct. at 2406. The Court noted that a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action could be defeated where there are "'special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress,'" <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 377, 103 S. Ct. at 2411 (quoting <span class="Italic">Bivens</span>, 403 U.S. at 396, 91 S. Ct. at 2004), and the Court found such a factor in the "comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions" of the CSRA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 462 U.S. at 368, 103 S. Ct. at 2406. The Court noted that this "elaborate remedial system" had been "constructed step by step, with careful attention to conflicting policy considerations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 388, 103 S. Ct. at 2416. The Court observed that the risk of personal liability could deter supervisors from imposing discipline and that Congress was in "a far better position than a court to evaluate the impact of a new species of litigation between federal employees or the efficiency of the civil service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 389, 103 S. Ct. at 2416. The Court thus declined "'to create a new substantive legal liability without legislative aid[.] '" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 390, 103 S. Ct. at 2417 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two years later, in <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 108 S. Ct. 668, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988), the Court pointed to the comprehensive nature of the CSRA in holding that a federal employee could not seek backpay under the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596, even though such claim had won judicial recognition prior to the CSRA. Later the same term, in <span class="Italic">Schweiker v. Chilicky</span>, 487 U.S. 412, 108 S. Ct. 2460, 101 L. Ed.2d 370 (1988), the Court relied on <span class="Italic">Bush</span> in refusing to recognize a non-statutory damages claim for the unconstitutional denial of Social Security disability benefits. The Court observed that "[w]hen the design of a Government program suggests that Congress has provided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of its administration, we have not created additional <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> remedies." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 423, 108 S. Ct. at 2467.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on these decisions--and in particular on <span class="Italic">Bush</span>--a good argument <span id="Page_5391"></span>can be made that a federal employee who has meaningful administrative remedies and a right to judicial review under the CSRA or another comparable statutory scheme is not permitted to bypass that scheme by bringing an action under 28 USC 1331 and seeking injunctive or declaratory relief. Several courts of appeals have so held, and these decisions have much to recommend them. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Saul v. United States</span>, 928 F.2d 829, 843 (9th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Dep't of Health and Human Services</span>, 901 F.2d 1571, 1575-77 (11th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Lombardi v. Small Business Administration</span>, 889 F.2d 959, 962 (10th Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The District of Columbia Circuit, however, has reached the opposite conclusion. In <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. EPA</span>, 809 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir. 1986), an unsuccessful applicant for a position as a criminal investigator with the Environmental Protection Agency claimed that he had been rejected because he had previously engaged in communications with the press that were protected by the First Amendment. The panel that initially heard the appeal held that <span class="Italic">Bush</span> defeated the applicant's <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim for damages but permitted him to seek the equitable remedy of reinstatement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...On balance, we think that the District of Columbia Circuit has taken the better course. The power of the federal courts to grant equitable relief for constitutional violations has long been established....&#8197;It is reasonable to assume that Congress legislates with the understanding that this form of judicial relief is generally available to protect constitutional rights. While Congress may restrict the availability of injunctive relief (<span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, 28 USC 1341, 2283; 26 USC 7421(a)), we believe that we should be very hesitant before concluding that Congress has impliedly imposed such a restriction on the authority to award injunctive relief to vindicate constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that <span class="Italic">Bush</span> found that the history and structure of the CSRA spoke with sufficient clarity to preclude the creation of a new <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim. But the Supreme Court has developed a special jurisprudence for <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claims, and we are hesitant to extend this jurisprudence into other spheres. Just because "special factors counselling hesitation" militate against the creation of a new nonstatutory damages remedy, it does not necessarily follow that the long-recognized availability of injunctive relief should be restricted as well. We assume that the power of the federal courts to award legal and equitable relief in actions under 28 USC 1331 stems from the same source, <span class="Italic">see Bush</span>, 462 U.S. at 374, 103 S. Ct. at 2409, but that does not mean that the factors that counsel against one type of relief are equally applicable with respect to the other. <span class="Italic">See Bivens</span>, 403 U.S. at 405-06, 91 S. Ct. at 2009-10 (Harlan, J., concurring in the judgment)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have noted, a good argument can be made that the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Bush</span> should be applied to cases involving only injunctive relief, but this application involves a big and important jump. Without more specific guidance from the Supreme Court, we do not think that this is a jump that we should make. We, therefore hold that <span class="Italic">Bush</span> and the related Supreme Court decisions on which the defendants rely did not prevent the district court from entertaining the appellants' requests for injunctive relief. Nor do we interpret these precedents as limiting the district court's authority to award declaratory relief under 28 USC 2201-02.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Semper v. Gomez</span>, 747 F.3d 229 (3d Cir. 2014) (by not providing a remedy, CSRA precluded a claim for monetary or due process equitable or declaratory relief in district court for terminated probation officer serving in judicial branch when court system provided for administrative review).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the Fifth Circuit, <span class="Italic">Broadway v. Block</span>, 694 F.2d 979 (5th Cir. 1982), concluded that without a demonstrable property right in not being reassigned, or in the absence of a constitutional liberty interest violation, a CSRA scheme precluded a direct suit to enjoin a reassignment without the loss of pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Feds for Medical Freedom v. Biden</span>, 30 F.4th 503 (5th Cir. 2022) (dissent by Judge Barksdale) (rejecting suit for injunction against E.O. 14043, mandating Covid-19 vaccinations for executive branch employees, subject to medical and religious exceptions; discussing the comprehensive review scheme of the CSRA and the adequacy of administrative challenges through MSPB or OSC of personnel actions resulting from failure to accept vaccination, with availability of review of constitutional issues in the Federal Circuit).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gilley v. United States</span>, 649 F.2d 449, 452-56 (6th Cir. 1981), affirmed the jurisdiction of a district court to grant an injunction, although the circuit court concluded that the district judge applied the wrong criteria to assess the validity of a request for an injunction to prevent a geographical reassignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal the government contends that the district court was without authority to enjoin plaintiff's transfer because the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 5 USC 1101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (1976 ed., Supp. III), contains the exclusive procedure for obtaining judicial review of federal personnel actions. The statutory scheme of the Act provides for judicial review of final personnel actions in the Court of Claims or the appropriate court of appeals. 5 USC 7703. This judicial review, however, follows the completion of administrative procedures, culminating in a review of the action by the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Act also contains a provision by which the Special Counsel to the MSPB may seek a stay of any personnel action for 15 days upon a determination of reasonable grounds to believe the action was taken as a result of "a prohibited personnel practice." 5 USC 1208. The government argues that this grant of authority to the Special Counsel provides the only means of maintaining the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> pending appeal from a federal personnel action, and that its effect is to deprive district courts of any power to intervene. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Though the Reform Act of 1978 represented a comprehensive overhaul of the federal civil service system, we find no indication within the statutory language, or the legislative history, of an intent to deprive district courts of their traditional equitable powers. The plaintiff did not seek review of the refusal of the Special Counsel to seek a temporary stay on his behalf. The authority of the Special Counsel in this regard is purely discretionary and there is no statutory provision for review of the exercise of this discretion. What the plaintiff sought and received from the district court was traditional equitable relief in the form of an injunction to prevent immediate irreparable injury which he claimed he would suffer if the transfer order were carried out prior to completion of administrative review of the action of the Bureau. This was an entirely different degree of judicial protection than that provided by the Act. The two avenues of relief are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of a clear showing of congressional intent to do so, courts will not infer that the enactment of a particular statute containing provisions for judicial review has the effect of withdrawing from the courts their traditional equitable powers. <span class="Italic">Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner</span>, 387 U.S. 136, 141, 87 S. Ct, 1507, 1511, 18 L. Ed.2d 681 (1967)....&#8197;We find no support for the argument that Congress intended to deprive district courts of their traditional power to prevent irreparable harm by providing for judicial review in another forum of final personnel actions and for limited temporary stays of administrative orders at the behest of an officer of the executive branch. Such a limitation on a long recognized power of the district courts could be found only in explicit language not present in the Reform Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Though the district court granted a preliminary injunction, it referred to the four criteria required for issuance of a stay<span class="Italic">. See Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Association</span> <span class="Italic">v. Federal Power Commission</span>, 259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C. Cir. 1958). Such stays are ordinarily granted by a court which has jurisdiction to review the orders of the court or administrative agency whose actions it is asked to stay; that is, such stays are granted by a reviewing court in order to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> pending its own review of the actions in question....&#8197;Since the district court has no jurisdiction to review final personnel orders under the Reform Act, it was not acting in aid of its own appellate jurisdiction when it granted the injunction in the present case. Rather, we believe, it was acting in the traditional role of an equity court and that its jurisdiction was founded on 28 USC 1331 (1976), the "federal question" provision. According to the complaint, the plaintiff's action is one which "arises under the Constitution, [or] laws...of the United States....&#8197;<span class="Italic">Id.</span>[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The plaintiff alleged several constitutional violations in his complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Sampson v. Murray</span>, 415 U.S. 61, 91, 94 S. Ct. 937, 953, 39 L. Ed.2d 166 (1974), the Supreme Court found that the showing by a probationary federal employee seeking to enjoin her discharge fell "far short" of the type of irreparable injury required to justify an injunction. Neither financial losses nor damage to reputation was found to constitute irreparable harm sufficient to support a preliminary injunction. At least when the plaintiff is a probationary employee, irreparable injury sufficient to justify an injunction will be found only in "extraordinary cases." 415 U.S. at 92 n.68, 94 S. Ct. at 953 n.68. The plaintiff argues strenuously that <span class="Italic">Sampson</span> applies only to probationary employees, and that tenured employees such as he need only meet the less stringent "traditional" standards of irreparable injury. It is true that some of the language in <span class="Italic">Sampson</span> applies only to situations involving probationary employees, who have fewer procedural rights than permanent employees. 415 U.S. at 80-82, 94 S. Ct. at 948-49. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court was referring to all federal employee cases, not just those of probationary employees....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion that <span class="Italic">Sampson</span> states rules applicable to all cases where federal employees seek district court injunctive relief prior to completion of their administrative appeals is fortified by holdings of other courts. In <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Fletcher</span>, 518 F.2d 236 (5th Cir. 1975), the court of appeals concluded that the district court had erroneously found irreparable injury consisting of a loss of salary which would probably lead to foreclosure of a mortgage on the plaintiff's home and the loss of medical insurance which would be injurious given the plaintiff's "overwrought condition." In reaching this conclusion the court of appeals relied on <span class="Italic">Sampson</span>, along with other decisions, and stated that the distinction between tenured and probationary employees relates to their different procedural rights, not to whether there has been irreparable injury. 518 F.2d at 239 n.3. In <span class="Italic">Diliberti v. Brown</span>, 583 F.2d 950, 951 (7th Cir. 1978), the court held that the case of a permanent employee seeking injunctive relief prior to completion of his administrative appeal was controlled by <span class="Italic">Sampson</span>. <span id="Page_5392"></span><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Lynn</span>, 507 F.2d 1186, 1187 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1974); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Klassen</span>, 502 F.2d 362, 368 (D.C. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 419 U.S. 996, 95 S. Ct. 309, 42 L. Ed.2d 269 (1974). Gilley cites a number of district court decisions in support of his argument that <span class="Italic">Sampson</span> does not apply to tenured federal employees. These cases are distinguishable, however, in that there was either a denial of a statutory right to a hearing or there was no possibility of recovering back pay.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;E.g., <span class="Italic">Keyer v. Civil Service Commission of City of New York</span>, 397 F. Supp. 1362 (E.D.N.Y. 1975); <span class="Italic">American Fed. of Gov. Employees, Local 1858 v. Callaway</span>, 398 F. Supp. 176 (N.D. Ala. 1975), dismissed sub nom. <span class="Italic">American Fed. of Gov. Employees v. Hoffman</span>, 427 F. Supp. 1048 (N.D. Ala. 1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the district court failed to apply correct legal standards to Gilley's claim for injunctive relief. Its finding of a due process violation appears to be based on a determination that Gilley's reassignment to Leavenworth impermissibly burdened his right to an effective administrative appeal. We find no basis for this conclusion. The plaintiff was entitled to no greater rights than a discharged federal employee. Yet it is clearly established that a federal employee is not entitled to a hearing prior to discharge. <span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy</span>, 416 U.S. 134, 94 S. Ct. 1633, 40 L. Ed.2d 15 (1974). If an employee may be required to suffer the ultimate sanction of discharge prior to hearing, it follows that he has no right to postpone the effective date of a less serious punishment until after his administrative appeal is concluded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The injury which he claimed as a result of the transfer order consisted of the difficulty of working with his attorney on his appeal to the MSPB and the personal inconveniences and expenses involved in being temporarily separated from his family and in breaking community ties. The district court declined to find that the claims of disruption of family life and related matters constituted irreparable harm. This was clearly correct. However, we find no basis for the holding that there was a "deprivation" of Gilley's right to perfect his appeal. True, it would be more difficult if he were in Leavenworth, yet it would in no sense be impossible. Gilley had sufficient accumulated leave to provide ample opportunities to confer with his attorney and to attend any required hearing. In fact, he could have sought transfer of his appeal to the field office with jurisdiction over claims originating in Kansas. 5 CFR 1201.4(e). The investigation and any hearing could then have been conducted as if the action complained of had occurred at Leavenworth rather than Memphis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Careful examination of the entire record on appeal convinces us that the district court failed to consider "the well established rule that the Government has traditionally been granted the widest latitude" in such matters and erred "in routinely applying to this case the traditional standards governing more orthodox 'stays.'" <span class="Italic">Sampson, supra</span>, 415 U.S. at 83-84, 94 S. Ct. at 949-50 (citation and footnote omitted). The consequences of the transfer order which Gilley sought to escape were such as to evoke sympathy for his predicament, but they did not constitute irreparable injury.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Seventh Circuit determined in <span class="Italic">Egger v. Phillips</span>, 669 F.2d 497 (7th Cir. 1982), that a district court could entertain a request for an injunction to restrain the geographical reassignment of a FBI agent that was alleged to have been directed in reprisal for protected First Amendment disclosures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the Eighth Circuit, <span class="Italic">Carter v. Kurzejeski</span>, 706 F.2d 835 (8th Cir. 1983), decided that the CSRA preempts a First Amendment injunctive proceeding to stop the dismissal of union officials; similarly, the union had no right independent of FLRA procedures to obtain an injunction on behalf of the employees.<span class="Italic"> Steuart v. Suskie</span>, 867 F.2d 1148, 1150 (8th Cir. 1989), involved the appellant's claim to be enrolled in a fee panel used to select DHUD contract appraisers. When the appellant did not obtain the type of arrangement he felt was his right under DHUD regulations, he sued and claimed that DHUD had deprived him of property without due process. The court found no right of relief:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the HUD Notice and Handbook may have given Steuart an expectation that he would be placed on an active roster, he has not alleged a failure to provide the procedural safeguards required by the Constitution, i.e., notice and an opportunity to be heard. Nor does Steuart's allegation that appellees deprived him of a certain status in contravention of HUD policy statements state a "substantive due process" claim. The doctrine of substantive due process is reserved for a narrow class of cases, usually involving some egregiously unfair or shocking act of governmental oppression. Steuart here claims a violation by HUD of its own personnel procedures. If such a claim raises substantive-due-process concerns, every claim by a citizen that any government has violated a statute, regulation, or procedure, in such a way as adversely to affect "liberty" or "property" would create a constitutional lawsuit. The heavy artillery of constitutional litigation is not available on such an indiscriminate basis. If in fact the agency has acted unlawfully, ample remedies, including the Administrative Procedure Act, are available without resort to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Ninth Circuit decision, <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Stone,</span> 502 F.3d 1027 (9th Cir. 2007), recognized subject matter jurisdiction for a lawsuit brought to review the dismissal of a probationary TSA screener who allegedly was discharged for union-related activities that were argued to be protected by the First Amendment. [<span class="Italic">AFGE v. Stone</span> is excerpted earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-24-150.html#sec17-146">First Amendment</a>."] The Ninth Circuit sustained entry of an injunction pending appeal involving a form used to obtain information from federal employees. The form, used for issuance of identification credentials, required information that invaded the constitutionally-protected interest of personal privacy (questions concerning counseling employees may have received), with no apparent relation to production of reliable identification cards. <span class="Italic">Nelson v. NASA</span>, 506 F.3d 713 (9th Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Surveying the law, the Eleventh Circuit implied preclusion of injunctive relief for federal employees without administrative procedures to challenge their dismissals. An injunction by a VA medical resident appointed under Title 38 was unavailable without a defined property interest in the continuation of employment, <span class="Italic">Hardison v. Cohen</span>, 375 F.3d 1262, 1266-69 (11th Cir. 2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether Hardison can state a claim for equitable relief is a closer question. Our sister circuits have reached different conclusions about whether the unavailability of a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action for damages for a federal employee means that he is also barred from obtaining equitable relief for an alleged violation of the Constitution. Although this Court has not squarely addressed that question, two of our precedents can be read to support either of the possible answers. <span class="Italic">Cf. Stephens,</span> 901 F.2d at 1575-76 <span class="Italic">with Perry v. Thomas,</span> 849 F.2d 484, 484 (11th Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has not addressed directly the issue whether a remedial statutory scheme necessarily precludes an action for equitable relief brought by a federal employee. <span class="Italic">Bush</span> and <span class="Italic">Chilicky</span> addressed only <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> actions for damages. <span class="Italic">Chilicky,</span> 487 U.S. at 428, 108 S. Ct. at 2470 ("The remedy sought in <span class="Italic">Bush</span> was virtually identical to the one sought by respondents in this case: consequential damages for hardships resulting from an allegedly unconstitutional denial of a statutory right."). "[F]ederal courts have historically had broad authority to fashion equitable remedies [,] " and the Supreme Court has not ruled definitively that Congress has the authority to preclude those remedies. <span class="Italic">Carlson v. Green,</span> 446 U.S. at 42-44, 100 S. Ct. at 1484-85 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Several of our sister circuits have differed on whether equitable relief is precluded by the presence of a statutory remedial scheme. In <span class="Italic">Mitchum v. Hurt,</span> the Third Circuit stated that the "power of the federal courts to grant equitable relief for constitutional violations has long been established." 73 F.3d 30, 35 (3d Cir. 1995). The <span class="Italic">Mitchum</span> court acknowledged, however, that under the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, a "good argument can be made" that a federal employee subject to a comprehensive remedial scheme "should not be permitted to bypass that scheme by bringing an action under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1331 and seeking injunctive or declaratory relief." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 34. The Third Circuit nevertheless refused to apply the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Bush</span> to suits for equitable relief and reasoned "that Congress legislates with the understanding that this form of judicial relief is generally available to protect constitutional rights." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 35.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. EPA,</span> the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that "the courts' power to impose equitable remedies against agencies is broader than its power to impose legal remedies against individuals." 809 F.2d 1, 11 n.15 (D.C. Cir. 1986)<span class="Italic">, vacated on other grounds &#x0026; reaff'd by Spagnola v. Mathis,</span> 859 F.2d 223 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Although "Congress may limit this power...CSRA did not explicitly limit our jurisdiction to enjoin unconstitutional personnel actions by federal agencies." <span class="Italic">Hubbard,</span> 809 F.2d at 11 n.15. The reasoning of <span class="Italic">Hubbard</span> was affirmed in <span class="Italic">Spagnola,</span> in which the court stated, "[T]ime and again this court has affirmed the right of civil servants to seek equitable relief against their supervisors, and the agency itself, in vindication of their constitutional rights." <span class="Italic">Spagnola,</span> 859 F.2d at 229-30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Ninth and Tenth Circuits have held that, under <span class="Italic">Bush</span> and <span class="Italic">Chilicky,</span> a comprehensive remedial scheme bars a federal employee from obtaining equitable relief. In <span class="Italic">Saul v. United States</span>, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, "judicial interference in federal employment is disfavored, whether the employee requests damages or injunctive relief." 928 F.2d 829, 843 (9th Cir. 1991). In <span class="Italic">Lombardi v. Small Business Administration</span>, the Tenth Circuit explained that the "clear purpose of <span class="Italic">Chilicky</span>...is to virtually prohibit intrusion by the Courts into the statutory scheme....&#8197;This judicial intervention is disfavored whether it is accomplished by the creation of a damages remedy or injunctive relief." 889 F.2d 959, 961-62 (10th Cir. 1989). The Fourth and Seventh Circuits have acknowledged this division of authority, but have not decided the issue. <span class="Italic">Bryant v. Cheney,</span> 924 F.2d 525, 528 n.2 (4th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Paige v. Cisneros,</span> 91 F.3d 40, 44 (7th Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Commentators have also drawn different conclusions about this issue. Dean Nichol criticizes the Supreme Court for displaying "too strong a hesitancy...to recognize constitutional damages claims." Gene R. Nichol, Bivens, Chilicky, <span class="Italic">and Constitutional Damages Claims</span>, 75 Va. L.Rev. 1117, 1154 (1989). He argues that "the present juxtaposition of a hesitancy to grant damages awards with a willingness to allow injunctive relief...gets the traditional interplay between law and equity exactly backwards. Equitable remedies...are normally available only after legal remedies <span id="Page_5393"></span>have been demonstrated inadequate." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1135. Nichol concludes that damages should be available "when either the congressional remedy is inadequate or the decision that the Court is asked to make is committed to another branch of government." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1153.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another commentator argues that equitable remedies should be allowed, unless the statutory remedial scheme is "constitutionally sufficient." Elizabeth A. Wells, Note, <span class="Italic">Injunctive Relief for Constitutional Violations: Does the Civil Service Reform Act Preclude Equitable Remedies?,</span> 90 Mich. L.Rev. 2612, 2645 (1992). Otherwise, deficiencies in remedial schemes would leave "specific classes of federal employees without constitutional protections." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Denying the federal courts "the power to review the sufficiency of legislative schemes" and provide equitable relief violates the separation of powers, because the courts are unable to serve "as a check on other branches of government." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2642. Civil servants, therefore, must "be able to seek equitable relief through the federal courts, or their constitutional rights may be rendered meaningless." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2645.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although some courts of appeals and commentators have read our decision in <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> as foreclosing equitable remedies in the face of a comprehensive remedial statutory scheme, <span class="Italic">Mitchum,</span> 73 F.3d at 34; <span class="Italic">Paige,</span> 91 F.3d at 44; Martin H. Redish &#x0026; Suzanna Sherry, <span class="Italic">Federal Courts</span> 874 (4th ed. 1998), we are unpersuaded that this circuit has ruled squarely on the issue for three reasons. First, in <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> we did not mention any possible distinction between legal and equitable relief. Second, the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> was eligible for and took advantage of an administrative remedy. <span class="Italic">Stephens,</span> 901 F.2d at 1573-74. Had the <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> plaintiff been left without a remedy, it is not clear that this Court would have found that his equitable claim was barred. Third, <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> did not discuss <span class="Italic">Perry v. Thomas,</span> which held that the federal courts "have the power to issue injunctive relief, in appropriate cases, in disputes between the United States and its employees, notwithstanding the existence of administrative remedies." 849 F.2d at 484.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must resolve this difficult question only if Hardison possessed a property interest in his former position with the Medical Center. Implicit in any claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is the requirement that the interest threatened be either "life, liberty, or property." U.S. Const. Amend. V. Hardison contends that he has a property interest in his employment as a medical resident, but the word "property" must be given "some meaning." <span class="Italic">Bd. of Regents v. Roth,</span> 408 U.S. 564, 572, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 2706, 33 L. Ed.2d 548 (1972). Property interests are not created by the Constitution, but "are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law--rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 577, 92 S. Ct. at 2709. Federal law, no less than state law, can provide the rules or understandings that create and define property interests. <span class="Italic">See Mathews v. Eldridge,</span> 424 U.S. 319, 332, 96 S. Ct. 893, 901, 47 L. Ed.2d 18 (1976). We must, therefore, examine the federal laws under which Hardison was employed by a federal agency to determine whether those laws reasonably could support a property interest in his residency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 38 gives no support to Hardison's claim that he has a property interest in his former job protected by the Constitution. Hardison was appointed under 38 U.S.C. section 7406, which allows the Secretary of the VA to appoint residents and interns. Section 7406 employees are appointed "without regard to civil service or classification laws, rules, or regulations." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7406(a)(1). Section 7406 also gives discretion to the Secretary in managing the employment details of residents and interns. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7406(b), (c). Those employees are denied any right to appeal an adverse personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7461(c)(1). Hardison was a temporary employee, and he was appointed under a system that allows employees to be "expeditiously separated from service." <span class="Italic">Franks,</span> 796 F.2d at 1240.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hardison's contention that he has a property interest in his job is similar to the contention advanced by the plaintiffs in <span class="Italic">Silva v. Bieluch,</span> 351 F.3d 1045 (11th Cir. 2003). In <span class="Italic">Silva,</span> the plaintiffs were deputy sheriffs who were demoted from their positions as probationary lieutenants. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1046. Those plaintiffs asserted that their due process rights were violated because they were demoted without a hearing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1047. This Court concluded that, because their appointments were probationary, the plaintiffs had no property interest. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1047-48. Like the plaintiffs in <span class="Italic">Silva,</span> Hardison had neither a guarantee of future employment with the Medical Center, nor a statutory right to appeal any adverse personnel action, and he, therefore, cannot prove that he had a property interest in his job at the Medical Center.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Hardison complains that Cohen violated the grievance policies of the Council, which required that all podiatric residents be afforded a pretermination hearing and a posttermination appeal. Because Hardison does not and cannot allege that the grievance policies established the exclusive grounds upon which his discharge could be based nor that a podiatry resident could be discharged only for cause, the grievance policies did not create a property interest in Hardison's employment. <span class="Italic">Zeigler v. Jackson,</span> 716 F.2d 847, 849 (11th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Ogletree v. Chester,</span> 682 F.2d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of Am., AFL-CIO v. Univ. of Ala.,</span> 599 F.2d 56, 59-61 (5th Cir. 1979). Hardison also did not plead a breach of contract claim, under state law, and at oral argument his counsel conceded that he did not seek relief under state law. This argument, therefore, fails.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it did not distinguish between Hardison's requests for legal and equitable relief, the district court properly dismissed Hardison's complaint for both forms of relief. We may, of course, affirm the judgment of the district court on any ground that finds support in the record. <span class="Italic">Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc.,</span> 257 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir. 2001). As to Hardison's request for equitable relief, we need not decide, as the district court found, that the remedial scheme of Title 38 bars Hardison's claim, because the record establishes that Hardison did not have a property interest in his employment.</p>
