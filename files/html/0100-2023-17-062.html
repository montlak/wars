<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Von Zemenszky v. VA</span>, 80 MSPR 663, 668-77 (1999) (following remand, a PFR was denied by the split vote of Board members, and following OPM intervention, 85 MSPR 655 (2000)), <span class="Italic">affirming MSPB and denying OPM petition for review</span>, <span class="Italic">James v.

Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">post</span>, <span class="Italic">reh'g den.</span>, 301 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2002)), concluded that the RIF provisions of 5 USC 3501-04 and 5 CFR part 351 (2022) apply to health-care professionals of the Veterans Health Administration, whose employee was separated from the position of physician through a "staff adjustment":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">I.&#x2003;The clear language of the statutory and regulatory provisions governing RIFs indicates that the appellant is subject to those provisions and has the right to appeal her RIF separation to the Board.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We examine first the relevant statutory provisions governing RIFs. The law governing RIFs is grounded in the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 (Veterans' Preference Act), Pub. L. No. 359, ch. 287, &#x00A7; 12, 58 Stat. 390. Congress mandated in the Veterans' Preference Act, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that "<span class="Italic">[i]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">n any reduction in personnel in any civilian service of any Federal agency</span>, competing employees shall be released in accordance with Civil Service Commission regulations which shall give due effect to tenure of employment, military preference, length of service, and efficiency ratings." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis supplied). This portion of the Veterans' Preference Act has remained unchanged in substance since its enactment more than 50 years ago. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 3502(a); <span class="Italic">Grier v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 750 F.2d 944, 946 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The current version of the Veterans' Preference Act that pertains to RIFs is codified in subchapter I of chapter 35 of Title 5, 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3501-04.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The law governing RIFs, in 5 USC &#x00A7; 3501(b), expressly provides that, "[e]xcept as otherwise provided by this subsection...<span class="Italic">this</span> <span class="Italic">subchapter [I]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic"> applies to each employee in or under an Executive</span> <span class="Italic">agency."</span> (Emphasis supplied.) The agency in this appeal, "The Department of Veterans Affairs," is specifically named by statute as an "Executive agency." 5 USC &#x00A7; 101, 105. Thus, it would appear from the clear language of these statutes that all employees of the agency are subject to the Title 5 statutes that govern RIFs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Precedent of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit supports this construction of the statutory provisions involving RIFs. The court has found in reviewing the Board's final decision affirming the RIF separation of a preference eligible excepted service employee of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) that, although the TVA is a government corporation authorized by statute to appoint TVA employees '"without regard to the civil service laws," the TVA is also an agency in the Executive branch under 5 USC &#x00A7; 105. <span class="Italic">Dodd v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 770 F.2d 1038, 1040 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Thus, the court determined that the employee, as a preference eligible employee within the meaning of the Veterans' Preference Act and as an "employee in or under an Executive agency," 5 USC &#x00A7; 3501(b), was entitled to retention preference rights under 5 USC &#x00A7; 3502(c)<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1040-41. The court affirmed the Board's final decision, holding that the TVA did not violate those statutory rights in the employee's RIF separation appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1040-42. Consequently, it would appear from the construction of the clear language of 5 USC H 101, 105, and 3501(b) that Congress has spoken directly to the question of whether all employees appointed by the agency are subject to the Title 5 statutes that govern RIFs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has promulgated regulations at 5 CFR part 351 to carry out the basic RIF principles set forth in 5 USC &#x00A7; 3502. <span class="Italic">See Kohfield v. Department of the Navy,</span> 75 MSPR 1, 4 (1997). Under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2), "[e]ach agency" is required to follow OPM's RIF regulations "when it releases a competing employee from his or her competitive level by...separation...when the release is required because of lack of work; shortage of funds; insufficient personnel ceiling; [or] reorganization....." The appellant's separation pursuant to a "staff adjustment" necessitated "by a reduction in the projected level of resources" constitutes the kind of action that is covered by the regulations. Further, with exceptions that are not relevant here, section 351.201(a)(2) covers "each civilian employee in...[t]he executive branch of the Federal Government." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.202(a)(1).[1] The appellant falls within the coverage of the regulations. Finally, an employee covered by the RIF regulations at part 351, and who has been separated by RIF, is entitled to appeal the separation to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901. In sum, OPM's regulations on their face apply to the appellant's separation and give her the right to appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3068"></span>[1]&#x2003;The only employees expressly excluded from the coverage of 5 CFR part 351 are Senior Executives and those whose appointments require confirmation by, or the advice and consent of, the Senate. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.202(b).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1946, Congress enacted Veterans Administration, Department of Medicine and Surgery, Pub. L. No. 293, 59 Stat. 675, creating what is now the agency's VHA. As now codified and amended, section 7421 of Title 38 restates the substance of the original 1946 enactment, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Notwithstanding any law, Executive order, or regulation, the Secretary [of Veterans Affairs (Secretary)] shall prescribe by regulation the hours and conditions of employment and leaves of absence of employees appointed under any provision of this chapter [chapter 74] in positions in the Veterans Health Administration listed in subsection (b).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that section 7421(a) permits it to construct its own system for "staff adjustments" for VHA health-care professionals outside of the relevant Title 5 statutes and regulations. Relying on <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984), the agency contends that the Board should defer to its interpretation of section 7421(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point of every case involving statutory construction is the language of the statute itself. <span class="Italic">Hargrove v. Department of Defense</span>, 77 MSPR 266, 270 (1998); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 65 MSPR 380, 383 (1994).

Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's authority to prescribe the "conditions of employment" for VHA health-care professionals could be interpreted to encompass the authority to devise a system for retention and release during "staff adjustments," if the term "conditions of employment" is read broadly and in isolation. That term appears between the terms "hours" and "leaves of absence," however, suggesting that Congress may have intended something less far-reaching, relating merely to scheduling and tours of duty. The federal courts of appeals have reviewed the legislative history relating to this provision and have found that it is sparse, containing mere paraphrases of the statutory language in the House and Senate reports and a single reference in House debate. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees</span> <span class="Italic">v. Federal Labor Relations Authority,</span> 930 F.2d 1315, 1326 n.15 (8th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 851 F.2d 1486, 1489-90 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The reference in the House debate states in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]e know that people do not get sick by the clock. We found that in many of these hospitals under civil-service regulations and under the wage-hour law and other regulations doctors practice 40 hours a week....&#8197;[i]f [the doctors] had worked a few minutes overtime, compensatory time would have had to be given them, and it would have taken a great deal of complicated figuring and bookkeeping to straighten it out. In section [7421] we provided that notwithstanding any law, Executive order, or regulation, the [Secretary] shall prescribe by regulation the hours and conditions of employment and leaves of absence of doctors, dentists and nurses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">91 Cong. Rec. 11,662-63 (1945) (Rep. Scrivner); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 930 F.2d at 1326 n.15; <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association,</span> 851 F.2d at 1489-90. This passage supports a limited reading of the term "conditions of employment," rather than the broad reading urged by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that one court has found that section 7421(a) is "an integral part of an <span class="Italic">independent</span> personnel system that Congress has placed under the direct control of the Secretary." <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span> <span class="Italic">Association,</span> 851 F.2d at 1489 (emphasis supplied). The specific question before that court, however, was whether the agency had a duty to bargain over "conditions of employment" with VHA healthcare professionals under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7102; the court held that the agency had no such duty, given the Secretary's authority to prescribe "conditions of employment" under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7421(a) (codified at the time of the court's decision at 38 USC &#x00A7; 4108). <span class="Italic">See also National Federation of Federal Employees v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 73 F.3d 390, 395 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7421(a), the Secretary exercises complete discretion over the conditions of employment of the agency's medical personnel, including peer review procedures for Registered Nurses appointed under section 7401(l); hence, the Secretary need not engage in collective bargaining with regard to such conditions); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 930 F.2d at 1325-27 (the agency did not have a duty to bargain with the union representing Nurses employed at an agency hospital over working conditions because Title 38 granted the Secretary authority to prescribe the working conditions of health-care professionals employed by the agency). The courts have not considered whether the agency has the authority it claims in this appeal to establish, independent of the RIF statutes and regulations, a manner by which the agency may release health-care professionals appointed under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7401(l) after the agency decides to eliminate positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Apart from the absence of any definitive judicial interpretation of 38 USC &#x00A7; 7421(a) in the RIF context, the agency has not shown that it has consistently and over a long period interpreted section 7421(a) as authorizing it to construct its own RIF system. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Clark</span>, 454 U.S. 555, 564-65, 102 S. Ct. 805, 70 L. Ed.2d 768 (1982) (where an administrative interpretation of a statute is consistent and longstanding, it is particularly worthy of deference); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">De Jesus,</span> 63 MSPR at 592. The relevant copies of the agency's regulations and directives pertaining to "staff adjustments" that it has submitted date only from March 11, 1996. Thus, they do not establish that the agency's administrative interpretation of 38 USC &#x00A7; 7421(a) as permitting it to construct its own Veterans Health Administration system governing "staff adjustments" outside of 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3501-04 and 5 CFR part 351 is "consistent and longstanding." <span class="Italic">See De Jesus</span>, 63 MSPR at 592-93.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, the agency contends that it has promulgated regulations governing "staff adjustments," VHA Handbook 5111 (Mar. 11, 1996), established pursuant to VA Directive 5111 (Mar. 11, 1996), which it applied in this appeal to separate the appellant. The agency has submitted copies of its March 11, 1996 Handbook and Directive into the record. The agency's VA Directive 5111 states that the Handbook rescinds "Change 2, VA Personnel Policy Manual MP-5, Part II, chapter 11, January 24, 1992." The agency has also submitted into the record a copy of the rest of its VA Personnel Policy Manual MP-5, Part 11 (July 28, 1977, as amended). However, the agency has not submitted a copy of the January 24, 1992 chapter 11 that was rescinded by the March 11, 1996 Handbook, nor has it submitted copies of any prior regulations it promulgated governing "staff adjustments." If the agency has had the authority to maintain its own non-Title 5 RIF system for over 50 years, as it claims, we would expect the agency to have produced more than just recent, incomplete excerpts from its personnel rules.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, our review of relevant judicial precedent discloses not consistency but, at best, ambiguity regarding the agency's administrative interpretation of section 7421(a). In a civil action filed by an agency Physician who had been separated, the agency submitted an uncontradicted affidavit stating that the Physician was separated "because there was an excess of surgeons on the Cardiothoracic section of the [Surgical] Service and not as a disciplinary action." <span class="Italic">Balderman v. Veterans Administration</span>, 666 F. Supp. 461, 465-66 (W.D.N.Y. 1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part and vacated in part on other grounds,</span> 870 F.2d 57 (2d Cir. 1989). The district court found that VA Manual MP-5, Part 11, Chapter 11, [paragraph] 5 clearly states that 'retention principles contained in sections 3501 through 3504, title 5, USC'...apply insofar as they are consistent with the language of paragraph 5" to the agency's determination to separate the Physician<span class="Italic">. Balderman</span>, 666 F. Supp. at 466. The court also found that "the provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3501-04...require" that OPM prescribe RIF regulations applicable to the agency for the release of competing employees, such as the Physician, in the event of a RIF. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court granted summary judgment to the agency upon determining that the agency properly reached the Physician for release from his competitive level under OPM's applicable RIF regulations and the agency's regulations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency has not proffered any explanation to the Board in this appeal for the apparent prior inconsistent, or, at best, ambiguous position it took before the court in <span class="Italic">Balderman</span> that, at least by its regulations, it would apply 5 USC H 3501-04 to an employee appointed under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7401(l) who has been separated for reasons consistent with those applicable to RIF actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3069"></span>As explained in the preceding section, the plain language of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 indicates that Congress intended the RIF rules to cover all executive branch employees. If, in creating the VHA two years later, Congress had intended to exempt VHA healthcare professionals from those rules, it would have done so in explicit terms. The statutory phrase "conditions of employment" is not explained in the legislative history examined by the courts or that the parties have cited to us, and when read in context the phrase appears only to relate to scheduling and tours of duty. We conclude that 38 USC &#x00A7; 7421(a) cannot reasonably be interpreted as exempting VHA health-care professionals from the RIF rules at 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3501-3504 and 5 CFR part 351.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">B. The Title 5 RIF scheme is not inconsistent with other portions of Title 38 that govern VHA health-care professionals, nor would subjecting VHA health-care professionals to the Title 5 RIF scheme derogate any Title 38 provisions.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7425(b) of Title 38 states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no provision of title 5 or any other law pertaining to the civil service system which is inconsistent with any provision of section 7306 of this statute of this title or this chapter [chapter 74] shall be considered to supersede, override, or otherwise modify such provision of that section or this chapter except to the extent that such provision of title 5 or of such other law specifically provides, by specific reference to a provision of this chapter, or such provision to be superseded, overridden, or otherwise modified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the Title 5 RIF scheme is inconsistent with Title 38 provisions governing VHA health-care professionals, and that subjecting VHA health-care professionals to the Title 5 RIF scheme would be in derogation of Title 38 provisions. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the implication of the agency's arguments, nothing in Title 38 expressly states that civil service laws are inapplicable to VHA health-care professionals employed under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7401. Section 7425(a), which was added by the Act of 1991, does contain a list of Title 5 provisions that are expressly <span class="Italic">not</span> applicable to VHA health-care professionals appointed under section 7401(1), but all such Title 5 provisions relate to the Senior Executive Service. The provisions of subchapter I of chapter 35 of Title 5 governing RIFs. 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3501-04, are not a part of that list.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, as stated above, section 7425(b) states that no other provision of Title 5 or any other law pertaining to the civil service system which is inconsistent with any provision of chapter 74 of Title 38 shall be considered to supersede, override, or otherwise modify chapter 74 of Title 38 except to the extent that such provision of Title 5 or of such law specifically provides, by the specific reference to a Provision of chapter 74 of Title 38 for such provision to be superseded, overridden, or otherwise modified. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cochran v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs,</span> 67 MSPR 167, 171 (1995). The Board has determined that health-care professionals appointed by the agency under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7401(1) are appointed without regard to civil service requirements regarding qualifications and thus are excluded from the competitive service and may appeal an adverse action under 5 USC chapter 75 to the Board only under limited circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(b)(10); <span class="Italic">Falso v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 MSPR 207, 210-11 (1997); <span class="Italic">Pichon v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 67 MSPR 325, 326-27 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, a case which arises out of "a question of professional conduct or competence of a section 7401(l) employee" and in which a "major adverse action"[4] is taken under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7462 requires review and execution by the Secretary, the highest ranking administrative officer of the agency. Under such circumstances and in view of the statutory language that the Secretary's action shall be the "final administrative action in the case," the Secretary's action would be entitled to due deference and not be subordinated to review by the Board absent an express grant of review authority. <span class="Italic">See Cochran,</span> 67 MSPR at 173. However, it is undisputed in this case that the appellant's separation was taken by the agency due to a "staff adjustment" and does not arise out of a question of her "professional conduct or competence." <span class="Italic">See also Cochran</span>, 67 MSPR at 172 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 466, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. at 30 (1990) that "the issue of whether a matter or question involves professional conduct or competence is not subject to review by any other agency"). Thus, the Board's jurisdiction over this appeal is not foreclosed by section 7462.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;A "major adverse action" is defined as an adverse action involving a suspension, transfer, reduction in grade or basic pay, and discharge. 38 USC &#x00A7; 7461(c)(2). A "question of professional conduct or competence" is one involving "direct patient care" or "clinical competence." 38 USC &#x00A7; 7461(c)(3); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cochran,</span> 67 MSPR at 171 n.*.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Other adverse actions" taken under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463, that are not major adverse actions or do not arise out of questions of professional conduct or competence, are subject only to a grievance procedure wherein the employee has a right to "formal review by an impartial examiner within" the agency and a review of the examiner's findings and recommendations "by an official of a higher level than the official who decided upon the action." 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463(d). There is no statutory requirement that a section 7463 disciplinary action be reviewed or executed by the Secretary, let alone that the action constitute the "final" administrative action in the case. Thus, the Board has found that a section 7463 disciplinary action need not be accorded the deference given to a section 7462 action and may be reviewed by the Board in an individual right of action (IRA) appeal "consistent with" 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221. <span class="Italic">Cochran</span>, 67 MSPR at 173-74; <span class="Italic">see Falso,</span> 77 MSPR at 211.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Cochran</span> that it may exercise jurisdiction over an IRA appeal filed by an employee appointed under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7401(l) and who was issued a letter of admonishment and subsequently removed for "preemployment suitability" within the provisions of section 7463, consistent with the disciplinary scheme established by Congress for section 7401(l) employees who are subject to a disciplinary action that is grievable under section 7463. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(A)(2)(iii) ("Personnel action" means "an action under chapter 75 of this title or other disciplinary or corrective action"); <span class="Italic">Cochran</span>, 67 MSPR at 16849, 174; <span class="Italic">see also Falso,</span> 77 MSPR at 211.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly to <span class="Italic">Cochran</span>, we find for the reasons below that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal by an employee appointed under section 7401(1) who has been separated for reasons consistent with those applicable to RIF actions, and that our exercise of jurisdiction here is consistent with the disciplinary scheme established by Congress for section 7401(1) employees who are subject to a disciplinary action that is taken under 38 USC chapter 74.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that a RIF is an administrative procedure by which agencies eliminate jobs and account for employees who occupy abolished positions. <span class="Italic">Huber v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 793 F.2d 284, 286 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see Marcoux v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 63 MSPR 373, 376 (1994). The court has noted further that a RIF action is not an adverse action against a particular employee, but is directed solely at a position within an agency. <span class="Italic">Huber</span>, 793 F.2d at 286; <span class="Italic">Marcoux,</span> 63 MSPR at 376. As noted above, it is undisputed in the record as currently developed that the appellant's separation does not arise out of a question of her professional conduct or competence, but was directed at eliminating her position due to a "staff adjustment...necessitated by a reduction in the projected level of resources available to support the [agency's] Coatesville Center activities." These circumstances alone indicate strongly that the appellant's separation is a RIF action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that 38 USC &#x00A7; 7306 directs the Secretary to make appointments in the VHA. We also acknowledge that section 7421 authorizes the Secretary to "prescribe by regulation the hours and conditions of employment and leaves of absence" of employees, such as the appellant, who are appointed in positions under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7401(l). We do not dispute or attempt here to review the Secretary's exercise of his authority to make appointments or to prescribe the hours, leave and work conditions of employees appointed under section 7401(1). However, we find nothing in the above Title 38 provisions, or in the legislative history of section 7421 and the judicial precedent that has construed that section, that conflicts with the agency's obligations and the appellant's rights under the RIF statutes and regulations. "The RIF statutes and regulations...are not directed toward an agency's authority to establish or eliminate positions; rather, they address the manner in which employees shall be released <span class="Italic">after</span> the agency decides to eliminate positions." <span class="Italic">Hargrove,</span> 77 MSPR at 271 (the Board held that the statute allowing the Department of Defense to appoint civilian employees to teach children of military personnel at military installations "without regard to the provisions of any other law relating to the number, classification, or compensation of employees," 10 USC &#x00A7; 2164(e)(2), could not be construed to allow the agency discretion to disregard the statutory provisions relating to RIF proceedings); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 350144; 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.202(a)(2), 351.901.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, our exercise of RIF jurisdiction here is not foreclosed by 38 USC &#x00A7; 7462 and is "not inconsistent" with the disciplinary scheme established by Congress for section 7401(1) employees who are subject to a disciplinary action that is grievable under section 7463. <span class="Italic">See Cochran</span>, 67 MSPR at 173-74. Because we find that our jurisdiction over this appeal derives from OPM RIF regulations, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(b)(10), limiting the adverse action appeal rights under 5 USC chapter 75 of employees appointed under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7401(1), does not affect our jurisdiction over this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, we find that the RIF provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3501-04 and 5 CFR part 351 are clear and apply to VHA health-care professionals. Therefore, we hold that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal of a RIF separation filed by an employee appointed under section 7401(1).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">By providing that appointments under section 7405(a)(1) may be made "without regard to civil service...laws, rules, or regulations," the statute exempts such appointments from Title 5 RIF procedures, which are part of the civil service laws. <span class="Italic">Accord, e.g., Thiess v. Witt,</span> 100 F.3d 915, 916-17 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (statutory provision permitting the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to appoint temporary personnel "without regard to the provisions of title 5, United States Code, governing appointments in the competitive service" authorized FEMA to employ temporary workers without regard to civil service laws); <span class="Italic">Todd v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 55 F.3d 1574, 1577 (Fed.

Department of the Army</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 70 &#x00B6; 12 (2002) (stating that "Congress knew how to apply Title 5 veterans' preference provisions to Title 10 employment when it wanted to do so" by expressly giving some Title 10 employees the benefit of preference-eligibility rules that apply in Title 5 RIF actions); <span class="Italic">Swango v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 235, 237 (1993) (plain language of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7406 authorizing the DVA to appoint residents and interns "without regard to civil service or classification laws, rule, or regulations" means what it says civil service laws, rules, and regulations do not apply to persons appointed under that statutory provision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Ninth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Orloff v. Cleland</span>, 708 F.2d 372 (1983), is instructive in our decision to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Dr. Orloff was a part-time temporary physician who had been appointed under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4114(a)(1), which was enacted in 1946 and renumbered as section 7405. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 376. Dr. Orloff was terminated for misconduct and claimed adverse action appeal rights as a veteran under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 375-76. The court held that the "plain language of the statute states that civil service laws shall not apply to part-time physicians employed by the [Veterans Administration] and the Veterans Preference Act falls within the category of civil service laws.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 376. Since the RIF statute was part of the 1944 Veterans Preference Act, the court's opinion can be reasonably read as holding that Title 5 RIF law does not apply to DVA employees employed under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7405(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the Federal Circuit nor the Board in <span class="Italic">Von Zemenszky</span> addressed whether employees appointed under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7405(a)(1) were covered under Title 5 RIF rules. However, the court in <span class="Italic">Von Zemenszky</span> said that Title 5 RIF procedures apply to DVA health-care professionals "absent other overriding provisions of law." 284 F.3d at 1320. An overriding provision of law is clearly present here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the plain language of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7405(a)(1), the Board finds that DVA employees appointed under that statute are excluded from coverage under civil service laws, rules and regulations, including Title 5 RIF procedures. Thus, the appellant is not entitled to Title 5 RIF procedures, and the administrative judge properly dismissed this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;The appellant in <span class="Italic">Wolf v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 33 (2000), was a part-time DVA physician who had been appointed under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7405(a)(1). He worked no more than 60 hours per pay period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6; 2. After being notified that he would be separated because of a realignment of resources, Dr. Wolf accepted a position in which he would work no more than 50 hours per pay period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6; 2. The Board found that the reduction in hours was not a RIF action within its jurisdiction because it was not a demotion, separation or furlough for more than 30 days resulting from a RIF. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11. Since the Board found that the action taken in <span class="Italic">Wolf</span> was not an appealable RIF action, it did not need to address the issue of whether the appellant was an employee with RIF appeal rights. Thus, <span class="Italic">Wolf</span> is distinguishable from this appeal and is not inconsistent with our holding in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ortiz-Escalante v. VA</span>, 93 MSPR 127, 130 &#x00B6; 9 (2002) (employees appointed under 38 USC 7405(a)(1) are not entitled to Title 5 RIF protections, citing <span class="Italic">Beckstrom-Parcell v. VA,</span> 91 MSPR 656 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8 (2002)). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Bouchard v.

<p class="Body-Text">A reassignment not involving a staff adjustment does not confer RIF appeal rights, <span class="Italic">Ver Helst v. VA</span>, 104 Fed. Appx. 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the first four of Ver Helst's claims. The Board lacked jurisdiction to hear Ver Helst's RIF claim because Ver Helst was not affected by an appealable RIF action. While the RIF regulations, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. Part 351, apply to Title 38 DVA health professionals, <span class="Italic">see James v. Von Zemenszky</span>, 284 F.3d 1310, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2002), only 3 types of RIF actions are appealable to the Board: 1) furlough for more than 30 days, 2) separation, or 3) demotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.901 (2004). Even if DVA had implemented a RIF action in the merger, Ver Helst was not affected by an appealable action when he was laterally reassigned from one Dental position to another without the loss of grade or base pay. <span class="Italic">See Id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(4) (2004). Similarly, the loss of certain pay unrelated to base pay would not convert a reassignment to an appealable demotion. <span class="Italic">See Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the Board lacked jurisdiction to hear Ver Helst's demotion claim because his Title 38 position was not entitled to direct appeal rights. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) (2004). More particularly, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) "does not apply to an employee who holds a position within the Veterans Health Administration which has been excluded from the competitive service by or under a provision of title 38, unless such employee was appointed to [a &#x00A7; 7401(3) position]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(10) (2004). <span class="Italic">See Pichon v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 325, 32627 (1995); <span class="Italic">Exum v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 344, 346 (1994). Because Ver Helst was appointed under title 38, &#x00A7; 7401(1), rather than &#x00A7; 7401(3), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) is not applicable.</p>
