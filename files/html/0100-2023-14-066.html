<p class="Body-Text">The Board admonished that "it is the efficiency of the service, not whether the appellant deserves sympathy, that is the ultimate criterion for determining whether a particular penalty may be sustained." <span class="Italic">Singletary v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 94 MSPR 553, 561 &#x00B6; 16 (2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Betz v. GSA</span>, 55 MSPR 424, 432 (1992)). But, as Brenda Lee suggested, it may help to say you're sorry. <span class="Italic">See Seigars v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-15-0091-I-1 (NP 9/14/2016) ("[A]ppellant was aware that his actions would be considered inappropriate, that he lacked rehabilitative potential based on his refusal to take responsibility for his actions, and that there was a lack of alternative sanctions to deter such actions in the future."); <span class="Italic">Gilliam v, VA</span>, AT-0752-14-0039-I-1 (NP 2/4/2015) ("[a]n appellant's rationalizations for his behavior and lack of remorse for his misconduct reflect a lack of rehabilitative potential and may properly be considered as an aggravating factor. <span class="Italic">Neuman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 26 (2008)."); <span class="Italic">Hankins v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-0752-13-0423-I-1 (NP 9/8/2014) ("Although the agency failed to prove that the appellant was actively involved in misappropriating the furniture, it does not appear that the appellant has ever apologized or otherwise expressed any remorse for his failure to account for the furniture, or for his conduct during the investigative interviews. This does not bode well for his rehabilitative potential. <span class="Italic">See Neuman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 26 (2008) (the appellant's rationalizations and lack of remorse indicated little potential for rehabilitation and were aggravating factors)."); <span class="Italic">Redschlag v. Dept. of Army</span>, 89 MSPR 589, 637 &#x00B6; 93 (2001) (the appellant's "unwillingness to acknowledge that she engaged in any misconduct indicate[s] that she exhibited little potential for rehabilitation"); <span class="Italic">Bailey v. VA</span>, 13 MSPR 435, 436 n.2, 437 (1982) (sustaining a removal for insubordinate or threatening remarks; the Board notes that the agency offered to reduce the proposed removal to suspension if the appellant apologized to his supervisor).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Pfaehler v. DHHS</span>, 20 MSPR 159, 161 (1984), the appellant was discharged when she copied agency documents and improperly disclosed them to a grant applicant that supported the practice of holistic medicine. The Board sustained the removal. The appellant took her case <span class="Italic">pro se</span> to the Federal Circuit. She told the court during argument that she would not release confidential or privileged agency documents if she were returned to her position. The court remanded to the Board for reconsideration. The Board then modified the penalty, reducing it to a 45-day suspension, noting that although the offense was very serious, there was a lack of training concerning office procedures and Pfaehler showed contrition during the reply process. In its nonprecedential opinion, the court suggested that the Board could not disregard a promise to avoid misconduct in the future on the basis of a subjective belief that the appellant would continue to offend. <span class="Italic">See Pfaehler v. MSPB</span>, 783 F.2d 187 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (an opinion concerning a counsel fee petition referencing a nonprecedential decision). The result here is difficult to square with the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> concept that if there is substantial misconduct, the agency's penalty determination will be sustained unless it is unreasonable; in fact, the Board did not even state that the agency penalty determination was unreasonable. The result is better understood when considered in light of the natural inclination of the Board to avoid confrontation with an otherwise deferential reviewing court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Timing has a lot to do with the weight given expressions of contrition, <span class="Italic">Singletary v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 94 MSPR 553, 560 &#x00B6; 15 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board has found that an appellant's failure to bring a mitigating factor to an agency's attention does not prohibit an AJ from considering that factor, the Board has noted that such failure merely affects the weight of the factor. <span class="Italic">See Bryant v. General Services Administration,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 425, 427 (1984). The Board has found that an employee's admission of his misconduct and his expression of remorse are indicative of his rehabilitative potential and constitute a significant mitigating factor when the employee notifies an agency of his wrong doing of his own volition, prior to the agency's initiating an investigation into the misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Casarez v. Department of the Army,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 131, 134 (1996). The Board has also found that an employee's immediate admission of misconduct and expression of remorse upon an initial inquiry by an agency is of some mitigating weight. <span class="Italic">See Schoeffler v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 80, 91 (1991), <span class="Italic">vacated in part on other grounds</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 143, 146 (1991); <span class="Italic">Kruger v. Department of Justice,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 71, 76-77 (1987). However, where an employee's admission of misconduct and expression of remorse do not come until after the agency conducts its investigation, the Board has found that the employee's contrition is entitled to little or no mitigating weight. <span class="Italic">See Capeless v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 619, 625 (1998) ("The...AJ properly did not consider the factor of the appellant's demonstration of remorse at the hearing. The...AJ correctly concluded that the appellant's contrition was not exhibited until long after the agency had reached its decision."); <span class="Italic">Padilla v. Department of Justice,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 416, 424 (1994) (the appellant's expression of regret for "letting the Warden down" only after the agency started to investigate the "weapons incident" was not a mitigating factor that outweighed the seriousness of his offense), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 64 F.3d 676 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). Because the appellant's expressions of remorse, no matter how genuinely made, were not made until after the agency had conducted its investigation and had proposed to take disciplinary action against her, we find them be of little mitigating weight.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wiley v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WILEY_MICHAEL_DA_0752_05_0539_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_247273.pdf">102 MSPR 535</a>, 543 &#x00B6; 18, 2006 MSPB 206 (2006), noted the significance of the appellant's failure to accept responsibility for misconduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency did not present any evidence that the appellant had been involved in any prior disciplinary actions or misconduct before this incident. Thus, the appellant appears to have had 8 years of unblemished agency service at the time of his removal. We find, however, that these mitigating factors are outweighed, not only by the seriousness of the offense, but by the appellant's failure to take responsibility for his misconduct and his lack of remorse. <span class="Italic">See Render v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 17 (2001) (considering lack of remorse in a penalty determination and finding that the appellant's failure to recognize that her acts were improper demonstrates that she lacks rehabilitation potential). At the hearing, the appellant continued to deny stating that he "felt like getting his gun and shooting up the place," even when confronted with the testimony of his "friend," Elias, who stated that she specifically heard him make that statement. He went on to admit, however, that he did ask Elias, "[I]f I lose my job, what am [I] supposed <span id="Page_2355"></span>to do, want to kill her?" We find that this statement provides a greater justification for the removal penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, <span class="Italic">Mann v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 54 MSPR 693, 698-99 (1992), sustained a suspension for some sexually degrading remarks to female subordinates:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]ppellant's attitude following both the counseling and the current charges does merit consideration in our analysis of the reasonableness of the agency's penalty selection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his response to the agency's petition for review, the appellant still maintains that he does not feel that he has violated the agency's policy on sexual harassment, although he concedes now that the language he used was "inappropriate and unnecessary." He has repeatedly indicated his displeasure and resentment that the agency should bring any action at all against him, stating his belief that the government hired him to do a job and that he should have been left alone to do it, regardless of what formal agency rules or regulations might have required; he stated that there was "no reason" for bringing a sexual harassment charge against him. Although he admitted several times that he may have used abusive and offensive language in referring to Ms. Steele and Ms. Odeski, he never expressed remorse for this offense at the hearing and denied, heatedly and at length, that it might have been serious or might have constituted sexual harassment. His statements thus indicate that his potential for rehabilitation in this area is, at best, limited, and provide support for the agency's penalty determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A removal for facilitating a drug sale was mitigated to a 120-day suspension for an employee who gained nothing from the transaction, acknowledged his misconduct, testified that he had led a difficult life, and made assurances that his future behavior would be different. <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 153, 159 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If one is to obtain mitigation through contrition, the Board expects the proper type of contrition. <span class="Italic">Dolezal v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 64, 71 (1993), rejected a mitigation argument with the observation that "[t]he deciding official specifically testified that the appellant expressed remorse for the 'hassle' involved in pursuing the investigation against him, but did not apologize for the underlying misconduct." <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Dept. of Army</span>, 96 MSPR 232, 237 &#x00B6; 14 (2004) (remorse not properly demonstrated by an appellant who said, as to misuse of a government credit card, "it's a violation if they catch you"); <span class="Italic">Viens v.

VA</span>, 75 MSPR 127, 137 (1997) (appellant's statement to the administrative judge that he handled incidents poorly was "belated, lukewarm expression of remorse...insufficient by itself to show that he has good rehabilitative potential"; his continued incidents of misconduct subsequent to the apology belied his verbal expression of remorse); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DOD</span>, 66 MSPR 546, 553 (1995) (record did not support a demonstration of remorse; instead the appellant attributed his misconduct to his medication and a medical condition); <span class="Italic">Padilla v. DOJ</span>, 64 MSPR 416, 424 (1994) (remorse was insufficient to outweigh the severity of the use of unauthorized law enforcement credentials in the purchase of a firearm). <span class="Italic">But see Shelly v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 75 MSPR 677, 684 (1997) (Board recognized rehabilitative potential because the appellant testified that she would not repeat her misconduct even though she contended in the reply to the proposed removal that her conduct was acceptable); <span class="Italic">Hillen v.
