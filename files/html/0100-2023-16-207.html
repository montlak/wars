<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-207"><span class="space">1.</span> Indicia of Formality</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are procedural and substantive components that define formal meetings. As to procedures, the factors FLRA considers to determine whether a discussion or meeting is formal include: (1) whether the individual who held the discussion is a first-level supervisor or is higher in the management hierarchy; (2) whether any other management representatives attended; (3) where the individual meetings took place (the supervisor's office, at each employee's desk, or elsewhere); (4) how long the meetings lasted; (5) how the meetings were called (with formal advance written notice or more spontaneously and informally); (6) whether a formal agenda was established for the meetings; (7) whether each employee's attendance was mandatory; and (8) the manner that the meetings were conducted (whether the employee's identity and comments were noted or transcribed). If the meeting is by mutual agreement, it is immaterial who proposed the meeting. Other factors may be identified and applied. FLRA considers the totality of the facts and circumstances presented. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, Office of Ass't Sec'y for Admin. and Mgmt. and AFGE Local 648</span>, 32 FLRA 465, 470 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Brockton and NAGE Local R1-25</span>, 37 FLRA 747, 753 (1990) (for union to have right to representation under section 7114(a)(2)(A), it must be shown the following elements exist: (1) there must be a discussion; (2) that is formal; (3) between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more unit employees or their representatives; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment (relying on <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ray Brook and AFGE Local 3882</span>, 29 FLRA 584 (1987)).).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">F. E. Warren AFB and AFGE Local 2354</span>, 52 FLRA 149, 155-59 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the Authority to conclude that a formal discussion occurred, the evidence must show that there was (1) a discussion, (2) that was "formal," (3) between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more unit employees or their representatives, (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of</span> <span class="Italic">Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution (Ray Brook, New</span> <span class="Italic">York</span>), 29 FLRA 584 (1987) (Ray Brook), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3882 v. FLRA</span>, 865 F.2d 1283 (D.C. Cir. 1989). In making determinations under section 7114(a)(2)(A), the Authority is "guided by that section's intent and purpose--to provide the union with an opportunity to safeguard its interests and the interests of employees in the bargaining unit--viewed in the context of a union's full range of responsibilities under the Statute." <span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span>, 29 FLRA at 589.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the Rivet Mile meeting was a discussion between representatives of the Respondent and unit employees concerning a grievance, personnel policy, practice, or other general condition of employment. The only issue is whether the discussion was "formal."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The predecessor to the Statute, Executive Order 11491, as amended, expressly authorized unions to be represented at formal discussions. However, the adjective "formal" did not appear in the first draft of the legislation ultimately enacted as the Statute. Title VII of H.R. 11280, as reported July 31, 1978, originally provided at section 7114(a)(1) that an exclusive representative was entitled to be represented at <span class="Italic">"any discussion</span> between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees in the unit or their representatives concerning any grievance, personnel policy or practice, or other conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">Legislative</span> <span class="Italic">History of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations</span> <span class="Italic">Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</span> (Comm. Print 1979) (<span class="Italic">Legislative History</span>) at 314 (emphasis added). The amendment to Title VII offered by Representative Udall, which was eventually accepted as the language of the Statute, replaced "any discussion" with "any formal discussion." The Udall amendment inserted "the word 'formal' before discussions to make clear that this subsection does not require that an exclusive representative be present during highly personal, informal meetings such as counseling sessions regarding performance." <span class="Italic">Legislative History</span> at 957 (124 Cong. Rec. 29,200).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This illustration of a meeting that would <span class="Italic">not</span> be a formal discussion describes both the purpose of the meeting (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, counseling an employee about performance) and its nature ("highly personal"). The Authority has similarly examined both the purpose and the nature of discussions in determining formality under section 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In some cases, the Authority has found the purpose of the discussion sufficient in itself to establish formality. For example, "[t]he Authority has repeatedly held that interviews by agency representatives with bargaining unit employees in preparation for third-party proceedings, including MSPB proceedings, are formal discussions." <span class="Italic">United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, United States</span> <span class="Italic">Border Patrol, El Paso, Texas</span>, 47 FLRA 170, 183 (1993). In other cases, the Authority has considered the purpose of a discussion as relevant in assessing its formality. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California</span>, 45 FLRA 1332, 1335-36 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the purpose of a discussion, the Authority has identified a number of factors that also are relevant in determining whether the nature of the discussion indicates formality. It was these factors to which the Judge adverted in this case. The enumeration of these factors has varied. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution, Bastrop, Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 1339, 1343 (1996); <span class="Italic">General Services Administration, Region 9</span>, 48 FLRA 1348, 1355 (1994). This variation demonstrates that the factors are merely illustrative:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Other factors may be identified and applied as appropriate in a particular case. Therefore, in determining formality, we consider the totality of the facts and circumstances presented.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Assistant Secretary</span> <span class="Italic">for Administration and Management, Chicago, Illinois</span>, 32 FLRA 465, 470 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Judge made no express findings on any of the eight factors identified in <span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span>, the record is sufficient to make a determination on many of the factors. This evidence, on balance, supports the conclusion that the Rivet Mile meeting was formal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, even if evidence regarding the factors did not indicate formality, the undisputed purpose and subject matter of the meeting was to inform employees, apparently for the first time, that they were targets in the RIF, that they could be laid off and that buyouts might be available for them. We find it highly implausible that the head of the Rivet Mile project, or any other second level supervisor, would leave an announcement of such gravity to a spontaneous, casual encounter with affected employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span>, "in determining formality, we consider the totality of the facts and circumstances presented<span class="Italic">." Id.</span>, at 470. The totality of the facts and circumstances here is that the Rivet Mile meeting was called to prepare employees to be laid off and, in that context, we conclude that the Rivet Mile meeting was a formal discussion of which the Union should have been notified in advance. Evidence that a number of the <span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span> factors were also present bolsters this conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The boiler plant meeting was called to announce that buyouts might be available and to determine whether any employees were interested in accepting them.&#x2003;As this context indicates less strongly that the meeting was formal, the presence or absence of other factors, such as those identified in <span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span>, assumes greater importance in our analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent excepts to the Judge's findings on four of the eight <span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span> factors. The first of these is the Judge's finding that the Chief of Employee and Labor Relations used the message received from Combat Command as a formal agenda "in addressing her remarks" <span id="page_1455"></span>at the meeting. In this regard, the Chief testified that she brought to the meeting the message from Combat Command, along with a list of employees eligible for buyouts, but denied that she had any agenda. One of the two boiler plant employees called by the General Counsel testified that the Chief's subordinate did "most of the talking" at the meeting and that she did not speak from notes or documents. The other employee, however, believed that both the Chief and her subordinate "had some notes or something." We conclude that the Judge's determination that the message from Combat Command served as the meeting's agenda is supported by the evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also excepts to the Judge's findings regarding the length of the meeting, and whether notes or minutes of the meeting were taken. As for the former, estimates of the length of the meeting ranged from 15 minutes to 45 minutes. Thus, the Judge's finding regarding the length of the meeting is directly supported by testimony. As for notes or minutes, it appears that none were taken at the meeting itself. However, as the Judge found, the Chief and her subordinate later reconstructed the meeting on paper. The written description of the meeting by the Chief and her subordinate fairly approximates what would be found in a set of minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The final disputed finding is that attendance at the meeting was mandatory.&#x2003;As to this finding, the record reflects that, upon being asked whether their attendance was required, the first boiler plant employee testified that "I don't believe it was mentioned that it [attendance] was a requirement, just that Civilian Personnel wanted to meet with the boiler plant operators." The second employee said that "I don't know as it was required, but we were informed that there would be a meeting." The Chief of Employee and Labor Relations testified that attendance was not mandatory....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the only finding to which the Respondent excepts and which appears to be unsupported by the record is the Judge's finding that attendance at the meeting was mandatory. Even concluding that attendance was not mandatory, however, on balance, and considering the "totality of the facts and circumstances," including the Judge's findings that are undisputed, we are persuaded that the evidence supports the Judge's decision that the May 25 boiler plant meeting was a formal discussion of which the Union should have been notified in advance.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an interview has other traits of formality, it is not informal because it is conducted by telephone. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr., McClellan AFB and AFGE Local 1857</span>, 35 FLRA 594, 604 (1990). There need not be discussion or dialogue for a meeting to constitute a "discussion" under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). The term "discussion" in the Statute is synonymous with "meeting," and no discussion or dialogue need occur for the meeting to constitute a discussion within the meaning of the Statute. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Brockton and NAGE Local R1-25</span>, 37 FLRA 747, 753 (1990) (meeting was called to permit employees to select their shifts); <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Bastrop and AFGE Local 3828</span>, 51 FLRA 1339, 1343 (1996) (meeting called by third-level supervisor, scheduled, relatively long, and directed by warden, were indicia of formality supporting conclusion that meeting was not informal supervisor-employee counseling session).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to substance, formal meetings include discussions about general rules or policies at the workplace and may, depending on the circumstances, exclude discussions with individuals about specific work practices. A formal meeting did not occur as to a meeting between a supervisor and two employees whose work assignments were temporarily changed. One of the elements of a formal discussion is that it concern a grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. Personnel policies or practices are to involve general rules applicable to agency personnel, not discrete actions concerning individual employees. A formal discussion did not occur when the subject of the meeting was confined to a temporary, discrete action involving no discussion of personnel policies or practices, having no effect on conditions of employment of unit employees generally. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Field Operations, SSA and AFGE Council of Social Security Dist. Office Locals</span>, 20 FLRA 80, 82-83 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 214 and Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 38 FLRA 309, 329-31 (1990) (proposals 3 and 4) (formal meeting would not include meeting convened with individual employee to present him with "last chance" agreement designed to settle specific disciplinary action). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">GSA Region 9 and AFGE Council 236</span>, 48 FLRA 1348, 1354-56 (1994), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 53 FLRA 925 (1997) (requiring notice to union and opportunity to participate in negotiations over last chance agreement arising during MSPB settlement discussions between private counsel for unit employee and agency).</p>
<p class="noindent">As an example of a planned, brief meeting not considered a formal discussion, consider <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow and AFGE Local 1482</span>, 45 FLRA 1332, 1335-36 (1992), involving overtime assignments:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a discussion or meeting is formal, within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, the Authority considers the totality of the facts and circumstances in a case. <span class="Italic">See generally</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 1181, 1189-91 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>). Among other factors, the Authority examines: (1) whether the individual who held the meeting is a first-level supervisor or is higher in the management hierarchy; (2) whether any other management representatives attended; (3) where the meeting took place; (4) how long the meeting lasted; (5) how the meeting was called; (6) whether a formal agenda was established; (7) whether employee attendance was mandatory; and (8) the manner in which the meeting was conducted. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Labor</span>, 32 FLRA at 470.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the disputed meeting was held on the shop floor and lasted only 10 minutes. Thus, neither the length nor the location of the meeting suggest that it was a formal discussion of working conditions. In addition, it is undisputed that: (1) only one management official, a first-level supervisor, attended the meeting; (2) no agenda was prepared for the meeting; and (3) no notes of the meeting were taken. In our view, these matters, which indicate how management intended to conduct, and conducted, the meeting also support a conclusion that the meeting lacked requisite formality to satisfy the requirements of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the meeting was called to solicit volunteers for overtime and to explain both the need for overtime as well as the procedures by which overtime would be assigned if an insufficient number of employees volunteered.&#x2003;No other employment-related matters were discussed. As we conclude that the meeting was not a formal discussion, we do not determine whether, as asserted by the Respondent, its actions in holding the discussion were privileged under the parties' agreement. However, in assessing the formality of a discussion, we find it relevant that the evident purpose of the meeting was to comply with and implement the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, although the Judge correctly observed that the supervisor "thought through his plans for the meeting in advance[,]" it is clear that only 5 or 10 minutes elapsed between the supervisor's decision to hold the meeting and the commencement of the meeting itself and that, as noted previously, the supervisor's planning did not include an agenda. As such, we conclude that while the meeting may not have been spontaneous, neither was its planning such that this factor supports a conclusion that the meeting was a formal discussion. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d at 1190 (in discussing whether a meeting was spontaneous, the court noted that "[f]or an attorney and two labor relations specialists to meet at the office of one of the labor relations specialists and in a single day interview all of the witnesses to be called at an MSPB hearing surely indicates some advance preparation.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the decisions relied on by the Judge and the General Counsel do not support a conclusion that the disputed meeting was a formal discussion. In <span class="Italic">Labor</span>, relied on by the Judge, the disputed meeting occurred pursuant to an agreement made over 1 week in advance that specified the attendees as well as the agenda for the meeting; a unit employee was formally questioned by a management representative at the meeting and the employee's answers were evaluated by other management representatives. 32 FLRA at 470-71. In <span class="Italic">McClellan</span>, relied on by the General Counsel, the disputed meeting, which was scheduled 5 days in advance, was held in a management representative's office, where a unit employee was questioned by the representative and notes were taken of the employee's answers. 29 FLRA at 603.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in this case, we conclude that the January 22 meeting did not constitute a formal discussion, within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. Accordingly, the Respondent's failure to notify the Union of the meeting and afford it an opportunity to be represented at it did not violate the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent">A brief meeting between a labor relations specialist and a unit employee to speak about a matter within the unit employee's job duties, involving a benefit entitlement for another unit employee, was not formal, even though its purpose was to prepare for an arbitration, <span class="Italic">VAMC Richmond and AFGE Local 2145,</span> 63 FLRA 440, 442-43 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determination as to whether a meeting is a formal discussion is based on the totality of the facts and circumstances presented.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming,</span> 52 FLRA 149, 155-57 (1996) <span class="Italic">(F.E. Warren).</span> The <span class="Italic">DOL</span> factors, discussed above, are illustrative, and other factors may be identified and applied as appropriate. <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren,</span> 52 FLRA at 157. In this regard, the Authority has recognized that a meeting can have some indicia of formality and yet, based on the totality of the circumstances, not be a formal discussion. <span class="Italic">See United States Department of Veterans Affairs Northern Arizona Veterans Affairs Healthcare, Prescott, Arizona,</span> 61 FLRA 181, 186 (2005) <span class="Italic">(Northern Arizona); United States Dep't of Justice, U.S. Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Service, Los Angeles, California,</span> 18 FLRA 550, 553 (1985). Moreover, the Authority has found that the purpose of a discussion may be relevant in assessing formality. <span class="Italic">See F.E. Warren,</span> 52 FLRA at 156-57; <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Sacramento Air Logistics Center, McClellan Air Force Base, California,</span> 35 FLRA 594, 605 (1990) <span class="Italic">(McClellan)</span> (agency management's interview of a bargaining unit employee with knowledge that union would call employee as a witness to an upcoming arbitration hearing is a formal discussion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1456"></span>The General Counsel contends that the Judge's conclusions that the meeting's duration and location do not suggest that the meeting was formal are "clearly erroneous." Regarding the meeting's duration, the General Counsel cites two Authority decisions for the proposition that formality is indicated by a meeting that lasts 15 to 30 minutes. <span class="Italic">See McClellan,</span> 35 FLRA at 604 (finding that a 15-25 minute witness preparation interview "lasted a significant length of time"); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Correctional Inst., Bastrop, Tex.,</span> 51 FLRA 1339, 1343 (1996) (formality is indicated by a meeting that lasts 25 to 30 minutes).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the General Counsel's contention, the Authority has not found a meeting length of 15 to 30 minutes to indicate formality under all circumstances. <span class="Italic">E.g., Northern Arizona,</span> 61 FLRA at 185 (a 15-minute meeting found to be of "short duration" and an indication of informality); <span class="Italic">Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Distribution Region West, Tracy, California,</span> 48 FLRA 744, 745 n.2 (1993) (meeting lasting "only 15 minutes" was not a formal meeting); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health and Human Services, Social Security Admin, and Social Security Admin. Field Operations, Region II,</span> 29 FLRA 1205, 1208 (1987) (meeting lasting "about 20 minutes" was not formal). The Judge found that, under circumstances where the Unit Employee prolonged the meeting by asking the Labor Relations Specialist questions and expressing complaints, the meeting's duration is not a reliable indicator of its formality. The General Counsel points to no precedent to the contrary. Accordingly, we deny the General Counsel's exception on this point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the location of the meeting, the General Counsel contends that the Judge should have found that it indicates formality because the meeting was held away from the Unit Employee's work site and in the Labor Relations Specialist's private office. However, the Judge found, and the General Counsel does not dispute, that the meeting took place away from the Unit Employee's work site simply because he did not have an office there. The General Counsel, having presented no evidence of any other explanation for the location of the meeting, failed to establish that the location indicates formality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the General Counsel has not demonstrated that the Judge erred in his evaluation of the indicia of formality set out in <span class="Italic">DOL.</span> Further, the General Counsel has not demonstrated that the Judge's decision is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">McClellan</span> and <span class="Italic">General Services Administration, Region 9, New York, New York,</span> 54 FLRA 864 (1998). In the meetings involved in those decisions, counsel representing management in arbitration cases interviewed union employees who had been designated by the union as witnesses in the cases. The Authority recognized that under such circumstances a union would have an interest in being present to be assured that its witnesses would not be coerced or intimidated prior to the hearings. <span class="Italic">McClellan,</span> 35 FLRA at 605. Here, the General Counsel does not except to the Judge's finding that the purpose of the meeting was not to prepare a Union witness for an arbitration hearing. Therefore, these decisions are distinguishable.</p>
