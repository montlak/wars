<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-145"><span class="space">h.</span> Attempts to Refile, Reinstate, or Reopen Withdrawn Appeals</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">When the appellant requests the AJ to withdraw an appeal, assuming that the withdrawal is not stated as being without prejudice to refile, the AJ issues an initial decision dismissing the appeal as withdrawn and the initial decision contains a notice of the right to file a PFR of that initial decision. Assuming no PFR is filed, the initial decision becomes a Board final decision. An AJ does not have the authority to set aside or reopen a Board final decision, including an initial decision that becomes final through operation of law, i.e., through the passage of time to file a PFR. The authority to reopen the decision dismissing the appeal as withdrawn lies with the Board, not with an AJ. The distinction in authority at the two Board levels was expressed in <span class="Italic">McNeil v. USPS</span>, 98 MSPR 18, 22 &#x00B6; 8 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reopen this case on our own motion and vacate the ID because the ID is based in part on a determination that the appellant had not established good cause for reinstating his prior appeal. Administrative judges, however, lack the authority to reopen or reinstate appeals in which there has been a final Board decision; that authority is reserved to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.112, 1201.118; <span class="Italic">Hall v. Department of the Interior</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 32 &#x00B6; 6 (2001); <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 163, 166, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 124 F.3d 227 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table). Where an appellant has filed a second petition for appeal after withdrawing his first one, it is generally appropriate to consider the second petition as a new, late-filed appeal and to determine whether good cause has been established for waiving the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">Nabors v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 656, 659 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 824 F.2d 978 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Rather than file a PFR seeking to reopen the first, withdrawn, appeal, the appellant might file another appeal on the same matter that led to the first appeal. Board policy appears to treat a request for renewal of a withdrawn appeal as a new appeal, to be assessed by the AJ as to timeliness, assuming the existence of jurisdiction, as <span class="Italic">Bradley v. DHS</span>, DA-0731-09-0107-I-1 (NP 6/15/2012), explained in a VEOA appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lincoln v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 486, &#x00B6; 12 (2010), we clarified and affirmed the Board's existing policy that when an appellant, whose initial appeal was dismissed as withdrawn, seeks to renew his appeal at the regional level, whether by requesting reopening or filing a second appeal, and the matter the appellant seeks to appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction, the Board will treat the pleading below as a new appeal. Such an approach permits the administrative judge, in the first instance, to consider the appellant's arguments and to take evidence from the parties on the issues of misinformation and timeliness.[2] In this case, the regional office erred in forwarding this VEOA appeal to the Board without first treating it as a new appeal under <span class="Italic">Lincoln</span> and developing the record. In <span class="Italic">Lincoln,</span> we specifically stated that when the appellant files a motion to reopen with an administrative judge, the "Board will treat the pleading below as a new appeal." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 12. Accordingly, we FORWARD the appellant's November 14, 2011 submission to the Dallas Regional Office for docketing as a new appeal. The appellant shall be afforded notice regarding the timeliness of his new appeal and an opportunity to establish that it was timely filed or that good cause has been established for waiver of the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;However, in <span class="Italic">Lincoln,</span> we also found, when the appellant did not file an additional pleading with the regional office, but instead elected to directly petition the Board for review of an initial decision that dismissed the appeal as withdrawn, that there was no basis for the Board's practice of treating a petition for review as a new late-filed appeal and expressly overruled any Board precedent treating pleadings filed directly with the Board as a new appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 13. Rather, we stated that the Board would treat such cases as a petition for review of the initial decision dismissing the appeal as withdrawn and, where appropriate, alternatively, as a request to reopen. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pradier v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 495, 499-01 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-14, 2010 MSPB 65 (2010), explained what occurred when the appellant withdrew an appeal and filed another:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an appellant files a second appeal after withdrawing his first one, the Board must consider, as a threshold matter, whether good cause has been established for the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gibson-Michaels v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 10 (2009); <span class="Italic">McNeil v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 18, &#x00B6; 8 (2004); <span class="Italic">Nabors v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 31 M.S.P.R. 656, 659 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 824 F.2d 978 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table).[1] In this case, the appellant argues on PFR that his appeal should be considered timely. He asserts that the agency never provided him with notice of his Board appeal rights or the time limits within which a Board appeal must be filed.<span class="Italic"></span> An agency is obligated to notify an employee of his appeal rights when it takes an action the employee may appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Carroll v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 570, &#x00B6; 6 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;This case, which involves an appellant who withdrew his first appeal and filed a second appeal with the regional office, is distinguishable from<span class="Italic"> Lincoln v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 2010 MSPB 64 (April 14, 2010), where the appellant withdrew his first appeal and filed a timely petition for review of the initial decision dismissing his appeal. In that case, the Board will examine whether the withdrawal is voluntary, i.e., clear, decisive, and unequivocal. <span class="Italic">See Lincoln,</span> 2010 MSPB 64, &#x00B6; 7 (citing<span class="Italic"> Page v. Department of Transportation,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 492, &#x00B6; 5 (2009)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency in this case did not provide any appeal rights notice to the appellant.[2] In some cases such as this, where the appellant claims he has appeal rights, where the agency has provided him with no notice of any such rights, and where he has filed an untimely appeal, the Board has found that the jurisdictional and timeliness issues are "inextricably intertwined," that is, resolution of the timeliness issue depends on whether the appellant was subjected to an appealable action. <span class="Italic">See Petric v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 342, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6 (2008). In those cases, the Board has held that jurisdiction should be addressed before timeliness. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 6. Here, however, the appellant filed a timely appeal after his separation despite the agency's failure to notify him of his appeal rights. The threshold question here, therefore, is not jurisdiction, but timeliness. <span class="Italic">See Tanner v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 17 n.* (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency has taken the position that the appellant was not entitled to appeal his removal to the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that he filed his second appeal late because he was waiting to be cleared of any wrongdoing by the agency. As noted, he stated in his second appeal that he was cleared of the charges as of May 30, 2009. He further stated that he made a number of calls to the agency and made written requests seeking information as to his status, but received no reply.<span class="Italic"></span> Yet he did not file his second appeal until July 7, 2009. We find that waiting five weeks, under these circumstances, does not evidence due diligence or ordinary prudence, even assuming that there is good cause for the delay prior to May 30, 2009. <span class="Italic">Cf. Staton v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 12 (2006) (delay in pursuing a Board appeal while the appellant informally attempted to resolve the matter with the agency did not constitute good cause for filing delay).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that he timely filed his second appeal from a July 22, 2009 agency letter informing him that he would not be reinstated. He has not submitted that letter into the record. In any event, we find this argument unavailing since he filed his second appeal on July 7, 2009, before he received the agency's letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant argues that the agency never provided him with <span id="Page_1095"></span>notice of Board appeal rights or the time limits within which a Board appeal must be filed. While true, the fact remains that, notwithstanding, he timely filed his first appeal with the Board. We find, therefore, under the circumstances of this case, that this argument does not support a finding of good cause for the substantial (10 months) untimeliness of the appellant's second appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At times the Board treats requests for reconsideration of appellant-initiated dismissals of appeals either as late-filed appeals or as requests to reopen and reinstate prior appeals for the purpose of determining whether good cause is established for waiver of the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. VA</span>, 83 MSPR 365, 368 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (PFR seeking to pursue a final decision dismissing the appeal without prejudice is treated as a request to reopen the original appeal or as a refiled appeal); <span class="Italic">Allison v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 335, 339 &#x00B6; 9 (1999) ("[W]here...a Postal Service employee withdraws his Board appeal to pursue the negotiated grievance-arbitration procedure and subsequently files a petition for review challenging the dismissal of his appeal as withdrawn, the Board will treat his petition for review as a new appeal or a request for reopening the previously dismissed appeal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Duncan v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 72, 74-75 (1985) (<span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 795 F.2d 1000 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds, given presiding officials' limited scope of authority, 5 C.F.R. 1201.112, that it is generally appropriate to treat requests for reconsideration of appellant-initiated dismissals as late-filed petitions for appeal and to determine whether good cause has been established for waiver of the filing deadline. In this case, however, because the presiding official examined the appeal only to determine if he had the authority to reopen it, we will address both possible sources of Board jurisdiction. We note that the same factors which bear on the propriety of reopening the first appeal will generally be relevant to a determination of whether to allow the late filing of the second. However, reviewing such cases as new appeals will allow presiding officials, in the first instance, to consider appellants' arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's second filing with the Board, if treated as a new appeal, must be dismissed for failure to comply with the time limits, 5 C.F.R. 1201.22(b), since it was filed after the deadline for filing an appeal with the Board and appellant has failed to establish good cause for waiver of the Board's filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 8 MSPB 409 (1981). Appellant's pleading was filed more than five months after the effective date of his removal. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has expressly held that pursuit of a grievance in another forum does not constitute good cause for the waiver of Board time limits. <span class="Italic">Massingale v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 736 F.2d 1521 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Therefore, as a "new appeal," appellant's appeal must be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Viewing the appeal as a request to reopen appellant's original appeal, we find that the presiding official was correct in finding that he had no regulatory authority to reopen the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.112, which divests the presiding official of jurisdiction after issuance of the initial decision except in certain limited circumstances which are not applicable here. In addition appellant's petition for review does not assert new and material evidence to warrant reversal of the presiding official's decision not to reopen.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board does have authority on its own motion under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.117, to reopen and reconsider the presiding official's order dismissing appellant's appeal, we decline to do so in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Duncan</span> was explained and modified in <span class="Italic">Lincoln v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 486, 492-94 &#x00B6; 10-13, 2010 MSPB 64 (2010), declining to treat as a new appeal a PFR seeking review of an initial decision dismissing an appeal as withdrawn:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that in some cases where an appellant attempted to reinstate an appeal that was dismissed as withdrawn, the Board has treated the appellant's pleading as both a request to reopen the original appeal and as a new, late-filed appeal. This practice dates back to our decision in <span class="Italic">Duncan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 72 (1985). In <span class="Italic">Duncan</span>, as here, the appellant's original appeal was dismissed after he notified the Board that he instead wished to pursue the negotiated grievance procedure. The grievance proceeded to arbitration, and the arbitrator dismissed the grievance, finding that the case was not arbitrable because Mr. Duncan had already appealed to the Board. The appellant then moved to reopen his Board appeal, whereupon the presiding official, i.e., administrative judge, issued a second decision, finding that he had no authority to consider the appellant's request. Subsequently, the appellant petitioned for review of that second decision. In its published opinion, the full Board first noted that it was not precluded from exercising jurisdiction because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121, which requires that an employee elect between a statutory appeal process and a negotiated grievance procedure, does not apply to the Postal Service, and the statutory and regulatory right of a preference eligible Postal Service employee to appeal to the Board cannot be limited by a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 74 (citing <span class="Italic">Hall v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 233 (1985)). Thus, notwithstanding his pursuit of the grievance process, Mr. Duncan retained the option to proceed before the Board, either by filing a new appeal or by establishing a basis for the Board to reopen its prior order dismissing his first appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board then reasoned as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board finds, given presiding officials' limited scope of authority, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.112, that it is generally appropriate to treat requests for reconsideration of appellant-initiated dismissals as late-filed petitions for appeal and to determine whether good cause has been established for waiver of the filing deadline. In this case, however, because the presiding official examined the appeal only to determine if he had the authority to reopen it, we will address both possible sources of Board jurisdiction. We note that the same factors which bear on the propriety of reopening the first appeal will generally be relevant to a determination of whether to allow the late filing of the second. However, reviewing such cases as new appeals will allow presiding officials, in the first instance, to consider appellants' arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> In other words, while the administrative judge lacked the authority to consider Mr. Duncan's request to reopen his original withdrawn appeal, the administrative judge did have the authority to consider the filing as a new appeal, albeit an untimely filed one. Thus, in a case where the appellant files a motion to reopen with an administrative judge, the Board's policy is to consider the filing as both a request to reopen, to be addressed by the full Board, and a new appeal, to be first addressed by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See also Scott v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 581, &#x00B6; 4 (1999); <span class="Italic">Richards v. Department of the Navy,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 6, 8 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following<span class="Italic"> Duncan,</span> the Board issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Nabors v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 31 M.S.P.R. 656, 659 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 824 F.2d 978 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table). Like Mr. Duncan, Mr. Nabors withdrew his initial Board appeal to proceed with a grievance, and his appeal was accordingly dismissed. In addition to his grievance, Mr. Nabors also filed a discrimination claim, and the resulting final agency decision included notice of Board appeal rights. Mr. Nabors then filed a second appeal with the regional office. The administrative judge dismissed the second appeal on various grounds, including an erroneous finding that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 precluded Mr. Nabors from appealing to the Board after pursuing the grievance procedure. Mr. Nabors petitioned for review of the initial decision that dismissed his second appeal, and the Board granted his petition, finding that his election to pursue grievance procedures did not preclude him from filing a second appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 658. The Board went on to expand the holding of <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board has determined that it is generally appropriate to treat requests for reconsideration of appellant-initiated dismissals of petitions for appeal as late-filed petitions for appeal and to determine whether good cause has been established for waiving the filing deadline. We find that the same analysis applies here where appellant has filed a second petition for appeal after withdrawing his first one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Nabors,</span> 31 M.S.P.R. at 659 (internal citation to <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> omitted). In accordance with that finding, the Board went on to consider whether Mr. Nabors had established good cause for the late filing of his second appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 659-60. The Board has since followed the policy established in <span class="Italic">Nabors</span> in numerous cases, not limited to the Postal Service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nahoney,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 93, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Gibson-Michaels v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 10 (2009); <span class="Italic">Robey v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 539, &#x00B6; 11,<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 253 Fed. Appx. 933 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> and <span class="Italic">Nabors</span> stand for the proposition that when an appellant whose initial appeal was dismissed as withdrawn seeks to renew her appeal at the regional level, whether by requesting reopening or filing a second appeal, and the matter the appellant seeks to appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction, the Board will treat the pleading below as a new appeal. Should that appeal be untimely filed, as will generally be the case, the burden is on the appellant to establish good cause for the delay.[3] We again affirm this policy, as it permits the administrative judge to address the appellant's arguments on timeliness, and possibly other issues, whereas the administrative judge would lack the authority to do so were the pleading considered solely as a request to reopen.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that in some cases the second appeal may be timely filed, which would obviate the need for a showing of good cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has on several occasions extended the holding of <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> and <span class="Italic">Nabors</span> to cases where, as here, the appellant did not file an additional pleading at the regional level, but instead elected to petition the Board for review of the initial decision that dismissed her appeal as withdrawn. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vitello v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 647, &#x00B6; 4 (2008) (considering a petition for review as a new appeal); <span class="Italic">Zuhlke v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 401, 403-04 (1997) (same); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 228, 230-31 (1991) (same);<span class="Italic"> cf. Sainz v. Department of Justice,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 678, 681 n.2, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 835 F.2d 870 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table) (treating appellant's request for reopening, filed directly with the Board, as a new, late-filed appeal). We find, however, that in such cases the rationale of <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> and <span class="Italic">Nabors</span> does not apply, and there is no basis for treating the appellant's petition for review as a new appeal.[4] Accordingly, we do not<span id="Page_1096"></span> consider the appellant's petition for review as a new appeal and hereby overrule any Board precedent to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The disposition of an appeal, including the question of whether the appeal should be dismissed as untimely filed, is in the first instance a matter to be decided by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.22(c), 1201.111(b)(3). By contrast, a petition for review is, by regulation, a matter to be considered solely by the full Board. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 C.F.R. part 1201, subpart C.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lincoln</span> was applied by <span class="Italic">Giordano v. USPS,</span> NY-0752-10-0151-I-1 (NP 6/3/2011), with the result that the Board determined<span class="Italic"></span> that the initial appeal leading to the PFR was untimely filed with no good cause for delay, leading to dismissal of the PFR that sought reopening of the initial decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant petitions for review of an initial decision that dismissed his involuntary resignation claim for lack of Board jurisdiction. The appellant resigned from his grade 6 Tractor-Trailer Operator position on October 9, 2008, due to alleged harassment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, after consideration of the record, we <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> vacate the initial decision and dismiss the appeal as untimely filed without a showing of good cause for the delay. As noted above, the appellant filed a previous appeal regarding his alleged involuntary resignation. <span class="Italic">See Giordano v. U.S. Postal</span> Service, MSPB Docket No. NY-0752-09-0043-I-1 (Initial Decision, Dec. 16, 2008). That appeal was dismissed pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement between the parties, which provided, among other things, that the appellant would withdraw the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, although the dismissal did not state this <span class="Italic">per se</span>, the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because it was withdrawn. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The dismissal initial decision became final on January 20, 2009. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily an appellant's withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality that removes the appeal from the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Lincoln v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 486, &#x00B6; 7 (2010); <span class="Italic">Small v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 4 (2009). The Board has the authority to reopen an appeal in which a final decision has been issued, but an administrative judge does not. <span class="Italic">Lincoln</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 486, &#x00B6; 10 n.2. Thus, if an appellant whose initial appeal was dismissed as withdrawn seeks to renew the appeal before an administrative judge, either by requesting reopening or filing a second appeal, his pleading will be docketed as a new appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 12. Should the new appeal be untimely filed, as will generally be the case, the burden is on the appellant to establish good cause for the delay. <span class="Italic">Pradier v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 495, &#x00B6; 9 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed this, his second appeal, on March 27, 2010, some 18 months after his October 9, 2008 resignation. The initial decision did not address whether the appellant established good cause for the filing delay and did not provide the parties with the opportunity to address this issue. The Clerk of the Board therefore issued an Order to the parties on March 9, 2011, setting forth the requirements for showing that the appeal was timely or that there was good cause for a delay in filing. The appellant filed a response in which he asserts that he cannot respond because he is preparing for a mediation in another appeal and that he has been subjected to harassment by agency officials in relation to that matter. The appellant has not requested an extension of time to respond to the Board's Order on timeliness, and we do not discern a basis for one. The fact that the appellant is involved in another case, without more, is not a basis for granting further time to respond, and the appellant has not explained specifically why he cannot respond at this time on the issue of timeliness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, an appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). The Board will dismiss an appeal not filed within the time limit unless the appellant establishes good cause for the delay in filing. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). An appellant bears the burden of proof on the issue of timeliness of his March 27, 2010 appeal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(B)] .</p>

Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). In making this determination, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of the excuse, whether the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits. <span class="Italic">McClendon v.

If the appellant asserts that there was good cause for his delay because a medical condition affected or impaired his ability to file a timely appeal, he must identify the time period during which he suffered from an illness; submit medical evidence showing that he suffered from the illness during that time period; and explain how the illness prevented him from timely filing the appeal. <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 434, 437 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the appellant filed this appeal on March 27, 2010, some 18 months after his October 9, 2008 resignation. The appeal was triggered when the appellant learned that other employees had not been made PTFs following their discipline for misconduct but rather had been allowed to return to their regular positions. This event occurred in October 2009, some 9 months after the appellant was returned to duty pursuant to his settlement agreement; it bears no relationship to the appellant's ability to timely file an appeal of his allegedly involuntary resignation. <span class="Italic">See Pradier</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 495, &#x00B6; 12 (delay of 5 weeks after being cleared of wrongdoing does not evidence due diligence or ordinary prudence).</p>

Accordingly, the appellant's appeal of his allegedly involuntary resignation must be dismissed as untimely filed without a showing of good cause for the delay.

<p class="Body-Text">Processing of an attempt to reopen or reinitiate an appeal may depend on whether the appellant's pleading is first filed with an AJ or directly with the Board. If the submission is filed first with the AJ, and then with the Board, as in <span class="Italic">Giordano</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board considers on PFR the AJ's rejection of the newly-filed but belated appeal and determines whether the Board itself should reopen the appeal. The process can differ if the first submission is to the Board. The Board may then decide the reopening issue and remand to the AJ to determine whether to accept the case as a new appeal. In <span class="Italic">Turay v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to her request to reopen this appeal, the Board has held that the "withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality that removes the appeal from the Board's jurisdiction, and, absent unusual circumstances, the Board will not reopen an appeal once it has been withdrawn merely because the appellant wishes to proceed before the Board or to cure an untimely PFR." <span class="Italic">Tacujan v.

Therefore, we DENY her request to reopen this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is an arguable basis for reactivating a withdrawn appeal, the appellant must act quickly on his appeal after learning of the condition that might support resumption of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goldberg v.

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 3 (2000)).

<p class="Body-Text">As an exception to the rule that withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality, the appellant may rescind the withdrawal of an appeal if the rescission is communicated to the Board before it acts on the withdrawal, <span class="Italic">Hoke v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...By letter dated April 10, 1991, and received by the regional office on April 12, 1991, the appellant withdrew her appeal. Accordingly, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal in an initial decision dated April 12, 1991.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With her petition for review, the appellant submits a copy of her letter dated April 18, 1991, to the regional office. In this letter, she requested reopening of her appeal and stated that on April 11, 1991, she spoke by telephone to the regional office's legal clerk, advised the clerk that she was not cancelling the appeal, and asked that her letter of April 10, 1991, be disregarded. The letter further asserted that, in this conversation, the clerk advised the appellant that the letter of April 10 had not been received and that the appellant told the clerk that she would send a letter confirming the telephone call. Finally, the letter stated that the appellant received the initial decision dismissing the appeal before she could mail the confirming letter to the regional office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality that removes an appeal from the Board's jurisdiction....&#8197;In the absence of unusual circumstances such as misinformation or new and material evidence, the Board will not reinstate an appeal once it has been withdrawn merely because an appellant now wishes to proceed before the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon examining the record...we find that she clearly intended to rescind the cancellation of her appeal, and that such intent was communicated prior to receipt by the regional office of the April 10, 1991, letter of withdrawal. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span>, &#x00A7; 38 n.18 (1951) (oral notice of revocation is effective, even though offer itself was in writing). It is undisputed that the appellant personally advised the regional office that she was "not canceling" her appeal on April 11, 1991, and the letter of withdrawal was not received until April 12, 1991. The administrative judge apparently was not advised of the telephone conversation before he dismissed the appeal on the basis of the withdrawal letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the withdrawal of the appeal was not effective because the appellant took timely and effective action to "cancel" or rescind it before it was received. The appellant is thus entitled to adjudication of her appeal of her removal....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Doctrines of issue or claim preclusion may preclude a subsequent appeal on the same matters covered by an earlier appeal. In <span class="Italic">Lapedis v. DHHS</span>, 47 MSPR 337 (1991), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> the appellant filed an appeal in April, 1990, asserting whistleblowing reprisal. The appellant withdrew the appeal in May. An initial decision was issued dismissing the appeal, and that decision became final. The appellant filed a second appeal in July, 1990, alleging that a reassignment in January, 1990, along with other actions, constituted whistleblowing reprisal. The Board decided that both appeals covered the same matters. Although the appellant asserted that the first appeal was withdrawn on the assumption that it would be settled, the withdrawal would not be invalidated unless there were unusual circumstances, e.g., misinformation or new and material evidence. The second appeal could not be placed within the Board's jurisdiction on the basis of a notice of appeal rights from OSC that reaffirmed the OSC determination leading to the first appeal and that was not based on new evidence of reprisal. The second appeal, although more detailed, was generally based on the same facts relating to the same reassignments encompassed in the first. The withdrawal of the first appeal precluded the prosecution of the second.
