<h3 class="h3" id="sec1-269"><span class="space">C.</span> HEARING ENTITLEMENT; BOARD DISPOSITION</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1247104.html">412 F.3d 1273</a>, 1278-79 (Fed. Cir. 2005), a USERRA claim carries a right to a hearing, meaning there is no preliminary determination of the existence of genuine factual disputes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next address Kirkendall's contention that he was entitled to a hearing on his USERRA claim. The board explained in a footnote that it has discretion in USERRA cases to grant a hearing, and that, because there was no genuine factual dispute, a hearing was unnecessary. In refusing to grant hearings in USERRA cases, the board has argued that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324 refers to USERRA claims as "complaints," not as "appeals," and therefore 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a), which guarantees a hearing in all <span class="Italic">appeals</span> to the board, does not apply. <span class="Italic">See Metzenbaum v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 240 F.3d 1068, 1071 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (explaining the board's reasoning for holding that USERRA complaints are not "appeals").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board's reasoning defies common sense and contradicts its own regulations. First, the vast majority of cases heard by the board, and subject to section 7701, are "appeals" of employment decisions, disciplinary or otherwise, made in the first instance by an agency. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Price v. Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 398 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Guillebeau v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 362 F.3d 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Knight v. Dep't of Def.</span>, 332 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2003). These cases do not involve a lower tribunal, such as a district court, yet they clearly involve an initial decision maker distinct from the board. In the same way, USERRA claims originate when an agency makes an employment decision (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, refuses to hire a veteran). Regardless of the fact that section 4324 uses the term "complaint," these employment decisions are then appealed to the board for review. More troubling, however, is the board's interpretation of sections 4324 and 7701 as providing less procedural protection to veterans who have potentially been victimized than to employees who have been discharged for misconduct. To the contrary, this reasoning is a gross misinterpretation of the purpose of USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the board itself understood that USERRA claims are "appeals" within the meaning of section 7701 and has promulgated numerous regulations memorializing this understanding. In 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.4, the board determined that "(a) Appeal. 'Appeal' means a request for review of an agency action (the same meaning as in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(f)) and includes a 'complaint' or 'action' as those terms are used in USERRA (38 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 4342)." And in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.13, the board refers to USERRA claims as "appeals" or to USERRA claimants as "appellants" no fewer than fourteen times. And, as noted in <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum</span>, 240 F.3d at 1071, the board intentionally included USERRA claims in its appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The right to a hearing--not a discretionary grant of a hearing--was reaffirmed in an <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision, <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://openjurist.org/479/f3d/830/kirkendall-v-department-of-army">479 F.3d 830</a>, 844-46 (Fed. Cir. 2007) [(on subsequent appeal, <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Dept. of Army,</span> 573 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2009), remanding to Board for remedial order for a VEOA claim)] :</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to hearing rights, our analysis begins with the USERRA statute itself.<span class="Italic"> See Sheehan v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1012 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (deciding the burden of proof requirement for USERRA actions "[o]n the basis of the statute and the appurtenant legislative history"). 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(1) provides: "The Merit Systems Protection Board shall adjudicate any complaint brought before the Board pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(A) or (b).... A person who seeks a hearing or adjudication by submitting such a complaint under this paragraph may be represented at such hearing or adjudication in accordance with the rules of the Board." The unambiguous meaning of the language is that any veteran who requests a hearing shall receive one. Indeed, section 4324(c)(1) begins, the board "shall adjudicate any complaint brought before [it]." The discretion it then affords does not relate to whether a hearing may be denied, but to how the veteran "may be represented" at the "hearing or adjudication." By providing that the board <span class="Italic">shall</span> adjudicate all USERRA claims brought before it and affording discretion over how the veteran may be represented at any requested "hearing or adjudication," the statute clearly evinces Congress' intent to provide veterans with a hearing as a matter of right. To interpret the statute otherwise would render the "such hearing" language nonsensical. The board has discretion neither to deny a requested "adjudication," nor to deny a requested "hearing."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Until now, it has been the board's practice to grant a hearing as a matter of administrative grace, or deny one at its convenience. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Matotek v. Dep't of Commerce,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 36, 41 (2006); <span class="Italic">Jordan v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 525, 529 (2002), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 82 Fed. Appx. 42 (Fed. Cir. 2003). But it must administer the law as Congress wrote it. The board's consistent misapplication of the law can neither be used to defend its practice; nor to justify what Congress did not intend. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Gardner,</span> 513 U.S. 115, 120-21 (1993) (where the Department of Veterans Affairs' 60-year regulatory practice was contrary to statute, congressional reenactment of the statute and legislative silence did not constitute an implicit endorsement); <span class="Italic">see also Demarest v. Manspeaker,</span> 498 U.S. 184, 190 (1991) ("Where the law is plain, subsequent reenactment does not constitute an adoption of a previous administrative construction."); <span class="Italic">Mass. Trs. of E. Gas &#x0026; Fuel Assocs. v. United States,</span> 377 U.S. 235, 241-242 (1964) (congressional reenactment has no interpretive effect where regulations clearly contradict requirements of statute). To be sure, the board is free to set out regulations for the orderly conduct of business, but it cannot use that discretion to override the congressionally mandated right to a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) lends additional support to our reading of section 4324(c). It provides: "An employee, or applicant for employment, may submit an <span class="Italic">appeal</span> to the Merit Systems Protection Board from <span class="Italic">any action which is appealable</span> to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation. An appellant shall have the right--(1) to a hearing for which a transcript will be kept; and (2) to be represented by an attorney or other representative." Plainly, Kirkendall's USERRA claim is "appealable" to the board under section 4324, and therefore constitutes an "appeal" entitled to a hearing. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.4(c) ("'USERRA appeal' means an appeal filed under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324."); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.13 (characterizing board review of USERRA claims as "USERRA appeals"); <span class="Italic">see also Kirkendall v. Dep't of the Army,</span> AT-3443-02-0622-I-1, AT-0330-02-0621-B-1 (MSPB Dec. 4, 2003) (referring to board review of Kirkendall's USERRA claim as an "appeal").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true, as the government argues, that Kirkendall's proceeding before the board is not an appeal in the traditional Article III sense, as defined by <span class="Italic">Marbury v. Madison,</span> 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803), but this is of no moment. In providing procedural protections for employees of and applicants to the federal government, <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, Congress made clear its intent to vary the <span class="Italic">Marbury</span> definition of "appeal" in federal employment contexts. Indeed, the vast majority of cases heard by the board, and subject to section 7701 procedures, are "appeals" of employment decisions, disciplinary or otherwise, made in the first instance by an agency. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Price v. Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> 398 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Guillebeau v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 362 F.3d 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Knight v. Dep't of Def.,</span> 332 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2003). These cases do not involve a lower tribunal, such as a district court, yet they clearly involve an initial decision maker distinct from the board, rendering them an "appeal" of agency action. In the same way, USERRA claims derive from an agency's employment decision, e.g., the refusal to hire a veteran.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Merely because Congress described Kirkendall's petition for review as a "complaint" does not suggest that it intended to characterize his action as an "original" proceeding before the board, and deprive him of the right to a hearing. To the contrary, in determining what procedural protections Congress intended to afford USERRA complainants, we look to the substance of the matter, review of an initial agency action, not to the form surrounding it or the name ascribed, initiation of proceedings before the board with a "complaint." <span class="Italic">Cf. Dolan v. City of Tigard,</span> 512 U.S. 374, 405 n.8 (1994) ("In determining what is due process of law regard must be had to substance, not to form.") (quoting <span class="Italic">Chicago B. &#x0026; Q. R. Co. v. Chicago,</span> 166 U.S. 226, 235 (1897)); <span class="Italic">see also Katz v. Cisneros,</span> 16 F.3d 1204, 1207 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("[W]e look to the true nature of the action in determining the existence or not of jurisdiction."); <span class="Italic">Chem. Eng'g Corp. v. Marlo, Inc.,</span> 754 F.2d 331, 333 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ("Implicit in our mandate is the authority to recharacterize pleadings which would improperly evade the intent of Congress."); <span class="Italic">In re Snap-on Tools Corp.,</span> 720 F.2d 654, 655 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("The issue here turns on the nature of the action as established in the complaint."). Moreover, it is incongruous to presume that Congress intended to provide hearings as a matter of right in cases involving <span id="Page_441"></span>discipline for misconduct, e.g., <span class="Italic">Price,</span> 398 F.3d at 1322 (constructive suspension); <span class="Italic">Guillebeau</span>, 362 F.3d at 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (removal), while declining to so provide for veterans who may have been victimized.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no ambiguity here. "Ambiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context." <span class="Italic">Brown,</span> 513 U.S. at 118; <span class="Italic">see also St. Vincent's Hosp</span>., 502 U.S. at 221 ("[T]he meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context."). But even if section 4324, especially in the context of section 7701(a), still fairly permitted of more than one interpretation, the rule set out in <span class="Italic">St. Vincent's Hospital,</span> 502 U.S. at 220 n.9; <span class="Italic">Alabama Power Co.,</span> 431 U.S. at 584; and <span class="Italic">Fishgold,</span> 328 U.S. at 285, would demand that we find in Kirkendall's favor. <span class="Italic">St. Vincent's Hospital,</span> and <span class="Italic">Brown,</span> 513 U.S. at 117-18, make clear that "interpretive doubt is to be resolved in the veteran's favor" and operate to rebut or eliminate otherwise fair readings in close cases. And this statutory regime emphatically does not admit of deference to the board &#x00E0; la <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> because "[i]f a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect." <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</span> 467 U.S. 837, 843 n.9 (1984). After applying the interpretive rule in <span class="Italic">Fishgold</span>, it is abundantly clear that Congress' intent is to provide veterans a hearing upon request, especially because we "presume congressional understanding of such interpretive principles," at the time of enactment. <span class="Italic">St. Vincent's Hospital,</span> 502 U.S. at 220 n.9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the government's assertion, <span class="Italic">Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 776 F.2d 276 (Fed. Cir. 1985), does not conflict with our holding here; in fact, it enhances it. <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> provides that, absent a reference to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 in the statute giving rise to the right of action, there 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1), some of its guidelines, whether procedural or substantive, may apply to an action without invoking all of them, as contrasted with cases under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(2), which explicitly refers to section 7701.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 278-80. Indeed, <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> approved of the board's practice of applying most of section 7701's procedures to voluntary physical disability retirement cases, but not applying its burden of proof. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, section 4324(c)(1) in this case gives rise to the right to a hearing, while 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c)(1) and the legislative history surrounding USERRA make clear that section 7701(c)'s burden of proof requirement does not apply. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan,</span> 240 F.3d at 1012-14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, had Congress referenced section 7701 in the USERRA statute, section 7701(c)'s burden of proof, along with all of section 7701's remaining procedures, would necessarily apply. Therefore, its decision not to reference this "catch-all" statute does not in any way suggest an intent not to provide a right to a hearing. It only demonstrates that Congress, while providing for a hearing, did not necessarily want all of section 7701 to apply. Consequently, because Kirkendall requested a hearing before the board on his USERRA claim, we reverse the board's decision to deny him one.</p>

Although this court held in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> that USERRA claimants have the right to a hearing because they are "appeals" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, it did not hold that the right to a hearing attaches simply because a claimant files a claim with the Board that he denominates as a USERRA claim.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Baney has failed to satisfy the threshold showing necessary to show that the Board has jurisdiction over his USERRA claim. He has provided no details about his claim. He has not described the protected right or benefit that he was allegedly denied because of his military status.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Barry v. DOD</span>, 702 Fed. Appx. 991, 992-93 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP), reiterated that the right of a hearing on a USERRA claim depends on the existence of nonfrivolous factual allegations of discrimination based on military service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board properly dismissed Mr. Barry's USERRA claim because he has not made nonfrivolous factual allegations suggesting he was discriminated against based on his military service. The Board set forth the jurisdictional standard for Mr. Barry's USERRA claim. It found Mr. Barry "failed to produce either direct or circumstantial evidence that his military service was a substantial or motivating factor in the agency's action." Although the Board's acknowledgement order did not advise Mr. Barry of the requirements to establish Board jurisdiction over his USERRA claim, the Agency advised him in its motion on jurisdiction before Mr. Barry responded to the Board's acknowledgement order with his proof of jurisdiction. Thus, there is no prejudicial error. We hold that the Board properly dismissed Mr. Barry's USERRA claim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Barry argues that under <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 479 F.3d 830, 844-46 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that the appellant's appeal was timely filed, we proceed to the merits of the appellant's request for corrective action. The Board's regulations permit adjudicating a VEOA claim on the merits without a hearing. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.23(b). The Board has interpreted this regulation as allowing an administrative judge to deny a hearing request in a VEOA case when there is no genuine dispute of material fact and one party must prevail as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See Sherwood v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 208, &#x00B6; 11 (2001). In this respect VEOA is distinguishable from USERRA. VEOA neither contains the word "hearing," nor any language relating to a "hearing," unlike USERRA, which provides an unconditional right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">Compare</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a-3330c with 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(1); <span class="Italic">see Kirkendall,</span> 479 F.3d at 845-46, 863 (a majority of the court determined that an appellant has a right to a hearing before the Board with regard to a USERRA appeal). Thus, the appellant here does not have an unconditional right to his requested hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are able to decide this appeal on the merits without a hearing because the record on a dispositive issue has been fully developed below and the appellant had a full and fair opportunity to dispute the agency's evidence.[*] The evidence shows that the appellant applied for multiple positions under announcements limited to internal candidates and that the agency did not conduct competitive examinations. Both the agency's submissions and the administrative judge's order put the appellant on notice that veterans' preference does not apply when an employee seeks a promotion under an announcement limited to internal candidates. <span class="Italic">See Brown v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">To be considered minimally qualified for this position, candidates must have a minimum of two years of demonstrated professional experience in some combination of selecting, organizing, and providing access to rare books and other special collections materials in an academic or research library. If such experience was gained as part of a set of more diverse responsibilities, the amount of such special collections experience must have cumulated to the equivalent of at least two years of full-time special collections work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's application package included a resume listing one continuous employment period for the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps from 1962 to 1984, in which one of his duties was "[a]rranging for donations of rare materials, controlling access to rare items, artifacts." It is undisputed, however, that the appellant's resume did not indicate that this experience "cumulated to the equivalent of at least two years of full-time special collections work," as required by the vacancy announcement, and nothing else in his application package indicated that he had cumulated this experience. Moreover, the administrative judge afforded the appellant numerous opportunities to file evidence and argument in this appeal, and nothing in the appellant's submissions below regarding jurisdiction and the merits of his case indicate that he cumulated two years of full-time special collections experience. In a Qualifications Rating Form, the agency stated that the appellant failed to "meet the selective factor of two years working with rare books or materials in a research or academic library." Thus, based on the record developed below, we find that the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights by not selecting him for the GS-12 Supervisory Librarian position because of his failure to meet a minimum qualification requirement of the position. <span class="Italic">See Ramsey,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 98 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9.</p>
