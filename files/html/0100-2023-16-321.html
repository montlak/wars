<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-321"><span class="space">1.</span> Findings on Credibility, Other Issues</h4>
<p class="noindent">An ALJ deciding an FLRA complaint must ensure that his decision comports with the adjudicative requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB and IAF Local F-88</span>, 55 FLRA 968, 970 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An unfair labor practice hearing must be conducted "in accordance with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of this title...." the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(6). Under the APA, all decisions--including "initial...decisions" by administrative law judges--must include "findings and conclusions" on all the "material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 557(c)(3)(A) (1966). This provision requires that an administrative law judge who is "faced with evidence in the record contradicting his conclusion...must affirmatively reject the contradictory evidence and explain his rationale for so doing." <span class="Italic">See v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, </span>36 F.3d 375, 384 (4th Cir. 1994) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">CNA Insurance Company v. Legrow</span>, 935 F.2d 430, 436 (1st Cir. 1991) (additional citations omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA Local 171</span>, 57 FLRA 604, 606 (2001) ("Absent a concession, a judge errs by failing to address an issue that is expressly alleged in the complaint."); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 56 FLRA 906, 912 (2000) (reviewing requirements pertaining to factual and credibility findings by ALJ). The judge need not comment on every piece of evidence, particularly if it is cumulative or undisputed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and AFSCME Council 26</span>, 59 FLRA 491 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">As for factual findings by the ALJ, FLRA recited its deferential review standard, <span class="Italic">DOD Foreign Language Ctr. and AFGE Local 1263</span>, 64 FLRA 735, 744 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a judge's factual findings are supported, the Authority looks to the preponderance of the record evidence. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp.,</span> <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 64 FLRA 365, 368 (2009) (Member Beck concurring) (citing, among others, <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Space and Missile Systems Ctr, Detachment 12, Kirkland Air Force Base,</span> <span class="Italic">NM</span>, 64 FLRA 166, 171 (2009) (Member Beck concurring in part)). Errors of fact that do not affect the outcome of the case are disregarded. <span class="Italic">BOP, Elkton,</span> Ohio, 61 FLRA at 517.</p>
<p class="noindent">But FLRA ultimately has responsibility for its factual and legal findings, and it may arrive at determinations different from those contained in its ALJs' recommendations, <span class="Italic">FDA and AFGE Council 242</span>, 54 FLRA 630, 635 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's objection that the Authority may not make factual findings "not found by" the Judge ignores basic principles of administrative law. The Administrative Procedure Act provides that "[o]n appeal from or review of the initial decision [of a Judge], the agency has all the powers which it would have in making the initial decision except as it may limit the issues on notice or by rule." 5 U.S.C. 557(b); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. 2423.41(b) (on exceptions, Authority will affirm, reverse, or "dispos[e] of the matter as is otherwise deemed appropriate"). An agency must consider a Judge's initial decision and the evidence on which it was based, but that decision is "not binding upon the agency[.]" 4 Jacob Stein, <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, Administrative Law, (1998) at 36-15; <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Communications Commission v.

<p class="noindent-1">As this case demonstrates, credibility determinations may be based on a variety of considerations.[11] Here the Respondent relies on character evidence, as well as alleged inconsistent testimony and the demeanor <span id="page_1588"></span>of the witness, to support its contention that Anthony-Jung's testimony should not be credited. With respect to witness demeanor, the Authority has recognized that only the judge has the benefit of observing the witnesses while they testify and accordingly the Authority attaches great weight to a judge's determinations based on demeanor. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Redstone Arsenal</span> <span class="Italic">Exchange, Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Redstone</span> <span class="Italic">Arsenal, Alabama</span>, 50 FLRA 51 (1994) <span class="Italic">(Redstone Arsenal</span>); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also Standard Drywall Products, Inc.</span>, 91 NLRB, 544, 545 (1950); <span class="Italic">Aiu v.

<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;Such considerations may include, but are not limited to: 1) the witness's opportunity and capacity to observe the event in question; 2) the witness's character as it relates to honesty; 3) prior inconsistent statements by the witness; 4) the witness's bias or lack thereof; 5) the consistency of the witness's testimony with other record evidence; 6) the inherent improbability of the witness's testimony; and 7) the witness's demeanor. <span class="Italic">See Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 453, 458 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, where other considerations are implicated in a credibility determination, the reasons for deferring to the judge are less compelling. <span class="Italic">See Herbert F</span>. <span class="Italic">Darling, Inc.</span>, 267 NLRB 476, 477 (1983), <span class="Italic">remanded sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Ewing v.

<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;It is incumbent on the judges to state the basis of their credibility determinations, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, whether they are based on witness demeanor or some other basis. For the reasons set forth above, it is also incumbent on the judges to explain, in circumstances such as those in this case, why they credit or discredit the testimony of a particular witness. Our concurring colleague suggests that requiring judges to state the basis for their credibility determinations will encourage litigation. We disagree. In our view, clearly informing parties of the basis of credibility determinations and the standard upon which those determinations will be reviewed will tend to decrease rather than increase exceptions to the Authority. Moreover, if parties choose to litigate nondemeanor credibility determinations, such exceptions to a judge's credibility determination must include specific citations to the record in support thereof.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Further, we disagree with the dissent's assertion that Authority should review administrative law judges' (ALJs') factual determinations on a "deferential 'substantial[-]evidence' standard," and should uphold the determination of the ALJ in this case that an SQA remedy is not appropriate. The Authority has previously explained in detail the reasons for applying the well-established preponderance-of-the-evidence standard for reviewing ALJs' factual findings.[24] There is no need to repeat that discussion here. However, the dissent's additional assertion--that the Authority should grant an ALJ's factual findings "the same deference that it does to an arbitrator['s]" factual findings--warrants comment.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The deferential standard that the Authority applies to review arbitrators' factual findings is based on considerations unique to the arbitration process, and has no implications for the standard that the Authority applies in reviewing ALJs' factual determinations in ULP cases. Congress was very explicit in the Statute about the grounds for reviewing arbitrators' awards. Specifically, &#x00A7; 7122(a) expressly provides, among other things, that the Authority review arbitrators' awards "on...grounds similar to those applied by [f]ederal courts in private[-]sector labor-management relations." Regarding factual issues, courts review arbitrators' awards applying the highly deferential nonfact standard.[27] Congress made this determination to ensure uniformity between the treatment of arbitrators' awards in private-sector labor-management relations, and their treatment by the Authority in federal-sector labor-management relations.[28]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The comparable analogy regarding ULP cases would be to the standard applied in private-sector labor-management relations by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). And as the Authority previously explained, "[t]he NLRB has determined to review factual findings made by its ALJs in [ULP] cases based on the preponderance[-]of[-]the[-]evidence standard."[29] In short, the analogy that the dissent seeks to draw between the standard for reviewing arbitrators' factual findings and the standard for reviewing ALJs' factual findings is contrary to Congress's determination in the Statute, and we reject it.</p>

Because the GC disputes the Judge's credibility determination on bases other than the witness' demeanor, we have reviewed the Judge's determination based on the record as a whole. For the following reasons, we conclude that the Judge's determination to credit the Chief Nurse's explanation that he<span class="Italic"> </span>reassigned the nurses because of interpersonal conflicts is supported by a preponderance of the record evidence, and we deny the GC's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Chief Nurse testified without dispute that there were "ongoing conflicts" on unit A2, including interactions among the LPN, RN A, and RN <span id="page_1589"></span>B and that the LPN sent an email to the Associate Director, which "brought to light her feelings of harassment." The Chief Nurse also testified that he "wanted to remove the individuals from the situation" without placing "blame on any individual...." Nothing about this explanation is inherently incredible. The GC disputes the witness' veracity, claiming that the witness offered inconsistent testimony as to whether the LPN was reassigned at her request. However, the Chief Nurse's acknowledgment that the LPN had requested a transfer from unit A2 does not establish that his decision to in fact transfer her was based on her request. Moreover, although the Chief Nurse was found to have made some unpleasant remarks about RN A, we find those remarks to be insufficient to show that the Chief Nurse reassigned RN A in retaliation for her protected activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the forgoing, we conclude that a preponderance of the record evidence supports the Judge's credibility determination and that the Judge correctly determined that the GC did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of unlawful retaliation. We, therefore, deny the GC's exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Respondent's first exception, regarding whether the Charging Party president agreed to begin negotiations on a new CBA, is framed as a challenge to a factual finding, it is, in effect, a challenge to the Judge's determination that the Charging Party president was a credible witness on the issues of whether the parties agreed orally to begin negotiating a new CBA.</p>

With respect to witness demeanor, the Authority has recognized that only the judge has the benefit of observing the witnesses while they testify, and, accordingly, the Authority attaches great weight to a judge's determinations based on demeanor. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Air Force,</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force Materiel Command, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins Air Force Base, Ga</span>., 55 FLRA 1201, 1204 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Warner Robins AFB</span>). Where a party raises exceptions to credibility determinations based on considerations other than witness demeanor, the Authority will review those determinations based on the record as a whole. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Judge's credibility determinations were based on demeanor and the consistency of the testimony with record evidence. In resolving the issue of whether an oral agreement had been reached, the Judge found that the Charging Party president's testimony that he "never made an agreement to start negotiations from the beginning" was "consistent and sincere," while that of the Respondent's labor relations officer was "self-serving and not candid." The Judge thus credited the Charging Party president's testimony that, although the parties had discussed negotiating a new CBA, they had not reached a "clear and concise" oral agreement to that effect. This determination is entitled to great weight because it is based on the Judge's own observations. <span class="Italic">Warner Robins AFB</span>, 55 FLRA at 1204.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge did not make explicit credibility rulings on the testimony of two Respondent witnesses who stated that the Charging Party president agreed to negotiate an entirely new CBA.&#x2003;However, the Authority has held that where a judge is confronted with conflicting witness testimony and affirmatively declares that one witness is credible, absent evidence to the contrary, the Authority will construe this as a determination by the judge that the opposing witness testimony is <span class="Italic">not</span> credible. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv.</span>, 56 FLRA 906, 912 n.5 (2000). We therefore construe the Judge's determination that the Charging Party president's testimony regarding an oral agreement was credible as a finding that opposing testimony from the two Respondent witnesses was not credible. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the Judge's credibility determinations were based on the consistency of the witnesses' testimony with the record evidence, the Respondent has not demonstrated by a clear preponderance of the evidence that the Judge's credibility determinations are erroneous. Although the Respondent assigns different weight to the witnesses' testimony, the record as a whole supports the Judge's findings concerning the parties' credibility. In this regard, a Respondent witness, who was present during the September 2004 meeting, stated that the Charging Party president requested a written proposal from the Respondent. This indicates that the Charging Party president did not make, or intend to make, an oral agreement at that time. Furthermore, the record contains little evidence in support of the Respondent witnesses' testimony that an agreement was reached. In this regard, the first written reference to that alleged agreement appeared in an April 2005 letter from the Respondent's labor relations officer to the Charging Party president. However, even that letter is devoid of detail. In further support of her conclusion that an oral agreement regarding a CBA had not been reached, the Judge found that the parties had a practice of negotiating exclusively in terms of written proposals and final agreements. Although it is uncontested that the parties made certain oral agreements, there is no evidence that the parties made oral agreements related to bargaining. Additionally, the Respondent's offer of free rent in exchange for no CBA negotiations for five years is not consistent with its claim that it had already agreed with the Charging Party president to start negotiations on a new CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Respondent has not established by a clear preponderance of the evidence that the Judge's credibility determinations are inconsistent with the record, and we deny the exception.</p>
