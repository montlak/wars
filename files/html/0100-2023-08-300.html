<p class="Body-Text">USERRA coverage is specific. The statute is for the protection of federal employees or applicants for employment who serve or who have served in the uniformed services. That class of individuals is not identical to that of individuals having veterans preference. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-064.html#sec1-65">Preference Eligible Status</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-08-328.html#sec1-320">Veterans Employment Opportunities Act</a>," for discussion concerning the scope of veterans preference entitlements and the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">38 USC 4303 defines a federal agency for purposes of USERRA coverage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)(A)&#x2003;Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the term "employer" means any person, institution, organization, or other entity that pays salary or wages for work performed or that has control over employment opportunities, including--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i) &#x2003;a person, institution, organization, or other entity to whom the employer has delegated the performance of employment-related responsibilities;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii) &#x2003;the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(iii) &#x2003;a State;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(iv) &#x2003;any successor in interest to a person, institution, organization, or other entity referred to in this subparagraph; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(v) &#x2003;a person, institution, organization, or other entity that has denied initial employment in violation of section 4311.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B) &#x2003;In the case of a National Guard technician employed under section 709 of title 32, the term "employer" means the adjutant general of the State in which the technician is employed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(5)&#x2003;The term "Federal executive agency" includes the United States Postal Service, the Postal Regulatory Commission, any nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the United States, any Executive agency (as that term is defined in section 105 of title 5) other than an agency referred to in section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) of title 5, and any military department (as that term is defined in section 102 of title 5) with respect to the civilian employees of that department.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(6)&#x2003;The term "Federal Government" includes any Federal executive agency, the legislative branch of the United States, and the judicial branch of the United States.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii), establishes exclusions of:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(ii)(I) the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the National Reconnaissance Office; and</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute governing retention preference in RIFs is codified in title 5 of the United States Code. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3501-3504. A "preference eligible" for purposes of title 5 has a specific definition<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2108(3). However, USERRA, which is codified in title 38, covers persons who performed "service in the uniformed services," as that term is defined at 38 USC &#x00A7; 4303(13). Section 4303(13) defines the term "service in the uniformed services" as meaning--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis in a uniformed service under competent authority and includes active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for training, inactive <span id="Page_499"></span>duty training, full-time National Guard duty, and a period for which a person is absent from a position of employment for the purpose of an examination to determine the fitness of the person to perform any such duty.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In arguing that DOJ should be considered his employer for purposes of this appeal, the appellant relies on 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(4)(A)(ii) which defines "employer" under 38 U.S.C. chapter 43 as including "the Federal Government." While it is no doubt true that all employees of federal agencies are employees of the federal government, the definition of "employer" also requires that the person, institution, organization, or other entity must pay salary or wages for work performed and have control over employment opportunities. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(4)(A). The appellant has not shown that DOJ ever paid him salary for work performed. Although he asserts that DOJ had control over the conduct of his prior adjudications, he has not shown that, in representing HUD in civil actions filed by the appellant, DOJ exercised control over his personal employment opportunities at HUD. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(4)(A); <span class="Italic">see Silva v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 15 (2009).

Jolley produced no evidence that the Department of Justice paid him a salary or wages for work he performed. <span class="Italic">See Board Decision</span>, 2014 MSPB LEXIS 5917, at *9. Nor was there any showing that it exercised control over his "employment opportunities," 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(4)(A), at HUD. Accordingly, the Department of Justice does not meet the definition of an "employer" under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department of Justice represented HUD during adjudication of the ADEA claim Jolley filed in district court. It also provided legal advice to HUD in connection with the appeals he filed against HUD with the board.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Ms. Lourens claims that she is entitled to appeal to the MSPB her termination from her former probationary position as a Part-time Flexible Letter Carrier with the United States Postal Service. Ms. Lourens argues that she has appeal rights under USERRA because she alleges discrimination based on her deceased husband's membership in a uniformed service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Lourens never served in the military, but as the widow of a deceased disabled veteran she is preference eligible. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2108(3). Ms. Lourens asserts that she has been discriminated against because of her preference eligibility, and since her preference eligibility was based on her husband's membership in a uniformed service, Ms. Lourens concludes that the discrimination against her was also based on her husband's membership in a uniformed service. Ms. Lourens asserts that USERRA, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of prior membership in a uniformed service, <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 4311 (a), therefore applies to her as well. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 4324(b) (providing the MSPB with jurisdiction to hear appeals under USERRA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is a case of first impression. Congress declared that the purpose of USERRA was "to prohibit discrimination against persons because of <span class="Italic">their</span> service in the uniformed services." 38 USC &#x00A7; 4301(a)(3) (emphasis added). The relevant antidiscrimination section of USERRA states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied...retention in employment...by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 USC &#x00A7; 4311(a). In &#x00A7; 4311(a), Congress demonstrated its ability to specify the exact coverage of the anti-discrimination provision it intended. The section applies not only to members of the uniformed services, but also to those who apply to perform, or perform, or are obligated to perform, service in a uniformed service. If Congress desired the section to include spouses or widows of such persons, an additional phrase in the statute would have done the job. That phrase is not there.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;"Service in the uniformed services" is defined as the performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis in a uniformed service under competent authority and includes active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for training, inactive duty training, full-time National Guard duty, and a period for which a person is absent from a position of employment for the purpose of an examination to determine the fitness of the person to perform any such duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">38 USC &#x00A7; 4303(13).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted by the administrative judge, Ms. Lourens does not allege that she "is a member of, applie[d] to be a member of, performs, has performed, applie[d] to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service," &#x00A7; 4311(a), but rather alleges that her husband had performed such service. We find no basis in USERRA for Ms. Lourens's assertion that she assumes her deceased husband's rights and is thus covered by virtue of his service.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a)(1) (emphasis added).

It is undisputed that the appellant is a dentist employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs and that he was appointed under chapter 74 of title 38.

<p class="Block-Quote2">Nonworkdays falling within a period of absence for active duty are charged against the paid military leave allowed full-time employees during the fiscal year, but nonworkdays falling at the end of an active duty period are not charged.

We further conclude that the nature of the appellant's USERRA claim--i.e., whether she is asserting a reemployment claim or a discrimination claim--does not change our analysis because the Board's jurisdiction over both types of claims derives from 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b). <span class="Italic">See Clavin</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 5.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;As explained by the administrative judge, employees of agencies listed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) are not completely left without redress of certain USERRA-based allegations of wrongdoing; pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4325, employees of such agencies, including the FBI, may submit a claim involving reemployment rights to the agency's inspector general for investigation and resolution. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4325(b); <span class="Italic">Dew</span>, 192 F.3d at 372-73.</p>

However, the appellant's reliance on <span class="Italic">Petersen</span> for purposes of establishing jurisdiction is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Petersen</span>, the Board held that an appellant can assert a hostile work environment claim under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) in a USERRA appeal before the Board, provided that "the appellant has otherwise met the jurisdictional and timeliness requirements." <span class="Italic">Petersen</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 237-239. Thus, the assertion of a hostile work environment claim is not itself a basis for Board jurisdiction; rather, it is a matter the Board may adjudicate in an appeal in which it has otherwise been granted jurisdiction. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge correctly dismissed the appellant's USERRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Because the Second Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Dew</span> provides additional, persuasive support for dismissal of the appellant's claim, we find that the administrative judge did not err in considering and citing it. <span class="Italic">See Mitchell v.

FBI employees who allege reprisal for engaging in whistleblowing activity are covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2303, which provides that enforcement of the FBI whistleblower protection provisions will be consistent with provisions in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221, but does not provide for appeal rights to the Board. Rather, the procedures for redress are to be established by the Attorney General to ensure internal resolution. <span class="Italic">Van Lancker</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 514, &#x00B6; 14 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2303(b), as well as the regulatory history for the applicable Department of Justice regulations). Because the Board does not have the authority to hear claims under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2303, the administrative judge properly dismissed the appellant's affirmative defense of reprisal for whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding his USERRA affirmative defense, the appellant argues that it would be contrary to congressional intent and our prior holding in <span class="Italic">Butler v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 45 (1982), if the Board allowed a preference-eligible FBI employee to bring an appeal but denied him the ability to make a USERRA affirmative defense. In <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, we held that a U.S. Postal Service employee may raise a race discrimination affirmative defense, even though the U.S. Postal Service was excluded from the definition of agencies subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302 concerning prohibited personnel practices. <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. at 48 However, in <span class="Italic">Van Lancker</span> we noted the distinction between the U.S. Postal Service and the FBI in the context of an affirmative defense of whistleblower reprisal, noting Congress' desire to adjudicate these claims internally within the Department of Justice, and we believe the same rationale is applicable for the present USERRA affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Van Lancker</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 514, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress specifically excluded the FBI from the list of agencies for purposes of filing a USERRA appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">Erlendson v.

Employees of the excluded executive agencies, including FBI employees, are covered for USERRA purposes under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4315, which provides that agency heads are to prescribe appropriate remedial procedures. Again, as with whistleblower reprisal claims, Congress has provided for a separate remedial process to keep USERRA claims out of the jurisdiction of external tribunals, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board. <span class="Italic">See Dew v. United States</span>, 192 F.3d 366, 372 (2d Cir. 1999) (observing that it is clear from the structure of USERRA that Congress "inten[ded] to preclude judicial review of USERRA claims by the employees of the intelligence community"). Therefore, consistent with our decisions in <span class="Italic">Erlendson</span> and <span class="Italic">Van Lancker</span>, we find that the administrative judge properly dismissed the appellant's USERRA defense because the Board lacks jurisdiction over such claims from FBI employees.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, Parkinson argues that his removal would be not in accord with law under &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C) if it is brought in violation of USERRA. In contrast to the whistleblower retaliation defense, however, the USERRA violation claims do manifest a clear Congressional will to withhold all judicial review of USERRA violations for FBI agents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Parkinson does not explain the specific USERRA violation herein, and cites only 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4315. That section, titled "Reemployment By Certain Federal Agencies" provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;The head of each agency referred to in section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) of title 5 [including the FBI] shall prescribe procedures for ensuring that the rights under this chapter apply to the employees of such agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;In prescribing procedures under subsection (a), the head of an agency referred to in that subsection shall ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the procedures of the agency for reemploying persons who serve in the uniformed services provide for the reemployment of such persons in the agency in a manner similar to the manner of reemployment described in section 4313.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4315 goes on to wholly exclude the FBI's determination of reemployability under that section from judicial review as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)(1)The procedures prescribed under subsection (a) shall designate an official at the agency who shall determine whether or not the reemployment of a person referred to in subsection (b) by the agency is impossible or unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Upon making a determination that the reemployment by the agency of a person referred to in subsection (b) is impossible or unreasonable, the official referred to in paragraph (1) shall notify the person and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management of such determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">(3)&#x2003;A determination pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to judicial review.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(emphasis added). Unlike 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2303(a), which sets forth a procedure for the internal resolution of whistleblower rights, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4315 explicitly indicates that the substantive determination of reemployability "shall not be subject to judicial review." Although such a prohibition applies by its terms only for "a determination pursuant to this subsection," i.e., pursuant <span id="Page_502"></span>to internal agency procedures, the Congressional intent to insulate the substantive determination from judicial review would be frustrated by allowance of judicial review under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2). <span class="Italic">Cf. Dew v. United States</span>, 192 F.3d 366, 371-72 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting <span class="Italic">Block v. Cmty. Nutrition Inst.</span>, 467 U.S. 340, 345 (1984)) ("'Whether and to what extent a particular statute [provides or] precludes judicial review is determined not only from its express language, but also from the structure of the statutory scheme, its objectives, its legislative history, and the nature of the administrative action involved.'"). We note also that unlike the whistleblower act, which protects both veteran and non-veteran employees, USERRA by its terms applies only to veterans. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303 (defining "service in the uniformed services") and 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4311-4312 (prohibiting certain acts against those who "serve in the uniformed services"). As such, it makes little sense to allow Parkinson--by virtue of his having served in the military service--access to judicial review over an affirmative defense grounded in a USERRA violation, when claims by others who have served are explicitly insulated from judicial review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress's coupling of a specific procedure for enforcing USERRA reemployment violations at the FBI and similar agencies, coupled with an affirmative prohibition on judicial review of the substantive determination made thereby, leads us to conclude that Congress intended to exclude the substantive determination from judicial review of any kind, including when presented in the context of an affirmative defense under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant served in the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service (PHS) in various engineering positions for his entire federal service from May 16, 1988, to November 1, 2010. The appellant did not have any military service or creditable PHS civil service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 1, 2007, the appellant was transferred to be a "Sup[ervisor] Facilities Management Engineer II" assigned to the Indian Health Service, Rapid City, South Dakota.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in his appeal asserted that the agency reassigned him in November 2009, included false information in his Commissioned Officers' Effectiveness Reports, denied him two promotions, and subjected him to a hostile work environment.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point for every case involving statutory construction is the language of the statute itself. <span class="Italic">MacLean</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 9 (citations omitted). In the statute at issue in this appeal, the language is clear beginning with the purpose of USERRA. Congress specifically articulated its intention in creating the statutory framework for effecting USERRA, and among those stated reasons was to protect those who serve in the uniformed services from discrimination based on that service. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)(3). Congress further stated that the Federal Government should serve as a model employer in carrying out the statutory mandate to protect those who serve in the uniformed services. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Board has noted the express intent of Congress that the anti-discrimination provisions of USERRA be broadly construed and strictly enforced. <span class="Italic">Murray v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 680, &#x00B6; 7 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 387 Fed. Appx. 955 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has asserted its support for the Board's expansive interpretation of USERRA. <span class="Italic">Yates v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 145 F.3d 1480, 1484 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA prohibits an employer from denying a member of the uniformed service a benefit of employment on the basis of that membership. Specifically the statute provides:</p>
<p class="Body-Address-h">A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant falls within the definition of a member of the uniformed services. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(16). Further, the appellant has claimed that he was: denied certain benefits of employment, including the denial of two promotions; reassigned to an undesirable location; and subjected to a hostile work environment. Finally, he contends he suffered a constructive removal because of his membership in a uniformed service. Denials of promotion and retention in employment are specifically covered in section 4311(a); therefore, these aspects of the appellant's allegation fall within the statute. For the remaining issues regarding reassignment and hostile work environment, we must look to the meaning of the term "benefit of employment." Congress has explained that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The term "benefit," "benefit of employment," or "rights and benefits" means any advantage, profit, privilege, gain, status, account, or interest (other than wages or salary for work performed) that accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employer policy, plan, or practice and includes rights and benefits under a pension plan, a health plan, an employee stock ownership plan, insurance coverage and awards, bonuses, severance pay, supplemental unemployment benefits, vacations, and the opportunity to select work hours or location of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2). The definition encompasses location of assignment, and the Board has interpreted this to include coverage of a hostile work environment claim based on uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Petersen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 227, 239 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that coverage should only apply to civilian service employment and cites for support cases arising under the reemployment sections of USERRA. [citing <span class="Italic">Sutton v. City of Chesapeake</span>, 713 F. Supp.2d 547 (E.D. Va. 2010); <span class="Italic">Erickson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 571 F.3d 1364, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Woodman</span>, 258 F.3d at 1377-79.] The cases the agency cites, however, relate to restoration and reemployment.[1] Two types of cases arise under USERRA: (1) reemployment cases, in which an appellant claims that an agency has not met its obligations under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312-4318 following the appellant's absence from civilian employment to perform uniformed service; and (2) so-called "discrimination" cases, in which an appellant claims that an agency has taken an action prohibited by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) or (b). <span class="Italic">Clavin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 5 (2005). The agency contends that USERRA was not intended to include those who are still serving when the action is taken by the agency employing the appellant in his uniformed service capacity. The law, however, is not framed so narrowly. Here the appellant's allegations fall under the second type of USERRA claim, and the agency has not cited any statute or precedent for precluding a member of the uniformed service from bringing a claim under this section even if it is against the agency employing the appellant as a career member of the uniformed service. The administrative judge, citing case law from several circuits including the Board's reviewing circuit court, explained, and we agree, that providing an exception where one does not exist is disfavored. [citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Sabhnani</span>, 599 F.3d 215, 245 (2d Cir. 2010); <span class="Italic">Owens v.

<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_503"></span>[1]&#x2003;The agency cites <span class="Italic">Bedrossian v. Northwestern Memorial Hospital</span>, 409 F.3d 840 (7th Cir. 2005), and <span class="Italic">Curby v. Archon</span>, 216 F.3d 549, 556 (6th Cir. 2000), for the proposition that Congress intended USERRA to minimize the disruption and disadvantages that uniformed service may have on civilian employment, emphasizing that it is only civilian service that is at issue under USERRA. These cases are also not on point as they only address the first two of the three stated purposes of USERRA, but not the one under which the appellant alleges his claim falls. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)(1), (2). The appellant asserts his claim under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)(3), and the stated purpose of that section is "to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)(3)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also focuses on the ramifications of allowing a career uniformed service officer to bring a claim under USERRA against the agency employing the officer in that capacity. While the Board recognizes the potential impact of allowing individuals who otherwise do not have the right to seek review of agency actions to bring a USERRA claim, this is not a basis for ignoring the clear language of the statute.[2] Moreover, the Board's decision that it has jurisdiction to consider an appeal is not dispositive of the merits of the underlying claim. Indeed, we believe that a career member of a uniformed service will likely have a very difficult challenge in establishing that an employer of career uniformed service members is discriminating based on an appellant's membership in its uniformed service.[3] Still, absent statutory language or clear legislative history of an intent to exclude career uniformed service members from coverage in situations such as this one, we do not find that such an exclusion exists.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency's contention that members of the Commissioned Corps already have an avenue of redress, and therefore USERRA should not apply, is unpersuasive. In enacting USERRA, Congress specifically stated that nothing in the statute should alter a law, policy, plan, or practice "that establishes a right or benefit that is more beneficial to, or is in addition to, a right or benefit provided for such person in this chapter." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(a)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that in this case, while the acting agency component within the Department of Health and Human Services, the Public Health Service, employs members of the Commissioned Corps, the agency component that is alleged to have discriminated, the Indian Health Service, does not. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 204. Here the appellant alleged that it was members of the Indian Health Service, where the appellant was assigned, that engaged in discrimination creating a hostile work environment, as well as caused the Public Health Service to deny him two promotions, reassign him, and eventually caused his involuntary retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, we do not find that Congress intended to exclude the agency from the definition of employer under USERRA. Section 4303 of Title 38 includes the Federal Government in the list of employers for the purposes of USERRA. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(4)(A). In section 4303(5), Congress specifically exempted specified agencies and specifically included military departments with respect to its civilian employees but did not exempt any part of the Department of Health and Human Services or otherwise limit the coverage of its employees under USERRA. Further, within the same section at 4303(16), Congress included, among those in uniformed service, members of the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service. We therefore find no basis to presume that the failure to exempt or further define the inclusion of the Public Health Service and/or the Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services was an oversight.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Exclusion from certain civil service laws, such as means of appointment, does not result in exclusion from coverage under all civil service laws if the appellant otherwise meets the definition of a covered individual. <span class="Italic">Cf. Fishbein v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 10 (2006) (the appellant's appointment under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) without regard to civil service laws did not preclude him from coverage under the Whistleblower Protection Act). Therefore, merely because the appellant was appointed under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 204 without regard to civil service laws does not preclude his coverage under USERRA if he otherwise falls within the defined parameters of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Board has authority to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to USERRA even when the appeal is brought by a career member of the uniformed service and the agency action at issue is taken by the agency employing the uniformed service member in that capacity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCURRING OPINION OF MARY M. ROSE</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I agree with the majority that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal. I believe that the plain language of the statute compels a finding that the Board has jurisdiction over a USERRA appeal brought by an officer of the Public Health Service (PHS) Commissioned Corps alleging that the Corps discriminated against him based on his status as a Corps officer. I write separately to express my discomfort with the implications of this decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Commissioned officers in the PHS Commissioned Corps are subject at all times to immediate deployment by the President of the United States in times of war or emergency. Should the President order deployment, Corps officers become <span class="Italic">de facto</span> military officers. Thus, the same policy considerations underlying Congress's decision to exclude Board jurisdiction over USERRA appeals brought by military officers against their military employers also apply to Commissioned Corps officers. Common sense dictates treating the two classes of officers the same for purposes of determining Board jurisdiction. However, Congress has left a loophole in the statute that excludes military officers, but not Commissioned Corps officers, from bringing USERRA appeals under these circumstances. The Board must apply the statutes that are enacted by Congress, even when those statutes contain what could well be a mistake. I would hope that this apparent mistake will be brought to Congress's attention so that it can be corrected. Until that happens, I must agree with the majority's decision.</p>
