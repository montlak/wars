<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-30"><span class="space">1.</span> General Rule</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit suggested the possibility of undue delay in adverse actions, <span class="Italic">Haver v. USDA</span> (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP No. 02-3315):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Haver argues that the nine-month delay between the July 11 incident and his termination violates his constitutional rights. Although in his brief he supports this point with the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, neither of which applies here, we will consider whether his Due Process rights under the Fifth Amendment have been violated. They have not. It is true that delay in agency action can become so prolonged as to violate Due Process. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 547 (1985). However, as the Supreme Court has held, a "9-month adjudication is not, of course, unconstitutionally lengthy <span class="Italic">per se."</span> <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Rather, there must be some demonstration that the process was "unreasonably prolonged." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this case the agency explained, and Haver does not deny, that it delayed action for nine months pending resolution of the criminal proceedings connected with the July 11 incident. This was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board noted as to a defense of laches, <span class="Italic">Pinegar v. FEC</span>, 105 MSPR 677, 689 &#x00B6; 25, 2007 MSPB 140 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish the equitable defense of laches, an appellant must prove both that the delay in bringing the action was unreasonable and that he was materially prejudiced by the delay. <span class="Italic">Hidalgo v. Department of Justice</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 645, &#x00B6; 19 (2003). In this case, the agency's delay was only five months, which was not unreasonable, and the appellant has made no showing that his ability to defend against the specification was prejudiced in any manner, much less materially prejudiced. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (the appellant failed to show that the charges were barred by laches where the delay was six months and he failed to allege that his ability to defend himself was prejudiced). Therefore, the appellant has not shown that this specification is barred by the doctrine of laches.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Describing laches in more detail, <span class="Italic">Kolenc v. DHHS</span>, DE-0752-14-0488-I-1 (NP 2/24/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The equitable defense of laches bars an action when an unreasonable or unexcused delay in bringing the action has prejudiced the party against whom the action is taken. <span class="Italic">Pueschel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 422, &#x00B6; 6 (2010); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Carr</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 313, 330 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 185 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The party asserting laches must prove both unreasonable delay and prejudice. <span class="Italic">Pueschel</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 422, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 330. The mere fact that time has elapsed from the date a cause of action first accrued is not sufficient to bar an agency disciplinary action as such a delay does not eliminate the prejudice prong of the laches test. <span class="Italic">Cornetta v. United States</span>, 851 F.2d 1372, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). As to prejudice, there are two types that may stem from the delay in initiating an action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. First, "defense" prejudice may arise by reason of a defendant's inability to present a full and fair defense on the merits due to the loss of records, the death of a witness, or the unreliability of memories of long past events. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The second type, "economic" prejudice, centers on the consequences, primarily monetary, to the Government should the claimant prevail. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Bailey v. United States</span>, 144 Ct. Cl. 720, 722 (1959) (discussing the potential economic prejudice suffered by the Government in an employment dispute). Defense prejudice is at issue in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The conduct that forms the basis of the agency action occurred in the first half of 2011, the agency proposed the removal at issue in January 2014, and the removal was effective in June 2014. Thus, approximately 3 years passed from the time of the conduct to the disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding the doctrine of laches inapplicable, the administrative judge found that the agency proposed the second removal action 4 months after the Board's Opinion and Order reversing the first removal action and thus the delay was not unreasonable. The administrative judge also found that the appellant failed to show "that his ability to defend against the charges was prejudiced in any manner by the delay, much less materially prejudiced." On review, the appellant asserts that the delay in the agency bringing the action should be measured from the time of the conduct that forms the basis of the agency charges. The appellant asserts that the delay is unreasonable, particularly because the agency's "own illegal actions" caused the delay and his "inability to remember and testify about his exact activities on specific days" is understandable in light of the delay, and that he has shown prejudice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not decide whether, in determining the application of the doctrine of laches, the relevant time period is the occurrence of the charged misconduct or the date of the Board's Opinion and Order addressing the first removal action, as the Board has held that a 3-year period from the misconduct that formed the basis for a disciplinary action to initiating the action was not unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 330-31 (finding that it was not unreasonable for the agency to include misconduct that occurred more than 3 years earlier in its disciplinary action); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Santella</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 452, 465-66 (1994) (finding that the Office of Special Counsel's 3-year delay in bringing a disciplinary action was not unreasonable). Furthermore, given the nature of the charged misconduct, the type of evidence presented (including extensive documentary and video evidence), and the reasoning set forth in the initial decision for sustaining the charges, the appellant's conclusory statement on review is insufficient to establish prejudice. Thus, in sum, we find unpersuasive the appellant's claim that the agency's action is barred by the doctrine of laches.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Laches was rejected as a basis to overturn a dismissal based on falsification of preemployment information pertaining to past employment, <span class="Italic">Haight v. DOJ</span>, 277 Fed. Appx. 995, 998 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board properly held that the agency's charges are not barred by laches. To invoke a laches defense, a party has the burden to prove: "1. the plaintiff delayed filing suit for an unreasonable and inexcusable length of time from the time the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known of its claim against the defendant, and 2. the delay operated to the prejudice or injury of the defendant." <span class="Italic">A.C.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board properly held, Mr. Haight did not prove either element of laches. First, Mr. Haight did not show that the agency's "delay" in filing suit was unreasonable or inexcusable. Mr. Haight asserts that the agency knew all it needed to know in 1994 to take action. However, Mr. Wolters testified that he lacked access to Mr. Haight's employment forms in 1994. Until the agency compared Mr. Haight's background with those forms, it was not aware of the conduct that formed the basis for its action. Second, Mr. Haight failed to show that the Board's findings concerning prejudice are unreasonable or unsupported by substantial evidence. Mr. Haight asserts that he was actually prejudiced by the agency's delay in bringing charges because an "exculpatory" 1994 report by Mr. Wolters is now lost, and because of Mr. Wolters' failure to remember details surrounding the 1994 investigation. But nothing that Mr. Wolters could have written in his "exculpatory" report would change the undisputed testimonial and documentary evidence upon which the Board relied when it sustained the charges against Mr. Haight.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Howard v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 680 Fed. Appx. 961, 969 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP), also rejected a laches defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, Mr. Howard contends that the threatening to inflict bodily harm charge should be barred by laches because the threat took place in 2005 and the Air Force did not propose his removal until 2008--a three-year delay.

Bd</span>., No. 2016-1223, 2016 WL 3645106, at *2 (Fed. Cir. July 8, 2016). The AJ disagreed that the delay barred the charge, noting that the Air Force initiated removal proceedings promptly after upper management became aware of Ms. Schneider's allegations, and also found that Mr. Howard was not prejudiced by the delay. We have previously held that a delay of more than three years between the conduct in question and the removal complaint was not unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 185 F.3d 1318, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 1999). We detect no abuse of discretion in the Board's conclusion that a three-year delay here was unreasonable or prejudicial.</p>

USDA</span>, 4 MSPR 555, 556, 5 MSPB 79 (1981), suggested that the balancing approach under <span class="Italic">Heffron v. United States</span>, 405 F.2d 1307 (Ct. Cl. 1969), be adopted: weigh the staleness of the charge against the prejudice to the employee and the necessity for the delay. The appeal was remanded to the AJ to consider whether the employee had been prejudiced by the delay. The Board did not specifically instruct the AJ to consider on remand the necessity for the delay in bringing the charges. The inclusion of past misconduct adversely affects an appellant's rights if the appellant shows that he cannot defend the allegations because of the lapse of time. <span class="Italic">Deatrick v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 10 MSPR 262, 267 (1982). If an employee is to show prejudice, some specific suggestions should be provided as to what he might have been able to show or how his defense would have been improved had the adverse action been sooner proposed. <span class="Italic">Smith v.

<p class="Body-Text">The problem of stale charges was treated in <span class="Italic">Woody v. GSA</span>, 6 MSPR 486, 6 MSPB 410 (1981), a vehicle misuse case. The Board reaffirmed that the taking of a stale action is prohibited if there is actual prejudice to the employee.

On appeal, <span class="Italic">Shaw v. USPS</span>, 697 F.2d 1078, 1080-81 (Fed. Cir. 1983), concluded that to show that an adverse action should be reversed because of delay in bringing the action, the appellant must establish that the delay caused demonstrable harm in his presentation of the defense. The court also noted with approval the agency explanation that the delay (two months) was caused by internal reporting and investigation of the incident. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Devine v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Wilkes v. VA</span>, 6 MSPR 732, 754, 6 MSPB 611 (1981), misconduct that occurred in 1975 came to the attention of the agency inspector general in 1978 and led to removal. The Board sustained the charges; the appellant demonstrated no prejudice by the delay. The Board did not determine whether the agency could have reasonably discovered the misconduct earlier. Inclusion of old incidents in an adverse action did not render the action stale if those older incidents, connected with more recent incidents, indicated a pattern of misconduct. <span class="Italic">Law v. IRS</span>, 5 MSPR 141, 145 n.5, 5 MSPB 203 (1981), decided that a two-year delay in bringing charges against the employee was not harmful error. The delay was caused by procedural difficulties occasioned by the Board's treatment of another case. The appellant could not demonstrate that he was prejudiced in responding to the charge because of the delay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A two-year delay in proceeding on the basis of evidence publicly available in records of a criminal proceeding was not error without a showing by the appellant of some detriment to appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">Alshouse v.

A four-year delay in the initiation of a nepotism case was excused in <span class="Italic">Rentz v. USPS</span>, 19 MSPR 35, 39 (1984). A three-year delay was no cause for concern in <span class="Italic">Mauro v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 86, 94 (1987). Appellant failed to show how he was harmed by the delay.

<p class="Body-Text">The defense of laches, involving several years between the operative events and an OSC disciplinary case, was rejected in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Santella</span>, 65 MSPR 452, 465-66 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In their exceptions to the recommended decision, the respondents reiterate their argument that laches bars the fourth charge against them (i.e., the charge related to Mr. Ecola's performance rating). Laches is an equitable defense that bars an action when an unreasonable delay in bringing the action has prejudiced the person against whom the action is taken<span class="Italic">. Hoover v. Department of the Navy</span>, 957 F.2d 861, 863 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The party asserting laches must prove both unreasonable delay and prejudice<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the respondents note that the rating was given in 1985. They also assert that it was not until 1988 that Mr. Ecola complained about it to the Office of the Special Counsel, and that it was not until May 1990 that the Special Counsel brought this action. Accordingly, they contend that there was an unreasonable and inexcusable delay in bringing the instant action and that this has severely handicapped their ability to defend against the charge related to this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The traditional rule is that laches generally does not bar actions brought by the United States<span class="Italic">. Costello v. United States</span>, 365 U.S. 265, 281 (1961). Furthermore, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that this defense applies here, the respondents have not shown unreasonable delay. There is no statutory time limit that governs Special Counsel disciplinary actions<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215. Even if we were to refer to a general statute of limitations for <span id="Page_3154"></span>guidance in determining whether the delay here is reasonable, the 3-year period between the time the Special Counsel learned of possible prohibited personnel practices and the time this action was initiated is not unreasonable. Because the respondents have not shown unreasonable delay, we need not determine whether they were prejudiced in their ability to defend this action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Carr</span>, 78 MSPR 313, 330-31 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Carr v. SSA</span>, 185 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">post</span>, provided a detailed analysis of a laches defense asserted in disciplinary proceedings against an ALJ by an agency that waited to take action to determine if the ALJ's actions reflected a pattern of undesirable behavior:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent alleges that the petitioner unduly delayed, i.e., was guilty of laches, in bringing some of the charges. Some of the charges and specifications in the June 20, 1994 complaint were based on incidents which occurred beginning in 1991. The respondent argues that her ability to refute those charges and specifications was prejudiced by the delay because none of the witnesses, including the respondent, could recall in exact detail the incident in question. She further asserts that she was more prejudiced than the petitioner by the delay because the petitioner sought written statements from the participants and witnesses to the incidents closer in time to their occurrence. The respondent was unable to do likewise because she was unaware that the petitioner was investigating and documenting these incidents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The equitable defense of laches bars an action when an unreasonable delay in bringing the action has prejudiced the person against whom the action is taken. <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Department of the Navy,</span> 957 F.2d 861, 863 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Santella,</span> 65 MSPR 452, 465 (1994). The party asserting laches must prove both unreasonable delay and prejudice. <span class="Italic">Hoover</span>, 957 F.2d at 863; <span class="Italic">Santella,</span> 65 MSPR at 465. In <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, the Board found that a three-year delay from the time that the Special Counsel learned of the possible prohibited personnel practices and the time it initiated an action against the petitioners in that case was not unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, 65 MSPR at 465-66. Here, the earliest misconduct on which a charge was based, specification 20, occurred in January 1991, and the removal complaint was filed in June 1994, almost 3 and one-half years later....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its post-hearing reply brief, the petitioner argued that the older incidents, when connected with more recent incidents, indicated a pattern of misconduct. We see nothing improper in the petitioner's actions here. An agency need not impose discipline for an individual act of misconduct as it occurs, but may determine that a pattern of behavior warrants discipline. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Scott v. Department of Justice,</span> 69 MSPR 211, 229-30 (1995) (the Board sustained a charge that the appellant engaged in a pattern of behavior evidencing a lack of trustworthiness, integrity, and honesty supported by 4 specifications), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 99 F.3d 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). We find that, under the circumstances, the petitioner's delay was not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor has the respondent shown that she was prejudiced by the delay. She asserts that prejudice resulted from the fading of the memory of the participants. Our review of the evidence in support of the specifications shows otherwise. The respondent admitted to using the offensive language as alleged in specifications 10, 11, and 12 of charge 3, language that is commonly considered to be vulgar. The respondent did not testify that she had difficulty recalling any of these incidents. Specification 14 charges the respondent with using similar language, which she denied. The CALJ sustained the specification based on the testimony of Harris-Gonzalez and a January 10, 1992 memorandum prepared by Harris-Gonzalez. The CALJ found that the respondent's denial of the misconduct was not credible. She testified that she "didn't use that kind of language," but she admitted to using the same vulgar and profane words on other occasions. The respondent did not indicate in her testimony that she did not recall the incidents or what she said.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of several years of delay between a background investigation and adverse action, <span class="Italic">Terry v. USDA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210408105">856 Fed. Appx. 283</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Terry argues that he suffers from memory loss and PTSD due to injuries incurred while he was in military service. For that reason, he contends, the agency's unreasonable delay in proposing his removal prejudiced him, as he had no recollection of certain matters that occurred several years earlier.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the delay was not so lengthy as to prejudice Mr. Terry. Mr. Terry's argument to the contrary is not convincing. While a delay such as the one in this case might be problematic if the case turned on small details that could reasonably slip from an employee's memory over a period of that length, it is not reasonable to suppose that such a delay would lead to a loss of memory regarding matters such as whether the person had been fired from a job....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Villareal v. Bureau of Prisons</span>, 901 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (several years between the onset of an investigation and an adverse action decisions did not invalid the action; no assertion of prejudice before an arbitrator); <span class="Italic">Carr v. SSA</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (as to a delay of several years between charges against an ALJ and some underlying incidents: "The delay was not unreasonable, as the termination was based on a pattern of behavior.... The delay was not prejudicial, as Ms. Carr did not have difficulty remembering many of the incidents identified in the specifications and, indeed, admitted to many of them."); <span class="Italic">Hidalgo v. DOJ</span>, 93 MSPR 645, 655 &#x00B6; 19 (2003) (six month delay in the initiation of a proposal was neither unreasonable nor prejudicial; an explanation was provided for the delay that was challenged as a violation of a contractual provision calling for issuance of proposed adverse action at the earliest practical date after the commission of an offense known to the employer); <span class="Italic">Salter v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 92 MSPR 355, 359 &#x00B6; 10 (2002) (party asserting laches must prove both unreasonable delay and prejudice); <span class="Italic">Messersmith v. GSA</span>, 9 MSPR 150, 155 (1981) (delay of five months, violating an agency regulation governing the issuance of charges after the completion of an investigation, was not harmful error warranting the reversal of adverse action; there was no proof of harm caused by the delay).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once in a while a laches defense rolls along that causes the Board pause. A delay of two-and-one-half years in bringing charges severely prejudiced the appellant's rights when there was no legitimate excuse for the delay, the delay caused the agency to be unable to produce potentially exculpatory evidence, the delay was contrary to agency internal regulations, and despite the delay the misconduct was charged without competent investigation by either the agency's proposing or deciding officials. <span class="Italic">Aubrey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 65, 66 (1985) (counsel fee decision). The Board considered staleness of charges in a reinstatement eligibility case, <span class="Italic">Thompson v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 228, 236-37, 5 MSPB 274 (1981), and guidance was provided to agencies concerning their discretion to refuse to reemploy individuals who recover from work-related injuries. If an agency concludes that a former employee entitled to priority consideration is disqualified for reemployment, the agency must be prepared to support that conclusion by a preponderance of the evidence should the employee appeal to the Board from denial of priority consideration. 5 CFR 302.501 (2022). Disqualifying reasons permitting an agency to decline reinstatement to an employee are set out at 5 CFR 302.203 (2022) and include, among others, dismissal from employment for delinquency or misconduct, false statements, and deception. Agencies are permitted to establish additional disqualifying reasons. The Board concluded that unsatisfactory service could be deemed a proper disqualifying factor if it was the kind of work-related behavior that would warrant disciplinary action. The agency must have taken, or not had sufficient time to take, reasonably prompt action against the behavior, however, and the behavior warranting disciplinary action must have occurred not long before the date the former employee began receiving disability compensation to indicate that the former employee had not reformed or improved his or her behavior. The case was remanded to the AJ for further consideration. Through this decision, the Board recognized that if charges are old, their value as corrective discipline is limited, particularly by intervening good behavior of the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wright v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 242, 245, 5 MSPB 285 (1981). The Board has not applied this reasoning to an adverse action appeal.</p>
