<h5 class="h5" id="sec11-123"><span class="space">a.</span> Deciding Official</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will consider whether the deciding official acted with termination authority or with the knowledge and approval of an official with termination authority. If an agency does not act pursuant to its statutory or delegated authority in removing an individual, the removal may be <span class="Italic">ultra vires</span> and not in accordance with the law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCollum v. NCUA</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1265794.html"> 417 F.3d 1332</a>, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (complex fact pattern concerning whether the employee was removed or voluntarily retired: "Where the agency has not acted, an employee's removal <span id="Page_3307"></span>cannot be in accordance with law. The fact that NCUA has not removed McCollum is not a mere procedural defect. Instead, the removal decision itself does not exist. Because NCUA did not remove McCollum, his removal was not in accordance with law." (citing <span class="Italic">Hamilton,</span> <span class="Italic">post</span>)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency properly delegates decisional authority <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210812139">8 F.4th 1290</a>, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2021):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Contrary to Mr. Rodriguez's argument, however, the Constitution permits principal officers to delegate duties and functions to other officers and employees, <span class="Italic">see Touby v. United States</span>, 500 U.S. 160, 169 (1991), and the Secretary's delegation of removal and disciplinary authority to the head of a DVA medical center is a lawful delegation, <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 512(a). Thus, there is no merit to Mr. Rodriguez's contention that it is somehow improper for the Board to defer (by dint of the substantial evidence standard) to removal decisions by agency employees other than the Secretary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span> said of an Appointments Clause challenge, 8 F.4th 1306-08:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Mr. Rodriguez argues that the authority to affirm or overturn a removal decision by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs can be granted only to officers of the United States, i.e., the members of the Merit Systems Protection Board. He argues that section 714 violates that principle by imposing a "substantial evidence" standard of review on the Board and stripping the Board of its authority to review agency penalty decisions, thereby making the deciding official's decision effectively unreviewable. The result, he contends, is that members of the Board, who are principal officers of the United States, are forced "to rubber stamp decisions by mere employees and/or inferior officers that they believe are wrongly decided."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are four problems with that argument. First and foremost, Mr. Rodriguez's argument misapprehends the purpose underlying the Appointments Clause. That Clause is designed to prevent unappointed officials from wielding too much authority. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Arthrex, Inc</span>., 141 S. Ct. 1970, 1979 (2021) (The power exercised by officers of the United States "acquires its legitimacy and accountability to the public through a clear and effective chain of command down from the President, on whom all the people vote." (internal quotation marks omitted)); <span class="Italic">Fin. Oversight &#x0026; Mgmt. Bd. for P.R. v. Aurelius Inv</span>., LLC, 140 S. Ct. 1649, 1657 (2020) ("[T]he Appointments Clause helps to preserve democratic accountability."). The Clause was not intended to protect appointed officials from congressionally mandated changes to their statutory responsibilities (particularly in a case such as this one involving responsibilities that Congress conferred on the Board in the first place). Congress's decision to alter the standard of review of adverse actions by the DVA does not violate the Appointments Clause unless it results in an unappointed official, such as the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Helman</span>, exercising powers that may be exercised only by officers of the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there was no unappointed official exercising such powers. While Ms. Klinker was not appointed by the President and thus is not a principal officer, she exercises authority to discipline DVA employees, such as Mr. Rodriguez, pursuant to her delegation from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as noted above. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Telecom Ass'n v. FCC</span>, 359 F.3d 554, 565 (D.C. Cir. 2004) ("When a statute delegates authority to a federal officer or agency, subdelegation to a subordinate federal officer or agency is presumptively permissible absent affirmative evidence of a contrary congressional intent.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Deciding officials such as Ms. Klinker routinely exercise delegated authority to make disciplinary decisions in individual cases, regardless of their status as officers or employees, without being found to have acted in violation of the Appointments Clause. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hardy v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 13 F.3d 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. United States</span>, 225 Ct. Cl. 542, 543 (1980); <span class="Italic">Monahan v. United States</span>, 354 F.2d 306 (Ct. Cl. 1966). The authority to issue instructions to subordinates and to discipline subordinates for failing to follow those instructions is inherent in the role of any supervisor. Mr. Rodriguez cites no authority and makes no argument as to why the imposition of disciplinary sanctions against individual employees constitutes the exercise of authority that may be wielded only by a principal or inferior officer of the United States, and we decline to so hold.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mr. Rodriguez overstates the extent to which section 714 reduces the Board's authority in reviewing disciplinary actions. As we initially stated in Sayers and reiterate today, while section 714 withdraws from the Board the authority to mitigate penalties by substituting penalties for those chosen by the agency, it does not prevent the Board from reviewing penalty decisions and requiring the agency to reconsider penalty decisions in appropriate cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, the limitations on the scope of review exercised by the Board do not leave deciding officials with unchecked authority to make disciplinary decisions. As noted above, the substantial evidence test has long been applied by the Board when reviewing decisions of agency deciding officials under chapter 43 of Title 5. Yet that standard of review has never been considered to create an Appointments Clause issue in those cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fourth, Mr. Rodriguez has made no showing in this case as to whether Ms. Klinker, the deciding official, was appointed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or instead by some subordinate official. If she was appointed by the Secretary, her appointment would qualify her to serve as an inferior officer under the Appointments Clause. By statute, the director of a DVA medical center is appointed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(4). That is relevant because Mr. Rodriguez does not argue that disciplinary actions can be imposed only by principal officers of the United States, and he does not argue that Ms. Klinker fails to qualify as an inferior officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is therefore no record before us on which we could find an Appointments Clause violation in this case even if we were to assume that disciplinary authority may be exercised only by principal or inferior officers of the United States.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hamilton v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 486, 488-89 (1993), considered the peculiar situation of an adverse decision signed by a deciding official several days after he retired. The action was contrary to law:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency action that is not in accordance with law may not be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C); <span class="Italic">Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 MSPR 634, 639 (1992). An appealable action is unlawful in its entirety if there is no legal authority for it, and the Board will reverse it as "not in accordance with law," even if minimum constitutional due process was afforded to the appellant and he has not shown harmful error, i.e., that the alleged error prejudiced his rights so that the outcome before the agency was possibly affected. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 683-84 (1991), citing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, <span class="Italic">Handy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 754 F.2d 335, 337-38 (Fed. Cir. 1985), and <span class="Italic">Baracco v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 MSPR 112, 120 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 735 F.2d 488 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 469 U.S. 1018, 105 S. Ct. 432, 83 L. Ed.2d 358 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 52 MSPR at 640.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, we find that the agency's demotion action is illegal in its entirety because, at the time the deciding official issued the final decision demoting the appellant, she was no longer an agency employee and had no legal authority to demote him. Under 5 USC 7513, it is the "agency" that is authorized to take an adverse action against an employee subject to prescribed procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 5 CFR 752.404(a)-(h). Under 5 CFR 752.404(e)(2), "[T]he agency shall designate an official to hear the employee's oral answer who has authority either to make or recommend a final decision on the proposed adverse action." There is nothing in the applicable statute or regulations that authorizes the agency to designate an individual other than an agency official to make or recommend a final decision on a proposed adverse action or that confers such decision-making authority to taking an adverse action against upon such an individual. Here, the deciding official retired from the agency on October 2, 1992, but she signed the demotion decision letter on October 6, 1992, 4 days after she retired. While, in the present case, it is undisputed that the deciding official had the authority to issue the final decision while she was employed with the agency, she had no authority to do so after she was no longer an agency employee. Further, there is no indication in this appeal that the agency duly designated another agency official to ratify her ultra vires decision. Therefore, we find that the deciding official's action was unlawful in its entirety and must be reversed.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">An unauthorized removal was reversed in <span class="Italic">Litton v. DOJ,</span> DA-0752-10-0388-I-1 (NP 8/1/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency reduced the appellant in grade from Facilities Manager, GS-12, to Maintenance Worker Supervisor, WS-8, and reassigned her. The appellant appealed the agency's action. Based on the record developed by the parties, including the testimony at the hearing held on August 13, 2010, the administrative judge reversed the agency's action. She found that the agency's issuance of a proposed removal purporting to be from Adolfo Cordero but signed by someone else without Cordero's permission or knowledge was an ultra vires act rendering the action not in accordance with law and requiring reversal of the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency argues that the administrative judge erred in failing to determine whether issuance of the proposal to demote and reassign the appellant under Cordero's name without his knowledge or permission constituted harmful error. However, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency's action was ultra vires and thus not in accordance with law. An appealable action that is not in accordance with law must be reversed in its entirety even if minimum constitutional due process was afforded to an appellant and he has not shown harmful error under statute. <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 683 (1991). The administrative judge did not err in reversing the action without determining whether the agency committed harmful error.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vandewall v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 55 MSPR 561, 564 (1992), analogized termination authority to appointment authority and noted that approval of an SF-52 or SF-50 is not always necessary for a personnel action to occur:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly found, Mr. Goldstein had the authority to terminate the appellant based on his finding that Goldstein's action had the prior approval of Mr. Robinson, an official with general termination authority. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan (NTEU)</span>, 663 F.2d 239, 247 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (the power to remove is inherent in the power to appoint). We find the following principles, generally used to determine if an appointment has taken place, also to be applicable in termination situations. As recognized in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, approval of the SF-52 or SF-50 is not always necessary for a personnel action to take place<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 243. Nor does its absence signal with certainty that a personnel action has not transpired<span class="Italic">. See Scott v. Department of the Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 282, 287 (1981). Moreover, for an appointment to be effective, the notification letter to the appointee need not be signed by an official with appointing authority, so long as it was approved by such an official before it was sent<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 246 n.9. <span class="Italic">Cf. Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687, 693 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span> is not inconsistent with cases requiring a formal writing for appointment because, although no SF-50 or SF-52 was used there, an unequivocal selection letter was sent with knowledge of official appointing authority).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, an unequivocal termination letter was issued to the appellant on October 6, 1989, with the knowledge and approval of an official with termination authority. Applying the above-stated principles, we find that, in this instance, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant's termination was effected on October 6, 1989. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's termination occurred during her probationary period, and thus that the Board has no jurisdiction over her appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Calhoun states that she was deprived of a "meaningful reply" because Col. Sanborn lacked the authority to review and act on her budget proposals. The Board found that Col. Sanborn's authority as a deciding official was limited to determining whether Ms. Calhoun was within one of the DOD prescribed categories of exempted employees and whether a reduction in her furlough hours was necessary to the agency's mission. While a deciding official must possess authority to take or recommend action, due process does not require "unfettered discretion to take any action he or she believes is appropriate" or require "consider[ation of] alternatives that are prohibited, impracticable, or outside of management's purview." <span class="Italic">Rodgers v.
