<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-116"><span class="space">a.</span> Cancelation of Action Appealed</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appealable action is canceled, the appeal that arose out of the action is dismissed by the AJ for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Curtis v. VA</span>, 19 MSPR 519, 520 (1984) (appeal was moot when an adverse action was canceled through a settlement before the issuance of the initial decision); <span class="Italic">Hunt v. TVA</span>, 18 MSPR 470, 471-72 (1983) (citing <span class="Italic">Hatler v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 3 MSPR 322, 324-25, 3 MSPB 406 (1980)). "[T]he desirability of an adjudicatory determination of important questions, standing alone, does not prevent a case from being dismissed as moot." <span class="Italic">Hatler v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 3 MSPR 322, 325 (1980) (overruled as to the ability of a party to file a petition for enforcement after an appeal was dismissed as moot, <span class="Italic">Haskins v. Dept. of Navy,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HASKINS_BETTY_J_AT_3443_06_0730_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_289996.pdf">106 MSPR 616</a>, 2007 MSPB 234 (2007)). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Stivers v. USPS</span>, <span id="Page_1024"></span>9 MSPR 346, 347 (1981) (indirectly suggesting that if an agency immediately reissues the action and the case is "pending" as a result of a PFR from the initial decision closing out the first action, the Board retains jurisdiction rather requiring another appeal if the employee complains of the reissuance of the action in his PFR). A retroactive pay correction--following a reassignment and prior to the initiation of an appeal--leaves the appellant with no appealable action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burkwist v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 27 MSPR 419, 420 (1985) (base-pay problems were corrected following a reassignment; the Board declined jurisdiction over an alleged pay reduction resulting from the inability to secure pay shift differentials and from increased health insurance costs); <span class="italic">cf</span>. <span class="italic">Todd v. VA</span>, DE-0752-16-0409-I-1 (NP 2/10/2023) (when agency action was canceled for lack of due process, harmful error claim was moot).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the appeal to be dismissed as moot, the agency's rescission of the appealed action must be complete. The employee must be returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> and not left in a worse position because of the cancelation than were the matter adjudicated. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> 96 MSPR 193, 195-96 &#x00B6; 5 (2004). <span class="Italic">Currier v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 191, 197 (1996), determined that an unresolved claim for compensatory damages for EEO claims avoids a mootness dismissal for full relief when the agency cancels an appealed action if an EEO affirmative defense claim remains viable, i.e., if it is not settled or withdrawn.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fernandez v. DOJ</span>, 105 MSPR 443, 446 &#x00B6; 5, 2007 MSPB 99 (2007), describes how an AJ is to assess whether restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> renders an action moot following its cancelation by the agency--the AJ must determine if the employee received all the relief that he could receive had the matter been favorably adjudicated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An agency's unilateral modification of its action after an appeal has been filed cannot divest the Board of jurisdiction unless the appellant consents to such divesture or the agency completely rescinds the action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, the Board may dismiss an appeal as moot if the appealed action is canceled or rescinded by the agency. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 193, &#x00B6; 5 (2004). For the appeal to be deemed moot, however, the employee must have received all of the relief that he could have received "if the matter had been adjudicated and he had prevailed." <span class="Italic">Harris v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In some decisions, the Board has said that an appeal is moot if, after cancellation of the action under appeal, the employee has been placed in the position he would have been in if the action had "never occurred." <span class="Italic">E.g., Henry v.

These decisions and others that frame the test for mootness in this way are OVERRULED because the correct focus is on whether there is any relief that the appellant could receive if the Board ruled in his favor. <span class="Italic">See Church of Scientology of California v.

Because the record is insufficient to establish that the appeal is moot, a remand is necessary.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ordinarily the concern is the effect on the appeal of the agency's cancelation of the action appealed. The same result may occur if the action is canceled before appeal to the Board, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 494, 498 (1997), or following the action of another adjudicator, e.g., a labor arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mackelprang v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 23, 25-26 (1991) (employee grieved and filed an EEO complaint concerning removal; the arbitrator ordered the removal canceled and the agency complied; the appellant filed with the Board after receiving the final agency EEO decision; there was no Board jurisdiction since the appealable action was rescinded before the Board appeal was filed); <span class="Italic">Gaines v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 594, 597 (1990) (agency reduced the removal to a 14-day suspension prior to the appeal and following the appellant's use of a grievance procedure); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Cantrell v. DHHS</span>, 55 MSPR 600, 603 (1992) (because an arbitrator's decision provided full relief to the appellant from the removal, there was no longer a live controversy for the Board; the remaining EEO allegations would have to be processed as a nonmixed case before EEOC); <span class="Italic">Roja v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 53 MSPR 326, 328 (1992) (on appeal to the Board from the agency's cancelation of an EEO complaint following the appellant's refusal of full relief, the agency's complete rescission of the adverse action left the Board without jurisdiction to consider the appellant's allegations of discrimination and reprisal). "The Board lacks jurisdiction over an appeal when an otherwise appealable action has been rescinded before a Board appeal is filed, regardless of whether the rescission has occurred before or after a formal EEO complaint is filed with the agency." <span class="Italic">Martin v. USPS</span>, 101 MSPR 634, 636 n.1, 2006 MSPB 112 (2006).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Application of the mootness doctrine is illustrated by <span class="Italic">Codrington v. DOJ</span>, 1 MSPR 333, 1 MSPB 321 (1980). Appellant was removed and appealed, contending that he was not a probationer. The agency decided that the employee was correct and reinstated him to a tenured position. Because the agency did not inform the AJ of its action, the AJ ordered the agency to cancel the separation and restore the employee. The Board reopened the case, dismissing the appeal. Citing <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Blount</span>, 336 F. Supp. 1271 (D.D.C. 1971), the Board concluded that because the employee was restored to duty with back pay, the relief sought was moot. <span class="Italic">Codrington,</span> 1 MSPR at 335. There was no chance that the employee would again be treated as a probationer. In <span class="Italic">Slocum v. USPS</span>, 107 MSPR 129, 2007 MSPB 253 (2007), the appeal was from what the appellant contended was a suspension resulting from enforced leave. After the appeal was filed, the agency retroactively placed Slocum on administrative leave for all but 14 days. The appeal was not moot. Jurisdiction was determined based on the facts when the appeal was filed, and when the appeal was filed, the appellant was in a nonpay status of more than 14 days (permitting him to appeal that status as an adverse action). Additionally, the agency had not demonstrated that it removed all references to the appellant's placement in a nonduty status from Slocum's personnel file. [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-22-001.html#sec15-1">Chapter 15</a> for the effect of an agency's cancelation of an appealable action upon the ability of an appellant to secure an award of counsel fees.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a constructive adverse action case resulting from a retirement challenged as the product of misleading information, the cancelation of the retirement following the initiation of the appeal will not moot the appeal if the appellant lost pay (and has a resultant constructive suspension appeal), <span class="Italic">Chichowski v. FEMA</span>, 72 MSPR 474, 477-78 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge found under <span class="Italic">Himmel v. Department of Justice</span>, 6 MSPB 408, 6 MSPR 484 (1981), that there was no appealable action because the appellant's retirement was canceled at the time of his appeal. We grant the appellant's petition for review to decide whether <span class="Italic">Himmel</span> controls. We conclude that it does not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rule set forth in <span class="Italic">Himmel</span> is clearly designed to prevent the divestiture of Board jurisdiction through post-appeal manipulation of facts. That is not the case here. Rather, in this appeal, OPM's disallowance of the retirement application was the first notice the appellant received that the agency may have provided him with misinformation. Applying the <span class="Italic">Himmel</span> rule in such circumstances would mean that an alleged involuntary retirement of the type at issue here, i.e., alleged detrimental reliance on purported agency misinformation, would never come within the Board's jurisdiction. This would be so because the disallowance of the retirement application and the ordering of his restoration, while giving the appellant notice of the involuntariness issue, would at the same time invariably divest the Board of jurisdiction based on a finding that the retirement had been canceled. The <span class="Italic">Himmel</span> rule does not require the creation of such a "Catch 22" for appellants, and we decline to so extend it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Application of the <span class="Italic">Himmel</span> rule under the circumstances of this case is also contrary to Board precedent regarding involuntary retirements. In <span class="Italic">Bannister</span>, the appellant submitted, on the basis of agency misinformation, an application for retirement benefits to be effective September 2, 1986. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 MSPR at 364-67. OPM denied the application and the agency retroactively restored the appellant to its rolls, placed <span id="Page_1025"></span>him on LWOP status from September 3, 1986, until April 30, 1987, and made his retirement effective April 30, 1987. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 364. The appellant filed an appeal with the Board on August 19, 1988, alleging that the agency's actions in retiring him on September 2, 1986, and placing him on LWOP status until April 30, 1987, were involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 365.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in <span class="Italic">Bannister</span> was retired at the time he filed his appeal with the Board, and his appeal was untimely filed, i.e., it was filed well beyond the time limit for appealing the allegedly involuntary retirement of September 2, 1986, and the subsequent LWOP action<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 368. If the appellant in <span class="Italic">Bannister</span> had timely filed his appeal, however, he would have been in the same situation as the appellant here, namely, he would not have been retired at the time of filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bannister</span>, the Board found good cause for the delay in filing and found on the merits that the retirement was involuntary and the LWOP was a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 368-69. Neither the cancellation of the retirement from September 2, 1986, through April 30, 1987, during the time limit for filing an appeal, nor the appellant's status of being retired when he filed the late appeal was a factor on which the Board relied in deciding the jurisdictional issue. Similarly, we find those considerations should not be factors in determining the jurisdictional issue in this appeal. Thus, we conclude that even though the appellant's retirement had been canceled at the time he filed his appeal, this fact does not divest the Board of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jankowski v. USDA</span>, 63 MSPR 596, 598-99 (1994), concluded that jurisdiction over a constructive adverse action was not defeated by a subsequently-granted retirement retroactive to a date before the contested resignation: "As long as the action was effected prior to the grant of retirement by OPM, the Board would have jurisdiction over an appeal of that action regardless of the effective date of the retirement."
