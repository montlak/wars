<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-96"><span class="space">3.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Stone</span></span>; Broadened Due Process Test; Clarifying or Cumulative Information</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Refining and redefining the law from the Court of Claims, the Federal Circuit reentered the field to offer a straightforward due process test. Under <span class="Italic">Stone v. FDIC</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1371-78 (Fed. Cir. 1999), to vitiate the disciplinary process, <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts with the deciding official must "introduce new and material information to the deciding official." Factors bearing on the materiality of the new information include "whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces 'cumulative' information or new information; whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it; and whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Stone was employed as a GS-12 bank examiner in the FDIC's Division of Supervision, Englewood, Colorado. Mr. Stone submitted applications for approved leave using Standard Form 71s on four occasions. He admitted that he signed these forms with the names of doctors who were purportedly excusing the absences that he requested.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FDIC decided to begin removal proceedings against Mr. Stone for the submission of false requests for leave....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After considering Mr. Stone's case, the deciding official recommended removal and Mr. Stone's employment with the FDIC was thereafter terminated under Chapter 75 of Title 5 of the United States Code. After his removal and the filing of his appeal to the Board, Mr. Stone made a second request for relevant documents. In response to this request, Mr. Stone discovered that an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> memorandum from the official recommending his dismissal (the "proposing official") had been sent to the deciding official. Mr. Stone also discovered that the deciding official received a second <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> memorandum from another FDIC official urging Mr. Stone's removal. In an affidavit, the deciding official stated that he would have concluded that Mr. Stone should be removed whether or not he had seen the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> memo from the proposing official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Stone's federal constitutional due process claim depends on his having a property right in continued employment. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 538 (1985); <span class="Italic">Board of Regents v. Roth</span>, 408 U.S. 564, 576-578 (1972). "The Fourteenth Amendment's procedural protection of property is a safeguard of the security of interests that a person has already acquired in specific benefits." <span class="Italic">Roth</span>, 408 U.S. at 576. These property interests come in a variety of forms, including public employment<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. If Mr. Stone does possess such a property interest, then the government cannot deprive him of this property without due process<span class="Italic">. See Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 538.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Property interests are not created by the Constitution; "they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source [such as a statute]...." <span class="Italic">Roth</span>, 408 U.S. at 577. "To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the government gives a public employee assurances of continued employment or conditions dismissal only for specific reasons, the public employee has a property interest in continued employment<span class="Italic">. See Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 538 (finding that Ohio statute providing that public employee was entitled to retain position for good behavior and efficient service and conditioning dismissal on showing of malfeasance or nonfeasance created a property interest in continued employment); <span class="Italic">Connell v. Higginbotham</span>, 403 U.S. 207 (1971) (public teacher hired without tenure or formal contract, but with clearly implied <span id="Page_3248"></span>promise of continued employment, had property interest); <span class="Italic">Slochower v. Board of Educ.</span>, 350 U.S. 551 (1956) (public college professor dismissed from office held under tenure provisions had a property interest in continued employment); <span class="Italic">Wieman v. Updegraff</span>, 344 U.S. 183 (1952) (public college professors and staff members dismissed during terms of their contracts had property interests in continued employment); <span class="Italic">see also Perry v. Sindermann</span>, 408 U.S. 593 (1972) (public professor would have protectible interest if college had a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> tenure program and professor had tenure under this program).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, if the public employee is hired for a limited appointment or is at will, then the employee does not have a property interest in continued employment<span class="Italic">. See Roth</span>, 408 U.S. at 578 (where public employee was explicitly appointed for only one year, employee had no property interest in continued employment; employee was not entitled to contract renewal and no statute or policy secured an interest in re-employment); <span class="Italic">Bishop v. Wood</span>, 426 U.S. 341, 346-47 (1976) (statute created at will employment relationship, as interpreted by relevant state courts, and therefore public employee did not have property interest in continued employment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the federal statutory employment scheme plainly creates a property interest in continued employment. Mr. Stone was a civil service employee who could not be dismissed except for cause or unacceptable performance<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC 7513 (a) (1994) (agency may take an action against an employee only for such cause as will promote efficiency of the service); 5 USC 4303 (1994) (agency may reduce in grade or remove an employee for unacceptable performance). The statute therefore entitled Mr. Stone to continue in his position unless the agency could show he needed to be removed for cause or unacceptable performance. Mr. Stone was not an at will employee or hired for a limited term. As this Court has explained previously, "an employee, as defined by 5 USC 7501, has a property right in his continued employment." <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 661 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next question we face is what process is due Mr. Stone before he can be deprived of his property interest. We begin by noting that his property interest is not defined by, or conditioned on, Congress' choice of procedures for its deprivation<span class="Italic">. See Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 541. In other words, 7513 and 4303 do not provide the final limit on the procedures the agency must follow in removing Mr. Stone. Procedural due process requires "that certain substantive rights--life, liberty, and property--cannot be deprived except pursuant to constitutionally adequate procedures." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Congress need not confer a property interest in public employment. However, once it does confer such an interest, it may not remove it without constitutional safeguards<span class="Italic">. See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The process due a public employee prior to removal from office has been explained in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>. The Supreme Court has stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An essential principle of due process is that a deprivation of life, liberty, or property "be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case."... This principle requires "some kind of hearing" prior to the discharge of an employee who has a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he pretermination hearing need not definitively resolve the propriety of the discharge. It should be an initial check against mistaken decisions--essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The essential requirements of due process...are notice and an opportunity to respond. The opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement.... The tenured employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.... To require more than this prior to termination would intrude to an unwarranted extent on the government's interest in quickly removing an unsatisfactory employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 542-46 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court expressly noted that the need for a meaningful opportunity for the public employee to present his or her side of the case is important in enabling the agency to reach an accurate result for two reasons. First, dismissals for cause will often involve factual disputes and consideration of the employee's response may help clarify such disputes. In addition, even if the facts are clear, "the appropriateness or necessity of the discharge may not be; in such cases, the only meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the decisionmaker is likely to be before the termination takes effect." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 543.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The introduction of new and material information by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications to the deciding official undermines the public employee's constitutional due process guarantee of notice (both of the charges and of the employer's evidence) and the opportunity to respond. When deciding officials receive such <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, employees are no longer on notice of the reasons for their dismissal and/or the evidence relied upon by the agency. Procedural due process guarantees are not met if the employee has notice only of certain charges or portions of the evidence and the deciding official considers new and material information.[4] It is constitutionally impermissible to allow a deciding official to receive additional material information that may undermine the objectivity required to protect the fairness of the process. Our system is premised on the procedural fairness at each stage of the removal proceedings. An employee is entitled to a certain amount of due process rights at each stage and, when these rights are undermined, the employee is entitled to relief regardless of the stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Our analysis is not in conflict with our prior cases, <span class="Italic">Depte v. United States</span>, 715 F.2d 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1983) and <span class="Italic">Grover v. United States</span>, 200 Ct. Cl. 337 (1973). Those two cases contained language to the effect that pre-hearing <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were permissible<span class="Italic">. See Depte</span>, 715 F.2d at 1484 and <span class="Italic">Grover</span>, 200 Ct. Cl. at 350. Those cases, however, were decided prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, which delineated an employee's due process rights with respect to pre-hearing terminations. To the extent <span class="Italic">Depte</span> and <span class="Italic">Grover</span> are inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, they can no longer serve as binding precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is a procedural defect so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that it undermines the due process guarantee and entitles the claimant to an entirely new administrative proceeding. Only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official will violate the due process guarantee of notice. In deciding whether new and material information has been introduced by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts, the Board should consider the facts and circumstances of each particular case. Among the factors that will be useful for the Board to weigh are: whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces "cumulative" information or new information; whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it; and whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. Ultimately, the inquiry of the Board is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board finds that an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication has not introduced new and material information, then there is no due process violation. On the other hand, if the Board finds new and material information has been received by the deciding official by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, then a due process violation has occurred and the former employee is entitled to a new constitutionally correct removal procedure. As we have explained previously, when a procedural due process violation has occurred because of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, such a violation is not subject to the harmless error test<span class="Italic">. See Sullivan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266, 1274 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Ryder v. United States</span>, 585 F.2d 482, 488 (Ct. Cl. 1978) (refusing to apply harmless error test: "[w]here a serious procedural curtailment mars an adverse personnel action which deprives the employee of pay, the court has regularly taken the position that the defect divests the removal (or demotion) of legality, leaving the employee on the rolls of the employing agency and entitled to his pay until proper procedural steps are taken toward removing or disciplining him. In that situation, the merits of the adverse action are wholly disregarded."); <span class="Italic">Camero v. United States</span>, 375 F.2d 777, 780 (Ct. Cl. 1967).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, because Mr. Stone had a property interest in continued employment with the FDIC, he was entitled by the Due Process Clause to meaningful notice of the reasons for his removal and a meaningful opportunity to respond. Because of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts between FDIC officials and the deciding official, Mr. Stone's procedural due process rights may have been undermined<span class="Italic">. See Sullivan</span>, 720 F.2d at 1274 (finding that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts were not only unfair, but a denial of rights under due process clause of the Constitution). We therefore must remand this case to the Board to determine, in the first instance, whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications in this case undermined Mr. Stone's procedural due process right to meaningful notice and an opportunity to respond. Specifically, the Board must analyze whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications in this case introduced new and material information to the deciding official. If the Board finds the communications did introduce such new and material information, Mr. Stone should be afforded a constitutionally correct removal procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In closing, we make two final observations. First, we express no opinion as to whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications in this case constituted new and material information that undermined Mr. Stone's procedural due process rights. Second, we note that the Due Process Clause only provides the minimum process to which a public employee is entitled prior to removal. Public employees are, of course, entitled to whatever <span id="Page_3249"></span>other procedural protections are afforded them by statute, regulation, or agency procedure which is in addition to the protections afforded by the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because, according to <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is not subject to the harmful error test, an AJ does not err by raising the issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, if necessary, to prevent manifest injustice. <span class="Italic">Powers v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 256, 261-62 &#x00B6; 10 (2000). If the AJ determines that the action against the appellant should be reversed for lack of due process, the "merits of the adverse action are wholly disregarded" under <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.2d at 1377, and the AJ should not make alternate findings on the merits of the case. <span class="Italic">Giannantonio v.

Conversely, the procedural protections enumerated in section 7513 are statutory, and an appellant must show that the agency committed harmful error in applying its procedures to warrant reversing an action.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With <span class="Italic">Stone v. FDIC</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> the constitutional due process elements of the decisional process were redefined. <span class="Italic">Stone</span> requires analysis of whether during the decisional process <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property, a determination that depends on whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it and whether the information conveyed through <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications was material or was of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. Older cases, including <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266 (Fed. Cir. 1983), involving improper manipulation of the decisional process, were not disavowed by <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, but the <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> circumstances would warrant reversal of the adverse action under <span class="Italic">Stone</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Stone</span> guidance was imprecise, couched in broad statements. The Board and future Circuit panels were left to sort out the gradations of permissible and impermissible <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications through a case-by-case analysis, placing considerable risk on agencies if the adverse action process was conducted under other than laboratory conditions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Analysis of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information often depends on testimony by the deciding official. But a decision letter can be evidence of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> consideration when a hearing is waived (and when one is not waived), as <span class="Italic">Gordon v. NASA</span>, DA-0752-13-0032-I-1 (NP 2/19/2014), involving findings of a threat assessment team, demonstrated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official's references to the TAT meeting and determination in her decision letter demonstrate that the deciding official had knowledge of them. A deciding official's knowledge of information raises due process or procedural concerns where that knowledge is a basis for the deciding official's determinations on either the merits of the underlying charge or the penalty to be imposed. <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Department of Justice,</span> 119 M.S.P.R. 685, &#x00B6; 10 (2013). We have considered the agency's argument that this reference for solely for context, but in the absence of independent evidence to the contrary, we find that the most reasonable reading of the decision letter suggests that the deciding official considered the TAT decision substantively. The appellant did not request a hearing; therefore, there is no testimony in the record by the deciding official about her decision-making process. The deciding official stated in her decision letter that she considered all evidence in determining the validity of the charge and the penalty, and also included the TAT information. Though the deciding official did not explicitly state that she was influenced by the TAT information, we find that her specific identification of it in the decision letter shows that the determination was material to her decision in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Silberman v. Department of Labor</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12 (2011) (specific identification of memoranda as factors in deciding official's decision show that they were material to the case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unelaborated by <span class="Italic">Stone</span> was whether new and <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information considered by the deciding official is "material." Is information immaterial only when it has no influence on the deciding official, or is it material if it has a minor but not determinative influence on the deciding official? The Board implied in <span class="Italic">Pickett v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 26, 2009, the agency proposed to remove the appellant from his position as a Farm Loan Officer based upon the following reasons: (1) Inappropriate conduct resulting in coworkers fearing for their safety and disruption to the workplace; (2) being intoxicated during duty hours; and (3) consuming alcohol during duty hours. In the specification underlying Reason 1, the agency stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On February 5, 2009, while in your office, you made remarks while on the telephone in a very loud tone "Just kill them all" or "Just shoot them all." The remarks were overheard by two employees in the office who became concerned for their safety as they believed the statement(s) referred to employees in the Farm Service Agency (FSA) office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Your threatening statement frightened and made employees in the Coahoma County FSA Office uneasy. This resulted in all the FSA employees being sent home for the remainder of the day and the following day. It also resulted in the closure of the National Resources and Conservation Service office for the remainder of the day and the following day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted a written reply on June 23, 2009, and made an oral reply on July 8, 2009. On August 13, 2009, R.M. Carnegie, the deciding official, sustained all three charges set forth in the proposal letter and removed the appellant from federal service effective August 15, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal with the Board and requested a hearing. At the hearing, both employees who heard the appellant's statements on February 5, 2009, testified. In addition to her testimony about the events of February 5, 2009, Ms. Norris testified that she "had been told by Bonnie Butler sometime prior to that day that [the appellant's] wife had told her that [the appellant] had held a gun to [the appellant's wife's] head." Mr. Carnegie testified at the hearing that he considered the information in the case file as well as information relating to a prior arrest of the appellant's that Judy Rocconi told him about but that was not in the case file. Mr. Carnegie further testified that in deciding to remove the appellant he considered "the rumors [he] had heard about [the appellant's] conduct outside the office" but that his consideration of the information in deciding to remove the appellant played "a minor role in that...it caused [the employees] to be more fearful...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its response file in the instant appeal, the agency included a December 19, 2006 newspaper notice indicating that the appellant had been arrested and was due in court for disturbing the peace. The agency stipulated during the hearing that the appellant was never provided with this information prior to the decision to remove him. During the appellant's discovery deposition, the agency representative questioned the appellant regarding the December 19, 2006 newspaper notice. In response, the appellant stated that he was not aware of the newspaper notice, that he called the police in December 2006 after an argument with his wife, that he had a gun in his truck at the time, that he never threatened anyone with the gun, and that he was never charged with disturbing the peace.<span class="Italic"></span> He denied that he ever held his wife at gunpoint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without addressing the merits of any of the charges, the administrative judge ordered the agency to cancel the appellant's removal and to retroactively restore the appellant effective August 15, 2009. Relying primarily on <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), and <span class="Italic">Blank v. Department of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the administrative judge found that the information regarding the appellant's arrest for disturbing the peace constituted new, rather than merely cumulative, information because it was not disclosed to the appellant prior to the agency's removal decision and because there was no record in the witness statements that the appellant was previously arrested or held a gun to his wife's head. The administrative judge also found that the new information was material given Mr. Carnegie's testimony that the information supplied by Ms. Rocconi played at least a minor role in his decision and his testimony that the rumors of the appellant holding a gun to his wife's head played a role in his decision since it caused the employees to be more fearful.<span class="Italic"></span> The administrative judge further found that "the appellant's alleged arrest for disturbing the peace and holding a gun to his wife's head is so likely to cause prejudice that the appellant could not fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances without being put on notice that it was being considered by the deciding official."<span class="Italic"></span> He thus found that the agency violated the appellant's procedural due process rights in failing to give him the opportunity to review and respond to Ms. Rocconi's comments regarding his alleged arrest for disturbing the peace and to the rumors that he held a gun to his wife's head, and that the agency's error was not harmless.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency asserts that the administrative judge erroneously applied precedent of the Board and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications because Mr. Carnegie's consideration of the newspaper material was limited to his penalty analysis. Relying on <span class="Italic">Westmoreland v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 625 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 19 Fed. Appx. 868 (Fed. Cir. 2001), and <span class="Italic">Biniak v. Social Security Administration</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 682 (2002), the agency argues that <span class="Italic">Stone</span> applies "only to cases involving <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information <span id="Page_3250"></span>that a deciding official receives in relation to the underlying charges of misconduct."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, our reviewing court held that, when a deciding official receives new and material information by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, "then a due process violation has occurred and the former employee is entitled to a new constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> 179 F.3d at 1377. In that case, the deciding official received <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> memoranda recommending removal of the employee after the employee had received a notice of proposed removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1372. The court reasoned:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The introduction of new and material information by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications to the deciding official undermines the public employee's constitutional due process guarantee of notice (both of the charges and of the employer's evidence) and the opportunity to respond. When deciding officials receive such <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, employees are no longer on notice of the reasons for their dismissal and/or the evidence relied upon by the agency. Procedural due process guarantees are not met if the employee has notice only of certain charges or portions of the evidence and the deciding official considers new and material information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Stone,</span> 179 F.3d at 1376. However, the court also stated that, "not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is a procedural defect so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that it undermines the due process guarantee and entitles the appellant to an entirely new administrative proceeding. Only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official will violate the due process guarantee of notice." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1376-77.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the Federal Circuit relied upon certain factors in determining whether <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications introduce new and material information: (1) Whether the information is merely cumulative, (2) whether the employee knew of and had an opportunity to respond to the information, and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications would likely result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377. The ultimate inquiry is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the Board developed a line of precedent holding that, where an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication does not relate to the charge itself, but relates instead to the penalty, we would not consider such an error as a denial of due process of law to be analyzed under the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>; rather we analyzed the error by applying the harmful error standard in our analysis of the penalty factors. <span class="Italic">See Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 239, &#x00B6; 10 (2009); <span class="Italic">Biniak</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 682, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Groeber v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 13 Fed. Appx. 973 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Westmoreland,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12. However, the Federal Circuit recently overruled <span class="Italic">Ward</span> and has directed the Board to consider this type of error as a due process violation under <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999). <span class="Italic">See Ward v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 634 F.3d 1274, 1279-80 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The court further found that, even if the Board concludes that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications did not rise to the level of a due process violation, the Board should consider the matter as harmful procedural error, and run a harmless error analysis to determine whether the procedural error required reversal, but not perform an independent analysis of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1281-83. Given this decision from our reviewing court, we note that the precedent followed in <span class="Italic">Ward, Biniak, Groeber, Westmoreland,</span> and similar decisions has been overruled. Therefore, the agency's argument on review is without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, as discussed above, the record evidence here shows the administrative judge did not err in his analysis of the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors. Mr. Carnegie testified that he considered information he received regarding the newspaper notice of the appellant's arrest for disturbing the peace in December 2006 and regarding the rumor that the appellant held his wife at gunpoint. The agency's response file contains a newspaper notice stating that the appellant was arrested for disturbing the peace on December 19, 2006, and the agency stipulated at the hearing that the newspaper notice was not provided to the appellant before the agency's decision to remove him. Additionally, in response to the agency's question regarding "what role...any rumors [he] had heard about [the appellant's] conduct outside the office" played in his decision to remove the appellant, Mr. Carnegie testified that the rumor played "a minor role in that...it caused [the employees] to be more fearful...." That the deciding official considered the new information and it influenced his decision weighs strongly in favor of finding that the new information was material. <span class="Italic">See Ward,</span> 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge properly applied the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors and determined that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information received by Mr. Carnegie constituted new and material information that was substantial and undermined the appellant's procedural due process rights.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The essential approach adopted by <span class="Italic">Stone</span> was reaffirmed by subsequent judicial precedential and nonprecedential decisions. Although <span class="Italic">Stone</span> plainly held that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications involving the decisionmaker are subject to a multifactor due process analysis and are not restricted to the harmful error analysis, two members of the Board may have weakened <span class="Italic">Stone</span> in <span class="Italic">Freeman v.

In <span class="Italic">Freeman</span> the issue was whether the agency committed reversible procedural error when, after the reply to the proposed adverse action, the proposing and deciding officials shared some information in the nature of a mitigation analysis concerning the penalty. The Board concluded that the information was not material because it was not of sufficient weight to warrant a different outcome. The Board's analysis sounded much like its harmful error rule, 5 CFR 1201.4(r) (2022), "error by the agency in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error...."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board could readily have reached the same result in <span class="Italic">Freeman</span> without employing language paralleling its regulatory harmful error regulation, and that was the point of Chairman Slavet's concurring opinion. Under the majority opinion, 88 MSPR at 663-64 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-13:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that the communication between Hemmingsen and Lovejoy denied him his due process rights because he was not provided with or aware of the existence of the detrimental information provided to Lovejoy by Hemmingsen, and not provided an opportunity to respond to the information. The appellant contends that the AJ should have applied a due process test, not a harmful error test, and erred in presuming the contents of the worksheet, because, "Who knows what information was improperly included in the worksheet?"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that the AJ referred to the wrong test in deciding the legal effect of the interaction between Hemmingsen and Lovejoy. As the court held in <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the introduction of new and material information by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications to the deciding official undermines the public employee's constitutional due process guarantee of notice (both of the charges and of the employer's evidence) and the opportunity to respond.[2] A claim based on such facts is, therefore, not subject to a harmful error analysis. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377; <span class="Italic">see Powers v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 256 &#x00B6; 10 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In deciding whether new and material information has been introduced by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts, the court instructed the Board to consider the facts and circumstances of each particular case. Among the factors that it deemed useful for the Board to weigh are: Whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces "cumulative" information or new information; whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it; and whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication was of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner<span class="Italic">. Stone,</span> 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we do not agree with the appellant's contention that the evidence of record indicates that a due process violation has occurred here. The court in <span class="Italic">Stone</span> admonished that "not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication...undermines the due process guarantee.... Only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official will violate the due process guarantee of notice." 179 F.3d at 1377. The Board considers evidence to be material to a proceeding only where it is of sufficient weight to warrant a different outcome. <span class="Italic">See Powers,</span> 86 MSPR 256 &#x00B6; 12. The ultimate inquiry is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as the AJ found, there is no indication that Hemmingsen introduced new information to Lovejoy, as opposed to cumulative information that had either already been incorporated into Hemmingsen's notice of proposed removal, or had already been considered by Lovejoy, who was merely attempting to compare Hemmingsen's worksheet to his own. The notice of proposed removal, for example, set forth seven prior disciplinary actions that were considered by Hemmingsen in proposing the removal. It appears that the appellant did not know of the communication between Hemmingsen and Lovejoy and did not have a chance to respond to it. Nevertheless, Hemmingsen, who the appellant had accused of whistleblower reprisal, did not approach Lovejoy on his own initiative, but merely responded to an unexpected request from Lovejoy for a document that Hemmingsen had already prepared for his own use. The worksheet, according to Hemmingsen's unrebutted testimony, did not include any recommendation as to whether the appellant should be retained or removed. Rather, it merely set forth facts <span id="Page_3251"></span>and opinions addressing factors that the Board has held are relevant in making penalty determinations. There is no indication in the record that the contents of the worksheet went beyond what one would expect to find in such a worksheet. Under these circumstances, the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors worksheet was not the type of communication that was likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. In other words, there is no indication that the communication was material in the sense of being of sufficient weight to warrant a different outcome. <span class="Italic">Powers,</span> 86 MSPR 256 &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Freeman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 28 Fed. Appx. 956 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP), affirmed the Board's result but rejected the "different outcome" analysis of the majority, stating that the approach may "in some cases, be tantamount to the harmless error test that we rejected in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>." The court noted the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors and determined, as in <span class="Italic">Blank v. Dept. of Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225 (Fed. Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">post</span>, that when a deciding official initiates <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication that does no more than confirm or clarify information already in the record, no due process violation occurs. <span class="Italic">Freeman</span> involved <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information injected into the penalty analysis. The problem of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> considerations as to a penalty would be revisited, and the Federal Circuit would clearly return the Board to a constitutional due process analysis, still allowing for a secondary harmful error analysis, in <span class="Italic">Ward v. USPS</span>, 634 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2011), <span class="Italic">post</span>. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-18-106.html#sec11-107">Information Pertaining to Aggravation or Mitigation of Penalty; <span class="Italic">Ward</span></a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board must distinguish information that is new and information that clarifies existing information, an analysis applied to find a <span class="Italic">Stone</span> due process violation in <span class="Italic">Kolenc v. DHHS</span>, 120 MSPR 101, 109-10 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22, 2013 MSPB 70 (2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Young</span>, the deciding official's receipt of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information that the traffic ticket had been dismissed was more than just an inquiry under <span class="Italic">Blank</span> "confirming and clarifying" information already in the record. <span class="Italic">Young</span>, 706 F.3d at 1377. Rather, as the administrative judge concluded, the fact that the ticket had not been dismissed was considered significant by the deciding official because he referred to it in the decision letter and because he testified that it affected his findings regarding the appellant's credibility with regard to all of the charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">See also Young</span>, 706 F.3d at 1376-77 (finding that the deciding official's consideration of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications related to credibility violated the first <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor). With regard to the second <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, the deciding official plainly acknowledged that he did not provide the appellant with an opportunity to clarify or explain the discrepancy regarding whether the ticket had been dismissed. <span class="Italic">See Young</span>, 706 F.3d at 1377 (finding that the appellant "had no opportunity to respond to the allegedly inconsistent statements" that were made to the deciding official in her <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> inquiry and that "[t]his defect during the investigation stage more that satisfies the second <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor."). Thus, we conclude that the administrative judge properly found that the appellant proved the first and second <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the third <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, the agency argues that the administrative judge erred in his determination on this issue because, while the deciding official admitted that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications influenced his decision, he also testified that he would not have removed the appellant on the basis of Charge 4 alone, that he was more concerned with the other three charges, and that he would have removed the appellant even in the absence of Charge 4. Thus, the agency asserts that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications did not exert undue pressure on the deciding official because the misconduct underlying Charge 4 had little relevance to his decision. The agency also contends that the administrative judge erred in failing to make a credibility determination to resolve the deciding official's conflicting statements citing <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> and <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>. However, unlike <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, the deciding official did not testify that he would have removed the appellant even if he had not received the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. Rather, the deciding official admitted that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication affected his view of the appellant's credibility. There is no indication in his testimony that he restricted the prejudice of the information solely to his resolution of Charge 4. Thus, the administrative judge did not err in failing to make a credibility determination under <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> because the deciding official's statements do not appear to be contradictory. Furthermore, we note that the court recently clarified the weight to be given the third <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor of undue pressure. It stated that this factor is "less relevant" when the deciding official states that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information "influenced her determination." <span class="Italic">Young</span>, 706 F.3d at 1377 (citing <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1280 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2011)). Thus, the court observed that when the first <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor "strongly suggests" a due process violation, "any deficiency of the third factor is less significant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We similarly find here that the third <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor is less significant, but that the strength of the first factor establishes that the appellant's right to due process was violated by the deciding official's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See ONeal v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, AT-0752-15-0666-I-1 (NP 2/22/2023) (no due process error when the deciding official confirmed with HR that the removal penalty was consistent with other cases; the removal proposal stated the penalty of removal would be consistent with actions imposed on other agency employees for the same or similar offenses); <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-11-0263-I-3 (NP 7/9/2014) (withdrawn from publication on 7/10/2014 for unstated reasons) ("Under the first <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, the court found that '[w]hen a deciding official initiates <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication that only confirms or clarifies information already contained in the record, there is no due process violation' because it does not introduce new and material information. <span class="Italic">Blank v.

Thus, the court recognized that a deciding official may conduct a limited inquiry into matters already in the record to clarify information that has already been received as evidence. However, the court later clarified this in <span class="Italic">Young v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 706 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stone</span> was interpreted by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Blank v. Dept. of Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225, 1229-30 (Fed. Cir. 2001), explaining that information obtained from investigatory interviews by a deciding official does not qualify as improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications if it only "confirms or clarifies" information already contained in the record:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Stone</span> sets forth certain factors in determining whether <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications introduce new and material information: (1) whether the information is merely cumulative, (2) whether the employee knew of and had an opportunity to respond to the information, and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications would likely result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377. The ultimate inquiry is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the AJ applied the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors and determined that (1) the information obtained from the interviews was merely cumulative of the documentary evidence already assembled to support the Notice of Proposed Removal, (2) Mr. Blank was furnished with a copy of the questions asked and notes of the answers given during the interviews, and (3) the interviews were unlikely to result in undue pressure on the Chief of Staff to rule in any particular manner. <span class="Italic">Blank</span>, No. DA0752-98-0348-1-2, slip. op. at 33-36 (MSPB June 25, 1999). Based on these findings, the AJ determined that the interviews conducted on April 2, 1998 did not violate Mr. Blank's due process rights<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 37. The AJ properly relied on the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>. A thorough examination of the record before us, including notes of the interviews, leads us to the conclusion that this determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More importantly, the investigatory interviews conducted in this case are not the type of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications proscribed by <span class="Italic">Stone.</span> In this case, the Chief of Staff interviewed various agency employees merely to confirm and clarify information that was already contained in the record. When a deciding official initiates <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication that only confirms or clarifies information already contained in the record, there is no due process violation. Investigatory interviews and communications that do no more than confirm or clarify pending charges do not introduce new and material information. For that reason, information regarding pending charges obtained by investigatory communications that do no more than confirm or clarify the record does not undermine an employee's constitutional due process guarantee of notice and the opportunity to respond. Thus, the interviews conducted by the Chief of Staff do not violate Mr. Blank's due process guarantees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Singh v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 15, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-26 (2022), found no due process error when information sought and received by the deciding official confirmed information that was in the adverse action proposal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has not shown that the agency violated his due process rights</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency violated his due process rights because the deciding official contacted an official at agency headquarters about one of the specifications without notifying the appellant of that contact. The deciding official testified that there was conflicting information as to whether the appellant was authorized to make the contract changes that formed the basis of the first specification of the improper conduct charge. The deciding official therefore contacted an official at agency headquarters to find out whether the appellant's actions were in fact improper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the Federal Circuit's decisions in <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1279-80 (Fed. Cir. 2011), and <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 1999), a deciding official violates an employee's due process rights when he relies upon new and material <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information as a basis for his decisions on the merits of a proposed charge or the penalty to be imposed. <span class="Italic">See Norris v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, 675 F.3d 1349, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">see also Gray v. Department of Defense</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 6 (2011). An employee's due <span id="Page_3252"></span>process right to notice extends to both <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information provided to a deciding official and information personally known to the deciding official, if the information was considered in reaching the decision and was not previously disclosed to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Solis v. Department of Justice</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 458, &#x00B6; 7 (2012). <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, and their progeny recognize, however, that not all <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official rise to the level of a due process violation. <span class="Italic">Solis</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 458, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the Federal Circuit identified the following factors to be used to determine if <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information is new and material: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information introduced cumulative, as opposed to new, information; (2) whether the employee knew of the information and had an opportunity to respond; and (3) whether the communication was "of the type likely to result in undue pressure on the deciding official to rule in a particular manner." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. Ultimately, we must determine "whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so <span id="Page_3253"></span>substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A deciding official does not violate an employee's due process rights by initiating an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication that only confirms or clarifies information already contained in the record. <span class="Italic">Blank v. Department of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 2001). On the other hand, information obtained from an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication may be considered new and material if it constitutes a significant departure from evidence already in the record and the deciding official considers it in reaching a decision. <span class="Italic">See Young v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 706 F.3d 1372, 1376-78 (Fed. Cir. 2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication in this case does not constitute a due process violation. The agency charged the appellant with improper conduct for his actions regarding the contract changes. The deciding official reached out to the official at headquarters because there was some indication in the record that the appellant's actions may not have been improper. The effect of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication appears to have been to confirm to the deciding official that the appellant's actions were in fact improper, just as the agency indicated in the notice of proposed removal. Therefore, we find that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication in this case did not introduce new and material information to the deciding official. Rather, it merely clarified or confirmed information that was already in the record. <span class="Italic">See Mathis v. Department of State</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 507, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 16 (2015) (applying the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors and finding no due process violation when the deciding official contacted a human resources representative to determine whether allegations made in response to the proposed removal were supported by the facts).</p>

Accordingly, like the email in <span class="Italic">Hornseth</span> and the interviews in <span class="Italic">Blank,</span> both of which provided only confirmatory, cumulative information, Dr. Bolden's email similarly did not deprive Mr. Reuter of due process....Indeed, a fair reading of these emails reflects that they appear to be perfunctory, administrative messages, asking about next steps and the status of the proceedings against Mr. Reuter.").</p>

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 F.4th 110, 110-17 (Fed. Cir. 2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Johnson worked as a firefighter at Dyess Air Force Base from 2017 to 2019. Around March 2018, Mr. Johnson's mother came to live with Mr. Johnson and his family. She was then taking around thirteen pills to treat various health issues. Around the same time, Mr. Johnson was also taking "seven or eight" pills.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a condition of his employment, Mr. Johnson was subject to random drug testing because the Air Force considered his position to be "sufficiently critical to the Air Force mission or to the protection of public safety." The Air Force selected Mr. Johnson for a drug test on October 30, 2018. He tested positive for oxycodone and oxymorphone. Shortly after, Mr. Johnson informed his supervisor, Chief Gregory Ranard, of the positive drug test and his belief that he had accidentally taken one of his mother's pills instead of his own prescribed medication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chief Ranard proposed that Mr. Johnson be fired. In a letter to Mr. Johnson, he stated that the Medical Review Officer found that "there was no legitimate medical explanation for the positive drug results." Chief Ranard also wrote that being "under the influence of Oxycodone could impair [Mr. Johnson's] ability to perform [his] duties safely."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proposal to terminate Mr. Johnson was then referred to the deciding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles R. Fletcher. On May 30, 2019, Lt. Col. Fletcher fired Mr. Johnson. Explaining his decision, Lt. Col. Fletcher wrote that he could not "risk the possibility of [Mr. Johnson] coming to work again under the influence of illicit drugs."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Johnson proceeded to challenge his removal under his Labor Management Agreement's grievance procedures. At the arbitration hearing that followed, Lt. Col. Fletcher testified that he "just [didn't] believe" that Mr. Johnson accidentally took his mother's pill. When asked whether Mr. Johnson's "lack of candor was a major part of" his decision to terminate Mr. Johnson, Lt. Col. Fletcher responded, "[a]bsolutely." Lt. Col. Fletcher then described how he had spoken to two family members about Mr. Johnson's case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You know, I consult advisors and I make decisions. When I heard [Mr. Johnson's explanation], I wanted to make sure I consulted probably my number one advisor, my wife, which is--she's a registered nurse, and I just wanted to make sure I wasn't off. And I spoke to my brother-in-law, who's a nurse practitioner, and they confirmed that the likelihood of that happening is slim to none.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On cross-examination, he further testified about consulting his family members:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Q. And you also said that you consulted with your wife and your brother-in-law. Correct?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A. Well, as far as the inadvertently taking someone else's pill, yes, I did talk to them about that.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Q. And their opinion was that Mr. Johnson was not being truthful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A. No, their opinion was it's low probability of that happening.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the end, the arbitrator denied Mr. Johnson's grievance and affirmed his termination "for having a positive test result for the metabolites of OxyContin." The arbitrator concluded that Mr. Johnson's explanation of his positive drug test was "so fantastic it is difficult to give it credence." He also found that Mr. Johnson's job "involve[d] the safety of others and the security of the installation" and that a positive drug test "is a powerful indicator of a possible problem and potential liability down the road." In response to Mr. Johnson's due process argument, the arbitrator simply stated that he found "no convincing evidence that [Mr. Johnson] was denied due process in being able to present any and all matters in his defense." Thus, the arbitrator concluded, the Air Force "was within its rights to remove [Mr. Johnson] from his position for having a positive test result."</p>

Pet'r's Br. 33; <span class="Italic">see</span> App. 215 (career report stating that Mr. Johnson was part of "Permanent--Tenure Group 1"). The Air Force does not argue to the contrary.

<p class="Block-Quote1">After reviewing the evidence in the record, we conclude that the arbitrator erred in finding no violation of Mr. Johnson's right to due process. The first <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor weighs in favor of a due process violation because it is apparent that Lt. Col. Fletcher received new--not cumulative--information from his sister and brother-in-law. Namely, he received the opinion of two medical professionals that the possibility that Mr. Johnson accidentally took his mother's pill was "slim to none."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Air Force urges us to follow <span class="Italic">Blank v. Department of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225 (Fed. Cir. 2001), that case is distinguishable. In <span class="Italic">Blank</span>, we held that "[i]nvestigatory interviews and communications that do no more than confirm or clarify pending charges do not introduce new and material information." 247 F.3d at 1229. There, the deciding officer "interviewed various agency employees merely to confirm and clarify information that was already contained in the record." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, by contrast, Lt. Col. Fletcher obtained new information that two medical professionals believed Mr. Johnson's explanation to be highly unlikely. In other words, when Lt. Col. Fletcher's relatives allegedly "confirmed" that the chances of Mr. Johnson taking his mother's pill were "slim to none," they were not confirming information in the record; rather, they were providing new opinions on the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject the Air Force's argument that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were permissible because they did not change Lt. Col. Fletcher's "existing understanding" of Mr. Johnson's explanation as not being credible. A deciding officer may violate an employee's due process rights even if the deciding officer states that he "would have concluded that the employee should be removed whether or not he had received the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications." <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 634 F.3d 1274, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (brackets omitted) (quoting <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1373). We do not ask whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications constituted harmless error. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. Once Lt. Col. Fletcher had received these comments about Mr. Johnson, he had to give Mr. Johnson an opportunity to respond to them before reaching a decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors similarly weigh in favor of concluding that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications introduced new and material information. The Air Force acknowledges that Mr. Johnson learned of Lt. Col. Fletcher's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications only during the arbitration hearing, which occurred after Mr. Johnson's removal was final. Resp't's Br. 42; <span class="Italic">see also</span> App. 2 (showing arbitration hearing occurred on September 10, 2020, and Mr. Johnson's removal was effective May 30, 2019). Mr. Johnson did not have a chance to respond to comments that Lt. Col. Fletcher's relatives made before he was terminated. And Lt. Col. Fletcher made clear that the communications at issue were material, bearing on the central issue of whether to credit Mr. Johnson's explanation of the test results and coming from medical professionals. We need not decide whether those facts themselves suffice to find a due process violation or to find, under <span class="Italic">Stone's</span> third factor, that "the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon" Lt. Col. Fletcher. <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. In this case, there is additional reason to so find. Familial bonds are often strong and intimate, making family members arguably the most influential people in anyone's life. Indeed, Lt. Col. Fletcher described his wife as his "number one advisor." It is "constitutionally impermissible to allow a deciding official to receive additional material information that may undermine the objectivity required to protect the fairness of the process." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376. Once Lt. Col. Fletcher had received the opinion of two family members--who are also medical professionals--that Mr. Johnson's explanation was not credible, he had to at least afford Mr. Johnson a chance to respond to maintain the objectivity that due process demands.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having concluded that Lt. Col. Fletcher's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications violated Mr. Johnson's right to due process, we are left to decide the remedy. Where "a serious procedural curtailment mars an adverse personnel action which deprives the employee of pay, the court has regularly taken the position that the defect divests the removal (or demotion) of legality, leaving the employee on the rolls of the employing agency and entitled to his pay until proper procedural steps are taken toward removing or disciplining him." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377. The goal of cancellation of an employee's termination is "to place the employee as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>." <span class="Italic">Kerr v. Nat'l Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Because the parties have not briefed the remedy due to Mr. Johnson, we leave it for the arbitrator to determine on remand the proper remedy for Mr. Johnson in view of these guidelines. If the Air Force continues to believe that Mr. Johnson should be removed, however, it can institute an "entirely new" and "constitutionally correct" procedure to remove him.[1] <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279 (citing <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Our decision turns solely on the violation of Mr. Johnson's due process rights. We do not express an opinion on whether the Air Force can place Mr. Johnson on notice leave or otherwise reassign him in accordance with Air Force regulations while initiating new removal proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6329b; <span class="Italic">cf.

Instead, Mr. Bernhart notes only that there was 'some risk of further complaints from' Dr. Bolden. But in view of the evidence, that statement cannot reasonably be interpreted to have caused undue pressure on Mr. Strelcheck. There are no details regarding this 'risk,' Mr. Strelcheck does not express any concern in his response, and, as we mentioned above, Dr. Bolden was Mr. Strelcheck's and Mr. Bernhart's subordinate and had no authority over them."; email to deciding official with chronology of events was cumulative or confirmatory).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Information developed for the deciding official during the reply process in response to assertions made by the appellant during the reply concerning the unfairness or impropriety of aspects of a drug test did not, although submitted without notice to the appellant or his opportunity to provide response at the reply stage, constitute a violation of <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> according to the analysis in <span class="Italic">Garza v. DOJ,</span> 5 Fed. Appx. 894 (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3202), because the information was not the evidence that formed the basis of the removal proposal (or, presumably, the decision):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Garza also argues that agency regulations were violated and he was denied due process when the report of an agency investigation into the procedure for his specimen was not provided to him in advance of the agency's decision. The investigation was apparently prompted by his response to the notice of proposed removal, in which he challenged the procedure for the specimen that he provided. Mr. Garza was not given the report of the investigation until after the agency's decision to remove him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Garza cites 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b), which provides that the notice of proposed removal "inform the employee of his or her right to review the material which is relied on to support the reasons for action given in the notice." This regulation requires that Mr. Garza have access to the evidence supporting his proposed removal, which was the positive drug test. The agency's subsequent investigation was made in response to Mr. Garza's answer to the notice of proposed removal; the report of that investigation may have been a factor in the actual removal, but it did not exist at the time of the proposed removal. Although the better procedure would have been to provide the report to Mr. Garza promptly when it was obtained, the Regulation was not, technically, violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Garza states that this procedure constitutes a constitutional violation, citing <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,</span> 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In <span class="Italic">Stone</span> this court held that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication of new and material information by the agency's investigating official to the agency's deciding official could constitute a violation of the employee's constitutional right to due process of law. However, the court in <span class="Italic">Stone</span> made clear that not all <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications are due process violations, and that it is necessary to "consider the facts and circumstances of each particular case." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1377. The court must consider "whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Viewing the agency's investigation report as an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication because it was not made available to Mr. Garza before the actual removal, Mr. Garza has not demonstrated that the report prejudiced him. The report of the investigation is not the evidence upon which the agency proposed to remove and subsequently removed Mr. Garza, but agency review of the arguments he made in challenging the proposed removal. Although Mr. Garza received this report in preparation for the MSPB hearing, at the hearing there was presented the testimony of the persons interviewed for the report, including the persons directly involved in the sample collection, as well as several other agency employees who were present at the time. Viewed as a whole, we conclude that due process was not violated by the agency's procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gerges v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 89 MSPR 669, 679-81 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-27 (2001), considering <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts that only confirm information already known or add information that is not material to the decision, discounted as decisionally insignificant noncumulative information provided to the deciding official:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge found that the official who decided to remove the appellant had violated the appellant's constitutional right to due process by relying on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information. That finding was based on evidence that the deciding official, Douglas Horsman, obtained information relevant to the appellant's employment from Mr. Mosher and Mr. Apraham after the appellant had made his oral <span id="Page_3254"></span>and written responses to the removal proposal, and that he did not advise the appellant of this information or give the appellant an opportunity to respond to it. The <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information on which the administrative judge relied consisted of assertions that the appellant had been the subject of "several complaints that he would become overly concerned about others' personal affairs," that there were "several documented instances in which other employees complained about his lack of professionalism," and that the appellant had indicated that he would not return to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 1999), our reviewing court held that a federal employee such as the appellant in this case, i.e., an employee covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501, had a property interest in his continued employment, and that he could not properly be deprived of that interest without due process of law, i.e., without notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to respond. It also held that the employee's due process rights could be violated by the deciding official's receipt, on an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> basis, of "additional material information that [might] undermine the objectivity required to protect the fairness of the process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1376.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court held further, however, that "not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication [was] a procedural defect so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice" that it was fatal to the action at issue, and that only those that "introduce[d] new and material information to the decision official [would] violate the due process guarantee of notice." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1376-77. Factors relevant in determining whether there was such a violation include whether the communication introduced new information or information that was merely cumulative, whether the employee knew of the communication and had an opportunity to respond to it, and "whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1377. The "[u]ltimate[ ] ...inquiry" with respect to this issue "is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the information about the appellant's alleged unwillingness to return to work cannot be considered an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication because both the appellant and the deciding official were aware of this information before the proposal notice was issued. In a letter to the appellant dated Sept. 22, 1998, issued about four months before the proposal notice, Commander Horsman, who ultimately was the deciding official in the appellant's removal action, denied the appellant's request for advance sick leave. The letter stated that the appellant had told Ms. Denise Spliethof (the agency official responsible for assisting employees in filing workers compensation claims) that "he would not return to work at PW, Environmental Division," and the letter further stated that "it is apparent that you do not intend to return to your current position." Thus, the appellant was aware, before the proposal notice was issued, that the deciding official believed he did not intend to return to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in his written response to the proposed removal notice, the appellant confirmed that he had decided not to return to work. In the decision letter, the deciding official stated that he had fully considered the appellant's oral and written responses, and he testified at the Board hearing that in considering the penalty under the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the "overriding consideration in his decision" was the evidence that the appellant was not returning to work<span class="Italic">. See Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981) (describing the factors that are relevant in assessing the reasonableness of a penalty imposed by an employing agency). Although "aggravating factors on which the agency intends to rely for imposition of an enhanced penalty...should be included in the advance notice of the charges so the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond to those alleged factors before the deciding official," <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376, <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 M.S.P.R. at 304, we find that the appellant here had a fair opportunity to respond to the information regarding his unwillingness to return to work. He was aware, before the proposal notice was issued, that Commander Horsman relied on this factor in denying his request for advance sick leave, and he also communicated his intent not to return to work to the that same official in his written response to the proposal notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The other information that the administrative judge found was communicated on an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> basis, i.e., assertions regarding the appellant's alleged concern "about others' personal affairs" and his alleged "lack of professionalism," does not appear to duplicate information already before Commander Horsman. Further, there is no indication in the record that the appellant was informed of, or had an opportunity to comment on, the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications concerning these issues before Commander Horsman decided to remove him. That information appears, however, to have played no significant role in the decision to remove the appellant. Commander Horsman testified at the hearing that the "overriding consideration" in his decision was the evidence that the appellant was not returning to work; and, although he referred to the other two matters briefly in a document he prepared in support of his decision to remove the appellant, he appears to have done so only as part of an effort to show that he gave proper consideration to the "<span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors." Accordingly, this information also does not appear to have placed any undue pressure on the deciding official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we find that the information about the appellant's decision not to return to work was not an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication, and that none of the other information communicated to Commander Horsman on an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> basis was substantial or likely to cause prejudice to the appellant. We therefore find that the appellant's due process rights were not violated by these communication.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Abaqueta v. United States,</span> 255 F. Supp.2d 1020, 1027-28 (D. Az. 2003), concluded that <span class="Italic">Stone</span> did not compel reversal of a determination of improper conduct by a VA physician when the information provided <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> to the decisionmaker confirmed expert opinions obtained during an investigation that was made available to the employee. <span class="Italic">Eilers v. Dept. of Army</span>, 415 Fed. Appx. 234 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), determined that there was no constitutional violation by a deciding official who did not rely on information that was not cumulative of the information already known to the appellant--a report concerning the incidents leading to the appellant's removal--and who gave the information no weight other than to address the appellant's alleged mischaracterizations of the report.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vanover v. Hantman,</span> 77 F. Supp.2d 91, 105 (D.D. Cir. 1999), explained that <span class="Italic">Stone</span> did not preclude procedural advice to a hearing officer in a personnel case involving an employee of the Architect of the Capitol:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The letter contained no new information as to the nature of the charges or the evidence, but rather dealt with interpretations of the governing procedures. No case law suggests that due process requires a forum to allow every procedural question to be debated. Further, there is nothing in Mulshine's letter that suggests that Miley's objectivity would be undermined. Rather, the letter reiterates that the hearing officer has a duty to determine the appropriateness of the charges.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stone</span> and its kin concern improper influences on a deciding official in an appealable action. <span class="Italic">Stone</span> has no application to agency internal deliberations that lead to the filing of a disciplinary case against an ALJ, when the Board is the sole determiner of disciplinary action to be authorized against an ALJ, <span class="Italic">SSA v. White</span>, CB-7521-11-0004-T-1 (NP 4/22/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the respondent contends that the action must be reversed on due process grounds based on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between agency officials. In particular, she asserts that Voisin recommended her termination in an email to Stewart, which was provided to Parks Saunders and Lillios. She also asserts that Voisin provided Lillios a copy of the respondent's pleadings in her defamation suit against Hunter and that Lillios may have reviewed those pleadings before filing the statement of charges with the Board. The respondent further contends that, as a result of Voisin's communications, the charges are tainted under the "cat's paw" theory, even if Lillios was ostensibly an independent decision maker. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 59-60 (citing <span class="Italic">Staub v. Proctor Hospital</span>, 131 S. Ct. 1186, 1190-92 (2011)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court has held that the introduction of new and material information by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications to the deciding official undermines the employee's constitutional due process guarantee of notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376; <span class="Italic">see Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). However, as the ALJ correctly noted, <span class="Italic">Stone</span> is inapplicable to this case because there was no agency employee who served as a deciding official. Rather, it is the Board which makes the decision to approve a disciplinary action against an ALJ pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521. Here, the petitioner provided the respondent with notice of its intent to remove her in the complaint at issue, and the Board's procedures under 5 C.F.R. part 1201, subpart D, provided her with an opportunity to respond in regard to the charges that underlie this complaint. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration v. Carr</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 313, 334 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 185 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Thus, the respondent received all the due process to which she was entitled under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is likewise no merit to the respondent's "cat's paw" argument. In <span class="Italic">Staub</span>, 131 S. Ct. at 1194, the Court held that, if a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary animus intended to cause an adverse employment action, and that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action, then the employer is liable under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, even if there is no antimilitary bias on the part of the ultimate decisionmaker. As the ALJ correctly found, this case is readily distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Staub</span>. Even if Voisin's actions were motivated by a discriminatory <span class="Italic">animus</span>--and the respondent has not proven such <span class="Italic">animus</span> or even specified the nature of the alleged discrimination--no adverse action can be taken against the respondent except upon proof of the charges and a determination of good cause, after a hearing before the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521. Because it is the Board, and not an agency official, which determines whether disciplinary action may be imposed, Voisin's actions, even if <span id="Page_3255"></span>they influenced Lillios's decision to file charges, would not serve as the proximate cause of the Board's decision to approve disciplinary action. Thus, <span class="Italic">Staub</span> is inapposite.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As in the 2002 <span class="Italic">Freeman</span> decision, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board's treatment of due process violations as the equivalent of harmless error analysis was again criticized by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Kelly v. USDA,</span> 225 Fed. Appx. 880, 80-83 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of her removal, Ms. Kelly had been employed with the Agency for seven years. Ms. Kelly worked a "5-4-9" schedule. Under this biweekly schedule, Ms. Kelly's first week consisted of five nine-hour days while the second week consisted of three nine-hour days, one eight-hour day and Friday off. Additionally, Ms. Kelly was authorized to take a "midday band"--time off in the middle of the workday for other activities. Midday band time had to be made up later in the day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Kelly and Dr. Nathaniel Clark, District Manager of the Minneapolis district office, both attended a noon "spinning" class at a gym near the office. Fellow employees expressed concern that the midday absences of Ms. Kelly and Dr. Clark interfered with operation of the office. In 2004, the Agency investigated Ms. Kelly and Dr. Clark. As a result of the investigation, the Agency recommended removing Ms. Kelly based on one charge of improper conduct supported by 11 specifications. The deciding official, Ms. Sandra Bain, sustained specifications 1-7 and 10-11 and determined to remove Ms. Kelly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Three weeks before Ms. Bain issued the Agency's decision, Dr. Clark sent Ms. Bain an email opposing the proposed removal. In the email, Dr. Clark provided an extensive character reference and further suggested Dr. Craig White (the program deputy district manager) and Doctor Jeffrey Legg (Compliance Deputy District Manager of the Minneapolis district office) could also attest that Ms. Kelly is an honest employee. Ms. Bain contacted Dr. White and Dr. Legg. Both doctors provided negative comments. Ms. Kelly, however, was not notified of their comments until receiving the decision letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board dismissed Ms. Bain's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with Drs. White and Legg as harmless, stating "the key determination whether a violation of the appellant's due process rights occurred is whether the challenged <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication improperly determined the outcome of the disciplinary decision." In support of this proposition, the Board cited <span class="Italic">Blake v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 394 (1999) and <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 720 F.2d 1266 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The Board further noted Ms. Bain testified that she was the deciding official and that no one in the Minneapolis District Office tried to influence her decision. The Board also noted Ms. Bain testified in determining Ms. Kelly's credibility. Ms. Bain noted that she relied on the statements in the investigation and not the conversation with Dr. White.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As this court has previously explained, <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications rising to the level of a procedural due process violation cannot be excused as harmless error. <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> 179 F.3d at 1377. An adversary's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications to a deciding official render that official's claims of a lack of influence unavailing. <span class="Italic">See Camero v. United States,</span> 375 F.2d 777, 780 (Ct. Cl. 1967) ("After listening to and discussing with each attorney his views on the case, Wolverton stated that he formed his own opinion.... We have no doubt that Wolverton formed his own opinion on what recommendations he should make to General Anderson, just as we have no doubt that General Anderson made up his own mind when he decided to sustain plaintiff's removal. The problem is, however, that both decisions were made, at least in part, on the basis of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication..."); <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1372 (finding a due process violation even though "[i]n an affidavit, the deciding official stated that he would have concluded that Mr. Stone should be removed whether or not he had seen the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> memo from the proposing official").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the Board's reliance on <span class="Italic">Blake</span> and <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> is misplaced. The communication in <span class="Italic">Blake</span> concerned an alleged threat from a congressman communicated to the deciding official from a Department of Justice attorney. <span class="Italic">Blake,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. at 413. The <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication was discounted because the evidence of record suggested the threat was not credible and the deciding official knew the threat was not credible. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 414. Indeed, the Board further noted, "it is plain that such evidence of an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication from a non-disinterested adversary, had it been presented and found credible, could indeed have so tainted the disciplinary decision process that the appellant's due process rights would have been irretrievably compromised." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sullivan,</span> the petitioner's commanding officer sent a letter to the deciding official recommending the petitioner's removal without sending a copy to the petitioner. <span class="Italic">Sullivan,</span> 720 F.2d at 1270. The commanding officer also made several follow up phone calls urging a quick decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This court held the commander's communications were improperly <span class="Italic">ex parte</span>. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1274 (noting "where a serious procedural curtailment mars an adverse personnel action which deprives the employee of pay, the court has regularly taken the position that the defect divests the removal (or demotion) of legality, leaving the employee on the rolls of the employing agency and entitled to his pay until proper procedural steps are taken toward removing or disciplining him.") (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, Ms. Bain contacted Drs. White and Legg (knowing the doctors had already taken a position adverse to Ms. Kelly in the record) and received further negative comments. At that point, Ms. Bain had a duty to notify Ms. Kelly and provide her an opportunity to respond before reaching a decision. Ms. Kelly's opportunity to address Drs. White's and Legg's comments before the Board after the Agency's decision was final and on appeal does not render the error harmless. <span class="Italic">Sullivan,</span> 720 F.2d at 1273 (holding that the opportunity to defend against an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication on appeal does not render the error harmless because the error is committed when the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> statements are made to the first deciding official who could decide the case in favor of the employee). This procedural defect overrides the Agency's contention that Ms. Kelly would likely have been removed on the merits of the charge without this procedural defect. <span class="Italic">Ryder v. United States,</span> 585 F.2d 482, 487 (Ct. Cl. 1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In upholding Ms. Bain's removal, the Administrative Judge found the penalty reasonable based on the sustained charges of a false statement and computer misuse. On remand, the Board will have an opportunity to review the considerable dispute in the record about computer policy in the Minneapolis district office, including many admissions of personal uses of government computers in the Minneapolis district office, including from both Drs. White and Legg. The Board may also review the record showing that others watched television in the office. The Board will also have an opportunity to reexamine the time card data showing that on seven of the twelve dates in question the alleged time claimed and not worked was less than ten minutes, including an allegation of three minutes. Altogether ten of the twelve dates allege shortfalls of sixteen minutes or less. On remand, the Board may consider whether this record fully supports a finding of intentional falsity in Ms. Kelly's statement that "I always make up time."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But another court decision implicitly retreated to what amounted to a harmful error test. In <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 244 Fed. Appx. 322, 324 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), involving some information learned by the deciding official after issuance of the removal proposal involving an employee who was alleged to have misused government time and vehicles and falsified travel documents, the information was apparently initially brought to the attention of the deciding official by the employee himself. Perhaps the court could have stopped there on a determination that no <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication occurred; however, the court went on to declare:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication occurred when the Deciding Official, Ms. Capell, discovered for herself that "in 1996, the Department of the Air Force removed the appellant from a civil service position and that in 1997, the Smithsonian Institution told [Mr. Mullins] to 'look for a new job.'" Indeed, the only "communication" that occurred was when Mr. Mullins communicated with Ms. Capell to bring to her attention the negative information about himself "by suggesting he had been subject to Board proceedings before." <span class="Italic">Ex parte</span> communications are procedural defects only when they cause prejudice that undermines due process guarantees. Because Mr. Mullins' two prior job losses did not affect Ms. Capell's decision to remove Mr. Mullins, the record shows no prejudice. Indeed, on April 22, 2005, before Ms. Capell discovered Mr. Mullins' two prior job losses, Mr. Grahl had already outlined 102 specifications to support the four charges of misuse and misconduct against Mr. Mullins.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, as clearly stated in the Initial Decision, the AJ knew the "removal" from federal service actually involved a settlement agreement where the Air Force agreed to pay Mr. Mullins in exchange for withdrawing his removal appeal. The AJ even noted that the Air Force was reluctant to expunge Mr. Mullins' employment records. Thus, this record shows no violations of due process guarantees. As a result, this court finds the Board's decision to affirm Mr. Mullins' removal is supported by substantial evidence, and substantively and procedurally in accordance with the law.</p>
