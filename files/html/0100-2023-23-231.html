<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-229"><span class="space">18.</span> Unlawful Provision</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the Board's split approach to problems involving settlement--use of a PFR to set an agreement aside that is invalid and use of enforcement proceedings to either enforce or set aside an agreement that is breached--if an agreement contains a material unlawful provision, a PFR can be used to attempt to nullify the agreement. If, however, a party seeks to enforce a provision that is unlawful, the Board will set aside the agreement rather than enforce the improper provision if the nonbreaching party is unwilling to live with the agreement without its unlawful provision. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-055.html#sec16-56">Provision Unlawful or Contrary to Public Policy</a>"; refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-169.html#sec2-167">Illegal or Punitive Term</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Legally unsupportable back pay obligations incurred through a settlement led to a Board order denying enforcement and directing reinstatement of an appeal in <span class="Italic">Stipp v. Dept. of Army</span>, 61 MSPR 415, 418-20 (1994). The theory employed by the Board was mutual mistake, although the error was essentially that of the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement must be set aside if it is tainted with invalidity either by fraud practiced upon a party or by a mutual mistake under which both parties acted. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 45 MSPR 263, 266 (1990). Although the agency asserts that it has complied in full with the settlement agreement, the logic of its argument is that the term of the agreement requiring it to pay the appellant $8,100 in back pay is illegal. As we explain below, we agree that this provision exceeded the agency's authority and find that the settlement agreement must be set aside because both parties acted under a mutual mistake as to the lawfulness of this material provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously held that an agency may not lawfully undertake in a settlement agreement to provide an appellant with benefits which the agency lacks authority to provide. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 45 MSPR at 267-68 (settlement provision providing administrative leave with pay for extended period of time was not lawful because agency lacked authority to spend appropriated funds in this fashion); <span class="Italic">accord, McDavid v. Department of the Army</span>, 46 MSPR 108, 111-12 (1990). In these cases, the Board was guided by decisions of the Comptroller General which the Board found persuasive. <span class="Italic">McDavid</span>, 46 MSPR at 111.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Comptroller General has also addressed the issue of limits on awards of back pay in settlements under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, concluding that federal agencies may not agree to awards which exceed the maximum amount which would be recoverable under Title VII if a finding of discrimination were made. <span class="Italic">Matter of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 62 Comp. Gen. 239, 244 (1983). The opinion cites <span id="Page_5147"></span>the Back Pay Act regulations for the rule concerning how the maximum amount payable is computed because the Act applies to settlements as well as to remedies which are based on an appropriate authority's finding of an unwarranted personnel action. "Generally, the maximum amount...is the gross amount of backpay the employee lost minus any interim earnings and other deductions listed in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.806(e)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 245. <span class="Italic">Accord</span>, <span class="Italic">Matter of Albert Parker</span>, 64 Comp. Gen. 349, 353 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same rule applies to all federal employment cases because, whether or not discrimination is claimed, corrective action by the agency is limited by the requirement that appropriated funds may be used only for authorized purposes. <span class="Italic">See</span> 31 USC &#x00A7; 1301(a). The sole applicable authority for the payments at issue here is the Back Pay Act, which by its terms limits the amount of awards which may be made to employees for lost compensation. Because an agency may not lawfully agree to pay more in compensation than the Act would permit, the agency's promise here to pay the appellant a larger sum in compensation for back pay was illegal and cannot be enforced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant objects, and the administrative judge found, that it is too late, after the decision dismissing the appeal as settled became final, for the agency to raise the unlawfulness of a term of the agreement. This view is incorrect. When the issue arises in an enforcement proceeding, the Board is entitled to address the validity of a settlement agreement and to set it aside if it is unlawful. <span class="Italic">See McDavid v. Department of the Army</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Indeed, the Board lacks authority to enforce an agency's agreement to make payments which are not authorized by statute. <span class="Italic">Cf. Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 110 S. Ct. 2465, 110 L. Ed.2d 387 (1990) (payments of money from the Treasury are limited to those authorized by statute, and an employee's erroneous advice to a claimant will not estop the Government from denying benefits not otherwise permitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The provision entitling the appellant to at least $8,100 in back pay was a principal term of the settlement, one which was material to the agreement and was relied on by the parties before the Board. Under these circumstances, where the parties to an agreement were mutually mistaken as to the lawfulness of a material provision, the Board will set aside the agreement. <span class="Italic">See McDavid v. Department of the Army</span>, 46 MSPR at 111.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another agreement foundered because the agency committed to a pay retention scheme that was inconsistent with statutes and regulations. The Board offered the appellant the choice between rescinding the agreement or accepting the remaining benefits of the settlement, <span class="Italic">Day v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 78 MSPR 364, 367-69 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, when an agency is in breach of a settlement agreement, the appellant has the option of enforcing the agreement, or rescinding the agreement and reinstating the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fuller v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 45 MSPR 611, 614 (1990). That option is not available here, however, because, as explained above, paragraph 2.d. of the settlement agreement provides for a combination of benefits that is not authorized by law. Accordingly, paragraph 2.d. cannot be enforced before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Stipp v. Department of the Army</span>, 61 MSPR 415, 420 (1994) ("[t]he Board lacks authority to enforce an agency's agreement to make payments which are not authorized by statute."); <span class="Italic">see also In re Ragunas,</span> 68 Comp. Gen. 97 (1988) (regardless of what the agency promised an employee, it could not be forced to provide retained grade and pay benefits that were not consistent with statute).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency asks that the settlement agreement be set aside, rescission of the agreement would not be appropriate at this stage. We acknowledge that in <span class="Italic">Stipp</span> the Board ordered rescission of a settlement agreement on the ground that the parties were mutually mistaken about the legality of one of its provisions. There, however, the Board expressly found that the unlawful provision was a "principal term" and "material to the agreement." <span class="Italic">See</span> 61 MSPR at 420; <span class="Italic">see also Townsel v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 33 MSPR 456 (1987) (a settlement agreement may be set aside on the basis of mutual mistake of "material" fact). In this case, by contrast, it is not immediately clear that the parties' mistaken belief that the appellant could receive step increases and locality adjustments while on pay retention was material. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">As'Salaam v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 MSPR 417, 421 (1994) (a mistake of fact is "material" if it involves a "basic assumption" underlying an agreement), <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed,</span> 47 F.3d 1184 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Defense,</span> 45 MSPR 263, 268 (1990) (a settlement term was found to be "material" where it was "central to the agreement and numerous other provisions of the agreement [were] dependent upon it").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More important, the appellant seeks enforcement of the settlement agreement, but he has not asked for rescission in the event that paragraph 2.d. is found to be unlawful. The appellant, who is the master of his petition for enforcement, now knows that paragraph 2.d. cannot be enforced. If he wishes to argue that the provision for step increases and locality adjustments was a material term, and that the agreement should be rescinded based on mutual mistake as in <span class="Italic">Stipp,</span> he may do so. Considering the length of time that has passed since the parties entered into the settlement agreement (nearly three years), and considering the fact that the parties appear to have performed all of their obligations under the agreement with the exception of the portion of paragraph 2 d. relating to pay, the appellant may wish not to have the agreement rescinded and the appeal reinstated. Under the circumstances we will not force rescission on him. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 17 C.J.S. &#x00A7; 289 (the general rule is that a contract which is otherwise lawful is not invalid merely because it contains an unlawful promise; this rule takes on added significance when there has been partial performance of the legal parts). We see no impediment to severing the unenforceable portion of paragraph 2.d.--specifically, the part that requires step increases and locality adjustments--from the rest of the agreement, and enforcing the rest of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (a court often chooses to enforce the portions of a contract that can be enforced, despite other contract terms that cannot be given effect because of illegality); Corbin on Contracts &#x00A7; 1520 (a contract containing an illegal term may be enforced in part by severing the illegal term from the rest of the agreement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case bears some resemblance to <span class="Italic">Gullette v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 569 (1996). There, the appellant could not obtain enforcement of a particular settlement term as she reasonably interpreted it because enforcement would violate a collective bargaining agreement. Although she was entitled to rescission of the agreement, rescission was not forced on her. Rather, she was given the option of rescinding the agreement and reinstating the appeal, or accepting the agreement under the agency's interpretation, that is, not having the disputed settlement term enforced as she reasonably understood it. Similarly, in this case the appellant cannot obtain compliance with paragraph 2.d. insofar as it obligates the agency to provide him with step increases and locality adjustments, but he should not be forced to have the agreement rescinded if he is content to have the remainder of the agreement, including pay retention, enforced. The appeal must be remanded to allow the appellant to choose a course.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two final points deserve discussion. The agency contends that paragraph 2.d. of the settlement agreement is entirely unlawful because it mandates that the appellant receive a GS-9 salary while performing WG-7 work. According to the agency, paragraph 2.d. violates 5 USC &#x00A7; 5301, which provides that "[i]t is the policy of Congress that Federal pay fixing for employees under the General Schedule be based on principles that...there be equal pay for substantially equal work within each local pay area...." We disagree. Section 5301 by its own terms is a policy underlying the federal pay system, not an ironclad rule mandating absolute uniformity in pay among all individual employees engaged in similar work. Pay retention, grade retention, and periodic step increases illustrate this point; all of these entitlements, which Congress itself authorized, can result in employees who do identical work receiving dissimilar salaries. Moreover, the agency's argument rests on a faulty factual premise; the appellant will be paid less than an employee holding a GS-9 position, as the formula limiting pay increases for employees on pay retention makes clear. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 5363(a). Simply put, section 5301 does not bar an agency from agreeing to provide an employee with pay retention in settlement of litigation, where pay retention itself is authorized by statute and is routinely afforded to employees adversely affected by reorganizations (upon the expiration of grade retention). The shortcoming in the settlement agreement was not the provision for GS-9 pay retention, but the additional commitments the agency made that are not consistent with pay retention.</p>

Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-16-0189-I-1 (NP 2/6/2023), offered, as the Board remanded to the AJ for further adjudication, including evidence of whether the invalid provision was severable:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alternatively, an illegal portion of a settlement agreement may be severed and the remaining legal provisions may be enforced if the "legal promises on one side...[are] wholly supported by legal promises on the other, and the illegal portion of the contract does not go to its essence." 8 Williston on Contracts &#x00A7; 19.73 (4th ed. 2018); <span class="Italic">see Day</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 368 <span id="Page_5148"></span>(recognizing that the Board may sever a nonmaterial, illegal term and enforce the rest of the agreement)....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Extrinsic evidence of intent may be considered here because the parties' intent as to the severability provision and the materiality of the DNA-testing provision are both ambiguous. <span class="Italic">See Mital</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6; 6....</p>
