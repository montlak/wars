<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-151"><span class="space">5.</span> Back Pay Dispute</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Until 1984, the Board took the position that back pay issues were not within its statutory jurisdiction. The official position was that issues relating to back pay were generally to be resolved between the individual employee and his agency. Failing that, the dispute should be settled by the General Accounting Office. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barry v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 14 MSPR 561, 566 (1983) (dispute over leave); <span class="Italic">Culbertson v. VA</span>, 10 MSPR 32 (1982) (dispute over leave balance following the Board's reversal of removal); <span class="Italic">Strickland v. VA</span>, 5 MSPR 526, 528, 5 MSPB 517 (1981) (denial of a continuation of standby pay); <span class="Italic">Bradford v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2 MSPR 598, 600, 3 MSPB 115 (1980) (back pay claim arising out of grievance proceeding). Under <span class="Italic">Tanaka v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 21 MSPR 278, 279-80 (1984), the Board would order back pay as part of a remedy, but specific back pay issues were to be resolved with the agency or through the Comptroller General. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 21 MSPR 270, 272 (1984), held that, under 5 USC 1205(a)(1) (final decisions) and 5 USC 1201(a)(2) (compliance) [now 5 USC 1204(a)(1) and (2)], the Board would generally "exercise authority to order back pay as appropriate in its review of the personnel actions subject to its jurisdiction."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board modified its position concerning back pay issues as a result of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Kerr v. Nat'l Endowment for Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984), involving review of the Board's manner of canceling Mr. Kerr's involuntary termination from his position, as well as review of allegations that he had not been returned to his original position. [<span class="Italic">Kerr</span> is discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-23-157.html#sec16-154">Reinstatement to the Same Position; <span class="Italic">Status Quo Ante</span> Remedy</a>," concerning sham compliance and reassignments.] Following <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, the Board advanced in <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro v. FAA</span>, 24 MSPR 25, 26-30 (1984), overruling past decisions rejecting its role in back pay disputes. Under <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro,</span> the Board has authority to adjudicate the merits of petitions for enforcement that allege computational errors or omissions in agency awards of back pay to appellants who prevail before the Board. The Board will instruct the agency to calculate and pay the amount of back pay due. Back pay includes pay, allowances, and differentials under 5 USC 5596(b)(1), and employment benefits established for the employee under law or regulation pursuant to 5 CFR 550.803 (2022). The Board analyzed its jurisdiction and authority in <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro</span>, and determined that it should have no less ability to <span id="Page_4994"></span>direct a back pay award than the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the EEOC, or an arbitrator:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Back Pay Act provides for entitlement to back pay to an employee who lost pay as a result of a personnel action that was reversed by an "appropriate authority," including the Board. 5 USC 5596(b)(1); 5 CFR 550.803 (1984). OPM regulations require the employee's agency to determine the amount of back pay due the employee following reversal of a personnel action<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 550.805(a) (1984). Although the agency's authority to determine the amount of back pay is not exclusive, OPM's regulations contemplate that ordinarily the determination will be made initially by the agency<span class="Italic">. See White v. Bloomberg</span>, 501 F.2d 1379, 1384-85 &#x0026; n.9 (4th Cir. 1974) (interpreting similar Civil Service Commission regulations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's authority to review the merits of an agency's initial determination of a back pay award derives from both Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978 and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Reorganization Plan redesignated the former Civil Service Commission (CSC) as the Board, CSC's authority under the former 5 USC 1104 and 7701 (1976) to adjudicate appeals, to recommend final corrective action, and to enforce its decisions was expressly specified to remain with the Board. Reorganization Plan No. 2 &#x00A7; 202, (May 23, 1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 9801, 9803-04.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Numerous courts have ruled that under the former section 7701, CSC had authority to order agencies to award back pay<span class="Italic">. E.g., Goodwin v. United States</span>, 118 F. Supp. 369, 370-71 (Ct. Cl. 1954); <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Civil Service Commission</span>, 407 F. Supp. 380, 383-86 (D.D.C. 1975), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 554 F.2d 1186 (D.C. Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">Wettre v. Hague</span>, 74 F. Supp. 396, 399 (D. Mass. 1947), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 168 F.2d 825 (1st Cir. 1948); <span class="Italic">Fischer v. Haeberle</span>, 80 F. Supp. 652, 656 (E.D.N.Y. 1948); <span class="Italic">see Sampson v. Murray</span>, 415 U.S. 61, 75 (1974) (stating in <span class="Italic">dictum</span> that CSC could "conceivably" accommodate conflicting claims in the case by "ordering that [the appellant] receive back pay" for a certain period). CSC also had authority to review the merits of agency back pay awards resulting from CSC decisions. 5 CFR 550.805 (1978). As CSC had authority under section 7701 to order agencies to award back pay and to review the merits of such awards, the Board inherited that authority from CSC pursuant to the Reorganization Plan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Reform Act gave the Board a broad grant of power to take "final action" on matters within its jurisdiction, to "order" agencies to comply with its decisions, and to "enforce compliance" with its orders. 5 USC 1205(a). The legislative history of that provision emphasized the breadth of the Board's authority<span class="Italic">. See</span> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 29, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2723, 2751. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has interpreted section 1205(a) as constituting a "broad grant of enforcement power" for the Board<span class="Italic">. Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although section 1205(a) does not specifically state that the Board has authority to order awards of back pay and to review the merits of those awards, Congress undoubtedly knew that CSC had such authority and that the Board would inherit that authority from CSC pursuant to Reorganization plan No. 2. Thus, it was unnecessary for Congress to provide specifically in the Reform Act for Board authority in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the language of the former section 7701, which required agencies to "take the corrective action that the Commission finally recommends," is not identical to the language of section 1205(a), the powers granted to the Board by the latter section to take "final action" on appeals, to "order" agencies to "comply with any order or decision" of the Board, and to "enforce compliance" therewith are at least as broad as the powers granted to CSC under the former section 7701. Moreover, in section 3(3) of the Reform Act, Congress stated that, "[f]ederal employees should receive appropriate protection through <span class="Italic">increasing</span> the authority and powers of the Merit Systems Protection Board in processing hearings and appeals affecting federal employees." 5 USCA 1101 note (West Supp. 1984) (emphasis added). The former Court of Claims has stated regarding CSC's authority under section 7701 that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When Congress authorized the Civil Service Commission to hear the demoted veteran's appeal and recommend to the employing agency correction of its treatment of him, it could not have been unaware that the most important element of relief for wrongful demotion, next to restoration to his former status, was back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Goodwin v. United States</span>, 118 F. Supp. 369, 371 (Ct. Cl. 1954). As the Board's powers under section 1205(a) are equal to, if not greater than, those granted to CSC under the former section 7701, the reasoning of the Court of Claims is equally applicable to Congress' intent in promulgating section 1205(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of a Board order cancelling a personnel action is to place the employee as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante. Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Because back pay is the most important element of relief next to reinstatement, <span class="Italic">Goodwin</span>, 118 F. Supp. at 371, Board action of reviewing the merits of back pay awards is an element of the Board's enforcement power necessary to effectuate the purpose of both the Board's reinstatement order and the Congressional intent that the Board's enforcement power be broad.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's prior decisions such as <span class="Italic">Ritchey</span> and <span class="Italic">Blanchard</span> ruling that the Board lacked authority to order back pay and enforce such orders were based on the holding of <span class="Italic">Bradford v. Department of the Army</span>, 3 MSPB 115 (1980). The Board held in <span class="Italic">Bradford</span> that it lacked jurisdiction to review agency denials of back pay that were unrelated to a personnel action over which the Board had jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. Bradford</span> was correctly based on the fact that no law, rule, or regulation provides for Board jurisdiction over agency denials of back pay <span class="Italic">per se</span>. However, in light of the Federal Circuit's recent decision in <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984), we have reevaluated the reasoning of the Board's prior decisions such as <span class="Italic">Ritchey</span> and <span class="Italic">Blanchard</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, the Federal Circuit ruled that the Board was required to make a "substantive evaluation" of an employee's allegation that the agency had reinstated him to a "sham" position which existed only on paper following the Board's reversal of his wrongful discharge. Despite the fact that the agency's action appeared to constitute a reassignment, which is not appealable to the Board <span class="Italic">per se,</span> the court reasoned that the agency's action should not be viewed as an original personnel action, and that the Board's authority to enforce its decisions included more than a formal determination that the employee had been reinstated to a position bearing the same title, grade, and pay--regardless of the actual content of the position<span class="Italic">. Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 732-33.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, an alleged denial of back pay following Board reversal of an unwarranted personnel action is not an original personnel action, and the Board's authority to enforce its decisions includes more than a formal determination that an agency has awarded back pay--regardless of the correctness of the award. As we have stated in a different context, the Board's enforcement power is "continuing in nature," and "subsequent agency action concerning a prevailing appellant, even if not constituting a matter otherwise directly appealable to the Board, may be the subject of a petition (for enforcement) if, for example, the agency's cancellation of appellant's removal is a mere subterfuge while other actions are taken to avoid substantive compliance." <span class="Italic">Meier v. Department of the Interior</span>, 3 MSPB 341, 350 n.8 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the courts have not ruled specifically on the Board's authority to award back pay and enforce such awards, the action of several courts shows that they regard such authority as properly within the Board's power<span class="Italic">. See Sullivan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266, 1276 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (ordering the Board to order back pay); <span class="Italic">McLeod v. Department of the Army</span>, 714 F.2d 918, 922 (9th Cir. 1983) (ordering the Board to determine whether a charge was sustained and, if so, to assess a penalty consistent with the agency's table of penalties and to "determine the appropriate award of back pay"); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Justice</span>, 715 F.2d 662, 670 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (ordering the Board to determine the "appropriate amount of back pay").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Board authority to award back pay and enforce such awards is consistent with Congress' intent to discourage forum shopping between the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) and the Board, <span class="Italic">see</span> H.R. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 153, 157, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2860, 2891 (the Conference Report); S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 111, 1979 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News at 2833, and between EEOC and the Board, <span class="Italic">see</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969 at 53, 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News at 2775.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee covered by a negotiated grievance procedure elects arbitration instead of filing an appeal with the Board, the arbitrator and, on review, the FLRA have specific statutory authority to award back pay. 5 USC 7118(a)(7)(C), 7122(b); 2 FLRA 1493 (1983). That authority includes resolution of claims concerning the merits of awards made by agencies pursuant to arbitrators' awards and orders from FLRA<span class="Italic">. See</span> 62 Com. Gen. 274 (1983). When an employee elects to file a discrimination complaint on a mixed case instead of appealing to the Board, EEOC has specific statutory authority to order back pay and to enforce compliance with such orders. 42 USC 2000e-16(b); <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 CFR 1613.271 (1983). If employees can obtain the important element of back pay from FLRA and EEOC, but not from the Board, such a disparity would tend to encourage forum shopping in contravention of Congress' intent in enacting the Reform Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Board's former view that it lacked authority to enforce back pay awards, the employee was required to seek relief from a different administrative agency, the General Accounting Office (GAO), <span class="Italic">see</span> 4 CFR Parts 31, 32 (1984), or to file suit in either the Claims Court or a federal district court, depending on the amount involved. However, in view of our holding in the present case, prevailing appellants are no longer required to seek backpay in another agency or in the courts.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A back pay dispute may arise under either a Board final decision on the merits or a settlement agreement accepted by the Board. In either case, <span id="Page_4995"></span>enforcement proceedings are employed to resolve the dispute. <span class="Italic">Sims v. DOJ</span>, 39 MSPR 332, 336 (1988). As to agencies, if there is an issue concerning the duty to provide back pay, the issue ordinarily must be raised as a challenge to the initial decision ordering back pay; the agency may not launch a collateral attack on the initial decision by allowing that decision to become final and then challenging its duty to pay the employee in compliance proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. OPM</span>, 61 MSPR 252, 255 (1994) ("[i]n an enforcement proceeding, the agency is estopped from relitigating an issue which was resolved by the AJ and which became the final decision of the Board."); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 398, 400 (1991) ("The agency is estopped from raising the issue of the appropriateness of the constructive suspension at this [enforcement] procedural stage of the case, since the appeal period expired without action from the agency, and the agency has thus waived its right to contest the merits of the suspension."); <span class="Italic">Blackmer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 624, 632-33 (1991) ("The issues the agency raises in its motion regarding the merits would properly have been challenged in a petition for review. Whenever an agency disagrees with an initial decision, or any part of it, it is incumbent on the agency to file a petition for review within 35 days of the issuance of the initial decision.... Although the agency indicated to the appellant its intent to so file, it failed to do so. Consequently, the initial decision became final and the time for review expired.... Furthermore, the agency cannot reargue the merits of an action in a proceeding on the employee's petition for enforcement." (also denying petition to reopen in lieu of a PFR)); <span class="Italic">Dwyer v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 181, 185 (1987) (as to the appellant's fitness to work, an issue decided on the merits by AJ: "Findings have been made on this issue by the administrative judge. The agency's opportunity to attack these findings has passed. No further evidence need be submitted by the appellant and the matter will not be relitigated."); <span class="Italic">Ferry v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 63, 64-65 (1986) ("The Board agrees with appellant that at this procedural stage of the case, the agency is now estopped from raising the issue of the appropriateness of back pay[.]"). The agency may require that the appellant provide information that will allow it to compute a back pay award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bradley v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 110, 113 &#x00B6; 8 (1998) (enforcement of a settlement; use of PS Form 8038 requesting information as to the appellant's interim earnings and ability to work during the period of the back pay claim).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The back pay obligation extends only to the claim covered by an appeal. If an employee files an appeal from a removal and could have but did not contest earlier enforced leave, the remedial authority of the Board is limited to ensuring restoration of the back pay lost following the removal. The enforced leave status may not be raised for the first time during compliance proceedings. <span class="Italic">Redding v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 187, 190 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Crippen v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 522, 524 (1987) (enforcement authority in one action, demotion, may not be used to secure relief for a constructive suspension that was not appealed).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In practice, when the Board directs an agency to cancel an adverse action, it gives the agency a set period of time to provide backpay to the employee. The agency then usually writes to the appellant and the appellant's counsel asking for a signed, possibly sworn, statement as to interim earnings and unemployment compensation. If there is an issue of the employee's availability for work during the backpay period, the agency will request information pertaining to the employee's fitness to work during that period. There is no fixed format that is followed. Agency lawyers and personnelists will develop their inquiries based on the circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 550.805 (2022) ("Back pay computations") and 5 CFR Part 550, Subpart H, Appendix A: "Information on Computing Certain Common Deductions From Back Pay Awards").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On challenge to the accuracy or adequacy of its records or compilations, the agency should be directed by the AJ to supply additional information to permit the Board to evaluate its figures and to permit the appellant to review them in order to determine whether there is any disagreement with those figures or records. <span class="Italic">Nielson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 630, 632-33 (1987) (Board agreed that the information supplied to the appellant was insufficiently specific for him to identify possible payroll errors). Although the party alleging breach of a settlement agreement has the burden of proof, the agency must produce evidence of its compliance and, to that end, the AJ should ensure that an agency complies with reasonable requests from an appellant concerning calculation of back pay and deductions. <span class="Italic">Sims v. DOJ</span>, 39 MSPR 332, 336 (1988) (lacking proper information from the agency concerning back pay computations, appellant cannot be expected to be specific concerning an allegation that the agency failed to comply with settlement's payment provisions). Nevertheless, the appellant's general allegation that the agency's calculations are "incomprehensible," unsupported by any documentary evidence or details that might better explain his objection, is insufficient to rebut the agency's showing of compliance. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 62 MSPR 212, 217 (1994) (appellant did not challenge the end result of the agency's calculations). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-130.html#sec16-128">Enforcement of MSPB Decision</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-23-140.html#sec16-138">Duty to Supply Information; Accounting</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board still shows some reluctance to become involved in certain intricacies of back pay litigation. <span class="Italic">Quackenbush v. DOJ</span>, 45 MSPR 543, 544 (1990), required consideration of a dispute over the amount of tax that the agency should have withheld from the appellant's back pay, garnered through a settlement. The Board threw the dispute back to the parties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board...is an administrative tribunal with limited jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Hipona v. Department of Army</span>, 39 MSPR 522, 525 (1989). The question of whether the amount of income tax withheld from appellant's back-pay award is in accordance with the applicable law, rule, or regulation is one that does not fall within our limited jurisdiction. Appellant should, therefore, seek relief in another forum.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board offered no explanation in <span class="Italic">Quackenbush</span> how it had authority to order back pay and enforce compliance with a back pay order, but then eschewed consideration of a dispute over the propriety of deductions from back pay. Previously, the Board routinely reviewed the propriety of deductions from back pay for various obligations, e.g., medical and life insurance premiums, and unemployment compensation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scales v. USPS</span>, AT-0353-11-0175-X-1 (NP 7/23/2013) ("Finally, the appellant seeks an order relieving her of her tax obligations with regard to her back pay and workers' compensation payments. The Board does not have jurisdiction to consider tax relief or withholding issues, however. <span class="Italic">Quackenbush v. Department of Justice</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 543, 544 (1990)."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Wyatt v.
