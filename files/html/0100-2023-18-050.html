<h5 class="h5" id="sec11-51"><span class="space">f.</span> Assessing Sufficiency of Charge</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">As a matter of constitutional due process, a charge should be reasonably specific to provide adequate notice of the conduct to be defended. Although it was not addressing a Title 5 adverse action, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Smith</span>, 116 MSPR 520, 521-23 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-8, 2011 MSPB 69 (2011), offered analysis of due process considerations taken from Title 5 adverse action decisions in a Hatch Act case brought by the Special Counsel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The core of due process is the right to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Erickson</span>, 522 U.S. 262, 266 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. 532, 542 (1985)). In this regard, due process mandates that notice be sufficiently detailed to make the reply opportunity meaningful. <span class="Italic">Barresi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 666 (1994); <span class="Italic">see Goldberg v. Kelly,</span> 397 U.S. 254, 267-68 (1970). In keeping with this principle, the Board's regulations mandate that when OSC files a written complaint alleging a violation, the complaint must state "with particularity any alleged violations of law or regulation, along with the supporting facts." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.123; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1215(a)(1), 1216.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC's complaint lacked this necessary particularity and supporting facts. With respect to the alleged e-mails, OSC did not identify the dates the e-mails were sent, the recipients, or the content, other than to state that the content was purportedly intended to aid the Obama campaign. The alleged documents drafted or edited by the respondent were "website materials and speech outlines" but, once again, the content of the documents was not described with any specificity. Furthermore, the complaint also did not contain any attachments or copies of the documents to identify the specific e-mails or materials that constituted the basis for its charges. Similarly, the location where the offenses occurred was not described other than a statement that the appellant engaged in the alleged conduct "while in a room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, OSC asserts that its complaint met the Board's requirements for particularity. OSC asserts that "[n]othing in the Board's regulations or case law require [sic] that the complaint outline each specific instance of Respondent's political activity." OSC is mistaken; outlining each specification is precisely what OSC is required to do. As the administrative law judge correctly noted, "[T]he Board has consistently held that a party must know of the claims with which he is being charged so that he may adequately prepare and present a defense." <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 50, 57 (1991); <span class="Italic">see Special Counsel v. Nielson</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 161, 179 (1996) (stating that, although the complaint in an OSC disciplinary action need not state every one of OSC's legal theories, it must provide the respondent with sufficient notice of OSC's claims to allow him to prepare a defense); <span class="Italic">Hartigan v. Veterans Administration,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 613, 618 (1989); <span class="Italic">Lockett v. U.S. Marine Corps,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 427, 429 (1988). A respondent cannot be expected to prepare a defense to each specification of a charge unless each specification is listed with sufficient identifying information to permit the respondent to know what event is at issue in the case. Informing a respondent that he is charged with drafting and/or editing documents or sending e-mails in the year 2008 is not sufficient to provide a respondent with adequate knowledge of the alleged conduct that OSC believes violated the law. He must be put on notice regarding which documents and which e-mails OSC believes violated the law. It is true that OSC need not always describe each event down to the very minute, as OSC has done in its amended complaint, but a precisely drafted complaint serves the parties and the adjudicator well as it reduces the potential for confusion as to the conduct at issue. In contrast, a poorly drafted, vague complaint that does not inform a respondent precisely how OSC believes that he has violated the law and that does not inform a judge as to what must be adjudicated, serves no one--including OSC, given the risk such a complaint may be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC is correct that the Board does not require "that OSC attach all the documents supporting its charges" to its complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.123. However, the administrative law judge did not hold that OSC <span class="Italic">must</span> provide such attachments to its complaint; he merely noted that such documents might have provided the specificity that was lacking in OSC's written description of the alleged events in question. In a case where creating and sending documents constitute the alleged misconduct, attaching the documents to the complaint as exhibits and citing the relevant exhibit when listing the specifications is one method by which OSC can prevent confusion as to the conduct being charged and provide the requisite "supporting facts." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.123.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC asserts that the respondent did not receive the complaint "in a vacuum" and that OSC had interviewed the respondent twice prior to filing its complaint. OSC contends that as a result, "Respondent knew full well what the charges in the Complaint referenced." OSC's investigative interviews do not constitute a charging document, however. As OSC indicated on petition for review, during its interviews of the respondent, it presented him with "hundreds of pages...of documents," including "a large number of the e-mails at issue." The volume of documents presented to the respondent during the investigative process indicates that the interviews were not sufficiently focused to place him on notice of the precise allegations against him. <span class="Italic">See Brock v. Department of the Navy</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 564, 569 (1991) (holding that, under the circumstances of the case, interviewing the appellant was not sufficient to make her aware of the exact nature of the charges against her). Further, OSC seems to concede that, during the interviews, it did not provide the respondent with all of the e-mails it considered problematic. Accordingly, we conclude that the administrative law judge correctly determined that OSC's December 10, 2009 complaint should be dismissed.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Both the petitioner and the respondent have cited the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in support of their positions with respect to the dismissal of the complaint. However, as the administrative law judge correctly noted, the Board is not bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure but looks to them for guidance. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v.

<p class="Body-Text">Although an agency is required to state the reasons for a proposed adverse action in sufficient detail to allow the employee to make an informed reply, the charge must be viewed relative to the accompanying specifications and circumstances; it should not be technically construed. <span class="Italic">Hudson v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3178"></span>The Board declined to find a charge void for vagueness, <span class="Italic">Ragolia v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 295, 301 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In arguing that charge one is vague, the appellant takes an unduly mechanistic approach which improperly focuses on the charge alone, and ignores that the question before us "is not the adequacy of the...pleading but is the fairness of the whole procedure." 1 Davis, Administrative Law, sec. 8.04 at 525 (1958). Under 5 USC 7513(b), an employee against whom an adverse action is proposed is entitled to be informed of the specific reasons for the agency's proposed action. The information provided by the agency must be sufficiently specific to permit the employee to properly respond to the agency's charge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lockett v. U.S. Marine Corps</span>, 37 MSPR 427, 429 (1988). Thus, the determinative standard is whether the notice is sufficiently specific to permit a response.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another example of the Board's practical approach toward the construction of charges is <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 11 MSPR 239, 240 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant first argues that the presiding official misinterpreted the charge. The agency charged appellant with causing major damage to a Government contracted aircraft and endangering the lives of offloading ramp personnel. The specification supporting the charge stated that appellant disregarded the offloading instructions covered in two agency directives. The presiding official found that the agency did not identify any specific instruction disregarded by appellant in the first directive and that it was uncertain whether appellant was aware of the existence of the second directive. However, the presiding official concluded that the basis of the charge was not appellant's disregard of the directives, but the improper performance of his supervisory responsibilities. Appellant argues that the presiding official changed the charge in order to sustain the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon our review of the record, we do not find that the presiding official erred in his interpretation of the charge and we affirm his findings in this regard. We note that the basis purpose of the notice requirement is to inform the employee of the reasons for the proposed action "with sufficient particularity to apprise him of allegations he must refute or acts he must justify." <span class="Italic">Burkett v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States</span>, 402 F.2d 1002, 1004, 185 Ct. Cl. 631 (1968). The Board finds that appellant knew of what the charge consisted and had every opportunity to prepare his defense. While the agency may have phrased the specification differently, appellant knew he was basically being charged with negligence in the performance of his supervisory duties. <span class="Italic">See Hendricks v. Department of the Interior</span>, 9 MSPB 584, 10 MSPR 349 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wiginton v. VA</span>, 13 MSPR 450, 453 (1982), excused the failure specifically to charge falsification of documents when the essence of the charge was contained in the factual details of the specifications of the proposal letter:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that the presiding official erred in determining that the appellant was properly apprised that his removal was based on the charge of falsification of records. Appellant's letter of proposed removal does not mention such a charge. The agency's subsequent explanation of the conduct with which it intended to charge appellant, offered for the first time during his second oral response to the removal proposal, does not meet the notice requirement of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1). However, the Board does not find that appellant was substantially harmed by the error for the reasons set forth below. <span class="Italic">See Parker, supra.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the introductory sentence in the second paragraph of the removal proposal is somewhat unclear, the specifications themselves show that the basis of the removal action was a series of entries in Outpatient Worksheets indicating contacts made by appellant with outpatients in fourteen cases where no such contacts could have been made because those patients were no longer under the agency's supervision, in most cases because they were deceased. The Board finds that those specifications are sufficiently detailed to inform appellant of the factual basis for which his removal was proposed. <span class="Italic">See Plath v. Department of Justice</span>, 11 MSPB 65, 66, 12 MSPR 421, 423 (1982). This is not a case where the charge failed to provide appellant with sufficient notice of the basis for the adverse action to enable the appellant to respond to the charges. <span class="Italic">See Knuckles v. Bolger,</span> 654 F.2d 25 (8th Cir. 1981). The Board finds, further, that the agency proved 14 of the 17 specifications by a preponderance of the evidence for the reasons set out in the initial decision at 9-13.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goines v. USDA</span>, 113 Fed. Appx. 925, 929 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) (notice does not need to explicitly include every element of every charge underlying the proposed action; citing <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 526-27 (Fed. Cir. 1993)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant demonstrates that he understands the charges, despite their unusual construction, there is no harmful procedural error or due process denial, <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 97 MSPR 389, 391-94 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-15 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue at this stage of the appeal is whether the notice of proposed removal, along with the supporting documentation attached thereto and contemporaneously provided to the appellant, afforded him sufficient notice of the charges against him to enable him to make a meaningful reply to the proposal. In resolving this issue, the AJ combined concepts of both due process and harmful error. She held that the charges must be reversed under the harmful error doctrine, but she did not address whether the agency's purported procedural error resulted in harm to the appellant. Further, in her analysis of the issue, she discussed both minimum due process requirements and the statutory requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b). She then found that "these charges failed to meet the minimal due process of providing 'sufficient detail to allow the employee to make an informed reply,' and thus, constitute harmful procedural error." Under either theory, however, it is clear that the appellant received sufficient notice to enable him to make a meaningful reply to the notice of proposed removal. <span class="Italic">Rawls v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 614 &#x00B6; 21 (2003) (notice of the charge, an explanation of the agency's evidence, a pre-decisional opportunity for the appellant to tell his side of the story before the effective date of the removal, and a post-decisional right to file a Board appeal are all that minimum due process requires); <span class="Italic">Stephen v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991) (harmful error under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) cannot be presumed; an agency error is harmful only where the record shows that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's notice of proposed removal is a two-page document which identifies the charges in fairly conclusory fashion. As to the careless workmanship charge, the notice states, "The specific reasons used to support this proposed action are the 24 different discrepancies that have occurred since April 2002. These discrepancies are listed in the attached documentation." Attached to the notice of proposed removal was a two-page chart listing the 24 discrepancies on which the careless workmanship charge was based, as well as some 50 pages of supporting documentation, including the specific work orders and checklists underlying each specification of the careless workmanship charge, and witness statements concerning both charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the chart was "cryptic and not self-explanatory" and that its "meaning was not self-evident." On the contrary, our review of the chart shows that, despite the use of abbreviations and codes, most of its meaning is clear. For each specification, the chart identifies the date; the vehicle registration number; the work order number; the employee numbers of the various inspectors, supervisors, and technicians who worked on the vehicle; and the particular discrepancy noted, such as "windshield cracked" or "oil pan bolt leaking." <span class="Italic">cf. Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 203 (1997) (notice requirement satisfied where the agency's narrative charge contained dates, times, names of participants, exact quotes of the offensive language that the appellant purportedly used, and a detailed description of the alleged events of that morning). The discrepancies assessed against the appellant were noted with a checkmark, and there are 24 such checkmarks, which correspond to the 24 specifications of misconduct underlying the careless workmanship charge. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the meaning of the chart was not evident to the AJ, it clearly was evident to the appellant. The particular type of chart at issue had been in use by the agency since April 2002 as a means of tracking and assessing employee performance, and had been discussed with the appellant a number of times while he was on a performance improvement plan. In addition, the appellant had seen prior versions of this chart in a slightly different format, and he was familiar with the terms used in the chart.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ also found that the appellant's alleged inability to understand the charges against him was evidenced by his failure to respond in a substantive fashion to the charges at the reply stage. This finding is not supported by the record. In fact, the appellant did make a substantive response, although not to all specifications.[2] He specifically addressed the misuse of government equipment charge, and provided his version of the events underlying that charge. As to the careless workmanship charge, he responded to the specification concerning work order number F5459 by annotating on the chart that the "hydraulic leak top of cylinder" was not his fault, but instead was a contractor error, noting that the "vehicle had been sprayed paint under [sic]." He also indicated by annotation on the chart that he was aware that 24 rejects were being assessed against him. Further, he provided a narrative version of the events underlying work orders F5586 and F5653.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 150, 154 (1995) (although the agency referred to an AWOL charge as occurring on the incorrect date, the appellant's reply indicated that he understood what the correct date was and he affirmatively defended against the correct AWOL charge); <span class="Italic">Ragolia v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 295, 301-02 (1992) (notice requirement satisfied where the appellant demonstrated his understanding of the charges against him by responding to them in reply to the proposal); <span class="Italic">Coppola v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 307, 313 (1991) (where an appellant comes forward and refutes a charge made against him, the Board cannot find that he was not on notice of the charge); <span class="Italic">Lockett v. U.S. Marine Corps</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 427, 430 (1988) (that the appellant addressed the charge in his reply to the proposal indicated that he understood the <span id="Page_3179"></span>allegation); <span class="Italic">cf. Mason v. Department of the Navy</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 584, 588 (1996) (notice requirement not satisfied where the appellant was informed of the nature of the misconduct, but not when or where the alleged misconduct took place and, despite diligent discovery efforts, was surprised by the agency's presentation at the hearing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant provided substantive responses to several of the specifications in his discovery responses, which further demonstrates that he understood the nature of the charges against him. <span class="Italic">Cf. Campbell v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 92, 103 (1983) (the appellants' presentation at the hearing demonstrated that they understood the charges against them), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 735 F.2d 497 (Fed. Cir. 1984). He again provided his version of the events underlying the misuse of government equipment charge, and he provided a copy of his contemporaneous memorandum documenting the incident. He also provided his version of the events underlying the careless workmanship charge with respect to work order numbers F5653, F5586, F5459, F5318, and F4848.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant first contended that he did not understand the charges after the AJ raised the issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>. <span class="Italic">Cf. Stephen</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 678-79 (AJ did not err by raising harmful error issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>). Only at that point did the appellant, who was represented by counsel even at the reply stage, maintain that he did not understand the charges. Even at the March 4 hearing, however, his testimony was not that he did not understand what the alleged misconduct was. Instead, he testified repeatedly that he did not understand the charges because he did not understand how the agency could perceive the respective incidents as misconduct, and he believed that they should not be considered misconduct. This is an argument concerning the merits of the agency's charges, not an argument that he did not understand what the charges were.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note with concern the AJ's comment in the initial decision that a notice of proposed adverse action should be a self-contained document whose meaning can be discerned without regard to other documents and that a proposal which does not meet this requirement "is facially inadequate." While this is one (and many would argue the best) way to propose an adverse action, there is no requirement that a proposal be in all cases a self-contained document. Indeed, the Board has held that the notice requirement is satisfied when the proposal and any attachments to it, taken together, provide the employee with specific notice of the charges against him so that he can make an informed and meaningful reply. <span class="Italic">Coppola</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 312; <span class="Italic">Littledyke v.

In analyzing a claim of denial of due process, the Board will examine, among other things, whether lack of specificity in the notice affected the appellant detrimentally or caused him any surprise during the hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mason</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 587; <span class="Italic">Ragolia v.

Department of the Army</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 328, &#x00B6; 15 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant argues that he did not receive proper notice of the first charge, his argument is unpersuasive. The record shows that the appellant was fully aware that the allegations regarding his conduct on January 15, 2010, constituted a separate charge of misconduct, even if the precise label of that charge remained a subject of some confusion throughout the Board proceedings. For example, the appellant responded to the allegations regarding his conduct on January 15 in his prehearing submission. In addition, as noted, when objecting to the administrative judge's characterization of these events as a third specification of "Improper Conduct," the appellant did not assert that he lacked notice that they formed part of the agency's charges, or that he was deprived of an opportunity to defend himself against them, but rather that he considered them to constitute an additional specification of failure to follow instructions and unwanted physical contact. Similarly, in his written closing argument, the appellant asserted that the agency's version of his conduct on January 15 was not supported by hearing testimony or other evidence, regardless of whether the agency should have drafted its proposal notice in such a way as to include the events of January 15 as part of its existing specification, or by making them a separate specification of "Improper Conduct."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From this record, it is clear that the appellant was informed of the reasons for the proposed action, including those related to the events of January 15, "with sufficient particularity to apprise him of allegations he must refute or acts he must justify." <span class="Italic">Hendricks v.

As in <span class="Italic">Hendricks</span>, this is not a case where the mislabeling of the charge and/or specifications failed to provide the appellant with adequate notice of the factual allegations underlying the charge/specifications, and a corresponding opportunity to prepare a defense to these allegations; indeed, as noted, the appellant did, in fact, provide such a defense. <span class="Italic">Hendricks</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. at 352-53.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant refutes a charge, the employee was on notice of the charge. <span class="Italic">Bias v. EEOC</span>, 20 MSPR 216, 219 (1984).

<p class="Body-Text">Reiterating the concept that an employee who refutes or defends a charge understands the charge, <span class="Italic">Yinat v. Dept. of Army</span>, 101 MSPR 328, 331-33 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-15 (2005), set aside an AJ's determination of a due process violation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ cited <span class="Italic">Mason v. Department of the Navy</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 584 (1996), for the proposition that fundamental due process requires that notice of charges against an employee be sufficiently detailed to provide a meaningful opportunity to be heard. She found that, here, the notice of proposed removal "did not adequately inform [the appellant] of the allegations against him."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Mason</span>, the appellant argued that the agency's notice of the charge against him--improper and unacceptable conduct at the workplace based on his alleged racial slurs and sexual jokes--was not specific enough to permit him to defend himself because it did not state when and where he allegedly made the comments. The Board agreed. It found that the appellant tried to learn this information through discovery; that he was told that the agency had no such information; but that, at the hearing, agency witnesses testified that the charged misconduct occurred three to four years earlier. Under those circumstances, the Board found that the agency's failure to give the appellant adequately detailed notice prior to the hearing of the alleged misconduct prejudiced his ability to mount a meaningful defense and denied him due process. The Board thus reversed the agency's action. <span class="Italic">Mason</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 587-88.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, though, the record does not show that any lack of specificity in the notice prevented the appellant from defending himself against the charge. Rather, the AJ informed the parties of her own difficulty in understanding "what incidents form the basis of the agency's action." She directed the agency to file sworn statements from Giovino and Chen to clarify the matter. Although she found that their declarations in response "did not shed very much light on the question of what incidents formed the basis of the removal action that [was] before [her]," she stated in her June 29, 2004 Notice and Order that there were "several incidents about which [she would] hear evidence: (1) the March 21, 2002 memorandum to Spanish-speaking employees with regard to the use of certain words in the workplace; (2) the April 26, 2002 and May 3, 2002 incidents relating to Yolanda Santiago; and (3) the July 16, 2002 e-mail titled 'suck it in.'" She <span id="Page_3180"></span>directed the agency to file an updated witness list and the appellant to file pre-hearing submissions including his witness list.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's prehearing submissions did not show that he could not defend himself against the charge. He addressed the specific incidents identified by the AJ as well as other incidents. He described the issue and listed his requested witnesses and their expected testimony. In an August 10, 2004 ID, however, the AJ dismissed the appeal without prejudice, issuing a notice the same day in which she "strongly urged" the parties to use the time before the appeal was refiled for settlement negotiations and stated her belief "that this case should be settled rather than litigated."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After refiling his appeal, the appellant again did not indicate that he could not defend himself against the charge. The AJ stated, however, that "because of the manner in which the notice of proposed removal and the letter of decision were drafted," she was "still unclear about various aspects of the case," and she determined that "it was not feasible to proceed with the hearing." Accordingly, she canceled it. She later rescheduled the hearing for January 5, 2005, and if necessary, January 6, 2005. In a December 30, 2004 Notice, the AJ stated that, during a conference the previous day, she "reiterated [her] position that it [was] unclear what acts of misconduct were alleged by the agency." For the first time in the written record, she referred to a potential due process problem, stating that "[du]e process requires that notice of charges against an employee be sufficiently detailed to provide a meaningful opportunity to be heard." The AJ approved only Chen, Giovino, and the appellant as witnesses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the hearing, the appellant similarly did not show that he could not defend himself against the charge. Although he indicated some confusion about specific events, and finally stated in his closing argument that he could "not determine what [he was] charges with," he did so only after the AJ extensively questioned Giovino and Chen, repeatedly stating that <span class="Italic">she</span> did not understand what acts formed the basis for the charge. Indeed, she stated at the outset of the hearing, "I don't think we can go into the merits," noting that she was not "sure what really [was] at issue in this case" and that she needed to know "what [Giovino] based...this removal proposal on." Likewise, when the agency representative attempted to question the appellant about an incident, the AJ reiterated, "[W]e really are not getting into the merits." That incident was specifically identified in the AJ's June 29, 2004 Notice and Order as an incident on which she would hear evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, any allegation by the appellant that his due process rights were violated was not based on his difficulty in understanding and responding to the charge once he received it, as was the situation in <span class="Italic">Mason</span>.

Rather, the appellant's allegation was based on his claim that he did not receive the notice of proposed removal before the agency decided to remove him, and, thus, that he had no opportunity to respond to it.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">More important, we note that the appellant raised no objection to the lack of specificity prior to the hearing, and that the only reference to a lack of specificity that she made during her hearing testimony was in a statement she made regarding the tenth specification of the charge against her. In that specification, she was alleged to have "failed to heed direction regarding...the use of auxiliary assistance that would have facilitated a more efficient delivery of the mail by [her] station." During her testimony regarding this specification, her attorney asked her whether this allegation "relate[d] to the overage in hours" mentioned in another specification. The appellant responded by saying that she "would only be guessing as far as understanding, that the statements are pretty vague, as far as using...auxiliary assistance." She proceeded, however, to testify regarding her use of auxiliary assistance, and she indicated in her testimony that her supervisor had discussed the use of auxiliary assistance with the appellant in "different meetings."</p>

At least two of the remaining three specifications would appear on their face to be sufficient to put the appellant on notice of the allegations against her. Moreover, the appellant addressed each specification on its merits in her hearing testimony.</p>

Admittedly, the reasons given plaintiff for his reduction in rank were short, concise and to the point. However, in our view, they were stated in a manner obviously susceptible of understanding and afforded the plaintiff an opportunity for refutation. This is especially true in view of prior communications from the agency to the plaintiff which explained "specifically and in detail" the transfer of functions alluded to in the notice received by plaintiff and which furnished the basis for plaintiff's reduction in rank. Moreover, plaintiff's awareness of the reasons for the reduction in rank is further demonstrated by his unusually detailed and delineated written reply to the proposed reduction in rank of July 20, 1965, which we note is free from any assertion of lack of particularity of reasons stated.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A charge against an employee need only be specific enough to allow the employee to understand what he has been charged with and to render a response. It need not state every matter that can fairly be inferred, e.g., that a given set of circumstances suggests fault on the part of the employee, if it is clear that the parties and the AJ understand what is at issue<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Bize v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 3 MSPR 155, 161, 3 MSPB 261 (1980). Even if the agency improperly presses at the hearing what amounts to a new specification supporting a given charge, the error is harmless if it is unlikely that the AJ gave the matter significant weight and if the charge was fully supported without consideration of the inappropriate evidence. <span class="Italic">Taylor v.

But if an agency uses one charge as a pretext for another, the agency would deny the appellant minimum constitutional due process, a result suggesting that the action should be reversed as to that charge without a further showing of harm. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hawkins v.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 680-81, 684 (1991)], an agency's use of one charge as a pretext for another would constitute a denial of minimum constitutional due process because an appellant would not have been afforded prior notice and an opportunity to respond to the real reason for the agency's action against him.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mason v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 584, 586-89 (1996), provides an example of a reversal of agency discipline for a charge that was unspecific, an agency discovery response that failed to provide the specifics the appellant needed to present a defense, and the agency's belated provision of specifics at the Board hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fundamental due process requires that notice of charges against an employee be sufficiently detailed to provide a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <span class="Italic">See Barresi v. United States Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 656, 666 (1994), citing <span class="Italic">Goldberg v. Kelly</span>, 397 U.S. 254, 267-68, 90 S. Ct. 1011, 1020-21, 25 L. Ed.2d 287 (1970). In analyzing a claim of denial of due process, the Board will examine, among other things, whether lack of specificity in the notice affected the appellant detrimentally or caused him any surprise during the hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ragolia v. United States Postal Service</span>, 52 MSPR 295, 302, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 983 F.2d 1086 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). On petition for review, the appellant argues that the agency's notice of the charge against him was not specific enough to permit him to defend himself adequately, contending that the notice did not describe the circumstances under which the alleged comments were made (time, place, etc.). For the reasons set forth below, we agree with the appellant and find that the lack of specificity regarding the time and place of the charged misconduct denied him due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's notice of proposed removal charged the appellant with improper and unacceptable conduct at the workplace and specifically referred to racial slurs made to three Carroll employees. Although it identified the type of misconduct with which the appellant was charged, the notice did not give any indication of when or where this misconduct allegedly occurred. During the processing of the appeal, the appellant initiated discovery and submitted an interrogatory seeking information regarding the date, time, and location of each instance of alleged misconduct; he later filed a motion to compel, among other things, the agency's response to that interrogatory. The administrative judge held a May 23, 1995 prehearing conference on the appellant's motion to compel. With respect to the interrogatory concerning the date, time, and location of the charged misconduct, he noted the statement of the agency's representative during the conference that the agency had no such information. Finding this a complete answer to the interrogatory, he denied the appellant's motion to compel on that point.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the hearing, the agency presented testimony from the three Carroll employees mentioned in the notice of proposed removal. Each testified that, on one occasion, the appellant had made racist remarks to them. In one case, the remarks were made in 1991, while in two other cases the remarks were made in 1992. Two witnesses stated that they believed that other employees were present when the remarks were made but could not remember the names of those employees. The appellant presented testimony from a Carroll employee, two agency employees, and two former agency employees; they reported that they had never heard him make racist remarks during their interaction with him at work. The administrative judge concluded that the appellant's witnesses had not refuted the testimony of the agency's witnesses because the testimony of the former showed at most only that they had not themselves been subjected to racially offensive comments by the appellant and that they were unaware that he had made such comments to others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge properly found, the agency's notice provided enough detail regarding the kind of misconduct charged (racial slurs), but it did not indicate when or where the charged misconduct took place. The appellant tried to learn these facts through discovery but was informed that the agency had no such information. At the hearing, however, he heard from the agency's witnesses that the charged misconduct had allegedly occurred three to four years earlier. The lack of specificity in the agency's notice thus clearly caused the appellant surprise at the hearing and affected him detrimentally because he could not obtain any information regarding the time and location of the charged misconduct until the agency's witnesses offered details on those matters at the hearing. As the appellant rightly complains, receipt of more specific information about the time and location of the alleged incidents would perhaps have allowed him to determine whether he was working on the dates in question and whether there were any other individuals who might have heard the remarks attributed to him. Without that specific information, the appellant had no alternative but to present a very general defense through his witnesses, a defense which the administrative judge rejected as insufficient to rebut the testimony of the agency's witnesses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, then, we find that the agency's failure to give the appellant adequately detailed notice prior to the hearing of the alleged misconduct prejudiced his ability to mount a meaningful defense and denied him due process. <span class="Italic">See Barresi</span>, 65 MSPR at 666; <span class="Italic">Ragolia</span>, 52 MSPR at 302. Such a denial of an employee's right to fundamental due process requires reversal of an agency's action. <span class="Italic">See Daniel v. Veterans Administration</span>, 68 MSPR 459, 461-62 (1995); <span class="Italic">Barresi</span>, 65 MSPR at 666-67. We therefore reverse the agency's suspension of the appellant.</p>
