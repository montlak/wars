<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-138"><span class="space">d.</span> Duty to Supply Information; Accounting</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not specifically instruct an agency on the amounts it is to pay to satisfy a back pay obligation, <span class="Italic">Cox v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 437, 440 &#x00B6; 5 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has mistaken the Board's role in this matter. The Board does not calculate the amount of back pay due the appellant in the first instance. Nor does the Board consider competing proposals for the amount of back pay from the agency and the appellant and instruct the agency which proposal to implement. Rather, it is the agency's responsibility to calculate and pay the appellant the appropriate amount of back pay and provide the Board sufficient evidence to demonstrate that its calculations were proper....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is the agency's responsibility to explain how the appellant's monetary remedy was calculated. <span class="Italic">Antunes v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 408, 410 (1994), made clear the agency's responsibility to provide a cogent explanation of back pay calculations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the agency has not adequately explained how it calculated the interest on the back pay award or the penalties under the Prompt Payment Act (31 USC &#x00A7; 3902(e)). Thus the agency has not complied with the Board's regulation at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(1)(i) (the agency must submit "[e]vidence of compliance, including a narrative explanation of the calculation of back pay and other benefits...."). <span class="Italic">See Blanchard v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Justice</span>, 40 MSPR 513, 515 (1989) ("A submission of satisfactory evidence of compliance by the agency must include an explanation of how it arrived at each of these figures, as well as a correct tallying of the total back pay award.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The responsibility of an agency to provide an explanation of benefits to the appellant extends to disability retirement cases and benefits administered by OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lua v. OPM</span>, 100 MSPR 431 (2005) (dispute concerning calculations for cost of life insurance premiums deducted from an annuity); <span class="Italic">Ogden v. OPM,</span> 92 MSPR 522, 525 &#x00B6; 7 (2002) ("[g]iven the appellant's allegations regarding noncompliance, OPM was required to show that its calculation of those benefits was proper"). <span class="italic">Corum v. USPS</span>, DC-0353-06-0728-X-1 (NP 3/31/2022), expanded on the explanation due from the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board finds a personnel action unwarranted or not sustainable, it orders that the appellant be placed, as nearly as possible, in the situation she would have been in had the wrongful personnel action not occurred. <span class="Italic">House v. Department of the Army</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 530, &#x00B6; 9 (2005). The agency bears the burden to prove its compliance with a Board order. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 6. An agency's assertions of compliance must include a clear explanation of its compliance actions supported by documentary evidence. <span class="Italic">Vaughan v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 319, &#x00B6; 5 (2011). The appellant may rebut the agency's evidence of compliance by making "specific, nonconclusory, and supported assertions of continued noncompliance." <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 325, &#x00B6; 5 (2010). A careful review of the agency's latest submission shows that the agency has now reached full compliance. Viewed together with the agency's narrative statements, the agency's submitted documentation demonstrates that the agency properly calculated the appellant's overtime back pay using the correct comparators and paid the appellant an amount at least equal to what it owed her, along with interest. While the agency ultimately did not use the correct method to determine the appellant's overtime back pay, its error resulted in her earning more overtime back pay than she otherwise would have received under the proper methodology, and thus leads to the conclusion that the agency was in compliance with the requirement to pay her the correct amount of overtime back pay owed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...For the agency to be found in compliance regarding the provision of back pay, interest on back pay, and benefits, the agency must provide a detailed and clear explanation of the calculations that it made in determining the amount due the appellant. The agency must clearly set forth the following: the gross amount due the appellant and how that amount was determined; the amount and reason for all deductions, reductions, and offsets from the gross amount due the appellant; the source and amount of all checks or electronic payments already received by the appellant and provide evidence that such checks or electronic payments were received; and the amount of interest due the appellant and how that amount was calculated. <span class="Italic">Bruton v.

In addition, the agency paid the appellant in two installments: one check for $20,044.30; and one check for $1,604.83. It has not explained what pay periods the specific checks relate to.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To be in compliance regarding the provision of back pay, interest on back pay, and benefits, the agency must provide a detailed and clear explanation of the calculations it has made in determining the amount due the appellant. Among other things, the agency must: 1) clearly set forth the gross amount due the appellant and show how that amount was determined; 2) clearly set forth the amount and reason for all deductions, reductions, and offsets from the gross amount due the appellant;[1] 3) clearly set forth the source and amount of all checks or electronic payments already received by the appellant and provide evidence that such checks or electronic payments were received;[2] and 4) clearly set forth the amount of interest due the appellant and how that amount was calculated. The agency must also clearly set forth its calculations relating to the appellant's sick and annual leave balances, his Thrift Savings Plan account, including both the appellant's and the agency's contributions, and any other benefits of employment the appellant would have received but for the agency's unwarranted personnel action. Finally, the agency must take the appropriate steps to restore the appellant's health insurance benefits and provide evidence that it has done so. In addition to the calculations, the agency must provide a clear and detailed narrative explanation of its calculations so that the Board may understand the calculations and verify that they are correct. The agency must provide an explanation of all codes and abbreviations used in its documentation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;There is no basis for the appellant's assertion that the agency should pay all deductions from his back pay. Under the Back Pay Act, an agency is required to deduct from a back pay award the appropriate amounts for retirement, Medicare, federal and state taxes, and any payment the appellant received for accrued annual leave. <span class="Italic">Tanaka v. Department of the Navy</span>, 788 F.2d 1552, 1553-54 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Hargett v. Department of the Navy</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 180, &#x00B6; 6 (1999). Similarly, in determining the amount of back pay due the appellant, the agency may consider the compensation he has received from the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP). <span class="Italic">White v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 10 (2009) (stating that an appellant is not entitled to back pay for the period he was receiving OWCP benefits); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Steen v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (stating that the employee was only entitled to the back pay he would have received beyond the OWCP payments he already received).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;To the extent that the appellant has returned to the agency checks previously provided to him, the agency should either reissue those checks or incorporate the amount of those checks in any new payment to the appellant. To the extent that the appellant may have returned checks issued by other agencies, such as OWCP or OPM, to those agencies, the appellant must contact those agencies to determine if the checks can be reissued.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once an issue, e.g., back pay entitlement, is raised during enforcement proceedings, the appellant must provide to the region all the information and argument pertinent to that issue. The region should ensure that the appellant has the opportunity to respond to agency submissions, changing appellant's address, if necessary, during the course of proceedings. <span class="Italic">Murray v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 38 MSPR 422, 425 (1988) (appellant was denied the right to file information or conduct discovery on his case when AJ sent an acknowledgment order on the enforcement case to the wrong address).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency offers calculations concerning back pay to show that it has <span id="Page_4982"></span>complied with a petition, the appellant must supply more than assertions that the calculations are incorrect. Specifics must be provided to the Board demonstrating the agency's error. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shobert v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 90 MSPR 262, 266 &#x00B6; 8 (2001) ("Where an agency offers calculations concerning back pay to show that it has complied, the appellant must supply more than assertions that the calculations are incorrect."); <span class="Italic">Martinez v.

However, its evidence of compliance does not include any specific documentation of its compliance with the Board order.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency also did not produce any documentary evidence to the Board to support any calculations it might have made. Instead, the agency produced SF-50s, which show that personnel actions were taken in accordance with the Board's underlying decision. While the SF-50s reflect the appellant's gross annual salary, they do not show "the gross amount due the appellant" for the relevant time periods, "the amount and reasons for all deductions, reductions, and offsets from the gross amount," "the amount of interest due the appellant," or the appellant's benefits. <span class="Italic">Bruton</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 489, &#x00B6; 17. Given that the agency has not provided "a clear explanation of its compliance efforts supported by understandable documentary evidence," <span class="Italic">Bruton</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 489, &#x00B6; 13, we determine that it has not met its burden of proof. This burden rests with the agency, and the agency cannot evade its responsibility by relying on unexplained calculations from its payor, DFAS. <span class="Italic">See Raymond v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-17 (2011) (rejecting "unsworn, vague" DFAS memorandum and spreadsheet as evidence of compliance with the agency's agreement to provide back pay to the appellant, in part because they lacked narrative explanation of calculations); <span class="Italic">see also Tichenor v.

Department of the Navy</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 288, &#x00B6; 12 (1999) (holding that "any failure on the part of DFAS ‘to follow through' or its ‘extraordinary' processing requirements" did not "excuse the agency's substantial delay" in complying with interim relief order). The agency must timely work with DFAS to supply the required information in a form that the Board can understand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant cannot be expected to provide specific objections to an agency compliance response when the agency has not provided a specific accounting of back pay calculations, <span class="Italic">Cross v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 27 MSPR 588, 589-90 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant filed a petition for enforcement of a final Board decision which reversed his removal for participation in the nationwide air traffic controllers' strike of 1981. The Director of the Chicago Regional Office found that the agency had failed to pay appellant the back pay due him for overtime he would have worked but for his wrongful removal. The Director certified the case to the Board for processing pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.184 on March 1, 1985. The Board subsequently received from the agency copies of letters to appellant notifying him of the amount of his overtime back pay award, and the approximate date when he would receive it. In a supplemental submission the agency informed the Board that appellant's award had been recalculated and would be increased by 10 to 20 percent. The agency said that appellant would be notified of the amount of the supplemental award by April 8, 1985.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 14, 1985, in light of the agency's evidence of compliance, the Board gave appellant 30 days to show cause why his petition for enforcement should not be dismissed as moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant responded by stating that, while he agrees with the methodology employed in calculating his overtime, he objects to the amount of the award, and believes it to be inaccurate by at least 50 percent. Appellant further stated that he had asked the personnel office at the facility where he works for the data used to make the calculations, but was advised that the office did not have the data.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency responded on April 8, 1985, by arguing that appellant's objections are speculative and thus not specific enough to meet the requirements of the Board's regulation, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.181(a). The agency also stated that it is providing appellant with a computer generated document showing him the average overtime calculations at his facility and the specific calculations for appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that appellant's allegations are specific enough, under the circumstances to meet the Board's criteria. Appellant was unable to be more specific without the underlying data, which the agency did not originally give him. However, the agency has stated its intention to provide him with that data, and appellant will be able to state specific objection after receiving it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of the appellant's obligation to supply information to the agency to secure back pay, <span class="Italic">Russo v. USPS</span>, 107 MSPR 296, 300-01 &#x00B6; 10, 2007 MSPB 277 (2007), determined the agency should not delay payment of undisputed amounts of back pay because the appellant fails to complete, or delays the completion of a form, that is not necessary to the back pay calculation and relates to some other aspect of the remedy, overtime or holiday pay calculations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ sets a date for the close of a record on enforcement disputes, and that date allows for an agency submission that the appellant may wish to challenge, the appellant should either object to the AJ's ruling and request an opportunity for the reply or, assuming no objection and no modification of the date, the appellant can submit information to the AJ after the close of record date and before the AJ's compliance decision, or to the Board on PFR, <span class="Italic">Wilkes v. VA</span>, DA-0432-11-0466-C-1 (NP 9/22/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant neither objected to this notice when it was issued nor attempted to file a response to the agency's submission during the month between the close of the record and the issuance of the compliance initial decision. The appellant's failure to timely object to the administrative judge's ruling precludes him from doing so on petition for review. <span class="Italic">See McCarthy v. International Boundary &#x0026; Water Commission</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 25 (2011) (finding that the appellant's failure to timely object to rulings during the hearing precludes his doing so on petition for review), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 497 F. App'x 4 (Fed. Cir. 2012), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 134 S. Ct. 386 (2013). Moreover, the appellant was given multiple opportunities to rebut the agency's compliance evidence below, and he now has had the opportunity to raise any outstanding compliance issues through his petition for review. The administrative judge did not abuse his discretion by determining that the record would close after the agency had one final opportunity to respond to the compliance issues that remained after considerable efforts by both parties to resolve those issues.</p>
