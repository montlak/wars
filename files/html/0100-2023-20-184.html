<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-176"><span class="space">6.</span> Disciplinary Penalty</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 1215(a)(3)(A) provides the authority of the Board to impose disciplinary penalties in an OSC disciplinary case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(A)&#x2003;A final order of the Board may impose--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003; disciplinary action consisting of removal, reduction in grade, debarment from Federal employment for a period not to exceed 5 years, suspension, or reprimand;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; an assessment of a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(iii)&#x2003; any combination of disciplinary actions described under clause (i) and an assessment described under clause (ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(B)&#x2003;In any case brought under paragraph (1) in which the Board finds that an employee has committed a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(8), or 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), the Board may impose disciplinary action if the Board finds that the activity protected under section 2302(b)(8), or 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) was a significant motivating factor, even if other factors also motivated the decision, for the employee's decision to take, fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take a personnel action, unless that employee demonstrates, by preponderance of evidence, that the employee would have taken, failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take the same personnel action, in the absence of such protected activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because in an OSC case the Board is the first entity to consider the evidence of the charged conduct, the selection of the penalty is for the Board. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Starrett</span>, 28 MSPR 60, 74 (1985). The Board's regulation, 5 CFR 1201.126(a) (2022), vests the authority to determine a penalty in either the Board or the ALJ who considers a disciplinary case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.126&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Final decisions</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;In any action to discipline an employee, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the administrative law judge, or the Board on petition for review, may order a removal, a reduction in grade, a debarment (not to exceed five years), a suspension, a reprimand, or an assessment of a civil penalty not to exceed $1,125, 5 U.S.C. 1215(a)(3), 7326; 28 U.S.C. 2461 note.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 required an adjustment of the penalty. Refer to the Board's rulemaking notice of September 18, 1996, 61 FR 49049, for an explanation of the adjustment requirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For guidance in assessing penalties, the Board looks to the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Starrett</span>, 28 MSPR 60, 74-75 (1985), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Starrett v. Special Counsel</span>, 792 F.2d 1246 (4th Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">post</span>; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Frederick v. DOJ</span>, 65 MSPR 517, 535, 536 (1994) ("In disciplinary actions brought by OSC...the Board is not bound by OSC's penalty determinations but instead takes into account the relevant factors enumerated in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA,</span> 5 MSPR 280, 5 MSPB 313 (1981)"; "[w]hether an offense was technical and inadvertent or intentional and malicious is a factor to be considered in determining the reasonableness of an agency penalty selection.") (<span class="Italic">Frederick</span> was reversed on other grounds in <span class="Italic">Frederick v. DOJ</span>, 73 F.3d 349 (Fed. Cir. 1996)); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Byrd</span>, 59 MSPR 561, 582 (1993), <span class="Italic">post</span>; <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Hoban</span>, 24 MSPR 154, 161-62 (1984) (considering <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, directing the downgrading to a nonsupervisory position of a VA police chief who took reprisals against a subordinate who made protected disclosures). The Board may also take into consideration the impact on the agency of the imposition of a penalty (e.g., suspension, removal, downgrading) on the respondent. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Filiberti</span>, 27 MSPR 498, 509 (1984). The Board may compare penalties in OSC cases involving reprisals by other employees of different agencies. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board elaborated on the considerations governing its choice of penalty in an OSC disciplinary case, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's assessment of penalties in original jurisdiction cases is made pursuant to the guidance set out in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280 (1981). <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Starrett</span>, 28 MSPR at 74. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> sets out a list of factors which may be considered in setting a penalty but notes that not all of them will be pertinent in every case.... A responsible balance must be struck among the relevant factors within the limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this case the Board finds that the following factors are relevant: the nature and seriousness of respondent's offense; his awareness of the law; the impact of the violation on the agency's reputation; respondent's job level; his past work record; and his potential for rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the violation of 5 USCA 2302(b)(8) was serious. It was not a technical violation, and the respondent was aware of the laws protecting whistleblowers. He was also well aware of the Special Counsel's interest in the case because she requested the agency to stay any plans to reassign Livengood until the investigation of prohibited personnel practices in the Regional Personnel Office had been completed. Further, a finding that a high level management employee violated the law protecting whistleblowers could be expected to have an adverse impact on the reputation of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds, however, in agreement with the CALJ, that the Special Counsel's recommendation of removal is excessive given the following mitigating factors. The record shows that respondent has 17 years of service with no past disciplinary record. The record also shows that he has been recognized as an excellent employee by his immediate and former supervisors and held their confidence. In fact, he was recently promoted to GM-15. In addition, the misconduct charged in this case appears to be atypical, and respondent appears to be a good candidate for rehabilitation. Finally, only one of four counts raised was sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances the Board finds that a 30-day suspension is an appropriate sanction for respondent's violation under count four.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Violations may be considered especially serious if the respondent commits them knowing that an OSC investigation is being conducted into the legal implications of his past acts. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

The penalty decision of the Board does not stop with a search, among the literal words of the statute, for language authorizing the specific punishment to be imposed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Byrd</span>, 59 MSPR 561, 582-84 (1993), imposed disciplinary penalties on two employees, one who was fined, the other suspended, for circumventing proper hiring procedures to employ a politically well-connected applicant. The Board explained that its assessment of an appropriate penalty would include consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Pertinent considerations included the seriousness of the offense, the position held by the respondent (an employee with a prominent position and personnel responsibilities being held to a higher standard than a subordinate employee), and the employee's past record and work record. As a follow-up, the <span class="Italic">Byrd</span> case returned to the Board on OSC's petition for compliance. The Board declined to adopt the agency's argument that the suspended employee should not be required to serve consecutively the days of the suspension, and the Board declined to permit the fined employee to mitigate the impact of the fine through an installment payment plan, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Byrd</span>, 63 MSPR 19, 21-23 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a March 4, 1994 letter, the agency informed the Board that it had scheduled Rubinstein's 60-day suspension in increments of one day per week for the remainder of 1994, and two days per week on weekends only in January and February, 1995. The agency claimed that it was necessary to schedule the suspension on a noncontinuous basis because Rubinstein was a key management official in the Office of Human Resources whose current duties and responsibilities included the supervision of his branch, the administration of the hiring freeze for the offices he serviced, and several special projects.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By motion dated March 10, 1994, the OSC asserts that the agency's action did not constitute compliance with the Board's Order. The OSC argues that the Board ordered a 60-day suspension, not a series of short term suspensions covering 60 days. The OSC further asserts that suspensions imposed as disciplinary actions have a larger purpose than mere monetary deprivation and also serve as visible signs of the penalty imposed. The OSC argues that a visible sign of the suspension is particularly important here because Rubinstein violated the very personnel laws and regulations which he is charged with implementing. Much of the exemplary effect of the discipline would be lost, the OSC maintains, if Rubinstein were permitted to serve the penalty on one or two days a week over a period of a full year. Finally, the OSC notes that any impact upon the Office of Human Resources caused by Rubinstein's absence would have the salutary effect of calling attention to the consequences of committing prohibited personnel practices.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215(a)(3), the Board has the authority to order the suspension of an employee in a disciplinary action. When a suspension is imposed, the Board normally intends the discipline to be carried out in a consecutive manner. Otherwise, as the OSC points out, the visibility of the suspension and its potential deterrence to similar actions will be weakened. An agency does not have the authority to modify a punishment imposed by the Board and, in the event the agency does not comply with an order of the Board, the Board may enforce compliance. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(e)(2)(A). Section 1215(a)(3) does not restrict the Board's discretion in the length of, or the manner in which, the suspension is imposed, and in unusual or compelling circumstances, the Board may permit a suspension to be served nonconsecutively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency has stated generally that a continuous 60-day suspension of Rubinstein will affect the agency's ability to carry out its mission. It has not provided specific evidence in terms of office staffing levels or available personnel in support of this contention. In addition, we agree with the OSC that scheduling the 60-day suspension in one-day increments will dilute the visibility of the discipline and therefore weaken the deterrent effect of the penalty. We note the agency has not alleged any greater harm than would be caused by the suspension of many other employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of compelling support for the agency's contention that its ability to carry out its mission will be compromised by the imposition of a 60-day sentence to be served consecutively, we GRANT the OSC's motion for enforcement. We again ORDER the agency to suspend Rubinstein for a period of 60 consecutive days without pay. The agency shall provide evidence of compliance with this Order to the OSC within 20 days of the date of this order. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the OSC shall file a report with the Clerk of the Board on the status of the compliance with the Board's Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its November 10, 1993 decision, the Board ordered Byrd to pay a fine in the amount of $1,000.00 within 45 days of the date of the order. When Byrd did not pay the fine in a timely manner, the OSC requested the Board to initiate enforcement proceedings against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, Byrd requested the Board to allow him to pay his fine in monthly payments of $10.00. He submitted a list of expenses incurred since he retired and stated that his retirement income was insufficient to cover their costs. However, Byrd failed to submit significant information in support of his request, including the amount of his retirement income and whether he has other assets which could offset his liabilities. Moreover, even if he submitted this data, it is unlikely that the Board would grant his request. There is nothing in the record to show that Byrd could not have remained in his position with the agency and awaited the Board's decision in this case. However, he chose retirement and cannot now rely on his retirement status to avoid or delay the payment of the fine.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another OSC disciplinary case involved suspensions of personnel specialists determined by the Board to have aided in providing improper preference in the course of a selection process.

MSPB</span>, 413 Fed. Appx. 298 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP)), was:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the issue of penalties. The Special Counsel recommends a suspension of not less than sixty days for each respondent. The Special Counsel argues that the seriousness of the offense merits a severe penalty. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic">ee Velez,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 650, &#x00B6; 26 (in evaluating a penalty, the Board will consider, first and foremost, the nature and seriousness of the misconduct and its relationship to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or was frequently repeated).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The range of penalties for a Special Counsel disciplinary action is set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215(a)(3):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A final order of the Board may impose disciplinary action consisting of removal, reduction in grade, debarment from Federal employment for a period not to exceed 5 years, suspension, reprimand, or an assessment of a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining the penalty in Special Counsel disciplinary actions, we apply the factors that are set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Byrd,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. at 582. In considering these factors, the Board also takes into account the particularized circumstances of this proceeding. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> We address these factors in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the respondents' duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or technical or inadvertent, or was committed maliciously or for gain, or was frequently repeated, <span class="Italic">see Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305, we find that the offense was, in fact, serious and goes straight to the heart of the respondents' duties, positions, and responsibilities. However, while we have found that the respondents' offense was intentional, the Special Counsel has adduced no evidence to suggest that it was committed maliciously or for gain, or that it was frequently repeated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the respondents' job level and type of employment, including supervisory or fiduciary roles, contacts with the public, and prominence of the position, <span class="Italic">see Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305, Beatrez was a nonsupervisory, journeyman-level HR Specialist in the agency's Washington, D.C.-based Civilian Personnel Office at the time of the events leading to the complaint, and she had limited public contact and no fiduciary responsibilities. Lee, also a journeyman-level HR Specialist, was the Command Staff Advisor for the Civilian Personnel Office and serviced agency organizations throughout California. Nelson-Possinger testified that, while playing a prominent role in the agency's West Coast operations, Lee did not have fiduciary responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3941"></span>As for the respondents' past disciplinary records, <span class="Italic">see Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305, they had none. Turning to their past work records, including length of service, performance on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability, <span class="Italic">see Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305, Kogut testified that Beatrez was "a very responsible employee who has many years of federal service...without any negative comments in her record," Nelson-Possinger characterized Beatrez as a "stellar" employee in terms of dependability, with twenty-one years of federal service, more than ten years of which have been with the Coast Guard. Beatrez's performance appraisals showed that her work has "been at the highest levels." Nelson-Possinger characterized Lee as an "extremely dependable" employee, who "really has carried the weight of the Alameda office on his shoulders as long as [she has] been there."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the effect of the offense upon the respondents' ability to perform at a satisfactory level and its effect upon supervisors' confidence in their ability to perform assigned duties, <span class="Italic">see Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305, Kogut testified that proof of wrongdoing would affect his confidence in Beatrez to the extent that he "would have to get her additional guidance instruction" and perform "additional oversight of her work.'" Nelson-Possinger testified that the Special Counsel's investigation and hearing in these complaints has not affected Beatrez's ability to do her work:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Even during the last six or more months that we've been preparing for this hearing, she has not missed a beat. She's continued to supervise her branch, she's continued to take on new responsibilities, and has, even as the branch chief, in lots of instances taken the lead for special projects.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for Lee, Nelson-Possinger testified that he had "taken on even additional work" related to the Coast Guard's modernization during the pendency of the complaint. "There would be no degradation of [Lee's] performance at all."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When asked about consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses, <span class="Italic">see Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305, both Kogut and Nelson-Possinger testified that there had been no similar offenses in the Coast Guard that they were able to find. Nelson-Possinger explained that the Coast Guard's table of penalties would allow penalties ranging from reprimand to removal and that she believed a "reprimand should be the most" severe penalty imposed on Beatrez.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the Coast Guard's reputation, <span class="Italic">see Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305, Kogut testified that the offense was "not notorious...not widespread, widely known.... I haven't read about it in the newspaper.... I haven't seen it anywhere." Kogut described a contrasting situation, the prominent news coverage following the arrest of the Federal Security Director at Dulles International Airport for driving while intoxicated. Nelson-Possinger opined that there had been no loss of reputation for the agency because of the respondents' actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the clarity with which the respondents were on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense, or whether they had been warned about the conduct in question, <span class="Italic">see Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305, Kogut testified that neither Beatrez nor anyone else at the agency had notice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As I said before, your honor, this is a process that in the Coast Guard occurs frequently where we announce jobs, reannounce jobs to get the best quality candidates. This is not a one-time occurrence. So just the opposite. [Beatrez] would have seen this as something that was proper, appropriate versus inappropriate and wrong.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nelson-Possinger testified: "There was no clarity. [Beatrez] did not know and neither did I that the Coast Guard was committing a prohibited personnel practice." Regarding Lee, she added, "This whole charge by [the Special Counsel] hit us out of left field, so we were not on notice. We did not know we were doing anything wrong.... [Lee] had no prior knowledge that anything, any advice he gave Commander Hogan would be turned into a charge of prohibited personnel practice."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both Kogut and Nelson-Possinger found high potential for both respondents to be rehabilitated. <span class="Italic">See Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305. Kogut testified, "I strongly believe that [Beatrez] would be very easily rehabilitated." Nelson-Possinger stated that Beatrez's potential for rehabilitation was "excellent." As for Lee, she said, "Now that he understands [the Special Counsel's] interpretation...he understands and can be rehabilitated."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither Kogut nor Nelson-Possinger could identify any mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense, such as unusual job tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad faith, malice or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter, that would apply in this case. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305. Finally, as to the adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the future by the respondents or others, <span class="Italic">see Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 306, both witnesses emphasized the importance of retraining HR employees so they would not commit similar offenses in the future.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that both respondents are strong performers and valued employees without prior discipline and with rehabilitation potential. Neither was a supervisor or manager at the time that the charged conduct took place. The major difference between the respondents that would affect the penalty is the degree and duration of their support for CMDR O'Hare's pre-selection efforts. This difference goes to the first and most important <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor, the nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lee was involved with the REC's recruitment efforts for a longer period of time and on a much more intimate level than Beatrez. His improprieties began with the cancellation of the first set of vacancy announcements. Lee worked directly with REC management, and by the agency's admission, he served as HR liaison between the REC and the Civilian Personnel Office. Lee was thus in the best position to dissuade local management from prohibited personnel practices. Indeed, that was part of his job, and there is no indication he did so. In determining the appropriate penalty, we are guided by <span class="Italic">Byrd,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. at 577, 583-84. As mentioned previously, in <span class="Italic">Byrd</span> the Board found that a personnelist violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) and (11) by using a hiring authority, which he knew or should have known was improper, to give an individual an advantage in hiring. The Board recognized that his actions were the result of his superiors directing him to find a way to hire the individual in question. The Board found, though, that someone in the personnelist's position should have known that using temporary limited appointment hiring authority was improper and should have informed his supervisors of that fact, but he failed to do so. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 583-84. The Board then determined that a 60-day suspension was warranted despite the personnelist's 16 years of service and status as an "exemplary" employee. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 584. Lee's situation is remarkably similar to the one described in <span class="Italic">Byrd.</span> Balancing the mitigating factors with the seriousness of the offense, we impose on respondent Lee a suspension without pay of forty-five days as the appropriate penalty under the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Beatrez only became entangled at some point before the second set of vacancy announcements closed. Although, as the headquarters HR Specialist servicing the vacancy announcements, she was in a position to help halt the ongoing prohibited personnel practice, she did not act in this case and she bears liability for her serious offense. Balancing the mitigating factors with the seriousness of the offense, we impose on respondent Beatrez a ten-day suspension without pay as the appropriate penalty under the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is expected to consider <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in OSC disciplinary cases as it would in other disciplinary cases, and on judicial review the court will defer to the Board's penalty assessment. <span class="Italic">Filiberti v. MSPB</span>, 804 F.2d 1504, 1510-11 (9th Cir. 1986). But the Board is limited in the penalty decisions it may make in OSC cases. As to a Board order docking the appellant's accrued leave account by the equivalent of the salary he would have forfeited had he served his suspension before retiring, the court first noted that 5 USC 1207(b) [now &#x00A7; 1215(a)(3)] provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A final order of the Board may impose disciplinary action consisting of removal, reduction in grade, debarment from Federal employment for a period not to exceed 5 years, suspension, reprimand, or an assessment of a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of the leave forfeiture, the court observed in <span class="Italic">Filiberti</span>, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1511-12:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The wording of this section obviously does not authorize the Board to impose the chosen sanction. Where a statute specifies particular remedies, we must be chary of expanding available remedies beyond what Congress explicitly provided.... As a creature of Congress, the Board is limited "not [to] what the Board thinks it should do but [to] what Congress has said it can do."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The power to do so, the Board argues, is derived from 5 USC 1205(a)(2), which authorizes it to "order any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board...and enforce compliance with any such order."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This section, however, does not give the Board carte blanche to do whatever is necessary to enforce its orders. We must remind ourselves that, in spite of the logic of the Board's contention, the effect would be to extend the sanctioning authority beyond that which is specifically prescribed by section 1207(b)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bearing in mind the specific teaching of the Supreme Court to be wary of expanding authority beyond the particular agency remedies Congress dictates, we hold that the Board may not circumvent the specific, narrow sanctioning authority set out in section 1207(b). The broad dictates of 1205(d)(2) do not empower the Board to create and impose new penalties not envisaged by Congress in section 1207(b). Therefore, we reverse and remand this issue to the Board to reconsider Filiberti's penalty in light of the sanctioning constraints imposed by Congress.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand the Board vacated the deductions from Mr. Filiberti's pay and directed him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Filiberti</span>, 33 MSPR 186, 188 (1987). Bearing in mind the admonitions of <span class="Italic">Filiberti</span>, in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel <span id="Page_3942"></span>v. Doyle</span>, 42 MSPR 376, 382-83 (1989), the Board construed the alternate sanctions of 5 USC 1207(b) [now &#x00A7; 1215(a)(3)]:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Section 1207(b) provides for the imposition of disciplinary action "consisting of removal, reduction in grade, debarment from Federal employment...suspension, reprimand, <span class="Italic">or</span> an assessment of a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000." As a general rule of statutory construction, the word "or," when used in a statute should be given disjunctive, rather than conjunctive, effect.... Moreover, where "or" is used in a statute containing a list, it cannot be interpreted as conjunctive absent obvious legislative intent that it be so interpreted....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, therefore, that the statutory penalties provided by section 1207 are meant to be imposed alternatively, rather than collectively....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Doyle</span> was followed by <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. McDonald</span>, 42 MSPR 624, 628 (1989), a decision that limited to one the number of sanctions employed under &#x00A7; 1207(b) against a respondent in a disciplinary case. McDonald was removed for recommending discipline against individuals who made protected disclosures about him. <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> and <span class="Italic">McDonald</span> were reconsidered and reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Doyle</span>, 45 MSPR 43, 46-49 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Filiberti,</span> an employee found to have engaged in a prohibited personnel practice was ordered suspended for 60 days. On the effective date of the suspension, the employee retired. The Board then ordered that the equivalent of 60-days' salary be withheld from the employee's accrued leave. The Board had ordered the money withheld under its enforcement authority at 5 USC &#x00A7; 1205(a)(2) (1986). The court was unequivocal in its warning against the expansion of statutory authority: "Where a statute specifies particular remedies," the court held, "we must be chary of expanding available remedies beyond what Congress explicitly provided." <span class="Italic">Filiberti</span> at 1511, citing <span class="Italic">Transamerica Mortgage Advisors,</span> <span class="Italic">Inc. v. Lewis,</span> 444 U.S. 11, 19-20, 100 S. Ct. 242, 246-47, 62 L. Ed.2d 146 (1979). Relying on the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, the Ninth Circuit held that the Board must abide by the "specific, narrow sanctioning authority set out in section 1207(b)." <span class="Italic">Filiberti</span> at 1512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has expressed concern that dual penalties may not be permissible under section 1207(b). In <span class="Italic">Starrett v. Special Counsel,</span> 792 F.2d 1246 (4th Cir. 1986), the court noted at 1255 that "'[o]r' quite possibly means that the various elements in a series are alternatives." Mindful of these opinions, the Board addressed the issue of dual penalties in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>. Citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service, Region II v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 739 F.2d 829, 832 (2nd Cir. 1984), we held that as a general rule of statutory construction, the word "or" should be given disjunctive rather than conjunctive effect. <span class="Italic">See also George Hyman Construction Co. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission,</span> 582 F.2d 834, 840 n.10 (4th Cir. 1978) (Use of the disjunctive "or" indicates alternatives unless such a construction is repugnant to the larger statute).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held further, consistent with N. Singer, <span class="Italic">Sutherland</span> <span class="Italic">Statutory Construction, &#x00A7;</span> 21.14 (4th ed. 1985) (Sutherland), that where "or" is used in a statute containing a list, it <span class="Italic">cannot</span> be interpreted as conjunctive absent obvious legislative intent that it be so interpreted. Noting that the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act was silent on the subject, we held that the sanctions provided by section 1207(b) are to be imposed alternatively, rather than collectively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Special Counsel argues first that we failed to ascertain Congress's intent with regard to section 1207(b). Where there is nothing in the legislative history, she argues, legislative intent should be drawn from analysis of the text of the statute and its related provisions, evaluation of administrative interpretations, and inferences drawn from Congress's inaction "in the face of these interpretations."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the textual analysis, the Special Counsel cites <span class="Italic">Sutherland</span> and several court cases for the proposition that "or" and "and" are frequently interchangeable. These authorities, however, qualify their assertions regarding this interchangeability with the requirement of consistency with legislative intent. These cases actually underscore the general rule: that "or" is to be interpreted disjunctively in the absence of obvious legislative intent that it be interpreted otherwise. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Customs Service, Region II v.</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Labor Relations Authority,</span> 739 F.2d 829, 832 (2nd Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">George Hyman Construction Co. v. Occupational Safety</span> <span class="Italic">and Health Review Commission,</span> 582 F.2d 834, 840 n.10 (4th Cir. 1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the Special Counsel argues that Congress's intent that the section 1207(b) penalties may be blended, is implied by its inclusion of both removal and debarment on the list. Debarment, the Special Counsel argues, presupposes removal. To hold otherwise, she argues, presumes that Congress included debarment to apply to the "narrow situation" where an employee voluntarily leaves federal service during the pendency of the action against him. This, however, is precisely the situation that existed in <span class="Italic">Doyle, Special</span> <span class="Italic">Counsel v. Zimmerman</span>, 36 MSPR 274 (1988), and <span class="Italic">Special</span> <span class="Italic">Counsel v. Waddams,</span> 34 MSPR 84 (1987), and the penalty of debarment, without removal, was appropriately imposed. It cannot be presumed, therefore, that Congress, by its inclusion of debarment as a penalty, intended that it be used in tandem with removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the same vein, the Special Counsel argues that Congress must have intended to include the option of imposing both removal and debarment on an employee to guard against a hostile agency firing and then immediately rehiring the employee. Congress cannot have intended to leave open the possibility of such subterfuge, the Special Counsel argues. There is, however, nothing that indicates that Congress anticipated that agencies would act in bad faith or that it intended to legislate a solution to a problem that apparently it did not perceive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Special Counsel then argues that the broad discretion granted the Board in the imposition of the section 1207(b) penalties reveals a legislative intent that they be discretionally combined. The range of the available penalties indicates that Congress intended to include the option of combining them, she argues. The broad discretion to which the Special Counsel refers, however, indicates just the opposite intent. The plain language of the statute gives the Board the discretion to impose a penalty as severe as removal, or as lenient as a one-dollar fine. This range, and the number of penalties of varying degrees of severity between, are hardly indicative of a Congressional intent to include the option of combining penalties. What is indicated by the broad discretion is an intent to provide, in the text of the statute, penalties to cover the spectrum of various prohibited personnel practices.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Special Counsel argues that the context of section 1207(b)--its relation to the provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1205 and 1206--evidences a legislative intent that the Board have the discretion to impose blended penalties. This argument, like the one described above, advances the notion that because Congress granted the Board broad authority in the imposition of penalties for a wide variety of offenses of varying degrees of severity, it intended to include the option of blended penalties. The Special Counsel argues further that the Board's even broader authority--to hear and adjudicate employee appeals, enforce compliance, and review Office of Personnel Management regulations--indicates a Congressional intent that section 1207(b) be liberally construed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These arguments, like all of the Special Counsel's arguments addressing legislative intent, ignore the basic statutory construction rule upon which our holding is based. The use of the word "or" in this statute cannot be interpreted as conjunctive unless that is the <span class="Italic">obvious</span> legislative intent<span class="Italic">. See Sutherland, &#x00A7;</span> 21.14. Section 1207(b), therefore, is to be read to mean exactly what it says, unless some clear legislative intent to the contrary can be shown. The Special Counsel has failed to show such clear intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Special Counsel argues that the fact that the Board has previously imposed blended penalties and Congress has not acted to prevent the imposition is evidence of a congressional intent to allow it. The Board has, in the past, imposed blended penalties in Special Counsel disciplinary actions. None of these cases, however, explicitly addressed the question of whether the statute was to be read as conjunctive or disjunctive. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Special Counsel</span> <span class="Italic">v. Falt,</span> 26 MSPR 569, 571 (1985); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Verrot</span>, 18 MSPR 714 (1984). In any event, the Special Counsel admits that congressional inaction is not an indication of congressional approval, citing <span class="Italic">Sutherland &#x00A7;</span> 49.10. Indeed, after noting that legislative inaction has been termed "'a poor beacon to follow'" in construing a statute, Sutherland deems legislative inaction of small consequence where neither the statute nor its interpretation has been called to the attention of the legislative body. The fact that Congress enacted the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (1989), which recodified section 1207(b) does not, as the Special Counsel asserts, maximize the significance of Congress's inaction. Only positive action by a legislative body to reject amendments after they have been proposed can serve to maximize the significance of legislative inaction. <span class="Italic">See Sutherland,</span> &#x00A7; 49.10 n.1. Where, as here, there is no evidence that Congress was aware of those decisions in which we imposed blended penalties, we cannot find that the reenactment of the statute indicates an intent to authorize the imposition of blended penalties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we noted, above, a settlement agreement covering three of the appellants provides for dual penalties, a letter of reprimand and a $500.00 fine. Although the Special Counsel has broad authority to enter into settlement agreements, the Board may not approve such agreements where statutory constraints exist. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dukes,</span> 8 MSPB 218, 8 MSPR 549 (1981). In <span class="Italic">Dukes,</span> the Board rejected a settlement agreement that provided for a 15-day suspension for a Hatch Act violation. Noting that the Hatch Act prescribed a suspension of at least 30 days for such a violation, the Board rejected the settlement agreement holding that the Hatch Act penalty provision did not permit the 15-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 8 MSPR at 551-52. We find a similar statutory constraint here. We cannot, therefore, accept the dual penalty to which the parties agreed in the settlement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The existence of more than one legal basis for a challenge to a respondent's conduct did not justify imposition of a greater penalty than would be imposed if only one legal basis existed. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Mongan</span>, 33 MSPR 392, 398 (1987). In <span class="Italic">Mongan</span>, a 60-day suspension was imposed against a regional administrator who retaliated against an employee by failing to promote <span id="Page_3943"></span>her in reaction to her protected disclosures to an Inspector General, a "very serious" offense. The respondent had an unblemished 15-year record and "the incident appear[ed] to be a deviation from his normal practice." Removal was not warranted. The respondent could be rehabilitated. In a different case, a two-year, two-grade demotion was imposed against a GS-11 who participated in the attempted termination of a probationer who complained of violations of agency smoking regulations. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Eidmann</span>, 49 MSPR 614, 628 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Brown</span>, 61 MSPR 559, 573-74 (1994), a suspension and fine were levied on two employees (one who retired before the Board's final decision) for improper practices involving an appointment and failure to follow OPM's corrective directions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a Special Counsel disciplinary action case, the selection of a penalty is determined in accordance with the criteria set out in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 305 (1981). <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Hoban</span>, 24 MSPR 154 (1984). Not all factors will be relevant in every case. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 306. Further, the principle of like penalties for like offenses does not require mathematical rigidity; the circumstances of each case must be considered. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the penalty imposed in different cases for violations of sections 2302(b)(5), (6) and (11) need not be identical as the Special Counsel suggests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the CALJ carefully weighed most of the relevant factors. In addition, we find relevant the impact of respondents' actions on the reputation of the agency. Respondents' misconduct was known to several employees and former employees of the agency as well as the OPM officials involved in the efforts to correct the misclassification of Brown's position and to appoint Nielson. This factor, together with the other factors cited by the CALJ, requires a significant penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondents' argument that if the Board finds against them on the merits they should receive, at most, very light penalties is unpersuasive. Respondents' inexperience in their positions at the time of the violations does not weigh in favor of mitigation because such high-level employees may be expected to obtain the necessary knowledge to carry out their duties. Respondents' characterization of their actions in Count two as constituting a "technical" violation requiring a light penalty is similarly unpersuasive. The CALJ found that the violation could not be viewed as <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> where the respondents engaged in deliberate acts of noncompliance with OPM instructions. Indeed Felix Garza, chief of the staffing services division for the Dallas region of OPM, testified that he had never encountered such agency reluctance to comply with a finding in an OPM audit. As to the OSC's asserted delay in bringing the charges, as the CALJ found, the delay was not unreasonable or so prejudicial to the respondents that they could not adequately defend themselves. Thus, OSC's delay does not support mitigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tamburello v. United States Postal Service</span>, 45 MSPR 455 (1990) (mitigation of penalty not warranted where the agency could not have taken disciplinary action earlier and appellant failed to show prejudice by the delay).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that respondent Nelson's performance appraisal rating of outstanding for the period July 1, 1991 through September 11, 1992 must be considered in mitigation. Contrary to the OSC's argument of irrelevance, we find it relevant to her potential for rehabilitation and conclude that no more stringent penalty than the 90-day suspension recommended by the CALJ is the appropriate penalty for respondent Nelson for the reasons set forth in the Recommended Decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The recommended 60-day suspension for respondent Brown, however, must be modified in light of his retirement effective December 31, 1993. The choice of penalties following retirement is limited to debarment or an assessment of a civil penalty not to exceed $1000<span class="Italic">. Special Counsel v. Doyle</span>, 42 MSPR 376, 382-83 (1989)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Ferro</span>, 91 MSPR 539, 543 &#x00B6; 7 (2002) ("[b]ecause the respondent retired before we reassessed the penalty pursuant to the court's remand, our choice of penalties was limited to debarment or a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 because he cannot now be suspended prospectively"; factors meriting a 60-day suspension warranted imposing the maximum civil penalty).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Transfer of an employee from the agency involved in the prohibited personnel practice case to another agency with no involvement in the events involved in the OSC complaint does not preclude the employee's penalty, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Beal</span>, 84 MSPR 181, 182-85 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent's representative responded to the Board's order by submitting a document on February 10, 1999, indicating that the respondent was no longer employed by the Department of the Army. On February 22, 1999, the petitioner filed a request for modification of the Board's order imposing disciplinary action. In that request, the petitioner stated that the respondent had transferred to the Department of the Treasury on September 13, 1998, and asked that that department be directed to take the disciplinary action the Department of the Army had previously been ordered to take. On February 25, 1999, the respondent was ordered to show why the petitioner's request should not be granted, and on March 4, 1999, the respondent filed a response to that order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent argues first that there is no nexus between her conduct and her current position, and that the imposition of disciplinary action by the Department of the Treasury therefore would constitute a prohibited personnel practice. In support of this argument, she cites <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Department of Justice,</span> 6 MSPB 493, 6 MSPR 585 (1981), in which the Board found that the employee's removal could not be sustained because the agency had not established the nexus between his alleged misconduct and the efficiency of the service that was required under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a), <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 589, 608. However, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a) applies to actions employing agencies decide to take against their employees, and not to actions such as the one at issue here, i.e., actions ordered by the Board in cases initiated by the Special Counsel. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513. The nexus provision addressed in <span class="Italic">Merritt</span> therefore does not apply here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The disciplinary action ordered here is authorized by 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215(a)(3), which provides that a final Board order "may impose disciplinary action consisting of removal, reduction in grade, debarment from Federal employment for a period not to exceed 5 years, suspension, reprimand, or an assessment of a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000." Nothing in this provision or any other authority of which we are aware indicates that the Board may direct such orders only to the agencies that employed the respondents at the time of the conduct that formed the bases for the orders. In fact, the authority to adjudicate a case arising under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215(a)(3), and to assess the civil penalty provided in that section, has been construed as extending to cases in which the respondent has left federal employment altogether<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Special Counsel v. Byrd,</span> 59 MSPR 561, 583 (1993) (imposing civil penalty on employee who had terminated his federal employment), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Byrd v. Merit Systems Protection</span> <span class="Italic">Board,</span> 39 F.3d 1196 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Santella,</span> 46 MSPR 99, 101-02 (1990) (Board has jurisdiction to adjudicate case arising under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215(a) even if respondent retired before complaint was served on him). In addition, the Board has noted that one of the penalties provided in 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215(a)(3)--that of debarment--is appropriate only when the respondent has left federal employment. <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, 46 MSPR at 102.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Clearly, if the Board has jurisdiction to order disciplinary action against an employee who has left federal employment altogether, it has jurisdiction to order such action against an employee who has simply transferred from one agency to another. We find, therefore, that the Board has the authority to order the respondent's current employing agency to take disciplinary action against the respondent.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The respondent argues that her present employing agency has no legal authority to discipline an employee for conduct occurring prior to her employment by that agency. She has cited no support for this argument, however, and the Board has sustained actions taken by agencies on the basis of conduct occurring prior to the employees' employment by those agencies, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Haack v. United States Postal Service,</span> 68 MSPR 275, 279, 283 (1995) (removal of employee for falsifying pre-employment forms promoted efficiency of service because it raised serious doubts regarding employee's honesty and fitness for employment). We therefore find this argument unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent also argues that ordering the Department of the Treasury to discipline her would be fundamentally unfair and would violate basic federal personnel principles. In support of this argument, she asserts that the conduct at issue in this case occurred 7 years ago; that she has been an exemplary employee since then; that the suspension is unnecessary; and that it therefore would be punitive in nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent's work record was considered below, in connection with the penalty analysis. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Barnett,</span> MSPB Docket No. CB-1215-94-0035-T-1, slip op. at 109-10 (Initial Decision, Mar. 12, 1998). While the CALJ found that it weighed against the imposition of a severe penalty, such as removal, he also found that it was not inconsistent with a decision to impose a 10-day suspension. The respondent raised no specific objection to this part of the initial decision in her petition for review, and we see no basis for modifying the penalty determination at this stage of the proceeding. Moreover, while several years have elapsed since the respondent engaged in the conduct at issue in this case, little additional time has elapsed since we issued our order denying the respondent's petition for review. The passage of time on which the respondent relies therefore provides no basis for a finding that a 10-day suspension is no longer appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another argument raised by the respondent is that the Department of the Treasury, unlike the Department of the Army, is not familiar with the facts of this case; that the respondent's current coworkers and supervisors have been acquainted with her only for a brief period of time; that a suspension imposed now therefore is more likely than one imposed during her previous employment to call her character into question; and that these circumstances make a suspension at this time much more severe than the same action taken earlier would have been.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This argument also is unpersuasive. As indicated above, the respondent <span id="Page_3944"></span>has been employed by the Department of the Treasury since September 13, 1998, several months ago. Furthermore, we have indicated below that a copy of the initial decision is to be placed in the respondent's official personnel folder, and the respondent is free to provide officials of her agency with additional information regarding the facts of this case. Perhaps more important, the prohibition the respondent has been found to have violated is applicable to the federal government in general, and not simply to the Department of the Army; the need to deter future violations by the respondent is present now just as it was when the respondent still worked for her former employing agency; and the need to deter violations by others would continue even if the respondent had left federal service altogether. We therefore see nothing in the respondent's transfer that would suggest that the 10-day suspension that has been ordered would be less appropriate now than it would be if it had been effected while the respondent was still employed by the Department of the Army.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent argues further that she has been promoted since the conduct at issue in this case occurred; that a 10-day suspension will result in a greater loss of pay as a result of her promotion; that the Department of the Army would have had an opportunity to respond to the Board's order once it became final if that department did not concur in the action it was ordered to take; and that the Department of the Treasury, because of its unfamiliarity with pertinent facts, will not have a meaningful opportunity to address the situation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We know of no basis on which either the Department of the Army or the Department of the Treasury--neither of them a party to this case--could have claimed a right to respond in opposition to the Board's final order in this case. Moreover, while the respondent's suspension at this time apparently will result in a larger financial loss than it would have if it had been imposed while she held a lower grade, the penalty will amount to a proportion of her current salary that is no greater than the proportion that would have been withheld from her if she still occupied her lower grade. The absence from her official personnel record of documentation of this suspension also may have helped her obtain the promotions she has received since she engaged in the conduct at issue in this case. In addition, we note that there is no indication that the respondent's transfer or her assignments to higher-grade positions were other than voluntary, and that at least some of these actions were effected after the petitioner had initiated the proceeding at issue here. The respondent cannot choose to accept these benefits while relying on them to avoid the penalty imposed on her. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Byrd,</span> 63 MSPR 19, 23 (1994) (employee could not choose to retire and then rely on his retirement status to avoid or delay payment of fine that had been imposed). We therefore find the arguments described above unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On motion to the Board, an agency may request modification of the penalty imposed in a disciplinary action. In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Filiberti</span>, 27 MSPR 498 (1984) and 29 MSPR 533 (1985), the Board imposed 60-day suspensions upon two employees. The Board later granted an agency motion to have the penalties served sequentially. The agency argued that the simultaneous suspension of both employees would impose an undue hardship on the agency and could potentially endanger national security. The purpose of the penalty, the Board observed, was not to punish the agency but rather the individuals involved in the prohibited personnel practice. In its subsequent decision in the same case, the Board determined that the agency had not engaged in concealment when it was discovered that one of the employees planned to retire just after the first employee finished serving the suspension and prior to his own suspension. However, the Board did order that an amount equal to the loss of pay from a 60-day suspension be deducted from the employee's accrued annual leave. In the 1985 <span class="Italic">Filiberti</span> decision, the Board emphasized that "[w]hen a party seeks relief from the Board, the request must be made with full candor as to the anticipated effect of the modification on the Board's prior action." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Filiberti</span>, 27 MSPR 37, 39 (1985) (expression of displeasure concerning the agency's failure to disclose information pertinent to the sequential suspension of respondents); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Malone</span>, 84 MSPR 342, 362-63 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 33-34 (1999) (resignation of an employee did not moot a Hatch Act prosecution or avoid the imposition of a penalty or the consideration of the violation by OPM in a subsequent suitability proceeding).</p>
