<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-151"><span class="space">10.</span> Judicial Branch</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees of the judicial branch have no MSPB adverse action appeal. They are not employees covered by of 5 USC 7511(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Riordan v. U.S. Dist. Court</span>, 19 MSPR 647 (1984) (Table). The exclusion of judicial branch employees was the subject of commentary in <span class="Italic">Hartman v. MSPB</span>, 77 F.3d 1378, 1379-81 (Fed. Cir. 1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mary G. Hartman ("Petitioner") appeals the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board") dismissing for lack of jurisdiction Petitioner's appeal of her removal from the position of Deputy Clerk at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. We affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 7513, an appeal to the Board is limited to "employee[s] against whom an action is taken under this section." 5 USC 7513(d) (1994)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that Petitioner was appointed under 28 USC 751(b), which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The clerk may appoint, with the approval of the court, necessary deputies, clerical assistants and employees in such number as may be approved by the Director of Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Such deputies, clerical assistants and employees shall be subject to removal by the clerk with the approval of the court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">28 USC 751(b). The Board concluded that Petitioner was employed by the federal Judiciary, not the Executive branch, and therefore did not come within any of the categories covered by the definition of "employee" under 5 USC 7511<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. McClellan</span>, 569 F.2d 1031, 1033 (8th Cir. 1978) (deputy clerk of district court was outside competitive service and not covered by civil service and merit systems).[3] The Board rejected Petitioner's claim that she was employed by the Administrative Office of the Courts (AO) and thus entitled to appeal her removal to the Board under the Administrative Office of the United States Courts Personnel Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-474, 104 Stat. 1097, codified at 28 USC 602 note (1994) (preserving right of certain AO employees to appeal removals to the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Under 5 USC 2102, the competitive service is defined to include "all civil service positions in the executive branch" [with certain exceptions not relevant here], plus certain other positions specifically included in the competitive service by statute. 5 USC 2102. Petitioner has not cited, and we have not found, any statute specifically including her position within the competitive service. Accordingly, if Petitioner was not an employee of an executive branch agency, she was not within the competitive service, and could not be an "employee" under section 7511(a)(1)(A). With respect to the excepted service personnel covered as "employees" under section 7511(a)(1)(C), again, Petitioner must either have served in an executive agency or have been appointed to a position pending conversion to the competitive service. Because there is no indication that Petitioner's appointment as deputy clerk was pending conversion to any other position, including a competitive service position, if Petitioner did not serve in an executive branch agency, she was not an "employee" under section 7511(a)(1)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he statutes establishing and governing the AO clearly identify deputy clerks as court personnel and not as AO employees. For example, 28 USC 604(a)(1) states that the Director of the AO shall "[s]upervise all administrative matters relating to the offices of <span class="Italic">clerks and other clerical and administrative personnel of the courts</span>." (emphasis added). Similarly, 28 USC 604(a)(5) provides that the Director of the AO shall "[f]ix the compensation of <span class="Italic">clerks of court, deputies,...clerical assistants, and other employees of the courts</span> whose compensation is not otherwise fixed by law." (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner has submitted an OMB Direct Deposit Sign-Up Form that lists the AO as the Government agency paying her. The fact that the AO handles Petitioner's pay, however, does not make her an AO employee. Section 609 of Title 28 states that "[t]he authority of the courts to appoint their own administrative or clerical personnel [for example, under 28 USC 751(b)] shall not be limited by any provisions of this chapter," which include the AO's authority under section 604 to administer the pay of court personnel. Accordingly, we find no error in the Board's conclusion that Petitioner was an employee of the court and not of the AO.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner claims that she was assigned by one of the district judges to work "for the U.S. Attorney" during her tenure as deputy clerk, implying that she was an employee of the Justice Department, an Executive agency. This claim similarly fails. Petitioner has provided no evidence that her assignment was outside the scope of her duties as Deputy Clerk, or that at some point she terminated her employment with the court and was hired by the Justice Department.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner asserts that the Clerk's office may not remove deputy clerks under 28 USC 751(b). This is incorrect; the plain language of the statute authorizes such removal. Moreover, the fact that the AO may require, as Petitioner claims, that removals be performed through "proper procedures" is irrelevant to whether the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal of a removal, on procedural grounds or otherwise. The Board's jurisdiction is strictly limited to that provided by statute, rule, or regulation, <span class="Italic">Forest v. MSPB</span>, 47 F.3d 409, 410 (Fed. Cir. 1995), and as shown above, with respect to adverse actions under section 7513, that jurisdiction only encompasses appeals by "employees" as defined in 5 USC 7511(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We affirm, though on a different basis than that cited by the Board, that Petitioner is not entitled to maintain an Individual Right of Action (IRA) <span id="Page_240"></span>before the Board under the whistleblower protection laws. The Board found that because Petitioner was "not an 'employee' under title 5, she may not avail herself of the provisions" of Title 5 authorizing an IRA. We need not determine whether Petitioner is an "employee" for any purpose under Title 5, because, more narrowly, the IRA provisions themselves do not encompass appeals by judicial employees such as Petitioner. Section 1221, "Individual Right of Action in Certain Reprisal Cases," provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may, <span class="Italic">with respect to any personnel action taken or proposed to be taken</span>...as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8) [which prohibits reprisal for whistleblowing], seek corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 1221(a) (emphasis added). Section 2302 defines "personnel action" as various types of employment-related actions "with respect to an employee in, or applicant for, a covered position in an agency." 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A) (emphasis added). Section 2302 in turn defines an "agency" to mean "an Executive agency and the Government Printing Office," excepting certain Executive branch agencies not relevant here. Federal courts are not "an Executive agency." It follows that the IRA created under section 1221(a), which concerns personnel actions as defined under section 2302, is not available to employees of the Federal courts such as Petitioner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, therefore, that Petitioner is not entitled to bring an IRA before the Board. We also agree with the Board that absent an independently appealable action, the Board lacked jurisdiction to hear Petitioner's discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7702(a); <span class="Italic">Brodt v. MSPB</span>, 11 F.3d 1060, 1061 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson v. Admin. Office of U.S. Courts</span>, 96 MSPR 482, 485-86 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. MSPB</span>, 128 Fed. Appx. 139 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">There are several ways to meet the statutory definition of "employee." One is to be an individual in the competitive service who has completed a probationary period or trial period under an initial appointment or who has completed one year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A). A second way is to be a preference eligible individual in the excepted service who has completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an executive agency, the United States Postal Service, or the Postal Rate Commission. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). A third way is to be a nonpreference eligible individual in the excepted service who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service, or who has completed two years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to two years or less. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "competitive service" consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch (with a few exceptions not relevant to this case), as well as certain positions not in the executive branch which are specifically included in the competitive service by statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101(a). Thus, whether the individual is in the competitive service or the excepted service, an individual's position must either be a position in an executive agency or a non-executive agency position specifically included by statute in the competitive service if she is to have appeal rights to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "executive agency" includes an executive department, a government corporation, and an independent establishment. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105. It manifestly does not include any court or instrumentality within the judicial branch. <span class="Italic">Hartman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 77 F.3d 1378, 1379, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not contend that she is an executive branch employee; she merely contends that she is a federal employee. Although the appellant was undoubtedly employed by an organ of the United States Government, she was a judicial branch employee, not an executive branch employee. The agency has submitted copies of judicial branch analogues to the executive branch Standard Form 50 which clearly demonstrate that the appellant is an employee of the judicial branch. The appellant does not dispute the authenticity or import of these documents and, in fact, she submits the identical documents into the record herself. We find, therefore, that the appellant is an employee of the judicial branch. Because the appellant is not an executive branch employee, the Board lacks jurisdiction over her appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hartman</span>, 77 F.3d at 1380-81 (the Board lacked jurisdiction over an individual right of action (IRA) appeal brought under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 by a judicial branch employee because the right to file an IRA appeal applied only to employees of an executive agency or the Government Printing Office).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that, although the appellant argues that her position is in the competitive service, we have considered whether her position could be deemed to be in the competitive service and we find that it cannot. There is no statute which specifically includes the appellant's position in the competitive service<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2102(a)(2). Positions in the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals are governed by 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 711 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> None of those statutory provisions state that the judicial branch positions to which they apply are included in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 711 (clerks, clerks' deputies, and clerks' assistants), 712 (law clerks and judges' secretaries), 713 (librarians and librarians' assistants), 714 (criers and messengers), 715 (staff attorneys, their secretarial and clerical employees, and technical assistants).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. MSPB</span>, 128 Fed. Appx. 139, 141-42 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board correctly identified three ways to meet the statutory definition of "employee" as set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). Section 7511(a)(1) defines an employee, in relevant part, as: (1) an individual in the competitive service who has fulfilled the requisite length of service; (2) a preference eligible individual in the excepted service who has completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar position in an Executive agency, the United States Postal Service, or the Postal Rate Commission; and (3) a nonpreference individual in the excepted service who has completed two years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to two years or less. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)-(C) (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Johnson contends that the Board erred in defining and interpreting "competitive service." We find no error in the Board's interpretation of "competitive service." The term "competitive service" is defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2102 as consisting of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "civil service positions not in the executive branch which are specifically included in the competitive service by statute." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 2102(a)(2). The Petitioner has not cited and we have not found any statute that places her position in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Johnson also contends that the Board erred in interpreting "excepted service." Subject to a few exceptions not relevant here, the "excepted service" consists of all civil service positions in an Executive agency. An Executive agency is defined as an "Executive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 105. The Board correctly concluded, and Johnson does not dispute, that she was an employee of the Judicial Branch, and not an employee of an Executive agency of the federal government. Accordingly, we agree with the Board that Johnson does not meet the definition of "employee" on this basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Johnson finally contends that, because she alleged that her removal was based on discrimination, her case is a "mixed case" within the Board's jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. For the purpose of determining the Board's jurisdiction, the discrimination claims must be made with respect to a personnel action that is otherwise appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7702(a); <span class="Italic">Hartman</span>, 77 F.3d at 1381. Since the Board lacks jurisdiction over personnel actions affecting employees of the Judicial Branch, the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear Johnson's discrimination claims as well.</p>
