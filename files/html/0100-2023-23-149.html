<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-147"><span class="space">m.</span> MSPB Review of Initial Decision on Enforcement Petition</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under current regulations, 5 CFR 1201.183 (2022), the AJ resolves the enforcement proceeding through a decision that is reviewable through a petition for review. Prior to regulatory revisions in 2012, the Board regulations on review of enforcement decisions were a bit confusing. The AJ who reviewed an enforcement petition was to issue a compliance recommendation; an initial decision was issued only if the AJ found the agency to be in full compliance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jarvis v. DOJ</span>, 45 MSPR 104, 106 n.1 (1990) (noting, under an earlier regulation, that a compliance recommendation was incorrectly labeled as an initial decision). Some the decisions that follow reference recommendations rather than decisions, and some references are to compliance initial decisions and some to enforcement initial decisions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency is determined to be in full compliance, the appellant proceeds with a PFR on the limited grounds available for a PFR. The Board will disregard a mistake in the appellant's labeling of his pleading seeking review of an AJ's compliance decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 179, 183 (1997) (Board adjudicated objections contained in the appellant's "request to reopen"). Under earlier regulations involving compliance recommendations, if the agency was found in noncompliance, it obtained review by submitting its objections to the compliance recommendation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coppola v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 394, 395 n.1 (1992) (Board treats a PFR filed by the appellant as a response to AJ's recommendation on compliance). There were no regulatory limits on the scope of the objections. But <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 566, 569 (1992), determined the Board will not entertain objections to a compliance recommendation that could have been, but were not, presented to the AJ. [Refer to earlier discussion of "<a href="0100-2023-23-142.html#sec16-140">Evidence of Compliance; Statement of Intent; Representative's Statement; Reargument of Merits,</a>" explaining how and at what level the Board considers proof concerning compliance issues.] Objections without specific record citations and persuasive argument of error are insufficient to alter findings of the AJ and will not be considered. Disagreement with conclusions reached by the AJ does not demonstrate that he ignored conflicting evidence. <span class="Italic">Eikenberry v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 37 MSPR 438, 444 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming the issuance of a enforcement initial decision that is subject to review, the PFR is governed by the same timeliness rules governing PFRs filed in other types of cases, <span class="Italic">Dean v. USPS</span>, 101 MSPR 356, 359-60 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 10-11, 2006 MSPB 55 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A petition for review of a compliance initial decision must be filed within 35 days from the date of the issuance of the decision, unless good cause is shown for the delayed filing. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(d); <span class="Italic">Kriete v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 680, &#x00B6; 6 (2002). To establish good cause for the untimely filing of a petition, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits, or unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his petition. <span class="Italic">Moorman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, a delay of over a year and three months is not minimal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dean,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 556, &#x00B6; 5 (a delay of 6 months is not minimal); <span class="Italic">Gaines v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. <span id="Page_4989"></span>504, &#x00B6; 7 (2004) (a delay of 37 days is not minimal). The compliance initial decision provided specific instructions regarding the time limit for filing a petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Murphy v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 490, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). The appellant's assertions regarding the agency's alleged breach of the settlement agreement in this case do not provide good cause for the appellant's untimely filing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tates v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 678, &#x00B6; 9 (2006); <span class="Italic">Blair v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant has not established that the delay was due to circumstances beyond his control. To establish that an untimely filing was the result of an illness, an appellant must: (1) identify the time period during which he suffered from the illness; (2) submit medical evidence showing that he suffered from the alleged illness during that time period; and (3) explain how the illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal or a request for an extension of time. <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 434, 437 (1998). The Board's January 21, 2004 compliance initial decision became the final Board decision regarding the appellant's petition for enforcement on February 25, 2004. The medical evidence the appellant has submitted does not address the 11-month period from January 21, 2004, until December 26, 2004. Thus, the appellant's medical evidence fails to establish that he was prevented from timely filing his petition for review during the relevant filing time period due to mental illness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Evidence concerning factual disputes should go to the Board's regional office. The agency cannot dispute, in a request for review of a compliance determination, admissions that it offered during enforcement proceedings at the regional level. <span class="Italic">Houston v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 164, 166-67 (1991) (agency could not controvert admissions it made to AJ that appellant was entitled to a merit pay increase as part of his remedy upon reinstatement). [Refer to the earlier discussion concerning the agency's continuing right to demonstrate compliance with a compliance recommendation under "<a href="0100-2023-23-135.html#sec16-133">Burden of Proof; Proof of Compliance</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board informs us that the PFR stage is too late to offer material evidence that could have been secured before termination of enforcement proceedings at the regional level. <span class="Italic">Warren v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 677, 679 (1996); <span class="Italic">Pearson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 255, 258 n.2 (1988) ("As noted by the agency...this information was readily available to the appellant before the hearing on the merits of his petition for enforcement. Thus, while the information is potentially material, it is clearly not new and cannot be a basis for our granting the appellant's petition for review, nor can it form the basis for a subsequent petition for enforcement."); <span class="Italic">Hall v. DOJ</span>, 26 MSPR 622, 624 (1985) (material submitted with the appellant's PFR did not constitute new and material evidence in a compliance proceeding). The Board will not accept evidence that could have been, but was not, presented to the AJ. <span class="Italic">Corsiglia v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 5, 10 n.2 (1995) (petition to enforce settlement: "The agency also contends that the appellant has not met the conditions for reinstatement because he was late in providing the evidence concerning his employment record....

Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 399, 402 (1995) (remanding enforcement matters that were raised before the Board when it reviewed an AJ's recommendation finding noncompliance as to other matters).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If, after the AJ issues an initial decision determining the agency is noncompliant and the Board issues its own order instructing the agency to submit evidence of compliance with the initial decision, the appellant's failure to challenge evidence then submitted of purported compliance will result in dismissal of the enforcement petition; the Board will assume that the appellant is satisfied. <span class="Italic">Heaps v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, SF-0752-15-0278-X-1 (NP 1/22/2016) (involving enforcement of a settlement). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Corum v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 566, 568-69 (1992), summed up the parties' responsibilities and limitations on the Board headquarters review process as to evidentiary presentations in enforcement actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden is on the agency to submit to the Board proof of compliance with its order<span class="Italic">. Rickels v. Department of Treasury</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 596 (1989). In a petition for enforcement proceeding all available proof of compliance should be filed with the administrative judge in the first instance. 5 C.F.R. 1201.183. The Board will not accept evidence which could have been, but was not, presented to the administrative judge<span class="Italic">. Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 560, 563-64 (1990). Similarly, the Board will not entertain objections to a noncompliance recommendation which could have been, but were not, presented to the administrative judge<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Marshall v. Government Printing Office</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 62, 65 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency made no attempt to explain why this evidence could not have been presented to the administrative judge. Because the agency has not shown that this evidence was unavailable at the time of its response to the petition for enforcement, we will not consider it further.[3] Therefore we will consider in support of the agency's exceptions only that evidence presented to the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Because we have not considered the agency's new evidence and argument we find it unnecessary to decide whether the appellant's timely request for an extension of time established good cause for his late-filed response to the agency's brief.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Beckwith v. VA</span>, 78 MSPR 668, 670-71 (1998), also explained the order of and limitations upon production of proof in an enforcement action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee files a petition for enforcement the agency has the burden of showing that it complied with the Board's order<span class="Italic">. Welber v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 MSPR 1, 3 (1994). The agency may not wait until the recommendation of noncompliance is issued before offering argument on the issues presented by the appellant because the Board will not consider agency objections to compliance which could have been, but were not, presented to the administrative judge in the first instance. <span class="Italic">Smith v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 54 MSPR 566, 568-69 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's submission in the initial compliance proceeding offered no reason for placing the appellant in a position other than her former position of Purchasing Agent. Although the appellant specifically alleged that her position of correspondence clerk was not the equivalent of her former position in terms of the knowledge and skills required, the potential for promotion, and the availability of overtime, the agency did not address these issues. Rather, the agency's response simply stated its belief that its "reinstatement of the appellant...places the agency in full compliance" with the Board's decision. It was only in response to the administrative judge's finding of noncompliance that the agency offered an explanation for its failure to place the appellant in her former position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the appellant's arguments setting out the distinctions between her former position and her position on reinstatement were made in her second submission to the administrative judge. However, the appellant's first submission, which asserted that the agency improperly failed to place her in her former position, put the agency on notice that position placement was an issue. Furthermore, the record before the administrative judge had not closed at the time of the appellant's second submission. Thus, the agency had the opportunity to present the argument of the appellant's alleged untrustworthiness to the administrative judge. Because the agency has failed to show that it was unable to present this argument to the administrative judge in the first instance, we will not consider it further.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency has presented no other evidence and argument on the issue of the appellant's reassignment to a new position, we find that it has failed to meet the requirement of <span class="Italic">Mann v. Veterans Administration</span>, 29 MSPR 271, 275 (1985), that it offer a compelling reason for its failure to reassign the appellant to her former position. Accordingly, the agency has failed to establish compliance with the Board's final decision. To meet its burden on compliance, the agency must reinstate the appellant to her former position of Purchasing Agent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite decisions stating that evidence pertaining to disputes over compliance is not to be produced for the first time to the Board, rather than to the AJ, the nature of enforcement proceedings is that the Board insists on continuing efforts at compliance. The only way to demonstrate those efforts is to supply proof of compliance to the Board. As to evidence of compliance developed during litigation at the stage of exceptions to a compliance recommendation, <span class="Italic">McDonough v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 122, 125-26 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While an agency may not submit new evidence or argument in its exceptions to a noncompliance recommendation, absent an explanation as to why the material could not have been presented to the administrative judge in the first instance, <span class="Italic">Smith v. United States Postal Service</span>, 54 MSPR 566, 568 (1992), the agency in this case is simply offering further explanation of its efforts to comply. To preclude an agency from offering a more complete explanation of its compliance effort could well lead to unnecessary adjudication. In the interest of ensuring that compliance has been effected, the Board will consider the agency's supplemental response....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency's ability to submit new evidence of compliance during Board review of AJs' compliance determinations was reconfirmed in <span class="Italic">Holmes v. VA</span>, 61 MSPR 497, 501-03 (1994), <span class="Italic">remanded on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Holmes v. VA</span>, 58 F.3d 628 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (remanded to assess a substantive breach of the settlement), <span class="Italic">post</span>, involving a dispute over whether the agency provided an employment reference that violated the requirements of a settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The recommended outcome of this case turned on what the agency failed to submit before the administrative judge. As the administrative judge noted in his Recommendation, the matter was adjudicated on the parties' written submissions. The appellant submitted, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a memorandum under Mr. Sitarski's signature that contained a specific account of the response by Mr. McLean to a telephoned reference check. The account indicated and described how the agency breached the provision of the agreement governing such checks. The agency <span id="Page_4990"></span>submitted an affidavit in which Mr. McLean made but a general denial of breaching the provision. The agency failed to directly address the specific allegations and documentary evidence submitted by appellant. Left with no choice, the administrative judge treated the evidence as unrebutted and properly concluded that the appellant had met his burden for establishing a breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Fredendall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 38 MSPR 366, 370 (1988) (the party seeking to enforce a settlement agreement has the burden of establishing a breach).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its brief in disagreement, the agency states that after the issuance of the Recommendation it stepped up its efforts to obtain evidence from appellant's prospective employer, the National Park Service. The stepped-up efforts, it asserts, produced new and material evidence that was unavailable before the close of the record before the administrative judge, despite its "reasonable and diligent efforts short of litigation to learn about the McLean interview from the Park Service." The evidence submitted by the agency is a copy of a report prepared by Mr. Sitarski's subordinate, Ms. Sturm, reflecting her conversation with Mr. McLean. The report indicates that Mr. McLean did not issue responses inconsistent with the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may not submit new evidence or argument in its response to a compliance recommendation, absent an explanation as to why the evidence was not submitted to the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">Smith v. United States Postal Service</span>, 54 MSPR 566, 568 (1992). Evidence that constitutes a further explanation of the agency's efforts to comply with the Board's order will, however, be considered by the Board. <span class="Italic">McDonough v. United States Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 122, 125-26 (1993). As an elaboration of the explanation of what transpired during the telephone call in question, this evidence constitutes a fuller explanation by the agency of its efforts to comply. It will, therefore, be considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency submitted a document that it identifies as a "report of contact" prepared by Ms. Sturm to reflect the substance of her telephone conversation with Mr. McLean. The report reflects that Mr. McLean identified himself as the agency employee designated to give reference checks. The substance of the report reflects a response by Mr. McLean that was generally complimentary, and does not contain negative information. The report reflects that Mr. McLean reported that appellant was punctual, had no problems dealing with his supervisors, and that there would be no problem rehiring him if he so wished. According to the report, Mr. McLean described appellant as "very people oriented." The report also states, significantly, that Mr. McLean was aware of no weaknesses in appellant's job performance, nor of any areas where he could improve his performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The information contained in the report supports the contention made by Mr. McLean in his initial affidavit that the information provided by him was consistent with the requirements of the settlement agreement. We hold, therefore, that appellant has not met his burden of establishing the agency's breach of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's treatment of the "new evidence" first presented to the Board during its review of an AJ's enforcement recommendation, <span class="Italic">Holmes v. VA</span>, 58 F.3d 628, 632 (Fed. Cir. 1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Holmes argues first that the Board erred when it agreed to consider the Sturm report after the administrative judge had issued his enforcement recommendation. This point requires little discussion. Procedural matters relative to evidentiary issues fall within the sound discretion of the Board and its officials. <span class="Italic">Curtin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 846 F.2d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1988). As noted above, the Board viewed the Sturm report as "a fuller explanation by the agency of its efforts to comply [with the settlement agreement]." Beyond that, the VA's response to the enforcement petition and its brief to the Board following the administrative judge's enforcement recommendation--both discussed above--make it clear that the Sturm report only became available to the VA after the Park Service "was put on notice of possible Justice Department intervention." In other words, the VA explained to the Board why it had been unable to come forward with the Sturm report sooner.[4] The Board did not abuse its discretion by agreeing to consider the Sturm report.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Smith v. United States Postal Service</span>, 54 MSPR 566, 568-69 (1992) (an agency may not submit new evidence in its response to a compliance recommendation, absent an explanation as to why the evidence was not submitted to the administrative judge); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.58(c) (1994) ("Once the record closes, no additional evidence...will be accepted unless the party submitting it shows that the evidence was not readily available before the record closed."); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(c) (1994) ("The Board...may grant a petition for review when it is established that...[n]ew and material evidence is available that, despite due diligence, was not available when the record closed.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gevaert v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 74 MSPR 303, 306 (1997), added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While the Board sets time limits for agencies to submit evidence of compliance, additional submissions may be accepted if the circumstances warrant, such as when the evidence is new and material as here. An appellant should not assume that an agency's unsolicited submission will be rejected out of hand. An appellant may respond to an agency's supplemental or late submission of evidence or argument in accordance with the Board's regulations, which provide 20 days for the appellant's response. 5 CFR 1201.183(a)(7).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-09-0604-C-1 (NP 4/9/2015) ("Although we have reached this conclusion based on the explanation contained within the agency's declaration, which was not presented to the administrative judge below, the Board has considered, in previous matters of compliance with a final Board order, a more complete explanation of an agency's compliance effort offered for the first time on review in the interest of ensuring that compliance has been effected. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDonough v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 122, 125-26 (1993). The appellant, moreover, has had an opportunity to respond to this information on review, and we find no basis in the record to conclude that the agency erred in its back pay calculations prior to August 28, 2011."); <span class="Italic">Cavanagh v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 232, 239 n.2 (1994) (permitting evidence supplied by the agency, apparently for the first time, in the agency brief in disagreement with the AJ's compliance recommendation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To bring matters to closure, once the Board issues a decision providing instructions on compliance in a prolonged proceeding, the Board may assign oversight to the Board's Office of General Counsel, <span class="Italic">Corum v. USPS</span>, DC-0353-06-0728-C-1 (NP 9/6/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we have found the agency in noncompliance, the agency is being directed to file evidence of compliance with the Clerk of the Board, and the appellant will be afforded the opportunity to respond to that evidence. The appellant's petition for enforcement will be referred to the Board's Office of General Counsel, and, depending on the nature of the submissions, an attorney with the Office of General Counsel may contact the parties to further discuss the compliance process. The parties are required to cooperate with that individual in good faith. Because the purpose of the proceeding is to obtain compliance, when appropriate, an Office of General Counsel attorney or paralegal may engage in <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications to, among other things, better understand the evidence of compliance and any objections to that evidence. Thereafter, the Board will issue a final decision fully addressing the appellant's petition for review of the compliance initial decision and setting forth the appellant's further appeal rights and the right to attorney fees, if applicable.</p>
