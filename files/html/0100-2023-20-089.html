<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-81"><span class="space">3.</span> <span class="Italic">Rusin</span> Model: Nonfrivolous Allegations Establish Jurisdiction; <span class="Italic">Hessami</span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2002, the Board attempted to sort out the IRA jurisdictional quagmire created by its decisions and those of the Federal Circuit. The Board decided that jurisdiction would be determined on the basis of allegations, rather than through relying upon allegations leading to a "jurisdictional hearing," with the merits being addressed somewhere along the way or afterwards. <span class="Italic">Rusin v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/RUSIN_MARK_S_CH_1221_00_0028_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_250380.pdf">92 MSPR 298</a> (2002), made the doctrinal shift. The basic determination of the case is that the Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted his OSC remedies and makes nonfrivolous allegations that he made a disclosure protected under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action as defined by 5 USC 2302(a). In 2015 the Board offered a regulatory definition of a nonfrivolous allegation (summarizing cases), 5 CFR 1201.4(s) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(s)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Nonfrivolous allegation</span>. A nonfrivolous allegation is an assertion that, if proven, could establish the matter at issue. An allegation generally will be considered nonfrivolous when, under oath or penalty of perjury, an individual makes an allegation that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Is more than conclusory;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is plausible on its face; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Is material to the legal issues in the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Reed v. VA</span>, CH-1221-13-1557-M-1 (NP 9/25/2015) ("Given the minimal showing required to meet the nonfrivolous allegation standard, we find that the appellant has met her burden regarding this disclosure as well. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jessup v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 10 (2007) (observing that the appellant's burden of making a nonfrivolous allegation is low and requires only a minimally sufficient showing).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of interest in <span class="Italic">Rusin</span> is a portion of the Separate Opinion of Member Slavet, who explained collateral issues and the questions unaddressed in the Board's decision. The basic <span class="Italic">Rusin</span> analysis is reprinted below, followed by Ms. Slavet's Opinion, 92 MSPR 301-07 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-20:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's primary argument in his petition for review is that the administrative judge erred by denying him a hearing. He argues that he was entitled to a jurisdictional hearing because he raised non-frivolous allegations of fact which, if proven, were sufficient to show jurisdiction. He further argues that the administrative judge erred because the Board has held that the decision as to whether an individual is reasonable in his belief that he has disclosed a violation of law, rule, or regulation or one of the other conditions listed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) requires a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained below, we have determined that the appellant's factual <span id="Page_3798"></span>allegations entitle him to a remand for a hearing to give him the opportunity to show that he made a protected disclosure within the meaning of the statute. This determination raises the question of whether such a hearing should be one limited to the issue of the Board's jurisdiction or whether the appellant is entitled to a hearing on the merits of his claim. The question arises because, as the Board's reviewing court has recently noted, the Board and the court have taken different approaches to what is required to establish the Board's jurisdiction over IRA appeals under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221. <span class="Italic">See Yunus v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The rule for establishing IRA jurisdiction that has been followed by the Board since 1994 was first stated in <span class="Italic">Geyer v. Department of Justice,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. 13, 16-17 (1994). <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> held that to establish the Board's jurisdiction over an IRA appeal an appellant must <span class="Italic">prove</span> by preponderant evidence that: (1) he engaged in whistleblower activity by making a disclosure protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); (2) the agency took or failed to take a personnel action as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2); and (3) he raised the whistleblower issue before OSC and proceedings before OSC have been exhausted. <span class="Italic">See also Kaeseman v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Veterans Affairs,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. 236, 238-39 (1994) (in order to establish jurisdiction over an IRA, employee must prove the above-stated <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> elements by the preponderance of the evidence). Under <span class="Italic">Geyer,</span> an appellant is sometimes able to establish the Board's jurisdiction through his pleadings and written submissions. In cases such as this one, where an appellant has alleged facts that, if proven, would establish the Board's jurisdiction, under <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> the appellant is entitled to an opportunity to prove jurisdiction through a jurisdictional hearing<span class="Italic">. See Bump</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Interior,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 326, 332 (1994). Regardless of the manner in which an appellant establishes jurisdiction, however, in order to prevail on the merits, <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> requires the appellant to prove by the preponderance of the evidence the causal connection between his protected whistleblowing and the personnel action subsequently taken by the agency. At that point in the proceedings, in order for the agency to prevail on the merits, it must show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel action regardless of the appellant's whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Kaeseman v. Department of Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. at 239; <span class="Italic">Gilmore v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit acknowledged in <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 242 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2001), that some of its decisions appear to have adopted the <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> approach to the Board's jurisdiction under section 1221. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1372 n.1, <span class="Italic">citing inter alia Serrao v.

However, in <span class="Italic">Yunus</span> and other cases, the court has apparently rejected <span class="Italic">Geyer,</span> stating that an individual who has exhausted his OSC remedy establishes the Board's IRA jurisdiction by making <span class="Italic">non-frivolous</span> <span class="Italic">allegations</span> that he made a protected disclosure and that his disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a covered personnel action against him<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 1371-72; <span class="Italic">see also Schmittling v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army,</span> 219 F.3d 1332, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Willis v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Agriculture,</span> 141 F.3d 1139, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Under these cases, the making of such allegations establishes the Board's jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant's claim on the merits. To prevail on the merits, the appellant is then required to prove these elements by preponderant evidence. But the agency, as in <span class="Italic">Geyer,</span> may still prevail if it shows by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action in the absence of the appellant's whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 7 F.3d 1031, 1034 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Kewley v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 153 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> approach is at variance with the <span class="Italic">Yunus</span> approach in two ways. First, the approaches differ in their treatment of the "causative" element of a whistleblower claim. Under <span class="Italic">Geyer,</span> the causal connection between the appellant's alleged whistleblowing and the alleged personnel action is treated solely as an element of the claim on the merits, and not as part of the jurisdictional showing. Under the court's approach, the causative element is a merits element that the appellant must prove in order to prevail, a non-frivolous allegation of a causal link is part of the required jurisdictional showing.[2] This difference also reflects a second, more basic difference between the two approaches. While <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> treats establishing jurisdiction as a matter of proof, an appellant establishes Board jurisdiction in an IRA appeal under <span class="Italic">Yunus</span> by merely exhausting his OSC remedy and making non-frivolous allegations that he made a protected disclosure that was a contributing factor in a covered personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Requiring a non-frivolous allegation of the "causative element" as part of the jurisdictional showing has the sensible effect of not requiring the Board to entertain on the merits claims concerning personnel actions which were taken prior to the appellant's alleged whistleblowing and which thus could not, as a metaphysical reality, have contributed to the personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Horton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 F.3d 279, 284 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although <span class="Italic">Yunus</span> did not explicitly overrule the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, the court made clear that it disapproved of the <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> approach, and it set forth what it determined was the correct rule for establishing the Board's jurisdiction in IRA appeals. <span class="Italic">See Yunus,</span> 242 F.3d at 1371-72 and n.1. The Board is required to follow the decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, its reviewing court. <span class="Italic">Amarille v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 424, 426 (1995). We therefore adopt the <span class="Italic">Yunus</span> approach here as the appropriate jurisdictional formulation in IRA appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted his OSC remedies and makes non-frivolous allegations that he made a disclosure protected under section 2302(b)(8), and the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a). We therefore overrule the holdings of <span class="Italic">Geyer v. Department of Justice,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. 13 (1994), and cases relying on it that follow a different approach than <span class="Italic">Yunus.</span>[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that several recent Board decisions have applied the <span class="Italic">Yunus</span> test, but did not overrule <span class="Italic">Geyer. Harvey v. Department of the Navy,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 51 (2002); <span class="Italic">Lachenmyer v. Federal Election Commission,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 80 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying this analysis, we find that the appellant has made his jurisdictional showing. First, he sought corrective action from and exhausted proceedings before OSC. It is also clear that the appellant made non-frivolous allegations that his disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decisions to take covered personnel actions against him. Specifically, he alleged that the agency took several actions that are defined as "personnel actions" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). Moreover, he made detailed, factual allegations that the agency officials responsible for these personnel actions were aware of his disclosure and acted within such time that a reasonable person could find that the disclosure contributed to the actions. Thus, if the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation that his disclosure was protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), he has established the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the appellant has exhausted his OSC remedy and has made non-frivolous allegations that he engaged in protected whistleblowing that contributed to covered personnel actions taken against him. Accordingly, the test for establishing the Board's IRA jurisdiction has been met, and the appellant is entitled to a hearing on the merits of his claim.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Because the appellant's allegations with respect to three personnel actions meet the <span class="Italic">Yunus</span> jurisdictional test, this case has reached the merits stage with respect to those personnel actions. It is within the sound discretion of the administrative judge to take the merits issues in the order she determines is the most efficient. <span class="Italic">See Dick v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 290 F.3d 1356, 1363-64 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Member Slavet observed in her separate Opinion in <span class="Italic">Rusin</span>, 92 MSPR at 313-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases where formerly an IRA appellant's failure to prove (after a hearing if one was requested) that he made a protected disclosure would have resulted in a jurisdictional dismissal, the dismissal will now be on the merits for failure to prove the claim.[5] Thus, in the instant appeal, if the appellant fails to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he had a reasonable belief that the information he disclosed evidenced a violation of the agency's rules, the administrative judge should dismiss his appeal for failure to prove a claim upon which relief can be granted. <span class="Italic">See Spruill,</span> 978 F.2d at 689 ("When a nonfrivolous claim for relief has been asserted before the Board, and the outcome is determined by whether the facts support the claim, a decision by the Board that they do not is a failure to prove a claim, not a lack of jurisdiction...").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The court has indicated that in some IRA appeals, dismissal for failure to state a claim will be appropriate and such dismissals can properly occur without first affording the appellant a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Meuwissen v. Department of Interior</span>, 234 F.3d 9 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (upholding dismissal for failure to state a claim because on its face the asserted "whistleblowing" made no disclosure of a violation of law within the meaning of the statute). However, I confess I still find it difficult to determine from the court's decisions when the Board is required to dismiss an appeal for failure to state a claim as opposed to dismissing for lack of jurisdiction. In a post-<span class="Italic">Yunus</span> case involving circumstances that were nearly identical to <span class="Italic">Meuwissen,</span> and where the court cited to <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> as controlling, the court affirmed the Board's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction without addressing why it was not applying the <span class="Italic">Spruill / Meuwissen</span> failure-to-state-a-claim analysis and conclusion. <span class="Italic">See Francisco v. Office of Personnel <span id="Page_3799"></span>Management,</span> 295 F.3d 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2002). In light of the significant consequences that flow from a dismissal for failure to state a claim, which I discuss in a later part of this opinion, I believe that the Board should be extremely cautious in dismissing cases without a hearing for failure to state a claim until further guidance on this issue is forthcoming from the court. Until then, I believe the Board should dismiss IRA appeals for failure to state a claim only when there is no question that the Board, as a matter of law, cannot grant any relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I also think it is important to address the <span class="Italic">Cruz/Spruill</span> jurisdictional dichotomy because of the secondary effects of a dismissal for failure to state or prove a claim. A determination by the Board to dismiss an appeal for failure to state or prove a claim upon which relief can be granted has critical legal consequences because such dismissals are decisions on the merits. <span class="Italic">Spruill,</span> 978 F.2d at 687-88. A decision on the merits has greater preclusive effect in subsequent actions than a jurisdictional decision since the <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect of a merits decision (claim preclusion) bars consideration of arguments that could have been presented in support of the claim but were not, while the preclusive effect of a jurisdictional dismissal (collateral estoppel or issue preclusion) is limited to issues that were actually litigated. <span class="Italic">See Baker and Thomas v. General Motors</span> <span class="Italic">Corp.,</span> 522 U.S. 222, 233 n.5, 118 S. Ct. 657, 139 L. Ed. 580 (1998). <span class="Italic">See also Bump v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Interior,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. at 331-33 (jurisdictional dismissal of prior IRA appeal for failure to exhaust OSC remedy did not bar second IRA appeal of same claim after OSC remedy was exhausted). Because the Board's section 1221 jurisdiction is limited to whistleblower claims, the greater <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect of an IRA merits dismissal may well be limited to preclusion of a second appeal challenging the same personnel action as based on different disclosures that were not brought to OSC and the Board in the first action, although they could have been.[6] Even so, it would be appropriate to attempt to minimize appellants' unwitting forfeiture of arguments for relief by notifying them that all known whistleblower contentions concerning the challenged personnel action should be presented in initial complaints to OSC and subsequent IRA appeals.[7] Further, it should be kept in mind that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is an affirmative defense that must be raised by a party and, absent special circumstances, should not be raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stearn v. Department of the Navy,</span> 280 F.3d 1376, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;This statement assumes that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> would bar not only an argument that an appellant failed to raise in an earlier appeal of the same action when he could have done so, but also an argument that was not considered in the earlier appeal even though the appellant raised it because he failed to present it first to OSC. I need not decide here whether this assumption concerning the reach of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> in these circumstances is correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Notification in the Board's acknowledgement order would appear to be too late because of the exhaustion rule. However, when it becomes clear that an appellant wishes to rely on additional protected disclosures not presented to OSC, the appeal could be dismissed without prejudice to permit exhaustion of the OSC remedy with respect to such alleged disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, I believe that the jurisprudential change made by our decision today will facilitate whistleblowers' presentation of their claims. The rule adopted here, which mandates that nonfrivolous allegations are the basis for the Board's IRA jurisdiction, is one that makes jurisdiction easier to establish. This rule is also consistent with the simplified pleading standard for civil actions generally that is found in Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) and that was recently held applicable to employment discrimination actions by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,</span> 534 U.S. 506, 122 S. Ct. 992, 998 (2002). At the same time, conscious that changes may have adverse effects that we cannot fully anticipate until they have been experienced, I believe the Board's administrative judges should take special care to ensure that this change does not have an adverse impact on whistleblowers' ability to present their claims. In particular, our administrative judges should allow parties sufficient time to engage in the discovery needed to define what facts are involved in the determination of whether a "reasonable belief' is present, rather than too hastily concluding that a particular disclosure is insufficient to support such a belief. Particularly when <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants are involved, the Board must not apply its decisions in a way that can make them a trap for the unwary party.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-established that the Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant exhausted her administrative remedies before OSC and makes nonfrivolous allegations that: (1) she engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure, and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Yunus v.

To meet the nonfrivolous standard, an appellant need only plead allegations of fact which, if proven, could show that she made a protected disclosure that was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Massie v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Intervenor the Department of the Treasury ("Treasury") contends that "the appellant bears the burden to establish jurisdiction by a <span class="Italic">preponderance of the evidence</span>," citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56 (emphasis added). Petitioner Aviles disagrees. Aviles relies on the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, in which the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> court explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Section 1201.56 of the regulations, <span class="Italic">placing the burden of proof on the employee with respect to "jurisdictional issues," is plainly not concerned with the first issue of technical jurisdiction</span> (the need for a non-frivolous allegation), but rather with the second issue (concerning the ultimate merits). It places the burden of proof on the employee at a merits hearing with respect to merits issues that are also jurisdictional issues. Thus, although the regulation characterizes the issues with which it is concerned as "jurisdictional" in nature, the regulation is directed, in fact, to the allocation of the burden of proof on the merits.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Aviles's interpretation of <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, which we follow as persuasive, and we conclude that Aviles need not establish jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We also conclude that the standard for determining whether nonfrivolous allegations are sufficient to meet the threshold jurisdictional requirement for an IRA appeal is analogous to that which we use for evaluating a motion to dismiss.[4] Accordingly, we accept all well-pleaded facts as true and view those facts in the light most favorable to the petitioner. <span class="Italic">See Whitley v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the government acknowledges that an "employee is entitled to a hearing if she presents a non-frivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over her [claims]." It contends, however, that Johnston's allegations are frivolous because it was "unreasonable" for her to believe that it was dangerous to employ CSRs, rather than SOHMs, to review agency training exercises. In support, it points out that CSRs would be given training and would be supervised by a CSR team leader.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This argument misses the mark. Johnston asserted that SOHMs have far more safety expertise than CSRs, and she was not required to prove conclusively that CSRs were incapable of properly reviewing training activities in order to establish board jurisdiction. On the contrary, under the WPA, "whether [an] allegation can be proven is a question on the merits that does not properly form a part of the jurisdictional inquiry." <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, 508 F.3d at 678; <span class="Italic">Greenspan v.

Indeed, since Johnston's appeal was dismissed before she was given access to the agency's file on her case or provided with an opportunity to conduct discovery, it would have been well-nigh impossible for her to prove that CSRs lacked the requisite training and experience to safely review training activities.</p>

In order to establish Board jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, an appellant, who is an employee, must exhaust his administrative remedies before OSC and make nonfrivolous allegations that: (1) He engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure; and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Yunus v.

Through his written submissions, the appellant made nonfrivolous allegations that he made protected disclosures and that these disclosures were a contributing factor in his nonselection....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the AJ determined that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that he engaged in whistleblowing activity. Citing <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2006), an appeal involving an alleged constructive reduction in grade, the AJ found that the appellant was entitled to a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[U]nder 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701 and 7512, once a claimant makes non-frivolous claims of Board jurisdiction, namely claims that, if proven, establish the Board's jurisdiction, the claimant has a right to hearing. At the hearing, the claimant must prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. If the Board determines that the claimant fails to prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, then the Board does not have jurisdiction and the case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1344.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court further noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In a constructive action case, the jurisdictional fact at issue is almost always whether the facially voluntary action was involuntary. Involuntariness is essential for jurisdiction and it must be proven by the claimant. But while jurisdiction is established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, the merits of the case are determined by the agency's compliance with &#x00A7; 7513(a)-(b). In other words, the jurisdictional determination is not identical to the merits determination. <span class="Italic">Cf. Rusin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298, 303 (2002) (noting in the context of the IRA that there is a near complete overlap between the merits and the jurisdictional determinations: "the making of such [non-frivolous] allegations [for IRA claims] establishes the Board's jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant's claim on the merits. To prevail on the merits, the appellant is then required to prove these elements by preponderant evidence").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1341.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, unlike adverse action appeals such as <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, an appellant with an IRA appeal is not entitled to a hearing until he establishes Board jurisdiction based on the written record and, if jurisdiction is established, the hearing is on the merits of the appeal, not the issue of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Spencer</span>, 327 F.3d at 1356. Given this procedural distinction, the AJ erred by relying on <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> as a basis for affording the appellant a hearing regarding his IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather than completely deciding the issue of jurisdiction on the pleadings alone and proceeding to a hearing only after jurisdiction was established, <span class="Italic">see Spencer</span>, 327 F.3d at 1356, the AJ limited the required pre-hearing jurisdictional determination to a finding that the appellant had made a nonfrivolous allegation that he engaged in whistleblowing activity. The AJ then held a hearing on the merits of the appellant's IRA appeal. After conducting the hearing, the AJ determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's IRA appeal because he failed to prove that a protected whistleblowing disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action. If he had met this burden, I would not grant the appellant's request for corrective action because the agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel actions in the absence of the whistleblowing activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ did not properly adjudicate the appellant's IRA appeal. First, as noted above, the AJ conducted a hearing on the merits without properly determining, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Yunus/Rusin</span>, that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Spencer</span>, 327 F.3d at 1356. In addition, the AJ ultimately required the appellant to <span class="Italic">prove</span> that his whistleblower activities were contributing factors to the agency's personnel actions in order to establish jurisdiction over his appeal, when what is required to show jurisdiction over an IRA appeal is a nonfrivolous allegation that the alleged protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel actions. <span class="Italic">See Holloway v. Department of the Interior</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 650, &#x00B6; 9 (2004) (the contributing factor issue is part of the jurisdictional criteria under <span class="Italic">Yunus</span> and must be adjudicated before determining that the Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 131 Fed. Appx. 717 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, as explained above, the AJ's failure to adjudicate the appeal properly was harmless, <span class="Italic">see Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision), because the appellant made the requisite nonfrivolous allegations based on his written submissions. <span class="Italic">See Spencer</span>, 327 F.3d at 1356.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The distinction in jurisdictional burdens of proof for IRA and constructive adverse action cases was also noted in <span class="Italic">Stoyanov v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <span class="blue">474 F.3d 1377</span>, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Stoyanov argues that the Board's decision should be reversed because the AJ improperly relied on <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> when reciting the standard by which the Board determines it has jurisdiction. The <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> case [<span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, 437 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>)] involved an allegation of constructive adverse action by an agency, which is filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, 437 F.3d at 1324, whereas the present action involves an IRA filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221. In <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, however, this court did address IRA appeals, and reiterated the standard by which an appellant establishes the Board's jurisdiction. 437 F.3d at 1324. Specifically, this court reaffirmed its holding in <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 687-89 (Fed. Cir. 1992), that for IRA appeals, the Board's jurisdiction is established by nonfrivolous allegations that the appellant made a protected disclosure that was a contributing factor to the personnel action taken or proposed. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1325.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If, under <span class="Italic">Rusin</span> and kindred cases, the appellant in an IRA case makes it to a hearing, the initial decision is on the merits of the IRA case. <span class="Italic">Oscar v.

<p class="Body-Text">In 2020, the Federal Circuit reentered the analysis of nonfrivolous allegations by eschewing a summary judgment standard and rejecting jurisdictional analysis that weighs competing evidence, e.g., statements of agency managers, <span class="Italic">Hessami v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20201109079">___F.3d___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first clarify the appropriate scope of the Board's inquiry when evaluating its jurisdiction over a whistleblower appeal. In <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., this court held that the threshold question of whether an appellant has invoked the Board's jurisdiction should be assessed under a "non-frivolous allegation" standard analogous to the "well-pleaded complaint rule" used to evaluate federal question jurisdiction in federal <span id="Page_3802"></span>court. 978 F.2d 679, 687-89 (Fed. Cir. 1992). We explained that "under the 'well-pleaded complaint rule,' whether a district court has federal-question jurisdiction over a claim 'must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff's statement of his own claim in the bill or declaration.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 688 (quoting <span class="Italic">Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp</span>., 486 U.S. 800, 809 (1988)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our subsequent cases have evaluated jurisdiction in whistleblower cases based on whether allegations were facially sufficient. <span class="Italic">See Johnston v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 518 F.3d 905, 910 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Yunus</span>, 242 F.3d at 1372. This court has consistently treated "a non-frivolous allegation" of an element as one that, "'if proven, can establish the Board's jurisdiction.'" <span class="Italic">Cahill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 821 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (quoting <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 437 F.3d 1322, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>)). Most recently, in <span class="Italic">Piccolo v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., we stated that "at the jurisdictional stage, a petitioner need only assert non-frivolous allegations--allegations that are not 'vague, conclusory, or facially insufficient,' and that the petitioner 'reasonably believe[s]' to be true--of a protected disclosure that was a contributing factor to a reprisal." 869 F.3d 1369, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (quoting <span class="Italic">Johnston</span>, 518 F.3d at 910). We held there that evidence concerning "a petitioner's credibility including...consideration of affidavits submitted by an allegedly retaliatory supervisor...'relates to the merits of the claim'" rather than jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Piccolo</span>, 869 F.3d at 1371 (quoting <span class="Italic">Johnston</span>, 518 F.3d at 911).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2015, the Board codified the non-frivolous allegation standard in its regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.57(b) and 1201.4. <span class="Italic">See</span> Practices and Procedures, 80 Fed. Reg. 4489 (Jan. 28, 2015). Section 1201.57(b) provides that an appellant who initiates a whistleblower appeal "must make nonfrivolous allegations...with regard to the substantive jurisdictional elements"[2] of the appeal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.57(b). Section 1201.4 defines a "nonfrivolous allegation" as "an assertion that, if proven, could establish the matter at issue" and specifies that "[a]n allegation generally will be considered nonfrivolous when, under oath or penalty of perjury, an individual makes an allegation that: (1) Is more than conclusory; (2) Is plausible on its face; and (3) Is material to the legal issues in the appeal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 1201.4(s).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;This excludes the non-merits elements of exhaustion and standing, which must be established by preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that this court has, on at least one occasion, analogized the standard for establishing non-frivolous allegations to the standard for summary judgment. <span class="Italic">See Kahn v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 528 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ("The standard for determining whether non-frivolous disclosures exist 'is analogous to that for summary judgment.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Dorrall v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 301 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002))). We did not, however, actually apply the summary judgment standard to authorize jurisdictional dismissal of a whistleblower appeal based on evidence submitted by the agency. To the extent the "summary judgment" analogy suggests that such a dismissal would be proper, it is plainly contrary to both the Board's current regulations and our holding in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The "summary judgment" analogy in <span class="Italic">Kahn</span> was borrowed from <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span>, 301 F.3d at 1380, which turned on the question of constructive discharge, a question that we have since held to be subject to a "preponderance of evidence" test for jurisdictional purposes rather than non-frivolous allegations. <span class="Italic">See Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1325. Although in certain pre-<span class="Italic">Spruill</span> cases, we approved of the Board's reliance on the agency's evidence in finding no jurisdiction, those cases involved direct appeals under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), where the threshold jurisdictional question was whether the employee suffered an appealable personnel action, a determination that is subject to the preponderance of the evidence standard. <span class="Italic">See Manning v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 742 F.2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (relying on agency evidence in concluding that employee was not suspended for more than 14 days); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 807 F.2d 1577, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (relying on agency evidence in concluding that employee had not been reduced in grade).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Permitting jurisdictional dismissal of an appeal based on a summary review of the evidence on the core merits issues would undermine Congress's express intent that the merits of employee appeals be resolved through a hearing rather than summary judgment. As we explained in <span class="Italic">Crispin v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, Section 7701 expressly provides that in any appeal to the Board, "[a]n appellant shall have the right to a hearing for which a transcript will be kept," and the legislative history made clear that the provision was meant to bar summary judgment. 732 F.2d 919, 922 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1); H.R. REP. NO. 95-1717, at 137 (1978), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2860, 2871). Thus, this court held in <span class="Italic">Crispin</span> that even when the documentary record clearly supports judgment for the agency, the appellant is nonetheless entitled to a hearing on the merits as a matter of statutory right.[4] <span class="Italic">Crispin</span>, 732 F.2d at 922. A summary judgment standard for "non-frivolous allegations" would allow the agency to circumvent that rule and obtain the equivalent of summary judgment on the merits by merely framing its motion as one for jurisdictional dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Board, in recognition of our holdings, declined to promulgate a process for summary judgment. Practices and Procedures, 77 Fed. Reg. 62350, 62352 (Oct. 12, 2012) (rejecting suggestion to create summary judgment proceedings because "[t]he Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has found that the MSPB lacks authority to order summary judgment.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus clarify and hold that when evaluating the Board's jurisdiction over a whistleblower action, the question of whether the appellant has non-frivolously alleged protected disclosures that contributed to a personnel action must be determined based on whether the employee alleged sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim that is plausible on its face.[5] The Board may not deny jurisdiction by crediting the agency's interpretation of the evidence as to whether the alleged disclosures fell within the protected categories or whether the disclosures were a contributing factor to an adverse personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;It does not follow from this, however, that the Board is restricted to considering these allegations in a vacuum. As the Supreme Court has explained regarding the analogous well-pleaded complaint rule, "[d]etermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will...be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense." <span class="Italic">Ashcroft v. Iqbal</span>, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009). And, consistent with that analogous rule, the Board may also consider sources such as "matters incorporated by reference or integral to the claim, items subject to judicial notice, [and] matters of public record." <span class="Italic">See A &#x0026; D Auto Sales, Inc. v. United States</span>, 748 F.3d 1142, 1147 (Fed. Cir. 2014).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Barrett v. VA</span>, SF-1221-16-0632-W-1, n.8 (NP 4/27/2023) ("As noted by the Federal Circuit, in determining whether an appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation in an IRA appeal, the Board should not consider the appellant's allegations in a vacuum. <span class="Italic">Hessami v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 979 F.3d 1362, 1369 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The court explained that "[t]he Board may not deny jurisdiction by crediting the agency's interpretation of the evidence as to whether the alleged disclosures fell within the protected categories or whether the disclosures were a contributing factor to an adverse personnel action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Nevertheless, the court noted that "the Board may also consider sources such as 'matters incorporated by reference or integral to the claim, items subject to judicial notice, [and] matters of public record.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">A &#x0026; D Auto Sales, Inc. v. United States,</span> 748 F.3d 1142, 1147 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting 5B Charles Alan Wright &#x0026; Arthur R. Miller, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice and Procedure</span> &#x00A7; 1357 (3d ed. 2004))). Similarly, we may also consider "exhibits attached to the complaint whose authenticity is unquestioned." Wright &#x0026; Miller, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> &#x00A7; 1357; <span class="Italic">von Kaenel v. Armstrong Teasdale, LLP</span>, 943 F.3d 1139, 1143 (8th Cir. 2019).").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant attached a copy of the settlement agreement to his appeal. He relied on it to support his claim that the agreement violated "current and future law," and he does not dispute the authenticity of the agreement. The appellant also asserted that the agency breached the agreement when it did not remove derogatory information from his personnel file and "blacklist[ed]" him for several positions to which he applied. Thus, we find that the settlement agreement is a matter incorporated by reference or integral to the appellant's claim, and that its authenticity is unquestioned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(c) provides that a "written instrument" attached to a pleading becomes "a part of that pleading for all purposes." Under this reasoning, when an appellant attaches a written instrument to his appeal, and relies on it to assert his claims, its contents are part of the appeal that the Board may consider in determining its sufficiency. <span class="Italic">See Williamson v. Curran</span>, 714 F.3d 432, 435-36 (7th Cir. 2013) (explaining that "when a plaintiff attaches to the complaint a document that qualifies as a written instrument, and her complaint references and relies upon that document in asserting her claim, the contents of that document become part of the complaint and may be considered as such when the court decides a motion attacking the sufficiency of the complaint"). "[A]n instrument is a document that defines a party's rights, obligations, entitlements, or liabilities," such as a contract. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citation omitted). A settlement agreement is a contract. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of the Army</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 178, &#x00B6; 6 (2016). Thus, under the guidance provided by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(c) and case law interpreting that rule, we find that the settlement agreement became a part of the appeal and may be considered in determining whether the Board has jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3803"></span><span class="Italic">See Baillie v. Dept. of Energy</span>, DC-1221-20-0838-W-1 (NP 5/26/2022) ("In determining if an appellant met the nonfrivolous pleading standard, we look at her allegations rather than the agency's contrary evidence or "interpretation of the evidence." <span class="Italic">Hessami v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 979 F.3d 1362, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2020). The test to determine whether a putative whistleblower has a reasonable belief in the disclosure is an objective one: whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably conclude that the actions of the agency evidenced a violation of law, rule, regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">Salerno</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 6.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The short of it is that if the appellant presents nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction, the hearing that follows is on the merits and not on jurisdiction, although the hearing may expand upon the jurisdictional allegations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morrall v. Dept. Defense</span>, 97 MSPR 378, 379 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5 (2004) (written record establishes whether there are nonfrivolous allegations establishing jurisdiction; the hearing is on the merits); <span class="Italic">Huffman v. OPM</span>, 92 MSPR 429, 435 n.6 (2002). Doubt or ambiguity as to whether the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation is resolved in favor of allowing a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ivey v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 94 MSPR 224, 229 &#x00B6; 13 (2003) (issue of reasonableness of belief in disclosures), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Ivey v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 107 Fed. Appx. 918 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP). Once jurisdiction is established through nonfrivolous allegations, the AJ is to receive evidence and analyze the case under the various WPA elements, including whether the appellant's disclosures were protected, whether the agency took the challenged personnel actions against the appellant because of those protected disclosures, and whether the agency can show by clear and convincing evidence that the actions would have been taken without regard to the protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Greenspan v. VA</span>, 94 MSPR 247, 256-57 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 29-31 (2003) (on later review, <span class="Italic">Greenspan v. VA</span>, <span class="blue">464 F.3d 1297</span> (Fed. Cir. 2006)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Iyer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 95 MSPR 239, 241-42 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5 (2003), provides an example of a <span class="Italic">Rusin</span> jurisdictional analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted his administrative remedies before the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and makes nonfrivolous allegations that: (1) he made a protected disclosure, and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action<span class="Italic">. Rusin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298 &#x00B6; 12 (2002). Further, the threshold issue of IRA appeal jurisdiction is decided without holding a hearing because the determination of whether the appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction is made on the basis of the written submissions<span class="Italic">. See Spencer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 327 F.3d 1354, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, under <span class="Italic">Rusin</span>, the appellant established Board jurisdiction over his appeal based on his written submissions made prior to the hearing. He showed that he exhausted administrative proceedings before OSC by demonstrating that he filed a request for corrective action with OSC and, by letter dated June 28, 2002, OSC noted that it had terminated its inquiry into the appellant's allegations and advised him that, because he alleged that he was a victim of the prohibited personnel practice described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), he had the right to seek corrective action from the Board<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In addition, he made a nonfrivolous allegation that he engaged in protected activity, i.e., made a disclosure that he reasonably believed evidenced a "violation of law, rule or regulation" or an "abuse of authority," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A), when he asserted that he disclosed that the IRS's Pennsylvania District misapplied the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child/Dependent Care Tax Credit to the detriment of taxpayers<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Finally, with regard to jurisdiction, he made a nonfrivolous allegation that his disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's personnel actions, not selecting him for two positions, Economist and Attorney, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ii), (iv), when he alleged that some IRS officials involved in the selection processes had knowledge of his whistleblowing activity and both nonselections occurred while OSC was investigating his allegations<span class="Italic">. Id. See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). Thus, the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal<span class="Italic">. See Schmittling v. Department of the Army</span>, 219 F.3d 1332, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (in an IRA appeal, the Board must first address all elements of the matter of jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits of the appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rusin</span> made clear the elimination of the "jurisdictional hearing" as a regular component of an IRA case. <span class="Italic">Rusin</span> was not the first case to characterize the proper jurisdictional foundation of an IRA case. <span class="Italic">Lloyd v. EPA</span>, 71 MSPR 671, 678 (1996), determined that the appellant is entitled to a hearing on jurisdiction when he makes nonfrivolous allegations showing compliance with the three jurisdictional elements. If jurisdiction is established, the AJ then adjudicates the appeal on the merits and determines if the appellant has shown, by preponderant evidence, whether protected disclosures were a contributing factor in any alleged personnel action and whether the agency has shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action without the protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Pashun v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 74 MSPR 374, 378 (1997) (pre-<span class="Italic">Rusin</span>: an IRA jurisdictional hearing depends on allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish the elements essential to IRA jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Pulcini v. SSA</span>, 83 MSPR 685, 690 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (same as <span class="Italic">Pashun</span>). <span class="Italic">Juffer v. USIA</span>, 80 MSPR 81, 86-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15 (1998), added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant, however, is not required to prove jurisdiction to entitle her to a hearing; she need only make a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal<span class="Italic">. Bump v. Department of the Interior</span>, 64 MSPR 326, 332 (1994). A nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction is an allegation which, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 789 F.2d 892, 893-94 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, the appellant contends that the administrative judge erred in denying her a hearing on her claim that the agency perceived her as a whistleblower. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first note that we agree with the appellant that the administrative judge improperly weighed evidence and resolved disputed facts in determining whether the appellant had made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction. The administrative judge weighed the credibility of the appellant's supervisor's statements that he did not perceive the appellant as a whistleblower, and accepted his statements as persuasive. The administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary evidence, but may not weigh evidence to resolve conflicting assertions. It was error to do so here. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994).</p>
