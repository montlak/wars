<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-293"><span class="space">1.</span> National Guard; Air Reserve Technicians</h4>
<p class="noindent">To understand the litigation involving uniform requirements of National Guard technicians, it helps to understand the nature of their employment. <span class="Italic">ACT v. FLRA</span>, 230 F.3d 377, 378 (D.C. Cir. 2000), provides a succinct explanation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"The National Guard has the dual mission of serving both the state in which the Guard unit is located and the federal government. The Guard stands ready to preserve peace and order at the command of state authorities; and to provide combat-ready units and to control domestic violence at the President's discretion<span class="Italic">. See Perpich v. Department of Defense</span>, 496 U.S. 334, 110 S. Ct. 2418, 110 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1990). Because the National Guard is not a full-time active force, it employs civilian 'technicians' to perform administrative, clerical, and technical tasks. These individuals are generally required to be members of the National Guard unit in which they are employed (32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(b)), and must wear their military uniforms while they are working<span class="Italic">. See</span> National Guard Bureau Technician Personnel Reg. No. 300, p 7-6 (1987); <span class="Italic">New York Council, Ass'n of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA</span>, 757 F.2d 502, 505-06 (2d. Cir. 1985). As federal 'employees' (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a); 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(d)), the Guard's civilian technicians are entitled to engage in collective bargaining regarding certain subjects. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102, 7103(a)(2) &#x0026; (a)(3); <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 2953 v. FLRA</span>, 730 F.2d 1534 (D.C. Cir. 1984)." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Defense v. FLRA</span>, 982 F.2d 577, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When called to active duty, as they are with some frequency, these "dual-status" technicians lose their civilian status and become members of the armed forces. For obvious reasons, Congress made it illegal for them or their union to bargain over the terms and conditions of military service. 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976(c)....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1953 and Barksdale AFB,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-59.html">72 FLRA 306</a>, 306-07 (2021), on exceptions form an arbitration award, provided, albeit indirectly, the statutory underpinnings of some of the litigation over uniform requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Agency issued an order requiring the technicians at Barksdale Air Force Base to wear their military uniforms while working in civilian status. After more than a decade of bargaining appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the order, the Agency notified the Union that it intended to implement the uniform requirement. On March 28, 2019, the Agency notified the technicians that it would implement the order on April 18, 2019. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">Shortly thereafter, the Union filed a grievance, and the parties advanced the grievance to arbitration. In relevant part, the Arbitrator framed the issue as: "Did the [A]gency violate 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 771 when it implemented its order on March 28, 2019, requiring Air Reserve Technicians to wear Air Force Military uniforms while performing their job duties in civilian status?"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 771 provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Except as otherwise provided by law, no person except a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, as the case may be, may wear--(1) the uniform, or a distinctive part of the uniform, of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps; or (2) a uniform any part of which is similar to a distinctive part of the uniform of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argued that the Agency violated &#x00A7; 771 by ordering technicians in civilian status to wear military uniforms. The Arbitrator interpreted &#x00A7; 771 in conjunction with 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 772, which he found "expressly provides exceptions to [&#x00A7;] 771." The Arbitrator noted that one of those exceptions was "for members of 'any other organization designated by the Secretary of a military department.'" He found that under &#x00A7; 772, the order requiring dual-status technicians "to wear uniforms while on civil service status. . .was solely within the sound discretion of the [Agency]." Therefore, he concluded that the Union's "assertion that the [A]gency violated [&#x00A7;] 771 of Title 10 is without merit."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the award conflicts with 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 771 and 772 because the Arbitrator found that "civilian supervisors can force civilian employees to wear a military uniform." The Union's exceptions, <span id="page_830"></span>however, merely recite the text of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 771 and 772, and do not explain how the award conflicts with those statutory provisions. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">Instead, to support its argument, the Union--citing two Authority decisions--asserts that other arbitrators "have sided with the union on the wearing of a military uniform by [Air Reserve Technician] personnel."[12] However, the precedent cited by the Union does not support its assertion.[13] And the Authority has specifically concluded that an arbitrator's determination that &#x00A7; 772 precludes the Agency from requiring technicians to wear military uniforms while performing civilian duties is contrary to the plain wording of that provision.[14] </p>

<p class="noindent">There have been decades of litigation over the issue of whether uniform requirements are negotiable for National Guard technicians.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAIL Local 7 and Dept. of Air Force, Seymour Johnson AFB,</span> 64 FLRA 1194, 1196-98 (2010) (rev'd <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 648 F.3d 841 (D.C. Cir. 2011), as to uniform allowances, <span class="Italic">post</span>), traversed the uniform analysis for Air Reserve Technicians, declaring nonnegotiable Proposals 1a, 1b and 5, defining who would wear a uniform, if the uniform would be worn while employees were performing civilian duties, and describing the items of clothing that would constitute the uniform; Proposal 6, calling on the employer to provide cleaning services for the uniform, was negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposals 1a, 1b, and 5 concern the methods and means of performing work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are two prongs to the Authority's test used to determine whether a proposal concerns the methods or means of performing work. First, the proposal must concern a "method" or "means" as defined by the Authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gen. Servs. Admin.</span>, 54 FLRA 1582, 1589 (1998). In this regard, the Authority construes the term "method" to refer to "the way in which an agency performs its work" and the term "means" to refer to "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1589-90 (citations and footnote omitted). Second, it must be shown that: (1) there is a direct and integral relationship between the particular methods or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission; and (2) the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1590 (citing <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Ariz. Army Chapter 61</span>, 48 FLRA 412, 420 (1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that the requirement that civilian military technicians wear a prescribed military uniform constitutes management's determination of the methods and means of performing work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1501</span>, 64 FLRA 802, 803 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Local 1501</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1869</span>, 63 FLRA 598, 599 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Local 1869</span>); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1655</span>, 35 FLRA 740, 743 (1990); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3006</span>, 32 FLRA 539, 541 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Local 3006</span>); <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, 26 FLRA at 686. Moreover, where, as here, an agency imposes this requirement in order "to foster military discipline, promote uniformity, encourage <span class="Italic">esprit de corps</span>, increase the readiness of the military forces for early deployment and enhance identification of the [agency] as a military organization[,]" the Authority has held that "the type of uniform, i.e., a military uniform, is critical to achieving the purpose for which the [a]gency has adopted the uniform requirement." <span class="Italic">NAGE, SEIU, AFL-CIO</span>, 23 FLRA 730, 732 (1986) (<span class="Italic">NAGE</span>). <span class="Italic">See also Local 1501</span>, 64 FLRA at 804; <span class="Italic">Div. of Military &#x0026; Naval Affairs, State of N.Y., Albany, N.Y.</span>, 15 FLRA 288, 292-94 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. N.Y. Council, Ass'n of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA</span>, 757 F.2d 502 (2d Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">Albany</span>) (citing judicial determinations of the "interrelationship between the duties performed by technicians and the ability of the National Guard to maintain its combat readiness" and testimony that "'technicians function in a more military fashion if they wear the military uniform'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Bruton v. Schnipke</span>, 370 F. Supp. 1157, 1163 (E.D. Mich. 1974))). Thus, where a proposal would modify ARTs' military uniform requirement to impose a "civilian uniform" in order to "alleviate...rank issues[,]" the Authority has found that the proposal affected management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work. <span class="Italic">Local 1869</span>, 63 FLRA at 598-99. In addition, the Authority has held that "[n]onmilitary...modifications of the required uniform are incompatible with the purpose of maintaining the military identity of civilian technicians which is necessary to the accomplishment of their mission." <span class="Italic">Local 3006</span>, 32 FLRA at 543. <span class="Italic">See also Local 1501</span>, 64 FLRA at 804.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has not provided the Authority with a basis for distinguishing the foregoing precedent.&#x2003;Thus, we find that the Agency has established a direct and integral relationship between the accomplishment of its mission and its use of the military uniform. <span class="Italic">See Local 1501</span>, 64 FLRA at 804; <span class="Italic">Local 1869</span>, 63 FLRA at 599; <span class="Italic">NAGE</span>, 23 FLRA at 732. As Proposals 1a, 1b, and 5 would impose a civilian uniform requirement, we find that the Union's proposal affects the Agency's exercise of its right to determine the methods and means of performing work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposals 1a, 1b, and 5 are not appropriate arrangements within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, the Authority applies the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-</span>87, 21 FLRA 24 (1986). Under that analysis, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 31. If the Authority finds the proposal to be an arrangement, then the Authority will determine whether it is appropriate or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the Union's proposals constitute arrangements, for the following reasons, we find that they do not constitute appropriate arrangements because they excessively interfere with management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the benefits that the proposals would afford employees, the Union argues that the proposals would eliminate certain negative <span id="page_831"></span>effects that flow from the uniform requirement. In this connection, the Union argues that requiring ARTs to wear the military uniform while performing civilian duties "will adversely affect ART morale" because wearing the uniform "requires conformance to military customs, such as saluting, standing at attention and grooming standards." The Union also argues that substituting a civilian uniform for a military uniform would "alleviate the grade compatibility/inversion issue" of having ARTs in military uniform supervising ARTs who outrank them. However, the proposals would not change the fact that ARTs in civilian supervisory positions may supervise ARTs with a higher military rank. That they must do so <span class="Italic">while wearing a military uniform </span>appears to be a relatively minimal adverse effect, and the benefits provided by the proposal would be fairly minimal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In regard to Proposal 1a, which would require that both ARTs and civilian BUEs wear the civilian uniform, the Union additionally asserts that the proposal would "provide fairness and equity" by alleviating the "disparity" of requiring only ARTs to wear a uniform. Even assuming that there is an inequity in requiring ARTs to work in military uniform alongside civilian BUEs who are not in uniform, the Union has not demonstrated that it is anything other than a minor one.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the degree of intrusion on the exercise of management's rights, as discussed previously, the Agency requires ARTs to wear the military uniform "to foster military discipline, promote uniformity, encourage <span class="Italic">esprit de corps</span>, increase the readiness of the military forces for deployment, and enhance identification of the ARTs as a military organization because of the unique positions ARTs hold within the Air Force." In <span class="Italic">Local 1501</span>, the Air Force articulated an identical purpose for its military uniform requirement for ARTs, and the Authority held that a proposal that would "effectively convert[ ] the military uniform into a civilian uniform" excessively interfered with management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work and, thus, was not an appropriate arrangement. 64 FLRA at 805-06.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Local 1501 </span>and decisions involving the National Guard, the Authority found that proposals comparable to those at issue significantly intrude on management's right to use the military uniform as a "constant reminder" to dual-status technicians that their work is essentially military with implications for the combat readiness of their units. 64 FLRA at 805; <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, 26 FLRA at 686. <span class="Italic">See also Albany</span>, 15 FLRA at 294. In this connection, the Authority has stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[B]ecause the traditional means of instilling <span class="Italic">esprit de corps </span>and military discipline are not available for use with personnel who are employed in a civilian status, the wearing of the military uniform is indispens[a]ble as a constant reminder to technicians that they <span id="page_832"></span>are members of an organization which is essentially military[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">ACT</span>, 26 FLRA at 686 (citing <span class="Italic">Albany</span>, 15 FLRA at 294). The Union attempts to distinguish the National Guard decisions by stating that--unlike the ARTs--NGTs do not work among civilian BUEs, and NGTs must hold equivalent grades in civilian and military status whereas an ART in civilian status may supervise an ART with a higher military rank.[6] Although these distinctions may mean that the proposals' benefits would be greater for ARTs than for NGTs, they do not change the fact that only the military uniform can serve as a "constant reminder" to ARTs that they "are members of an inherently military organization[,]" [A]nd, thus, the proposal would seriously undermine the purposes for which the Agency determined that the uniform requirement was necessary. <span class="Italic">See ACT</span>, 26 FLRA at 686; <span class="Italic">Local 3006</span>, 32 FLRA at 543. Moreover, to the extent the Union identifies adverse effects unique to ARTs flowing from the exercise of management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work, as discussed above, they appear to be relatively minor adverse effects.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The Union attempts to further distinguish the Authority's National Guard decisions by noting that NGTs are hired pursuant to a different title of the U.S. Code and are required by law to wear the military uniform. Because Authority decisions on this issue do not rely upon these distinctions, we reject these arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Union argues that the uniform requirement would not decrease the readiness of the military forces for deployment because ARTs are "not subject to immediate call to active duty at a moments notice[,]" but often have several weeks--and never less than 72 hours--of notice prior to activation. However, the Authority has considered and rejected a similar argument where, as here, the ARTs train other reservists and "[m]aintaining combat-ready posture depends directly on [ARTs'] ability to perform this aspect of the job." <span class="Italic">See Local 1501</span>, 64 FLRA at 805-06. Thus, because the Agency requires ARTs to wear the military uniform as a "constant reminder they are members of an inherently military organization" so that they will conduct training while keeping in mind that their training duties "are vital to their units' military readiness[,]" "the uniform requirement's role in increasing the readiness of the military forces for deployment is not limited to the ability of an individual ART to quickly deploy in the proper uniform." <span class="Italic">Local 1501</span>, 64 FLRA at 805. <span class="Italic">See also Albany</span>, 15 FLRA at 292-93.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Balancing the parties' respective interests, we find that the intrusion of Proposals 1a, 1b, and 5 on management's right to determine methods and means outweighs the benefits that the proposals would afford employees. Accordingly, we find that Proposals 1a, 1b, and 5 excessively interfere with the right to determine methods and means and, thus, are not appropriate arrangements within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that Proposals 1a, 1b, and 5 are outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Seymour Johnson AFB and NAIL Local 7</span>, 70 FLRA 279 (2017) (concurring opinions of Acting Chairman Pizzella and Member DuBester) (setting aside arbitration award involving Air Reserve Technicians who are members of the Air Force Reserve: 10 USC 772(j)(2) vests in military designation of organizations that will wear uniform while performing civilian duties); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 997 and Dept. of Air Force, Maxwell AFB</span>, 66 FLRA 499, 501 (2012) (declining to reconsider <span class="Italic">NAIL Local 7 and Dept. of Air Force, Seymour Johnson AFB,</span> 64 FLRA 1194 (2010), and determining nonnegotiable both Proposal 1: "The Authority has specifically held that proposals intended to prohibit discipline for infractions regarding wearing the military uniform affect management's right to discipline under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, 38 FLRA 1005, 1014 (1990), <span class="Italic">remanded as to other matters</span>, <span class="Italic">DOD v.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1869 and Charleston AFB</span>, 63 FLRA 598, 599 (2009), restated and reconfirmed preexisting law as to uniforms of Air Reserve Technicians:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously held that "the requirement that civilian technicians wear the military uniform is a method and means of performing work within the meaning of [&#x00A7;] 7106(b)(1) of the Statute." <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Wis. Chapter,</span> 26 FLRA 682, 686-87 (1987) (citation omitted) (<span class="Italic">ACT Wisconsin</span>); <span class="Italic">see also Ass'n of Civilian Technicians,</span> 38 FLRA 1005, 1012 (1990) (<span class="Italic">ACT</span>). It is well established that proposals or provisions that restrict an agency's authority to determine the methods and means of performing work affect the exercise of this management right. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., ACT,</span> 38 FLRA at 1012-13 (proposal that would allow employees to deviate from specified components of the military uniform prescribed by the agency found to directly interfere with the agency's right to determine the methods and means of performing work); <span class="Italic">ACT, Wisconsin,</span> 26 FLRA at 686-87 (in view of the relationship between the military nature of the uniform and the purpose for which the uniform requirement was adopted, proposal allowing employees to elect to wear a nonmilitary uniform would negate agency's right to determine the methods and means of performing work).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the proposal would allow employees to deviate from the Agency's prescribed military uniform for the ARTs, and, as such, affects the Agency's right to determine the methods and means of performing work. <span class="Italic">See ACT,</span> 38 FLRA at 1012-13; <span class="Italic">ACT Wisconsin,</span> 26 FLRA at 686-87. The Union does not assert that the proposal is encompassed by any of the exceptions to management rights set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. That is, the Union does not argue either that the proposal is an appropriate arrangement or a procedure. Accordingly, as the Agency has not elected to bargain over the proposal, we find that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain. The history of negotiations over uniform requirements is extensive. As to the impact of military regulations requiring the use of military attire, in a ULP case FLRA construed 7103(a)(14) as meaning that only those matters specifically provided for by other federal statutes are excepted from the obligation to negotiate. As to matters of regulation, an exception to a bargaining obligation depends upon a demonstration of compelling need. Reviewing the military attire issue under the criteria for a compelling need determination, FLRA initially found nothing to demonstrate that the use of the uniform was essential as opposed to helpful or desirable. <span class="Italic">State of Nevada Nat'l Guard and NAGE Local R12-130</span>, 7 FLRA 245, 262-63 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2986 v. FLRA</span>, 775 F.2d 1022, 1026-27 (9th Cir. 1985), holding, although affirming the result reached by the Authority:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Unions contend that the Authority, when applying the "methods and means" test in the cases here under review, inexplicably and erroneously departed from the more stringent "compelling need" standard employed by the [Federal Labor Relations] Council. We agree.... In the context of section 7106(b)(1), the Authority determined that "means" refers to "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by the agency for the accomplishing or furthering of the performance of its work."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "means" standard employed by the Authority did not require the Guard to demonstrate a compelling need for military dress before the uniform requirement would be subject to bargaining only at the Guard's election. "A direct and integral relationship between the uniform wearing requirement and the duties technicians perform in furtherance of the overall military mission of the National Guard," was sufficient to make the <span id="page_833"></span>requirement a permissible subject of bargaining between the Unions and the Guard units. The fact that the Authority's standard was less stringent than that of its predecessor is best indicated by the opposite conclusions reached by the two agencies on essentially the same factual record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the Authority departed from the "methods and means" test established by the Council, the question then becomes whether that departure requires us to set aside the decisions as arbitrary and capricious. We conclude that it does not....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Congress did not intend for the Authority to be bound by the policies of the Council, but intended that it take a fresh and independent approach to federal labor relations.... Consequently, the Authority was free to depart from the "functional relationship" or "compelling need" test of its predecessor without giving any reasoned explanation for the change.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1501 and Dept. of Air Force, McChord AFB</span>, 64 FLRA 802 (2010), again concerning uniforms of Air Reserve Technicians, the proposal was:</p>

Moreover, where, as here, an agency imposes this requirement in order "to foster military discipline, promote uniformity, encourage esprit <span class="Italic">de corps</span>, increase the readiness of the military forces for early deployment and enhance identification of the [agency] as a military organization[,]" the Authority has held that "the type of uniform, <span class="Italic">i.e</span>., a military uniform, is critical to achieving the purpose for which the [a]gency has adopted the uniform requirement." <span class="Italic">NAGE, SEIU, AFL-CIO,</span> 23 FLRA 730, 732 (1986) (<span class="Italic">NAGE</span>).<span class="Italic"> See also Div. of Military &#x0026; Naval Affairs, State of N.Y, Albany</span>, <span class="Italic">N.Y</span>, 15 FLRA 288, 292-94 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff 'd sub nom. NY. Council, Ass 'n of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA,</span> 757 F.2d 502 (2d Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">Albany</span>) (citing judicial determinations of the "interrelationship between the duties performed by technicians and the ability of the National Guard to maintain its combat readiness" and testimony that "technicians function in a more military fashion if they wear the military uniform[ ]" (quoting <span class="Italic">Bruton v. Schnipke,</span> 370 F. Supp. 1157, 1163 (E.D. Mich. 1974))). In addition, the Authority has held that the composition of the prescribed military uniform is nonnegotiable, <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, 26 FLRA at 687, and that "[n]onmilitary additions to or modifications of the required uniform are incompatible with the purpose of maintaining the military identity of civilian technicians which is necessary to the accomplishment of their mission." <span class="Italic">AFGE,</span> 32 FLRA at 543. Where the Authority previously reviewed a proposal to modify ARTs' military uniform requirement to impose a "civilian uniform" in order to "alleviate...rank issues[,]" the Authority held that allowing ARTs to deviate from the prescribed military uniform would affect the Agency's right to determine the methods and means of performing work. <span class="Italic">Local 1869,</span> 63 FLRA at 598-99.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Union has not provided the Authority with a reason to reconsider the foregoing precedent, we find a direct and integral relationship between the Agency's accomplishment of its mission and its use of the military uniform to constantly remind ARTs about the military nature of their work and the importance of their units' combat readiness. <span class="Italic">See Local 1869,</span> 63 FLRA at 599; <span class="Italic">NAGE</span>, 23 FLRA at 732. The Union's proposal would essentially convert the military uniform to a civilian one by removing military rank insignia and replacing the uniform's "Air Force" tape or patch with tape or a patch reading "DoD Civilian. Because this transformation of the ART uniform directly interferes with the Agency's purpose for its <span class="Italic">military</span> uniform requirement, we find that the Union's proposal affects the Agency's exercise of its right to determine the methods and means of performing work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The proposal is not an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, the Authority applies the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87,</span> 21 FLRA 24 (1986). Under that analysis, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 31. If the Authority finds the proposal to be an arrangement, then the Authority will determine whether it is appropriate or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the Union's proposal constitutes an arrangement, we find, for the following reasons, that it does not constitute an appropriate arrangement because it excessively interferes with management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the benefits that the proposal would afford employees, the Union argues that the proposal would eliminate certain negative effects that flow from the uniform requirement. In this connection, the Union argues that requiring ARTs to wear rank insignia while in civilian status is "embarrassing" and causes "confusion[,]" "st[r]ess[,] and controversy" because the ARTs are not permitted to exercise rank authority while working as civilians, and typically outrank their supervisors. However, the proposal would not change the fact that ARTs routinely outrank their supervisors and are unable to exercise rank authority while in civilian status. The embarrassment or confusion caused by the fact that the ARTs must work at the direction of someone with a lower military ranking <span class="Italic">while wearing rank insignia</span> appears to be a relatively minimal adverse effect, and the benefits provided by the proposal would be fairly minimal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the degree of intrusion on the exercise of management's rights, as discussed previously, the Agency requires ARTs to wear the military uniform "to foster military discipline, promote uniformity, encourage <span class="Italic">esprit de corps</span>, increase the readiness of the military forces for deployment, and enhance identification of the ARTs as a military organization because of the unique positions ARTs hold within the Air Force." In cases where the National Guard has articulated an identical purpose for its military uniform requirement for dual-status technicians, the Authority has held that "the type of uniform, <span class="Italic">i.e</span>., a military uniform, is critical to achieving the purpose for which the [a]gency has adopted the uniform requirement." <span class="Italic">NAGE,</span> 23 FLRA at 732. <span class="Italic">See also Albany,</span> 15 FLRA at 290-94. Further, in National Guard decisions, the Authority has expressly held that proposals to modify the composition of the prescribed military uniform or allow dual-status technicians to elect to wear a nonmilitary uniform excessively interfere with management's right to determine the method and means of performing work and, thus, are not appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE,</span> 32 FLRA at 543; <span class="Italic">ACT,</span> 26 FLRA at 687; <span class="Italic">NAGE,</span> 23 FLRA at 732.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union attempts to distinguish these decisions by stating that--unlike the ARTs--National Guard dual-status technicians may exercise authority based on rank even while in civilian status.[2] In this regard, the Union argues that the proposal would not frustrate the articulated purposes of the Agency's uniform requirement because requiring ARTs to wear rank insignia, "which has absolutely no meaning" in civilian status, thwarts rather than fosters <span class="Italic">esprit de corps</span>. Similarly, the Union argues that the proposal's removal of both military insignia and "Air Force" tape from the ART uniform does not undermine discipline or uniformity because military rank is not recognized in a civilian status.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;The Union attempts to further distinguish our National Guard decisions by noting that the National Guard dual-status technicians have policing powers over non-military civilians. Because Authority decisions on this issue do not rely upon the National Guard's provision of emergency civil services, we reject this argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no indication that the Authority's numerous decisions finding the military uniform requirement for National Guard dual-status technicians nonnegotiable were in any way based on the fact that the affected technicians were authorized to exercise military rank even in civilian status. <span class="Italic">See AFGE,</span> 32 FLRA at 543; <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, 26 FLRA at 68687; <span class="Italic">NAGE</span>, 23 FLRA at 732. Instead, these decisions rely on the military uniform's role as a "constant reminder" to dual-status technicians that their work is essentially military with implications for the combat readiness of their units. <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, 26 FLRA at 686. <span class="Italic">See also Albany,</span> 15 FLRA at 294. In this connection, the Authority has stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[B]ecause the traditional means of instilling <span class="Italic">esprit de corps</span> and military discipline are not available for use with personnel who are employed in a civilian status, the wearing of the military uniform is indispens[a]ble as a constant reminder to technicians that they are members of an organization which is essentially military and subject to mobilization at a moment's notice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">ACT,</span> 26 FLRA at 686 (citing <span class="Italic">Albany,</span> 15 FLRA at 294). Here, the Agency has articulated an identical purpose for its uniform requirement, which depends on the <span class="Italic">military uniform</span> as such, regardless of the ARTs' inability to exercise authority based on rank while they are in civilian status. <span class="Italic">See NAGE,</span> 23 FLRA at 732. Moreover, the Union's proposal does more than remove indicators of rank; it effectively converts the military uniform into a civilian uniform by both removing military insignia and changing the "Air Force" tape on the uniform to expressly identify the wearer as a "Civilian." Because the military uniform can serve as a "constant reminder" to ARTs that they "are members of an inherently military organization which is subject to mobilization at a moment's notice[,]" the proposal would seriously undermine the purposes for which the Agency determined that the uniform requirement was necessary. <span class="Italic">See ACT,</span> 26 FLRA at 686; <span class="Italic">AFGE,</span> 32 FLRA at 543.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Union argues that the uniform requirement does not increase the readiness of the military forces for deployment because it takes a minimum of three days to complete the preparations necessary to deploy an ART, and each ART "has a complete set of military uniforms with rank insignia ready for wear in the event of a recall to active duty[.] However, the uniform requirement's role in increasing the readiness of the military forces for deployment is not limited to the ability of an individual ART to quickly deploy in the proper uniform. The Agency asserts that the "primary role of an ART is to train other reservists[,]" and that "[m]aintaining combat-ready posture depends directly on [ARTs'] ability to perform this aspect of the job. Thus, as discussed above, the Agency requires ARTs to wear the military uniform as a "constant reminder they are members of an inherently military organization" and "operate in an inherently military environment" so that they will conduct training while keeping in mind that their training duties "are vital to their units' military readiness." <span class="Italic">See also Albany,</span> 15 FLRA at 292-93.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Balancing the parties' respective interests, we find that the proposal's intrusion on management's right to determine methods and means outweighs the benefits that the proposal would afford employees. Accordingly, we find that the proposal excessively interferes with the right to determine methods and means and, thus, is not an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It is now well-settled that matters concerning conditions of employment are subject to collective bargaining when they are within the discretion of an agency and are not otherwise inconsistent with law or applicable rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Association and U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark</span> Office, 53 FLRA 625, 648 (1997) <span class="Italic">(PTO); National Treasury Employees Union and</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service</span>, 21 FLRA 6, 10-11 (1986), <span class="Italic">enforced</span>, 836 F.2d 1381 (D.C.

However, it is also well-settled that where a law or regulation indicates that an agency's discretion is intended to be exercised only by the agency--referred to by the Authority as "sole and exclusive" discretion--it would be contrary to law to require that discretion to be exercised through collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">PTO</span>, 53 FLRA at 648. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers</span>, <span class="Italic">Franklin Lodge No. 2135 and U.S. Department of the Treasury</span>, <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 50 FLRA 677, 681-82 (1995) (BEP), <span class="Italic">aff'd mem. sub nom.

In determining whether an agency's discretion is sole and exclusive, the Authority examines the plain wording and the legislative history of the statute being relied on. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., BEP</span>, 50 FLRA at 691; <span class="Italic">VA</span> <span class="Italic">Locals</span>, 49 FLRA at 933.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the plain wording of section 709(b)(3), a technician employed by the National Guard is required to wear the uniform appropriate for his or her grade and component while performing duties as a technician "[e]xcept as provided by the Secretary concerned."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history of section 709(b) of the Technician Act has previously been addressed by the Authority. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians, Montana Air</span> <span class="Italic">Chapter and Department of the Air Force, Montana Air National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard, Headquarters, 120th Fighter Interceptor Group (ADTAC)</span>, 20 FLRA 717 (1985) <span class="Italic">(Montana ACT)</span>, the Authority analyzed the legislative history of section 709(b) and, based thereon, concluded that the scope of the Secretaries' discretion to make exceptions to the requirements of military membership, set forth in section 709(b)(1), and military grade, set forth in section 709(b)(2), is "extremely limited<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 726.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In discussing the pertinent legislative history, the Authority observed that the Technician Act was originally introduced as Title II of H.R. 2 in the First Session of the 90th Congress in 1967. As concerns the provision that authorizes the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force to make exceptions to the requirements of section 709(b), the Authority noted that the intent of Congress was set forth in the House Report accompanying Title II of H.R. 2, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Clause (b) </span>converts to a statutory requirement what has long been practice and procedure--that of requiring the civilian male caretakers and clerks, now termed "technicians," to be members of the National Guard and to hold the military grade specified by the Secretary concerned for the corresponding technician position. The requirement for military membership to assure the presence, during mobilization, of a hard core of highly qualified technicians was strongly endorsed by the House Armed Services Committee in its consideration of H.R. 8186, 86th Congress, 1st Session....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It has also been the practice of the Secretary concerned to designate certain positions as "officer positions," others as "enlisted positions," which can be filled only by individuals who hold the appropriate grade in the National Guard. There is a high correlation between the duties of the technician in his military and civilian capacities. Thus, the division staff training assistant (civilian) is conventionally a lieutenant colonel, the division G-3, and the unit administrative supply technician (AST) is conventionally the unit first sergeant or supply sergeant. In the interest of efficiency and discipline, a military commander should not be a civilian subordinate of a member of his unit. Such inversions may be prevented by authorizing the Secretary concerned to establish the military grade required for employment in a particular technician position. Proposed 32 U.S.C. 709(b) of the bill would so provide. <span class="Italic">The right to make</span> <span class="Italic">exception to the foregoing military requirement</span> <span class="Italic">granted to the Secretary concerned in the said clause (b) of section 709 is primarily directed toward the female technician secretaries who would normally not be expected to fulfill military assignments in the National Guard</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 725 (emphasis added) (quoting H. Rep. No. 13, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 58-59 (1967)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When legislation that was to become the Technician Act was reintroduced in the Senate during the Second Session of the 90th Congress, the language of section 709(b) remained unchanged. In addition, both the House and the Senate Reports that accompanied the legislation indicated that, as in H.R. 2, it was the intent of Congress to circumscribe the authority of the Secretaries concerned to make exceptions to section 709(b). In this connection, the Senate Report specifically states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Unless the Secretaries make an exception, the bill provides that the technicians as a condition of civilian employment will be required to be members of the National Guard and hold a military grade required for that position. In addition, such civil service positions would be noncompetitive.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">About 95 percent of the technicians would hold</span> <span class="Italic">noncompetitive positions and would be required</span> <span class="Italic">to be members of the Guard as a part of their</span> <span class="Italic">civilian employment. About 5 percent, or 2,000</span>, <span class="Italic">would be in a competitive Federal status and</span> <span class="Italic">would constitute principally female employees</span>, <span class="Italic">clerk-typists, and security guards</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The noncompetitive status is necessary for the technicians in view of (a) [the] requirement for holding a concurrent military Guard status as a condition for employment and (b) the fact that civilian employment is terminated where the concurrent military status ceases to exist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 725-26 (emphasis added) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1446, 90th Cong. 2nd Sess. 6 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Authority concluded that the scope of the Secretaries' discretion to make exceptions to the requirements of military membership and military grade is "confined to certain specific types of positions, the mobilization of which would serve no military purpose<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 726. The Authority therefore found the Union's proposals--which concerned the filling of civilian technician positions without regard to the military compatibility requirement set forth in section 709(b)--inconsistent with law and, consequently, outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history of section 709(b)(3) is spare. It shows that this <span id="page_834"></span>provision was enacted into law in 1996 as a provision of the Department of Defense Authorization Bill. In addition, as the Agency correctly points out, the House Conference Report explains that section 333 of the Senate version of the bill <span class="Italic">"requir</span>[<span class="Italic">ed</span>] military technicians to wear military uniforms in their jobs." 1996 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Adm. News 366 (emphasis added). The Conference Report then states that the House bill contained no similar provision and that the House receded to the Senate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is a well-established rule of statutory construction that a statute should be read as a whole. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Division of Military and Naval Affairs, (New York</span> <span class="Italic">National Guard), Latham, New York</span>, 53 FLRA 111, 118 (1997); Sutherland, Stat. Const. &#x00A7; 46.05 (5th ed. 1992). Consistent with this general rule and, with regard to future transactions, "the provisions introduced by the amendatory act should be read together with the provisions of the original section that were reenacted or left unchanged, in the amendatory act, as if they had been originally enacted as one section. Effect is to be given to each part, and they are to be interpreted so that they do not conflict<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 22.34. In addition, Congress is presumed to be aware of existing administrative and judicial interpretations of a statute and, absent a clear manifestation of contrary intent, a newly-enacted or revised statute is presumed to be harmonious with existing law and its judicial construction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. First National Bank of Montevideo, Minnesota</span> 719 F.2d 270, 277 (8th Cir. 1983) (citing <span class="Italic">Cannon v. University</span> <span class="Italic">of Chicago</span>, 441 U.S. 677, 697-98 (1979)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's arguments in this case are premised on a construction of section 709(b) that would permit the scope of the Secretaries, discretion under section 709(b)(3) to be interpreted more broadly than the scope of their discretion under sections 709(b)(1) and 709(b)(2). The Union has not, however, offered any legislative history to support this construction of the statute. Moreover, our review of the legislative history of section 709(b)(3) reveals no evidence that Congress intended to change the scope of the Secretaries' discretion, as determined by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Montana ACT</span>, 20 FLRA 717, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Therefore, Congress is presumed to have adopted the Authority's interpretation of section 709(b) at the time of the 1996 amendment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's proposal in this case would permit the technicians of the Colorado Air National Guard to wear civilian attire while performing technician duties. Nevertheless, the proposal is not confined to the types of positions over which Congress intended to give the Secretaries discretion--competitive, non-military positions such as security guards and clerk-typists whose mobilization would serve no military purpose. Moreover, the Union does not dispute the Authority's prior interpretation of the scope of sections 709(b)(1) and 790(b)(2). Accordingly, we conclude that its proposal is inconsistent with law and, therefore, outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">By way of historical development, FLRA determined, on remand from the court in <span class="Italic">New York, Div. of Military and Naval Affairs v. FLRA</span>, 696 F.2d 202, 205 (2d Cir. 1982), that a proposal was nonnegotiable that the National Guard allow civilian technicians to wear civilian attire while on the job. FLRA declared that the uniform was essential to the accomplishment of the military readiness mission of the Guard and was a means of performing work within the meaning of 7106(b)(1). That argument, explained FLRA, was not addressed in <span class="Italic">State of Nevada NG and NAGE</span>, 7 FLRA 245 (1982), a case that originated under Exec. Order No. 11491. Negotiation over the proposal was optional with the agency. <span class="Italic">Div. of Military and Naval Affairs, New York and New York Council, ACT</span>, 15 FLRA 288, 294 (1984). The <span class="Italic">New York</span> case was affirmed on review in <span class="Italic">New York Council, ACT v. FLRA</span>, 757 F.2d 502, 509-11 (2d Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority's interpretation of the phrase "means" is not premised on an understanding of industrial complexities but instead relies on Webster. The all-important qualification put on its literal definition of means is that there be a "direct and integral" relationship between the means and the agency's mission. Because of this qualification, the Authority's interpretation does not conflict with the acknowledged view that &#x00A7; 7106 creates a narrow exception to the duty to bargain over the terms and conditions of employment....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Council had...made clear its view that there was no "functional relationship between the day-to-day work performed by technicians and the requirement to wear military dress."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...But...the FLRA has been expressly instructed by Congress to start afresh and avoid making the mistakes of its predecessor.... Hence, we cannot say that it was arbitrary and capricious for the FLRA to find that there is a direct and integral relationship between wearing a military uniform and working within a military framework, even though its administrative predecessor held a different view.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...It was not arbitrary for the Authority to consider it self-evident and unworthy of discussion that standard civilian attire would not "foster military discipline, promote uniformity, encourage <span class="Italic">esprit de corps</span>, increase the readiness of the military forces for early deployment and enhance identification of the National Guard as a military organization."</p>

So too, FLRA rejected the negotiability of proposals that impliedly require at least two possible uniforms, with a choice by employees between the two on a particular day. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1655 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Dept. of Military Affairs, Illinois Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 35 FLRA 740, 741, 743 (1990) (Proposals 1, 2, and 3); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Locals R12-1222, R12-222 and DOD, Washington NG, Tacoma</span>, 38 FLRA 295, 303-05 (1990) (nonnegotiable Proposal 3, sentences 1 and 2: "Employees shall have the option of wearing Class A, Class B, BDU or coverall, unless other appropriate arrangements are made between the Union and supervisor. Employees who opt to wear the coverall will not be required to wear a uniform beneath.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was a proposal to permit employees to wear either a military uniform or agreed-upon standard civilian attire. FLRA reaffirmed the primacy of the right of an agency to determine its internal security practices in <span class="Italic">Nat'l Guard Bureau, Alexandria and ACT Montana Chap. No. 29</span>, 45 FLRA 506, 517-19 (1992) (Member Talkin concurring), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded</span> <span class="Italic">ACT, Montana Air Chap. No. 29 v. FLRA</span>, 22 F.3d 1150, 1155-56 (D.C. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">post</span>. FLRA determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the right to determine policies that are part of a plan to secure or safeguard personnel and physical property.... Generally, the Authority will not examine the relative merits of various options that an agency may select to achieve internal security, because the Statute has vested management with the authority to make such choices.... More specifically, "the Authority will not inquire into the extent of the measures employed to achieve the objective as long as they reasonably relate to the purpose for which the particular plan or practice was adopted."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's rejection of the civilian uniform clause in the agreement is based on its determination that its internal security needs require the technicians to wear the military uniform so that it can readily identify its own employees and distinguish them from individuals who might be on the site improperly. The Respondent refers to its proximity to the civilian airport for the city of Great Falls and notes that anyone with a copy of the clause detailing the civilian uniform "could easily have deliberately outfitted himself for initial access to the facility."... Further, it argues that "anyone in similar clothes could have accidentally wandered onto the facility from the neighboring civilian facility."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent has established to our satisfaction that the wearing of a military uniform has a reasonable relation to its stated internal security needs of protecting the base and the aircraft, weapons systems and ancillary equipment on that facility. With over 200 bargaining unit members authorized to enter the facility, it cannot be assumed that security guards or other technicians would recognize all the authorized unit employees. Clearly, when wearing a military uniform, an employee is more easily identifiable and more quickly mobilized, while those not in that uniform are also more readily identified as being in the wrong place. Moreover, the General Counsel does not dispute the Agency's argument that nonemployees are more likely to obey directions from a technician in a military uniform. For these reasons, we conclude that the Agency's decision to require the military uniform is reasonably related to its internal security requirements of easy and quick identification of its personnel. In sum, under its current practice, the Activity is able to mobilize all of its employees when necessary and distinguish them from unauthorized individuals who may seek to enter the site, and can more easily control the activities of any nonemployees who are on the base....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having agreed that there is a nexus between the requirement that all <span id="page_835"></span>employees wear a uniform and the Agency's right to maintain its internal security, we will not determine whether there are other options that would achieve the same objective. <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Engineers</span>, 21 FLRA at 235. Accordingly, we will not examine the argument of the General Counsel that the Respondent's internal security needs would also be met by the civilian uniform option that is contained in Article 23 of the negotiated agreement. In our view, the General Counsel's position does not take into account the Authority's established policy that the extent of measures chosen to accomplish internal security goals will not be held up to scrutiny so long as management's selection of such measures is reasonably related to its internal security goals. In contrast to our concurring colleague, we see no reason to modify our precedent in light of our continued recognition that only management can fully understand and determine the measures that it must take to safeguard its personnel and property.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, in the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the provision permitting employees to wear standard civilian attire directly interferes with the management right to determine the means to achieve its internal security goals.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">ACT, Montana Air Chap. No. 29 v. FLRA</span>, 22 F.3d 1150, 1155-56 (D.C. Cir. 1994), the court decided that the agency head could not disapprove the clause concerning civilian attire because there was no finding that the provision violated law or an agency-wide rule. The case was remanded to FLRA to ascertain whether the provision was invalid. Otherwise, the court held, the activity could engage in permissive bargaining over the provisions and, having done so, the agency head was not free to set aside the contract clause. The D.C. Circuit's decision is discussed in <a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec4-1">Chapter 4</a> concerning agency head disapprovals of contract provisions.</p>
