<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-247"><span class="space">q.</span> Security Screening</h5>
<p class="noindent">Time spent in security screening will not likely be compensable under <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Busk</span>, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/indep-union-of-pension-emps-for-democracy-justice-v-fed-labor-relations-auth">135 S. Ct. 513</a>, 519 (2014), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, a decision that concluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold that an activity is integral and indispensable to the principal activities that an employee is employed to perform--and thus compensable under the FLSA--if it is an intrinsic element of those activities and one with which the employee cannot dispense if he is to perform his principal activities. Because the employees' time spent waiting to undergo and undergoing Integrity Staffing's security screenings does not meet these criteria, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. </p>
<p class="noindent">In one of the many decisions considering awards of overtime compensation to correctional facility personnel for required tasks at the initiation of their <span id="page_2160"></span>workshifts, <span class="Italic">DOJ, FCI Allenwood and AFGE Local 4047</span>, 65 FLRA 996, 999-1001 (2011) (Member DuBester dissenting), concluded that the time spent to pass through security screening was not compensable under the FLSA on the facts before FLRA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The initial award is contrary to the FLSA and the Act in part.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In passing the Act, Congress distinguished between "the principal activity or activities that an employee is hired to perform," which are compensable, and "activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities," which are not compensable. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a)(1) &#x0026; (2). <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1482</span>, 49 FLRA 644, 646-47 (1994); <span class="Italic">Gen. Servs. Admin</span>., 37 FLRA 481, 484 (1990). <span class="Italic">See also Reich v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth.</span>, 45 F.3d 646, 649 (2nd Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">N.Y.C. Transit). </span>Any activities that are integral and indispensable to an employee's principal activity or activities are themselves principal activities under the Act. <span class="Italic">Alvarez</span>, 546 U.S. at 33 (citing <span class="Italic">Steiner v. Mitchell</span>, 350 U.S. 247, 253 (1956)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether given activities are an integral and indispensable part of employees' principal activities, "what is important is that such work is necessary to the business and is performed by the employees, primarily for the benefit of the employer, in the ordinary course of that business." <span class="Italic">Dunlop v. City Electric Inc</span>., 527 F.2d 394, 401 (5th Cir. 1976) (<span class="Italic">Dunlop</span>). In addition, activities that take place between the first and last principal activities of the day, including those which would otherwise be excluded from compensation under the Act, are covered by the FLSA because they occur during the continuous workday. <span class="Italic">Alvarez</span>, 546 U.S<span class="Italic">. </span>at 29-30, 37, 40; <span class="Italic">see also </span>29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 790.6(a)-(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator awarded compensation for two separate periods: the pre-screening period and the post-screening period. We address these periods separately below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Pre-Screening Period </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that picking up a battery at the Control Center is integral and indispensable to the officers' principal activities. The Agency does not dispute this finding, which, as a matter of law, supports a conclusion that the picking up of the battery is a principal activity. <span class="Italic">See Alvarez</span>, 546 U.S. at 33. The Arbitrator also found, and the Agency does not dispute, that re-entry into the Sally Port is the last principal activity of the day. It is undisputed that the flipping of the accountability chit and travel between the Sally Port and duty posts occur after the pick-up of batteries at the Control Center and before re-entry into the Sally Port from the compound at the end of the day. As these activities occur between the first and last principal activities of the day, they are part of the continuous workday. <span class="Italic">Alvarez</span>, 546 U.S. at 29-30.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Terre Haute </span>is misplaced because the flipping of the accountability chit and the travel in that case, unlike here, occurred before the start of the continuous workday. Further, with regard to the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator compensated travel time to all officers, regardless of whether they engage in principal activities prior to traveling, the Arbitrator found that "all of the workers pick up a charged battery"--the first principal activity of the day. Therefore, the Arbitrator's factual finding, which the Agency does not challenge as a nonfact, supports his determination that all officers who travel between the Sally Port and their duty posts are entitled to compensation for the flipping of the accountability chit and travel time as part of the continuous workday. <span class="Italic">Alvarez</span>, 546 U.S. at 29-30, 37.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we deny the exceptions regarding the pre-screening period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Post-Screening Period </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the award is deficient because the time spent passing through the security screening is not compensable under the FLSA and the Act.&#x2003;Courts that have addressed this issue consistently have held that time spent participating in security screening is not compensable under the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See Bonilla</span>, 487 F.3d at 1345 (concluding that time spent going through airport security to report to work was not compensable under the FLSA); <span class="Italic">Gorman</span>, 488 F.3d at 592-93 (holding that while security procedures including "waiting in line and passing through a radiation detector, x-ray machine, and explosive material detector" were necessary "in the sense that they were required and serve the essential purpose of security," they were not "integral" to the nuclear power station's employees' principal activities and therefore noncompensable).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the security screening in the instant case is integral and indispensable to officers' principal activities because it is: (1) conducted at a location separate from where visitor screening is conducted; (2) necessary to officers' principal work "due to the dangerous nature of the correctional environment"; and (3) performed for the benefit of the Agency because officers must "maintain a high level of professionalism" and "be prepared to respond in the event of an emergency" when at the screening site. However, there is no basis in the above-cited precedent for finding that these factors have any bearing on whether the screening is "integral and indispensable" to officers' principal activities. Accordingly, we find that, consistent with <span class="Italic">Gorman </span>and <span class="Italic">Bonilla</span>, passing through the security screening is not compensable as a principal activity, and set aside that portion of the initial award.[9].</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;The dissent contends that: (1) the Arbitrator determined that officers are essentially on duty while passing through screening; and (2) it is undisputed that officers can be required to respond to emergencies while at the screening site. However, the Arbitrator found only that after officers pass through screening <span class="Italic">and </span>begin to collect equipment, "their focus shifts" from civilian to correctional officer. In addition, the dissent does not explain why it would be relevant to consider whether screening is conducted at separate locations for employees and visitors (as in the instant case) or at one location for everyone (as in <span class="Italic">Gorman</span>); in both cases, everyone is screened. Moreover, the fact that the employer in <span class="Italic">Bonilla </span>was required to conduct employee screening is immaterial because, as <span class="Italic">Gorman </span>demonstrates, even when an employer is not required to do conduct screening, the act of passing through screening before engaging in principal activities is not compensable. Finally, the dissent is based solely on attempts to distinguish precedent; the dissent cites no precedent actually supporting its position</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also compensated officers for time spent donning their duty belts and traveling to the Control Center after passing through the security screening because he found those activities to be part of the continuous workday.&#x2003;However, as we have set aside the Arbitrator's finding that the security screening is a principal activity, such time is compensable only if the donning of the duty belt is a principal activity sufficient to commence the continuous workday, or if officers engage in principal activities during their travel from the security screening area to the Control Center. <span class="Italic">See Terre Haute</span>, 58 FLRA at 330.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated previously, activities that are integral and indispensable to an employee's principal activity or activities are themselves principal activities under the Act. <span class="Italic">Alvarez, </span>546 U.S. 21. Also as stated previously, in determining whether given activities are an integral and indispensable part of employees' principal activities, "what is important is that such work is necessary to the business and is performed by the employees, primarily for the benefit of the employer, in the ordinary course of that business." <span class="Italic">Dunlop</span>, 527 F.2d at 401. Further, some courts have held that an employer-imposed requirement that donning occur at the employer's premises weighs heavily in favor of finding that the donning is a compensable activity. <span class="Italic">See Jordan</span>, 542 F. Supp.2d 790 at 806 (citing <span class="Italic">Ballaris</span>, 370 F.3d at 911). In addition, the donning of protective gear is generally compensable only if it is specialized or unique, rather than generic. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gorman</span>, 488 F.3d at 594; <span class="Italic">N.Y.C. Transit</span>, 45 F.3d at 649; <span class="Italic">Reich v. IBP, Inc., </span>38 F.3d 1123, 1126 (10th Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, the Arbitrator neither found that the donning of the duty belt is an integral and indispensable activity, nor assessed the factors relevant to determining whether that activity is integral and indispensable. The Arbitrator found that each officer <span class="Italic">has </span>a duty belt, and that because officers cannot wear these belts when passing though the security screening, they need to don their belts on the Agency's premises after passing through the security screening. However, the Arbitrator made no findings regarding whether officers are actually required by the employer to wear the duty belt. Thus, in contrast to the precedent cited by the Union, it is unclear whether the donning of the duty belt on the premises is an activity that is required by the employer. <span class="Italic">Cf. Jordan, </span>542 F. Supp.2d at 806 (finding that requirement that employees don required frocks on the employer's premises weighed heavily in favor of compensability); <span class="Italic">Ballaris</span>, 370 F.3d at 903, 911-12 (holding that donning of uniforms at employer's premises was compensable work where employees were required to wear the uniforms); <span class="Italic">IBP</span>, 339 F.3d at 898 n.2, 904 (finding that donning of required protective gear at employer's premises was a compensable activity).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Arbitrator did not address whether the duty belt, if required, must be donned immediately after passing through screening, such that travel from the screening area to the Control Center is compensable as part of the continuous workday. Moreover, if the duty belt is required, but can be donned at any point after passing through the screening, travel to the Control Center is compensable only if officers engage in principal activities during their travel. It is unclear from the record whether officers engage in such activities while traveling from the screening area to the Control Center. In addition, the Arbitrator did not address whether the duty belt is a type of protective gear (i.e., helmet, safety glasses, or steel-toed boots), and, if so, whether it is unique or generic. <span class="Italic">See Gorman</span>, 488 F.3d at 594.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an arbitrator has not made sufficient factual findings for the Authority to determine whether the award is contrary to law, and those findings cannot be derived from the record, the Authority will remand the award to the parties for further action<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2054</span>, 63 FLRA 169, 172 (2009); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., Maritime Admin</span>., 61 FLRA 816, 822 (2006); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710-11 (1998). Accordingly, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, <span id="page_2161"></span>absent settlement, to determine: (1) whether the donning of the duty belt is an activity that is integral and indispensable to officers' principal activities, including, among other things, whether the duty belt is a type of unique protective gear; (2) if so, whether officers are required to don the belt immediately after passing through screening; and (3) whether officers engage in principal activities during their travel from the security screening area to the Control Center.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once again to the mat, this time with a remand, the FLSA overtime coverage for time spent in security screening (and time spent on tasks following screening, including donning duty belts and traveling to the control center) was disputed in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Med. Ctr. and AFGE Local 817</span>, 68 FLRA 932, 936-38 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting in part), with FLRA's focus on <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. v.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the awards are contrary to the FLSA because undergoing security screening is not compensable as an integral and indispensable part of the grievants' principal activities. In its opposition, the Union argues that, in determining that undergoing security screening is integral and indispensable, the Arbitrator made a factual finding to which the Authority should defer. Although the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings when assessing whether the award is contrary to law, a determination that an activity is integral or indispensable to a principal activity is a legal conclusion, which the Authority reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In passing the FLSA, Congress distinguished between "the principal activity or activities that an employee is hired to perform," which are compensable, and "activities [that] are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities," which are not compensable.[48] However, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1) pertinently provides that, if a "preparatory or concluding activity is closely related to," and is "indispensable to the performance of," an employee's principal activities, and "the total amount of time spent in that activity is more than [ten] minutes per workday, the agency shall credit all of the time spent in that activity, including the [ten] minutes, as hours of work."[49] In determining whether an employee has engaged in a compensable preparatory or concluding activity, the Authority has assessed whether the activity is "an integral and indispensable part of" the employee's principal activities.[50]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator concluded that passing through security screening was an integral and indispensable part of the grievants' principal activities because (1) the Agency required the screening and (2) the screening benefitted the Agency by preventing contraband from reaching secure areas.[61] But, as discussed above, <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span> rejected similar reasoning.[62] Further, the Arbitrator did not conduct the inquiry that <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span> now requires. Specifically, the Arbitrator did not assess whether security screening in the particular circumstances of the grievants--correctional officers in a prison, whose principal responsibility is the security of the Agency's facility--is "an intrinsic element of" the principal activities that the grievants are employed to perform "and one with which the [grievants] cannot dispense if [they are] to perform [their] principal activities."[63] And the Arbitrator did not make sufficient factual findings for us to assess whether security screening in the circumstances of this case meets that standard. Where the Authority is unable to determine whether an arbitration award is consistent with applicable legal principles, the Authority remands the award for further findings.[64] As we are unable to determine whether the awards of overtime pay for security screening are contrary to law, we remand that issue to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for further findings.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">2. <span class="Italic">On remand, if necessary, the Arbitrator should also make further findings regarding donning duty belts and chains and traveling to the control center, and, for any grievants who do not pick up and return equipment from the control center, also make further findings regarding the activities that they perform between traveling to the control center and beginning to perform work at their assigned posts.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that, after passing through security screening, the grievants donned their duty belts and chains and then traveled to the control center. And the Arbitrator compensated them for these activities solely because he found that they were part of their "continuous workdays"--in other words, because they occurred after security screening, which the Arbitrator found to be the first compensable activity of the workday during the post-screening period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the continuous-workday doctrine, activities that take place between the first and last principal activities of the day--including those that otherwise would be non-compensable under the FLSA--are compensable because they occur during the continuous workday.[67] As discussed in Section IV.B.1. above, we are unable to determine whether the awards of compensation for security screening are contrary to law. As it is unclear whether security screening is compensable, it also is unclear whether that activity begins the compensable, continuous workday. If, on remand, the Arbitrator applies <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span> and finds that security screening is compensable, then donning duty belts and chains and traveling to the control center would be compensable as part of the continuous workday. But if the Arbitrator applies <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span> and finds that security screening is not compensable, then donning duty belts and chains and traveling to the control center are compensable only if they are either (1) principal activities[68] or (2) integral and indispensable to principal activities[69] and last over ten minutes per workday.[70]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">If it is necessary for the Arbitrator to address these issues on remand, we note the following. Principal activities are the activities that an employee is "employed to perform."[71] And, as with security screening, <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span> sets forth the applicable standard for determining whether activities are integral and indispensable. If the Arbitrator assesses whether donning duty belts and chains is an integral and indispensable activity, then he should also assess whether the Agency required the grievants to don their duty belts and chains <span class="Italic">immediately after</span> undergoing screening, such that doing so at that particular time was compensable and triggered the continuous workday. And with regard to traveling to the control center, it is well established that unless employees are required to engage in principal activities during their travel, their time spent traveling to and from the actual place of performance of their principal <span id="page_2162"></span>activities is non-compensable, even if it is on the employer's premises, and even if it occurs after the employee checks in.[72] If necessary, the Arbitrator should address this standard as well.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For the above reasons, we remand the awards of compensation for donning duty belts and chains and traveling to the control center to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for further findings. In so doing, we note that there is no dispute that, for most of the grievants, the activity that follows the travel to the control center--specifically, picking up equipment there--is a compensable activity. There also is no dispute that all of the activities that follow picking up equipment at the control center--up to, and including, returning equipment at the control center at the end of the day--also are compensable as part of those grievants' continuous workday; although, as discussed in Section IV.B.3. below, there is a dispute regarding whether flipping the accountability chit occurs before or after returning equipment at the end of the workday. Consequently, we find no basis for remanding the portions of the awards that provide most grievants compensation for picking up equipment, returning equipment, and all of the activities in between.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Arbitrator apparently found that some grievants pass through, but do not pick up or return equipment, at the control center. If necessary, on remand, then the Arbitrator should apply the above-stated legal principles to also assess the compensability of the activities that these grievants perform after traveling to the control center and before beginning work at their assigned posts.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's determination that time spent undergoing security screenings is contrary to law. When a party's exceptions involve an arbitration award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews the questions of law raised by the award and the party's exceptions <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.[18] In applying a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> standard of review, the Authority assesses whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law.[19] In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings unless the excepting party establishes that they are nonfacts.[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As we noted in <span class="Italic">FCI Bastrop I</span>, the Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span> that an activity is "integral and indispensable" to an employee's principal activities--and therefore compensable under the FLSA--"if it is an intrinsic element of those activities and one with which the employee cannot dispense if he is to perform his principal activities."[21] In so holding, the Court explained that this "test is tied to the productive work that the employee is employed to perform."[22] Applying this test to the warehouse workers at issue in that case, the Court concluded that the security screenings they underwent at the end of each workday were not an intrinsic element of their principal duties of "retrieving products from warehouse shelves or packaging them for shipment."[23] In this regard, the Court found that the employer "could have eliminated the screenings altogether without impairing the employees' ability to complete their work."[24]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues here that the Arbitrator, in "no more than a few sentences, and with no discussion of the application of <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span>," made a "conclusory statement without providing any analysis as to why going through the security screening is an 'intrinsic element' of being a correctional officer." Indeed, the Arbitrator appears to have entirely sidestepped the Authority's directive in <span class="Italic">FCI Bastrop I</span> to "make sufficient factual findings for us to assess whether security screening in the circumstances of this case meets [the] standard" set forth in <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's "findings and conclusions" in the remand award consist of little more than the statement, without any further explanation, that security screenings are "<span class="Italic">directly related</span> to the [grievants'] ability to perform their jobs." The Arbitrator also states that the security screenings are "an intrinsic element of" the grievants' principal duties. However, as the Authority explained in <span class="Italic">FCI Bastrop I</span>, this is a legal conclusion and not a factual one, and is therefore not entitled to deference. And although the Arbitrator spends ample time summarizing the positions of the parties, he does not specify which portions of the parties' positions he credits as factual findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Arbitrator provided no additional factual findings to which we can defer and which we utilize to conduct the required <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, we are presented with a legal conclusion ("directly related") that has no factual findings in support.[32]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[32]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr., Newport, R.I</span>., 55 FLRA 687, 693 (1999). <span class="Italic">Contra U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Fed. Prisons Camp, Bryan, Tex</span>., 67 FLRA 236, 237 (2014) (reviewing arbitrator's legal conclusions <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, Authority consistently denied exceptions when arbitrator has applied correct standard of law and made findings of fact that support disputed legal conclusion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that a vacuous legal conclusion, one that has no factual findings to support it, is an erroneous legal conclusion. Therefore, that portion of the award in which the Arbitrator pronounced the grievants' passage through security screening to be directly related to their principal activities and one with which the grievants could not dispense is contrary to law, namely the legal standard as given by <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding the award contrary to law, we do not remand this case for a second time to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator. Unlike previous cases where the Authority has remanded cases for a second time, the Arbitrator here provided <span class="Italic">no</span> further factual findings or analysis following the first remand upon which the Authority could rule. Instead, the Arbitrator's "findings" were simply a recitation of the arguments made by the Union in its briefs on remand--which, for the reasons stated above, are insufficient to support the Arbitrator's legal conclusion. A further remand would give the Union--the party with the burden of proof to demonstrate that these screenings are compensable--a second opportunity to prove its case to the Arbitrator when it failed to do so on remand the first time. For these reasons, we find that a second remand would be inappropriate in this case.</p>
