<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-82"><span class="space">a.</span> Nonfrivolous Allegations Based on the Written Record; Required Specificity</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Rusin</span>, the IRA appeal goes to a hearing on the merits if there are nonfrivolous jurisdictional allegations. According to <span class="Italic">Applewhite v. EEOC</span>, 94 MSPR 300, 305 &#x00B6; 9 (2003), whether allegations are nonfrivolous is determined by the written record. There are many components of the well-pleaded IRA case: a disclosure under one of the covered statutory criteria; the reasonableness of the disclosure, a condition that is dependent upon many subfactors; knowledge of the disclosure by an agency official, or constructive knowledge of the disclosure; a personnel action, or the threat of a personnel action; a causal relationship between the disclosure and the personnel action; disclosure through a specific complaint to OSC; and timely resort to the MSPB. "The threshold issue of IRA appeal jurisdiction is decided without holding a hearing because the determination of whether the appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations or jurisdiction is made on the basis of the written submissions." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 96 MSPR 487, 490 &#x00B6; 6 (2004) (relying on <span class="Italic">Iyer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 95 MSPR 239, 241 &#x00B6; 4 (2003)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Mogyorossy v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 96 MSPR 652, 658 &#x00B6; 6 (2004) ("The threshold issue of whether an appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations of IRA appeal jurisdiction is determined on the basis of written submissions without holding a hearing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At least until <span class="Italic">Hessami</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, it was (and may remain) unclear from the case law exactly how the Board is supposed to assess these factors through means short of a hearing and discovery when the facts are disputed or the circumstances are ambiguous. If IRA cases are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction based on allegations as well as affidavits and documentation, the Board is engaging in summary judgment, as opposed to a test of basic allegations challenged through a motion to dismiss an IRA appeal. Since the Board states that it does not engage in summary judgment practice (based on the rationale that appellants are entitled to hearings), the Board needs to modify its law on summary judgment or ensure that jurisdictional litigation before the Board has the same benefits as summary judgment under the Federal Rules, e.g., discovery and jurisdictional hearings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit offered but sparse explanations of how the Board is supposed to determine IRA jurisdiction on a written record without summary judgment. Under <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <span class="blue">327 F.3d 1354</span>, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003), in an IRA case "whether allegations are non-frivolous is determined on the basis of the written record." <span class="Italic">Spencer</span> referenced the whistleblower case of <span class="Italic">Dick v. VA</span>, <span class="blue">290 F.3d 1356</span>, 1362, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (partially overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, <span class="blue">437 F.3d 1322</span> (Fed. Cir. 2006)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There simply is no right to a hearing on the threshold issue of jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[N]on-frivolous jurisdictional allegation supported by affidavits or other evidence confer Board jurisdiction. The truth of such allegations is tested in a hearing in which appellant must prove the allegations by preponderant evidence. These hearings are not "jurisdictional" hearings--they are hearings on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dick</span> was relied on in a non-IRA case, <span class="Italic">Marcino v. USPS</span>, 344 F.3d 1199, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 2003), involving a claimed involuntary demotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These statements by the petitioner did not constitute non-frivolous allegations to support jurisdiction for two reasons. First, the petitioner did not support the allegations with affidavits or others evidence. In <span class="Italic">Dick</span> we held that "[t]he Board has jurisdiction over an appeal if the government employee makes non-frivolous allegations of jurisdiction supported by affidavits or other evidence." 290 F.3d at 1361 (emphasis added). Similarly, we concluded in <span class="Italic">Dorrall v. Department of Army</span>, 301 F.3d 1375 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Downing v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 89 Fed. Appx. 231 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), an IRA case, reiterated the distinction between pleading jurisdiction and proving reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have held that "the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal if the employee makes <span class="Italic">non-frivolous allegations</span> that the elements of his claim are satisfied." <span class="Italic">Spencer v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In Downing's appeal, the Board articulated its jurisdictional standard as follows: "The appellant has the burden of proving by preponderance of the evidence that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal. An appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing if he makes a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal." <span class="Italic">Downing</span> <span class="Italic">v. Dep't of Labor,</span> No. NY-1221-01-0328-W-1, slip op. at 2 2002 WL 31740577 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 11, 2002) (citations omitted). It again articulated the improper standard: "To establish Board jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, an appellant must show, by <span class="Italic">preponderant evidence</span>..." the factors of an IRA appeal<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 3 (emphasis added). The Board concluded by stating: "Here, the appellant has not alleged any facts, which if true, would show that his alleged disclosures met the aforementioned standards." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 7. Although the concluding language may indicate the Board applied the proper non-frivolous allegation standard, we are left with no clear indication of what "aforementioned standards" the Board actually applied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Department of the Navy,</span> 327 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2003), we thoroughly explained the difference between the standards to be applied by the Board in determining jurisdiction and in determining the merits of a claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he Board has jurisdiction over an appeal if the employee makes non-frivolous allegations that the elements of his claim are satisfied. Whether allegations are non-frivolous is determined on the basis of the written record. Only after Board jurisdiction is established is the Board required to provide an employee with a hearing under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1), and that hearing is a hearing on the merits, not a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is axiomatic that at that hearing the appellant must establish the elements of his claim by a preponderance of the evidence. Failure to do so is a failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted; it is not, repeat not, a matter of lack of subject matter jurisdiction to decide the merits. The consequence of such a failure is a judgment on the merits, not a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1356-57 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the Board erred by not clearly articulating the standard it applied in evaluating whether Downing had established jurisdiction of the Board over his case. At oral argument, the Department of Justice acknowledged the ambiguity in the Board's decision and its awareness of the expectation stated in <span class="Italic">Spencer</span> that "the Department of Justice[] in future cases will faithfully adhere to our precedent [to] avoid any further question about fair procedure." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1357. We are disappointed that, despite the recognized ambiguity, the Department of Justice chose to contest this appeal rather than to voluntarily agree to remand the case for clarification.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, the Board explained why the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of gross mismanagement and why the appellant was properly denied a hearing for lack of adequate jurisdictional allegations. <span class="Italic">Downing v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 98 MSPR 64 (2004).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilkins v. DOD</span>, 118 Fed. Appx. 509, 512 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), distinguished speculative from factually-based assertions that a management official charged with reprisal had knowledge of the appellant's disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, there is no evidence that Mr. Ellinger, the supervisor who terminated Mr. Wilkins, was aware of Mr. Wilkins' disclosures. Mr. Wilkins suggests that Mr. Ellinger may have learned of his disclosures because Mr. Jones spoke with Mr. Murphy about "problems" with Mr. Wilkins, and as a result, Mr. Murphy met with Mr. Ellinger and "had [Mr. Ellinger] sign the termination action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Wilkins' argument fails both because it is based on unsubstantiated speculation and because it differs from the argument he made before the Board. "Non-frivolous allegations cannot be supported by unsubstantiated speculation in a pleading submitted by petitioner." <span class="Italic">Marcino v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 344 F.3d 1199, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 2003), quoting <span class="Italic">Dorrall v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 301 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Rather, a petitioner must support his allegations with "affidavits or other evidence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Dick v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 290 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("whether allegations are 'non-frivolous' is determined by the written record."). Mr. Wilkins fails to provide any evidentiary support for his assertion that Mr. Jones met with Mr. Murphy and discussed problems that included Mr. Wilkins' disclosures. He merely speculates that the two met and discussed the disclosures. Likewise, Mr. Wilkins fails to provide any evidentiary support for his assertion that Mr. Murphy conveyed information regarding the disclosures to Mr. Ellinger.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. MSPB</span>, 382 Fed. Appx. 942, 946 (Fed.

VA</span>, 112 MSPR 280, 282-83 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11, 2009 MSPB 182 (2009), followed a path different than <span class="Italic">Wilkins</span> and allowed an allegation of knowledge by a supervisor alleged to have been involved in the decision to reassign the appellant to carry the case to a hearing despite the affidavits supplied by the agency that the supervisor was not involved in the reassignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether allegations are nonfrivolous is determined on the basis of the written record. <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Department of the Navy,</span> 327 F.3d 1354, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Crenshaw v. Broadcasting Board of Governors,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 475, &#x00B6; 8 (2007). In determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a hearing in an IRA appeal, the administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties, and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive. <span class="Italic">Simone,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 120, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the appellant exhausted his administrative remedies before OSC. <span class="Italic">[S]</span> <span class="Italic">ee Yunus,</span> 242 F.3d at 1371. Further, the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that he made a protected disclosure, alleging to his second-level supervisor that Umlauf and Walcott were abusing their discretion in the personnel process that resulted in the selection to fill the vacancy in the Veteran Service Center Manager position. The administrative judge properly relied on his finding in an earlier appeal filed by the appellant in which the administrative judge had found that the appellant's disclosure of his supervisors' alleged abuse of discretion constituted nonfrivolous allegation of a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Powers v. Department of the Navy,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 554, &#x00B6; 14 (2004). At issue here is whether the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that his whistleblowing activity was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to laterally reassign him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to satisfy the contributing factor criterion, an appellant need only raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the fact of, or content of, the protected disclosure was one factor that tended to affect the personnel action in any way. <span class="Italic">Santos v. Department of Energy,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 370, &#x00B6; 10 (2006). To this end, Congress established a knowledge/timing test that allows an appellant to demonstrate that a disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the whistleblowing disclosure and took the personnel action within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 1221(e)(1)(A), (B); <span class="Italic">Rubendall v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 12 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged that he disclosed Umlauf's alleged abuse of authority and also asserted that Umlauf played a role in his reassignment. The appellant alleged that Umlauf was aware of the appellant's protected disclosures. The appellant stated that, after he told his second-level supervisor of his belief that Umlauf was abusing his discretion in the personnel process, the appellant's second level supervisor discussed the appellant's complaint with Umlauf. Further, the appellant alleged that Umlauf, who continued to be a manager with the agency, "ordered the initiation of the [Administrative Investigative Board] in his letter directed to Phyllis Hilger dated June 30, 2008." We find that these allegations of fact, if proven, constitute nonfrivolous allegations that satisfy the "knowledge" prong of the knowledge/timing test. <span class="Italic">See Swanson v. General Services Administration,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 12 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge erred in considering the agency's submissions, specifically, the affidavits of Pfanzelter, Umlauf, and Walcott that the agency submitted into the record of this appeal in which Pfanzelter avers that he made the decision to reassign the appellant without <span id="Page_3805"></span>input from Umlauf and Walcott, and Umlauf and Walcott aver that they played no role in the decision to reassign the appellant, to find that Umlauf did not play a role in the appellant's reassignment. The agency's assertion through these affidavits that Umlauf played no role in the appellant's reassignment is merely a factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate nonfrivolous allegation of fact to satisfy his jurisdictional burden under the knowledge prong of the knowledge/timing test. As noted, the Board may not weigh such evidence in order to resolve the conflicting assertions of the parties regarding jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. at 329.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf. Taylor v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, DC-1221-17-0088-W-1 (NP 8/12/2022) ("Although the administrative judge is correct that the appellant failed to identify which management officials were aware of her protected activities, a letter submitted by the agency establishes that the responsible management officials became aware of appellant's OIG activity in the months preceding her delayed promotion. <span class="Italic">See Bruhn v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 10 (2016) (stating that, in determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a hearing, an administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Carney v. VA</span>, <span class="blue">121 MSPR 446</span>, 451-52 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12, 2014 MSPB 62 (2014), the appellant's allegations of facts strongly implying supervisors' knowledge of the appellant's protected activity were sufficient to warrant a hearing that could not be precluded by supervisors' sworn statements that they were unaware of the appellant's protected activity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An employee may establish, for jurisdictional purposes, that a protected activity was a contributing factor to covered personnel actions through circumstantial evidence, such as the acting official's knowledge of the protected activity and the timing of the personnel actions. <span class="Italic">Mason v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 135, &#x00B6; 26 (2011). Thus, an appellant's nonfrivolous allegation that the official taking the personnel action knew of the protected activity and that the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action is sufficient to meet the knowledge-timing test and to satisfy the appellant's burden to make a nonfrivolous allegation of a contributing factor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ormond v. Department of Justice</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 13 (2012), for example, the Board found that 6 months between a disclosure and a personnel action was sufficiently proximate to allow a reasonable person to conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Mudd</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 10, the Board found that personnel actions alleged to have begun within 1 year of the time that an employee engaged in a protected activity satisfied the timing prong of the knowledge-timing test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged that the supervisors who suspended him in March and August of 2013 had knowledge that he assisted a coworker in the grievance on March 6, 2013, because they were apprised of the appellant's everyday activities and were intensely scrutinizing him. The appellant also alleged that the supervisors who suspended him granted the appellant official time to engage in the representational activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite these allegations that the appellant's supervisors knew of his representational activity and suspended the appellant soon thereafter, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that his assistance to a coworker in the grievance process was a contributing factor to the two suspensions. In making this finding, the administrative judge relied on the sworn statements of the agency supervisors that, at the time of their involvement with the appellant's suspensions, they had no knowledge of the appellant's presence at the March 6, 2013 grievance meeting. The administrative judge's consideration of the agency's evidence at this stage of the proceedings was erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant meets his jurisdictional burden and is entitled to a hearing on the merits in an IRA appeal if he makes nonfrivolous allegations that his protected activity was a contributing factor to a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Aquino v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 35, &#x00B6; 9 (2014); <span class="Italic">Mason</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 135, &#x00B6; 7. A nonfrivolous allegation is an allegation of fact that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994); <span class="Italic">see Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 18 (2010). In determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a hearing, the administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties, and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive. <span class="Italic">Weed</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 19; <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 329.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, contrary to the administrative judge's conclusion, that the appellant's assertions that the supervisors who suspended him in March and August of 2013 were aware of his representational activity on March 6, 2013, constitute allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of Board jurisdiction. The agency's evidence regarding the knowledge of the agency supervisors constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's evidence and should not have been considered by the administrative judge. Thus, we conclude that the appellant met his jurisdictional burden and is entitled to a hearing on the merits of his claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kleckner v. VA</span>, 96 MSPR 331, 334 &#x00B6; 5 (2004) (to establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, the appellant is not required to prove that he made protected disclosures merely to make a nonfrivolous allegation that his disclosures were protected).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Arnett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 126 Fed. Appx. 474, 476 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), noted as to unspecific allegations of whistleblowing reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Arnett fails to establish that she made nonfrivolous allegations that she engaged in whistleblowing activities by making a protected disclosure and that any protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's actions. Instead, Arnett only provided vague and unspecific allegations of the Board's jurisdiction in response to the Board's two Orders to Show Cause requiring her to specify the "nature of [her] disclosures and the circumstances surrounding any personnel actions that [she] allege[s] an agency has taken, failed to take, or threatened to take in retaliation for [her] whistleblowing activities." Thus, we affirm the Board's dismissal of Arnett's IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that Arnett failed to satisfy her burden of presenting non-frivolous allegations that the elements of her claim are satisfied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, from <span class="Italic">Chambers v. DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 8, &#x00B6; 18 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding motive to retaliate, the record does not reflect that the appellant's disclosures or grievances were personally directed at the official who issued the written admonishment. The appellant asserts that he believes that the official who issued the written admonishment was disciplined as a result of his May 17, 2007 email. However, there is no indication in the record that this official was named in or included on the appellant's May 17, 2007 email, or that he was among those disciplined by the agency as a result of its investigation into the matter disclosed in the email. Such conclusory and unsubstantiated speculation is insufficient to amount to a nonfrivolous allegation of a retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sherman v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 644, &#x00B6; 9 n.5 (2015) (finding that the appellant's assertion that his first- and second-line supervisors were likely among the many people who knew of his disclosure amounted to conjecture unsupported by any record evidence and, thus, did not amount to a nonfrivolous allegation); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 479, &#x00B6; 8 (2005) (finding that an appellant's insinuation that an individual might have known of his prior whistleblowing activity amounted to unsubstantiated speculation, not a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(s) (defining a nonfrivolous allegation generally as an allegation that is more than conclusory)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;The appellant also does not allege that any other individual involved in the decision to issue him the written admonishment was aware of his alleged prior protected disclosures or activity or had a motive to retaliate against him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Buchanan v. VA</span>, DC-1221-21-0390-W-1 (NP 8/3/2022), noted of unspecific allegations concerning protected activity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant states only that she asked for the OIG's contact information from a Human Resources (HR) official and that, after she mailed her complaint to the provided contact (presumably, the DHHS OIG), she received a letter back stating they did not handle situations like hers. She expresses her belief that the HR official intentionally gave her the wrong contact information. The appellant has not provided any additional information regarding her OIG complaint or alleged that any official responsible for any of the purported personnel actions, or any other agency management official, was aware of the complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As such, the appellant has not produced any evidence by which she might be able make a connection between her protected activity and any of the challenged personnel actions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sherman v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 644, &#x00B6; 9 n.5 (2015) (finding that the appellant's assertion that his first- and second-line supervisors were likely among the many people who knew of his disclosure amounted to conjecture unsupported by any record evidence and, thus, did not amount to a nonfrivolous allegation); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 479, &#x00B6; 8 (2005) (finding that an appellant's insinuation that an individual might have known of his prior whistleblowing activity amounted to unsubstantiated speculation, not a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(s) (defining a nonfrivolous allegation generally as an allegation that is more than conclusory).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, even if the appellant established that she engaged in protected activity when she filed a complaint with the OIG for DHHS that was subsequently forwarded to her own agency's OIG, we nevertheless <span id="Page_3806"></span>conclude that she failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that it was a contributing factor in any of the challenged personnel actions based on either the knowledge/timing test or nonknowledge/timing evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 99 MSPR 479, 482-83 &#x00B6; 8 (2005) (insinuation that an agency official might have known about whistleblowing activity, amounting to unsubstantial speculation, is insufficient to establish the nonfrivolous threshold for establishing Board jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ analyzes the jurisdictional issue using language that connotes preponderant evidence, but the record establishes that jurisdiction would have failed under a nonfrivolous allegation standard, the Board dismisses the IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Berry v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 101 MSPR 385, 387 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4, 2006 MSPB 62 (2006). If during the AJ's consideration of jurisdiction the appellant's version of the facts changes, the modification is more appropriately considered in assessing the appellant's credibility than in determining whether the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Woodworth v. Dept. of Navy,</span> 105 MSPR 456, 466 n.2, 2007 MSPB 109 (2007) (IRA appeal).</p>
