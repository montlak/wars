<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-166"><span class="space">f.</span> Denial of Promotion</h5>
<p class="noindent">It is a ULP for a manager or supervisor to tell an employee that it would be a good idea to drop a contract grievance to avoid getting the reputation as a complainer and jeopardizing future career advancement. The statement is a direct threat that the career of any employee who processed grievances or complaints would suffer. Any interference with the right of an employee to file and process grievances under a negotiated agreement, by implied threats of adverse consequences, is inherently destructive of the right of each employee, assured by the Statute, to "form, join, or assist any labor organization...freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal," and violates 5 USC 7116(a)(1). It is immaterial whether the grievance is valid or whether it is within the coverage of the negotiated procedure. It is not essential to demonstrate that the statement had a chilling effect on other employees. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, BATF, Chicago and NTEU Chap. 94</span>, 3 FLRA 724, 731-33 (1980) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 47 FLRA 459, 459 (1993) (ALJ Decision) (ULP when supervisor made statement to employee that employee's career would be ruined if she provided written statement on behalf of another employee, a probationer, who was faced with proposed termination). A statement by a manager, after the union protested the possibility of preselection in the promotion process, that consideration for future vacancies would be nationwide rather than local, implying a decrease in the chances for promotion locally, was a threat of reprisal for protected activity. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Fayetteville and AFGE Local 2201</span>, 5 FLRA 581, 585-86 (1981) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">A nonselection case based on a union discrimination theory was reviewed on a union's exceptions to an arbitrator's award in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3506 and SSA ODAR Shreveport</span>, 65 FLRA 30, 32-33 (2010), applying <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator "failed to follow the burdens in regard to reprisal for Union activity." When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def., Dep'ts of the Army &#x0026; the Air Force, Ala. Nat'l Guard, Northport, Ala.</span>, 55 FLRA 37, 40 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues in its exception that the Agency committed a statutory unfair labor practice (ULP) when it allegedly based the grievant's non-selection on anti-union animus and that the Arbitrator erred by failing to so find. However, it is unclear from the issues proposed by the parties whether the Arbitrator was resolving statutory or contractual issues. While the issue proposed by the Agency concerned both contractual and statutory issues, the issue proposed by the Union raised only contractual issues. Nevertheless, the Authority has applied statutory standards in assessing the application of contract provisions that mirror, or are intended to be interpreted in the same manner as, the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1164, </span>64 FLRA 599, 600-01 (2010) (statutory principles applied in circumstance where exception was based on an alleged violation of the Statute and issue before the arbitrator was framed in contractual terms, which mirrored or were intended to be interpreted in the same manner as provision of the Statute); <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 61 FLRA 197, 199 (2005) (<span class="Italic">NLRB</span>) (same); <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 59 FLRA 767, 769-70 (2004) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>) (same). The issue proposed by the Union referenced certain contract articles, including Article 1, Section 1, which provides that the parties "shall be governed by existing or future laws...[,]" and Article 3, Section 1, which provides that "[e]ach employee shall have the right to join[&#8197;] or assist the Union...without fear or penalty of reprisal...." Therefore, assuming that the Arbitrator resolved statutory issues, we find, for the following reasons, that the Union has not established that the award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where statutory issues concerning Union discrimination are raised, the Authority reviews the award under the statutory principles applicable to &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NLRB</span>, 61 FLRA at 199; <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 59 FLRA at 769-70; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Complex, Coleman, Fla.</span>, 63 FLRA 351, 354 (2009). Section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute provides <span id="Page_1396"></span>that it is a ULP for an agency to encourage or discourage membership in a union by discrimination in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. When a grievance under &#x00A7; 7121 of the Statute involves an alleged ULP, the arbitrator must apply the same standards and burdens that would be applied by an administrative law judge in a ULP proceeding under &#x00A7; 7118. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529</span>, 57 FLRA 464, 465 (2001). In a grievance alleging a ULP by an agency, the union bears the burden of proving the elements of the alleged ULP by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>As in other arbitration cases, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's findings of fact. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, in cases alleging discrimination, the Authority applies the framework in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot</span>, 35 FLRA 113, 118 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>). <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2145</span>, 64 FLRA 661, 664 (2010) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2145</span>) (Member Beck dissenting, in part). Under that framework, the party making such an assertion establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case of discrimination by demonstrating that: (1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee. Once the <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>showing is made, an agency may seek to establish the affirmative defense that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for the action; and (2) the same action would have been taken even in the absence of the protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, although the Arbitrator did not expressly apply the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny </span>framework, the record is sufficient for the Authority to do so. The Arbitrator found that the grievant was a Union member; however, the Arbitrator rejected the Union's claim that the grievant's non-selection for the position was motivated by his Union membership. The Arbitrator found that the evidence was insufficient to conclude that the "grievant was not selected because of his Union membership."<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the record provides no basis for concluding that the Arbitrator's finding is deficient. In this regard, the record shows that the Arbitrator evaluated testimony and evidence offered by the Union and found that there was nothing in this evidence that showed the selection officials were biased towards the grievant in his non-selection. Although the Union asserts that it submitted "considerable unrebutted testimony and documentation that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that Union activity was a motivating factor in decision[&#8197;]making[,]" in the Shreveport office during the time of the disputed matter, the Union has not pointed to any evidence that demonstrates the grievant's non-selection was predicated on his Union membership.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Union has not pointed to any evidence that demonstrates the grievant's non-selection was predicated on his Union membership and because the record does not establish that the selecting officials were biased towards the grievant in his non-selection, the Union has not satisfied the second part of its <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case under the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny </span>framework. As a result, no <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case of discrimination based on protected activity has been established. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2145</span>, 64 FLRA at 664 (Member Beck dissenting on other grounds) (finding no <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case of discrimination where evidence did not show that agency's action in disciplining employee for being absent without leave was motivated by employee's protected activities).[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Even assuming the Union established a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case, the Arbitrator's factual findings show that the Agency established a legitimate justification for its actions consistent with <span class="Italic">Letterkenny. </span>Specifically, the Arbitrator found, among other things, that the disputed position includes some supervisory duties and the selectee had some experience in this regard while the grievant did not. Also, communication skills were important for the position and the selectee was rated as possessing good skills in this area. In sum, after evaluating the evidence, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had "met the burden" of demonstrating that there was legitimate business reasons for the selection of the selectee over the grievant. The Union has not established that the Arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence and his conclusions based thereon are improper. As the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings, the Union has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency committed a ULP by refusing to consider work as a union representative as qualifying experience for an employee who sought through merit promotion competition the position of management analyst, a job requiring substantial involvement in labor-management relations. FLRA directed that the promotion be rerun and that full consideration be given during the process to the employee's experience as a union representative, <span class="Italic">DHHS, Reg'l Personnel Office, Seattle and Saul</span>, 47 FLRA 1338, 1342-45 (1993), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 48 FLRA 245 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, we addressed the analytical framework for resolving alleged violations of section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute. We affirmed that, in such cases, the General Counsel bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion or other condition of employment....&#8197;Once the General Counsel makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, a respondent may seek to establish the affirmative defense that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for the action; and (2) the same action would have been taken in the absence of protected activity. The General Counsel also may seek to establish that such reasons are pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is undisputed that the Charging Party was engaged in protected union activity and that the Respondent was aware of that activity. It is also clear that protected union activity was a motivating factor in the Respondent's treatment of the Charging Party. In this regard, there is no argument or other basis on which to conclude that, in evaluating candidates for the disputed management analyst position, the Respondent refused to credit any relevant experience or category of relevant experience, other than Federal union activity. Stated simply, the Respondent's policy and its application to the Charging Party are based solely on protected union activity. It is clear, therefore, that the General Counsel has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Respondent violated the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent contends that it did not violate the Statute because its policy is motivated by lawful considerations.&#x2003;In particular, the Respondent maintains that it prohibits consideration of an employee's Federal union experience in determining qualifications for positions under the merit selection process to ensure agency compliance with section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute by preventing rating panels and selecting officials from judging the manner in which employees performed union duties. According to the Respondent, a policy permitting the crediting of the Charging Party's union experience would unfairly penalize employees who choose not to engage in protected activity under section 7102 of the Statute. We reject the Respondent's contentions for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Authority has rejected similar arguments made by respondents in other cases. For example, in <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, United States Customs Service, Region IV, Miami, Florida</span>, 19 FLRA 956 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>), the Authority adopted a judge's conclusion that the respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute by refusing to detail a union president for a special assignment solely because of his protected union activity. The Authority rejected the Respondent's contention that it was necessary to exclude the union president from the special assignment to preserve the Union president's "integrity as a Union negotiator." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 971. The Judge concluded, and the Authority agreed, that if the Respondent's argument "was carried to its logical extension [then] no bargaining unit employee would be able to engage in negotiations on behalf of a labor organization without risking the possibility of being eliminated for details[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">SSA, Inland Empire</span>, the Authority found that an agency violated section 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute by reducing gainsharing awards paid to two employees because they had engaged in union representational duties during work time. The Authority stated its agreement with the judge's conclusion that the "foreseeable effect" of the agency's action was to discourage employees from engaging in union representational duties<span class="Italic">. SSA, Inland Empire</span>, 46 FLRA at 176.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, as noted previously, the Respondent considers other pertinent nonwork activities of unit employees in determining qualifications for certain positions under the merit selection process. As such, with respect to consideration for these positions, we conclude that the policy clearly discriminates against and penalizes employees who engage in protected union activity. The Respondent asserts that crediting the Charging Party's union experience would penalize unit employees who exercise their right, under section 7102, to refrain from assisting the Union. It is not clear, in this regard, that a policy crediting all relevant nonwork activities, whether or not related to union representation, penalizes employees who choose not to assist the Union. Instead, a policy which makes no distinctions based on union activity appears to promote management neutrality with regard to its treatment of employees who do, and do not, choose such actions. On the other hand, in view of the Respondent's crediting of other relevant nonwork activities of employees, we conclude that the interference with the Charging Party's right to engage in protected activity which results from the Respondent's policy is direct and substantial.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the stipulated record does not establish that a rating panel evaluates how well an applicant has performed his or her job functions or nonwork activities, such as union representational duties, as contended by the Respondent. Therefore, we reject the Respondent's affirmative defense that its policy is necessary to ensure that rating panels do not improperly evaluate the manner in which employees perform union representational duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that, in the circumstances of this <span id="Page_1397"></span>case, the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute by refusing to credit the Charging Party's Federal union experience in the same manner as other applicant's outside activity experience in determining his qualifications for a position.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once it is established that consideration of union activity motivated nonselection for promotion, the respondent may seek to rebut that showing by establishing an affirmative defense that there was a legitimate justification for the action and the same action would have resulted without the protected activity. The General Counsel may then seek to demonstrate those reasons are pretextual. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Facilities Eng'g Command and NFFE Local 2096</span>, 45 FLRA 138, 158 (1992) (agency failed to explain the underlying basis for selection decisions adversely affecting union activist during a RIF); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Hq. XVIII Airborne Corps and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 43 FLRA 1414, 1416 (1992) (summarizing <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>: General Counsel must establish <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that discriminatory action was motivated by consideration of protected activity; respondent may rebut that showing by establishing affirmative defense that there was legitimate justification for action and same action would have been taken in absence of protected activity; General Counsel may then seek to establish that respondent's reasons are pretextual).</p>
<p class="noindent">Management did not succeed in avoiding a ULP finding after it failed to select a union steward for a work leader position when a foreman, who essentially recommended who would be selected, told the steward that he had not been selected because of his union activities. That the actual selecting official could have selected someone else, for reasons other than those offered by the foreman, was not sufficient to deflect the ULP, <span class="Italic">VA Golden Gate Nat'l Cemetery and LIUNA Local 1141</span>, 59 FLRA 956, 961 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we reject the Respondent's assertion that if the foremen had recommended the chief steward for promotion, then the Cemetery Director would have rejected that recommendation and chosen the selectee anyway for non-discriminatory reasons. There is no support for this assertion in the record. Nor does such an assertion rebut the Judge's finding that the asserted reasons for the chief steward's non-selection were pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, to the extent the Respondent argues that an agency's hiring decision is entitled to great deference, we find that this case is not a matter of deference. Rather, it is a matter of complying with the Statute's requirements to refrain from discriminating against an employee based on union activity. For the reasons previously expressed, applying the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework, we find that the Respondent has failed to rebut the GC's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and has failed to establish that there was a legitimate justification for not selecting the chief steward and that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of the chief steward's protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Management did not commit a ULP when it denied a temporary promotion to a union official who was on a fixed term of three years of 100% official time. The temporary promotions offered by management were to individuals in that official's job series, but the promotions were offered to individuals who were qualified to be supervisors of other employees hired on a temporary basis. Because the union official was assigned only to union duties, he would have been unavailable as a supervisor for the year that the temporary promotions were to be in effect. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr. and AFGE Local 987</span>, 52 FLRA 602, 605-06 (1996).</p>
