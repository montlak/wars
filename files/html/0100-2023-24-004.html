<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-5"><span class="space">a.</span> Denial of Request for Reopening</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCarthy v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/15-3072.Opinion.1-12-2016.1.PDF">809 F.3d 1365</a>, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2016), determined that judicial review may be sought from the Board's denial of an initial request to reopen an appeal based on an intervening change in law--in <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span>, the denial was in the form of a <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> letter from the Board's Clerk:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reviewability of Clerk letters from the Board is not an entirely new question to us. In <span class="Italic">Haines v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 44 F.3d 998, 1000 (Fed. Cir. 1995), we found that a <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> letter from the Clerk denying repetitive motions to reopen was not a "final order or final decision" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113, and thus not reviewable. We reasoned that "the letter was merely an administrative response by the Clerk to Haines's third informal letter request that the Board reopen her appeal and reconsider its final decision on its own motion. The Clerk had been delegated the authority to make such responses by the Board and was performing only a ministerial function in this regard." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we need not decide the reviewability of Clerk letters generally, we conclude that, at least in the circumstances of this case, where a Clerk letter denies a first motion to reopen, <span class="Italic">Haines</span> does not apply. As we previously noted, <span class="Italic">Haines</span> appears to have involved repetitive motions to reopen. <span class="Italic">In re McCarthy</span>, No. 15-118, slip op. at 2 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 29, 2015). Because of this, the situation only required an "administrative response" which could be dispensed by a "ministerial function." <span class="Italic">Haines</span>, 44 F.3d at 1000. By contrast, McCarthy's motion to reopen had not been previously considered by the Board as it involved an intervening change in law. In effect, then, the Clerk letter announcing the Board's denial of his motion announced a substantive decision which had a real impact on McCarthy's interests. The nature of this decision is akin to a "final order or final decision," not an "administrative response," and should be construed as such. This court's jurisdiction should not turn on the manner in which the Board chooses to announce its decision, and it would elevate form over substance to hold otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's arguments to the contrary are unavailing. While it is true that existing statutes and regulations do not specifically state that a Clerk letter is a "final order or final decision," <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B), 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.113, 1201.117(c), they also do not prohibit it from being so. Indeed, they are silent as to the form these documents may or may not take. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, characterizing a Clerk letter as a "final order or decision" does not conflict with existing law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we are not deprived of jurisdiction simply because the Board issued its denial of McCarthy's motion to reopen in letter form.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCarthy</span> went on to describe the basis for judicial review, that is, the existence of a final and reviewable decision, 809 F.3d at 1369-73:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court's review of decisions by the Board is limited. Under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9), we may only hear "an appeal from a final order or final decision of the" Board. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) (2012). A threshold question, then, is whether the Clerk's January 8 letter constitutes a "final order or final decision" that may be reviewed by us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1201.113 of 5 C.F.R., titled "Finality of decision," provides in relevant part:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">This case presents a second jurisdictional hurdle: even if the Clerk letter in this case qualifies as a "final order or decision," we may not hear this case if the Board's decision on McCarthy's motion to reopen a case is not itself reviewable. In past cases, we have acknowledged that is an open question. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Zamot v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 332 F.3d 1374, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (noting that whether we have the authority to review a Board decision regarding reopening is "an issue the court has left open"); <span class="Italic">Nelson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">"Congress rarely intends to prevent courts from enforcing its directives to federal agencies" and there exists a "strong presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action." <span class="Italic">Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC</span>, 135 S. Ct. 1645, 1651 (2015). Nevertheless, before review may be had, "a party must first <span id="Page_5161"></span>clear the hurdle of &#x00A7; 701(a)." <span class="Italic">Heckler v. Chaney</span>, 470 U.S. 821, 828 (1985). Section 701(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedures Act ("APA") precludes judicial review where "agency action is committed to agency discretion by law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 701(a)(2). This is a "very narrow exception" that applies in "those rare instances where 'statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.'" <span class="Italic">Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc.,</span> 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971) (quoting S.

In addition, &#x00A7; 701(a)(2) more likely applies if an "agency decision not to enforce often involves a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise." <span class="Italic">Heckler</span>, 470 U.S. at 831.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only statutory acknowledgement of the Board's authority to reopen cases appears in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1), which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(e)(1)&#x2003;Except as provided in section 7702 of this title, any decision under subsection (b) of this section shall be final unless--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;a party to the appeal or the Director petitions the Board for review within 30 days after the receipt of the decision; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;the Board reopens and reconsiders a case on its own motion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board, for good cause shown, may extend the 30-day period referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. One member of the Board may grant a petition or otherwise direct that a decision be reviewed by the full Board. The preceding sentence shall not apply if, by law, a decision of an administrative law judge is required to be acted upon by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board argues that the "broad and standard-less language" of &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B) is sufficient to bring cases such as this, where the Board denies a motion to reopen, within the prohibition of &#x00A7; 701(a)(2). Specifically, the Board notes that this statute neither authorizes motions to reopen, nor does it lay out a standard by which such motions should be judged. It contrasts this to statutes governing motions to reopen in other contexts, such as 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10327(g), which sets forth the Interstate Commerce Commission's authority to reopen prior decisions and which the Supreme Court has found reviewable in certain circumstances. <span class="Italic">Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng'rs</span>, 482 U.S. 270, 284 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's reliance on &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B) is misplaced. Section 7701(e), the broader provision in which &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B) appears, is a provision which sets forth conditions under which a decision of the Board can be considered final. Its reference to "the Board reopens" is simply that--a reference to reopening such that it can set forth how reopening impacts a decision's status (e.g., final or not final). Unlike 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10327(g) (the Interstate Commerce Commission provision cited by the Board), this is not a provision focused on reopening procedures, nor the Board's authority to act in this way. Therefore, it makes sense that &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B) would not fully set forth legal standards or address motion practice--this was not the purpose of this provision and an attempt to do so could render the remainder of the provision confusing. Given this context, it would not be reasonable to infer an intent to "commit to agency discretion by law" from &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B)'s passing reference to "the Board reopens." <span class="Italic">See Barlow v. Collins</span>, 397 U.S. 159, 166-67 (1970) ("[J]udicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut of [sic] unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress."); <span class="Italic">Abbott Labs. v. Gardner</span>, 387 U.S. 136, 141 (1967), <span class="Italic">abrogated by Califano v. Sanders</span>, 430 U.S. 99 (1977) ("[O]nly upon a showing of 'clear and convincing evidence' of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review."). We decline to do so here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also do not think that the fact that Congress has otherwise been silent as to the Board's authority to reopen a case is sufficient to pull this case within the realm of &#x00A7; 701(a)(2). The mere absence of a statute spelling out the details of how an agency should carry out a particular action does not mean that that action has been wholly committed to agency discretion. Indeed, the Supreme Court has found agency decisions--including decisions to not reopen a case--reviewable under the APA, even in the absence of specific statutory directives. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dunlop v. Bachowski</span>, 421 U.S. 560, 573 (1975), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Local No. 82, Furniture &#x0026; Piano Moving, Furniture Store Drivers, Helpers, Warehousemen &#x0026; Packers v.

Orgs., Inc. v. Camp</span>, 397 U.S. 150, 158 (1970) (ruling by Comptroller was judicially reviewable in absence of statutory indication that review was precluded); <span class="Italic">see also INS v. Rios-Pineda</span>, 471 U.S. 444, 451 (1985) (refusal to reopen suspension proceeding reviewable despite absence of statutory mechanism for reopening).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What remains, then, is the "strong presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action." <span class="Italic">Mach Mining, LLC</span>, 135 S. Ct. at 1651. In the specific facts before us here, where the Board issued a decision on a motion to reopen that is premised on a change in law, we find that review is appropriate under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A). The Supreme Court has held:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Though the agency's discretion is unfettered at the outset, if it announces and follows--by rule or by settled course of adjudication--a general policy by which its exercise of discretion will be governed, an irrational departure from that policy (as opposed to an avowed alteration of it) could constitute action that must be overturned as 'arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion' within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang</span>, 519 U.S. 26, 32 (1996). This is precisely the case here: the Board has established a practice of entertaining motions to reopen which, although not codified in statute, are governed by regulations and substantially settled case law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.117, 1201.118; <span class="Italic">Anthony v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 214, 219 (1996); <span class="Italic">Moss v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, No. CH-1221-97-0313-B-1, 1999 WL 398739 (M.S.P.B. June 11, 1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Moss v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 230 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Most notably, the Board has held that reopening "may be appropriate where there is clear and material legal error, and a conflict between the holding of the decision and a controlling precedent or statute, either because of an oversight or a change in the controlling law between the date of the original decision and the reopening request." <span class="Italic">Olson v. Dep't of Agric.,</span> No. CH-3443-00-0857-I-1, 2002 WL 1289867 (M.S.P.B. June 3, 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we hold that, at least in the case of a Board decision on a motion to reopen that is premised on a change in law, we have jurisdiction to review, generally applying the "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law" standard under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A). Whether we have jurisdiction to review decisions on motions to reopen that are premised on other grounds, or the Board's decision to reopen a case <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, are issues we need not reach, and we decline to do so here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCarthy</span> decided that the failure of the letter from the Board's Clerk to articulate a basis for denying the reopening request did not preclude substantive review of the Board's determination, 809 F.3d at 1373:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having found the Board's denial of McCarthy's motion to reopen reviewable under the APA, we next consider whether the Board erred in denying McCarthy's motion. We conclude that it did not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we note that the Board did not specify in its January 8 letter the bases under which it denied McCarthy's motion to reopen. This potentially raises concerns under <span class="Italic">Chenery</span>, which generally prohibits courts from upholding agency decisions on grounds other than those actually relied upon by the agency. <span class="Italic">See SEC v. Chenery Corp.,</span> 318 U.S. 80, 95 (1943) ("[A]n administrative order cannot be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted in exercising its powers were those upon which its action can be sustained.") However, even under <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> we may, in appropriate circumstances, "affirm the agency on grounds other than those relied upon in rendering its decision, when upholding the agency's decision does not depend upon making a determination of fact not previously made by the agency." <span class="Italic">In re Comiskey</span>, 554 F.3d 967, 974 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting <span class="Italic">Killip v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 991 F.2d 1564, 1568-69 (Fed. Cir. 1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Fleshman v.

Cir. 1996)) ("[T]he [<span class="Italic">Chenery</span>] doctrine does not prohibit a reviewing court from affirming an agency decision on a ground different from the one used by the agency if the new ground is not one that calls for 'a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make.'"). Because, as we explain below, we can affirm the Board's decision on precisely such grounds--a lack of jurisdiction based on application of a statute (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214) to undisputed facts (McCarthy did not identify the legal memoranda in his submissions to the OSC)--there is no <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> concern here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jones v. MSPB</span>, 675 Fed. Appx. 972, 973-74 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP), distinguishing <span class="Italic">McCarthy,</span> determined there was no jurisdiction to review a notice from the Board's Clerk stating an appeal would not be reopened when the appeal was earlier the subject of a reopening request that was earlier denied:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 28, 2016, Mr. Jones submitted to the Board a third request for reconsideration of its final order. He requested the Board reopen his appeal in light of this court's precedential decision in <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 809 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2016). On February 23, the Clerk issued a letter denying his third request. The Clerk's letter stated that "the decision in <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span> was expressly limited to situations in which the Board denies a first request for reconsideration that is premised on a change in the law," and it noted that his third request for reconsideration was "premised not on a change in the law, but on a claim of 'clear and material legal error.'"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our jurisdiction to review decisions by the Board is limited. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9), we may only hear "an appeal from a final order or final decision" of the Board. We conclude that the Clerk's letter denying Mr. Jones' third request to reopen his appeal was not a final order or <span id="Page_5162"></span>decision of the Board, but an administrative response, over which we lack jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Haines v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 44 F.3d 998, 999 (Fed. Cir. 1995), we found that a letter from the Clerk of the Board informing the petitioner it did not plan to reopen her appeal was not a "final order or final decision" of the Board for purposes of 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9). The letter "was neither an administrative judge's initial decision, a denial of a petition for review by the Board, nor a Board decision disposing of an entire action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1000. Instead, we found the Clerk's letter was "an administrative response" to the petitioner's third request to reopen her appeal, and the Clerk "was performing only a ministerial function" in accordance with its delegated authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similar to <span class="Italic">Haines</span>, the Clerk's letter in this case was not an AJ's initial decision, a denial of a petition for review by the Board, or a Board decision disposing of an entire action. Rather, the Clerk's letter was a denial of Mr. Jones' third repetitive request to reopen his appeal. Mr. Jones argues his third request was not repetitive because the Board was divested of jurisdiction to review his first two requests during the pendency of his appeal of the Board's final order before this court. However, we agree with the government that although the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider a request for reconsideration while an appeal is before this court, here, the Board had jurisdiction over Mr. Jones' first request to reopen because he had not yet filed his appeal of the Board's final order in this court. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 46 M.S.P.R. 341, 350-51 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 949 F.2d 404 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Regardless of whether the Board had jurisdiction over Mr. Jones' second request to reopen, which was submitted and denied before this court issued its mandate in the appeal of the Board's final order, the Board had jurisdiction to consider his third request to reopen. Thus, the Clerk performed a ministerial task in denying Mr. Jones' repetitive request to reopen his appeal via an administrative response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decision in <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span> does not alter our conclusion. The facts of this case are unlike those in <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span>. In <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span>, we construed the Clerk's letter denying McCarthy's motion to reopen his appeal as a reviewable "final order or final decision." <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span>, 809 F.3d at 1370. In contrast to Mr. Jones' request to reopen, "McCarthy's motion to reopen had not been previously considered by the Board as it involved an intervening change in law." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, there is no intervening change in law at issue. The Board has previously considered Mr. Jones' motion to reopen.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Jones argues that because we found jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span> to review a motion to reopen based on a change in law, we should similarly find jurisdiction to review his third request to reopen, which is based on alleged "clear and material legal error," or "oversight," by the Board. The holding in <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span> does not extend as far as Mr. Jones would like. In <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span>, we held that "at least in the case of a Board decision on a motion to reopen that is premised on a change in law, we have jurisdiction to review...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1373. We stated that "[w]hether we have jurisdiction to review decisions on motions to reopen that are premised on other grounds... are issues we need not reach, and we decline to do so here." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span> does not provide the route to jurisdiction that Mr. Jones seeks.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A nonprecedential decision, <span class="Italic">Timmers v. MSPB</span>, 126 Fed. Appx. 482, 484-486 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), affirmed the Board's denial of a PFR presenting "new evidence" to justify a belated appeal from an annuity determination, but the court then set aside the Board's decision not to reopen the appeal based on a clear error of law in the annuity determination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal to the full Board, Timmers also specifically requested that the Board reopen the case pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118. That section provides: "The Board may reopen an appeal and reconsider a decision of a judge on its own motion at any time." The Board refused to reopen the case. In past cases we have assumed that we have authority to review the Board's decision not to reopen. As we noted in <span class="Italic">Azarkhish v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 915 F.2d 675 (Fed. Cir. 1990): "Assuming, without deciding, that [petitioner] has standing... the full Board has 'broad discretion' in deciding which initial decisions to review <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>," and the petitioner bears a "heavy burden" in this court to overcome it. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 679 (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see Zamot v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 332 F.3d 1374, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("The Board enjoys broad discretion in deciding whether to reopen particular appeals, and this court has stated that, even <span class="Italic">assuming we have the authority to review such a decision (an issue the court has left open)</span>, a party has a 'heavy burden' in attempting to demonstrate that the full Board erred in exercising its discretion not to reopen." (emphasis added)). The standard of review for such decisions is the highly deferential abuse of discretion standard. <span class="Italic">Nelson v. FDIC</span>, 83 F.3d 1375, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("<span class="Italic">Assuming</span>, <span class="Italic">without deciding</span>, that we may review the Board's decision not to reopen an appeal on its own motion under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118 for an abuse of discretion." (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">Azarkhish</span>, 915 F.2d at 679. When it denied Timmers' petition for review in its final decision, the Board did not mention the request to reopen.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the past, the Board has exercised its discretion to reopen cases to prevent what it perceived to be "manifest injustice to the appellant's substantive rights." <span class="Italic">Fields v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 659, 661-62 (1998) (considering additional evidence submitted to the full Board on reopening). In <span class="Italic">Fields</span>, the petitioner was the first wife of a federal employee and was seeking survivor annuity benefits from OPM pursuant to the terms of the divorce decree. OPM found that because the deceased husband was married to a second wife at the time of his death, the second wife would share in the survivor annuity, and accordingly reduced petitioner's benefits. 79 M.S.P.R. at 660-61. Petitioner appealed OPM's decision to the Board, but the appeal was untimely. The full Board nonetheless reopened the case because OPM had plainly erred. The evidence conclusively demonstrated that the second wife had divorced the husband prior to his death, and was not entitled to share in the survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 662. The full Board thus remanded the case to OPM for a new determination. <span class="Italic">See also Beck v. Gen. Servs. Admin.</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 489 (2000) (reopening case despite untimely petition for review because the initial decision directly conflicted with this court's precedent). We agree with the Board that it has authority to reopen a case to prevent manifest injustice. <span class="Italic">See Wright v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 183 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("The board has broad discretion in deciding whether reconsideration of a decision is necessary to preserve consistency or achieve 'the right result.'" (citing <span class="Italic">Azarkhish</span>, 915 F.2d at 679)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The circumstances of this case are similar. OPM denied Timmers' claim for survivor annuity benefits because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h) provides: "[A] former spouse of a deceased employee... is entitled to a survivor annuity... if and to the extent expressly provided for... in the terms of any decree of divorce." OPM held that the decree did not "expressly" provide for a survivor annuity, and the administrative judge agreed. They are plainly wrong. The divorce decree, which was presented to OPM and the administrative judge, unambiguously states: "[Timmers'] entitlement to death benefits is... fixed as of date of the Decree, utilizing the same apportionment as would be utilized if [Rausch] begins receiving his pension benefits at age 62." (Resp't App. at 41-42.) The reference to "death benefits" appears sufficient to establish an entitlement to a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Hokanson</span>, 122 F.3d at 1046.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize the broad discretion that the Board has in deciding whether to reopen a case pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118. However, if there is not already "ample justification for the board to exercise this discretion here," <span class="Italic">Wright</span>, 183 F.3d at 1332-33, there certainly is good reason for the Board to <span class="Italic">consider</span> whether to exercise that discretion. OPM's reconsideration decision appears inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Hokanson</span>, which would bring this case within the purview of <span class="Italic">Fields</span> and <span class="Italic">Beck</span>. At the same time, although she couched the request in terms of the timeliness issue, Timmers asked the Board to reopen. Under these particular circumstances, we think a remand is required. Thus, while we affirm the denial of the petition for review, we remand the case to the Board for it to determine whether OPM made a manifest error which requires reopening under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118 under the rationale of <span class="Italic">Fields</span> and <span class="Italic">Beck</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit will not likely disturb a Board decision not to reopen an appeal, <span class="Italic">Azarkhish v. OPM</span>, 915 F.2d 675, 679 (Fed. Cir. 1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Initially, it is not beyond question whether petitioner even has standing to contest the Board's declining to <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> reopen the appeal. Assuming, without deciding, that she has standing, Congress explicitly granted the full Board authority to reopen any initial decision upon its own motion. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7701(e)(1)(B) (1988). That authority was implemented in 5 C.F.R. Sec. 1201.117 which states that the full Board "may reopen an appeal and reconsider a decision of [an AJ] on its own motion at any time." That "reserved discretion" to reconsider an agency decision was not exercised here. <span class="Italic">See Dunning v. National Aeronautics and Space Admin</span>., 718 F.2d 1170, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner has a heavy burden to demonstrate that the full Board abused its discretion under section 1201.117, as the full Board has "broad discretion" in deciding which initial decisions to review <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>. <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd</span>., 751 F.2d 1250, 1254 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (discussing 5 C.F.R. Sec. 1201.115, a regulation setting forth the bases for granting a petition for review of an initial decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our predecessor court has stated that the reserved discretion of the predecessor of the MSPB to reopen a prior decision is "absolutely essential to the even administration of justice." <span class="Italic">Bookman v. United States</span>, 197 Ct. Cl. 108, 453 F.2d 1263, 1265 (1972) (concerning the Civil Service Commission). Thus, the policy goal behind section 1201.117 presumably is aimed at assuring consistency between and among initial decisions. Here, there is simply no evidence that the AJ's decision resulted in the petitioner being subjected to a hardship not faced by others who file applications for disability retirement untimely and then file untimely requests for reconsideration, without proving an excuse cognizable under the regulation. As the Supreme Court noted: "Whenever a question concerning administrative... reconsideration arises, two opposing policies immediately demand recognition: the desirability of finality, on the one hand, and the public interest in reaching what, ultimately, appears to be the right result on the other." <span class="Italic">Civil Aeronautics Bd. v. Delta <span id="Page_5163"></span>Air Lines, Inc</span>., 367 U.S. 316, 321, 81 S. Ct. 1611, 1617, 6 L. Ed.2d 869 (1961). Even if we give all weight to the policy of reaching the "right result" in this case, and none to the need for the finality of administrative decisions, when we review the two additional medical reports submitted to the full Board, we cannot say the AJ clearly did not reach the "right result."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The discretion accorded to the Board concerning requests to reopen appeals was confirmed in <span class="Italic">Nasuti v. MSPB</span>, 445 Fed. Appx. 355, 357-58 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP) (on further review, remanding for the Board to consider retroactivity and scope of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, <span class="Italic">Nasuti v. MSPB</span>, 504 Fed. Appx. 894 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of Board decisions is limited. We may only set aside agency actions, findings, or conclusions that we find to be "(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c); <span class="Italic">see also Bennett v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 635 F.3d 1215, 1218 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The Board's determination that it lacked jurisdiction is a question of law that this court reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Bennett,</span> 635 F.3d at 1218.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations allow for additions to the record when "[n]ew and material evidence is available that, despite due diligence, was not available when the record closed." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(d)(1); <span class="Italic">see also Avansino v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 3 M.S.P.B. 308, 310-11 (1980). However, in response to the Board's order to submit evidence and argument as to why the Board should reopen the record, Nasuti failed to provide any explanation as to why the letter was unavailable to him before the close of the record despite due diligence. At the time of Nasuti's original appeal, the AJ expressly informed Nasuti of his burden under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] to establish the Board's jurisdiction over his claim, and the AJ instructed him on the evidence that was required to determine whether he had exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nasuti argues that the Board had discretion to waive its rules under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.12, or to reopen the record on its own motion under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118, and abused its discretion in not doing so. When challenging the Board's refusal to reopen an appeal on its own motion, a petitioner "has a heavy burden to demonstrate that the full Board abused its discretion." <span class="Italic">Azharkhish v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 915 F.2d 675, 679 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Nasuti has not shown that the Board acted inconsistently with its prior decisions. The cases cited by Nasuti concerning the Board's discretion to reopen the record in a whistleblower appeal are distinguishable on the facts. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Orr v. Dep't of the Treasury,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 117, 122 (1999) (reopening the record after finding that the AJ failed to inform the petitioner that he had the burden to establish the Board's jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Atkinson v. Dep't of State,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 136, 140 (2007) (reopening the record after evidence was raised for the first time on administrative appeal, rather than where the evidence was raised for the first time on judicial review). Nor has Nasuti established that the Board abused its discretion in any other respect in declining to reopen the record.</p>

Dept. of Transp.,</span> 102 MSPR 306, 2006 MSPB 156 (2006)) (court suggested Board consider carefully whether "new" evidence is material when it may bear on significant credibility determination); <span class="Italic">Wright v. USPS</span>, 183 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (court strongly implied necessity for Board to reopen cases when evidence newly acquired following close of the record tends to impeach credibility of witness whose testimony is central to the disposition of the case); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 591 F.3d 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (timing of reopening petitions).</p>
