<p class="Body-Text">The indefinite suspension is an unusual breed of cat. The employee is indefinitely cast into nonduty and nonpay status pending the outcome of an investigation or criminal proceedings. If the employee loses the criminal case, the agency initiates termination. If he wins, the suspension ends, and under law from the Federal Circuit he gets no back pay, and the agency may still initiate termination for misconduct. The agency is not bound by an acquittal, for it can then initiate adverse action with proper notice and reply rights. The same result is reached with the indefinite suspension imposed while an employee's clearance is suspended. If the employee successfully resists the clearance suspension or notice of proposed revocation of the clearance and the clearance is restored, the employee is restored to duty, but without back pay. [Refer to Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-08-001.html#sec1-1"><span class="Italic">Res Judicata</span></a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-08-405.html#sec1-398">Collateral Estoppel</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulatory definition of an indefinite suspension is indefinite, 5 CFR 752.402 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Indefinite suspension</span> <span id="Page_2114"></span>means the placing of an employee in a temporary status without duties and pay pending investigation, inquiry, or further agency action. The indefinite suspension continues for an indeterminate period of time and ends with the occurrence of the pending conditions set forth in the notice of action which may include the completion of any subsequent administrative action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The indefinite suspension places the employee in a nonpay status. If the employee is placed on administrative leave during an investigation, he is not indefinitely suspended and the Board lacks jurisdiction over the imposition of the paid leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Oliver v. USPS</span>, 696 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir. 1983) (agency did not err by placing an employee on administrative leave during the 30-day advance notice period required for an adverse action); <span class="Italic">Moten v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 282, 286-87 (1989) (order to leave work was to permit the agency to investigate misconduct and not to punish misconduct; a subsequent indefinite suspension was not double jeopardy). [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-218.html#sec1-216">Leave Dispute; Administrative Leave; Notice, Investigation Leave.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employee may appeal the indefinite suspension at its onset, or the employee may assume the validity of the initiation of the suspension and appeal at the point that the suspension is unlawfully continued. The Board measures its jurisdiction (limited to suspensions exceeding 14 days) by examining the whole suspension, not only the unlawfully continued portion of the suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Peyton v. DOJ</span>, 62 MSPR 113, 116 (1994); <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 22, 26 (1993) (appellant could avoid an immediate appeal of an indefinite suspension, wait until the criminal action was dismissed, then await his restoration and appeal when the restoration was not made retroactive to the date of the dismissal of the indictment; "an appeal of an indefinite suspension takes as its action the entire suspension, rather than any discrete portion of it...though the subject matter of the instant appeal is limited to the last fourteen days of his suspension, the appeal nevertheless relates to the entire suspension for jurisdictional purposes"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Beatty v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 95, 98 (1983) (indefinite suspension of 14 days or less was not within the Board's jurisdiction). Once an appeal has been initiated concerning an indefinite suspension, it appears that an enforcement petition can be used to challenge the ongoing validity of the suspension should the appeal result in a Board order finding the suspension appropriate, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Farris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 29 MSPR 518, 520 (1985), although the better approach may be the initiation of another indefinite suspension appeal. A grievance as to the initiation of the indefinite suspension does not bar a Board appeal as to the agency's subsequent failure to reinstate the employee. <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://openjurist.org/487/f3d/1377/rhodes-v-merit-systems-protection-board">487 F.3d 1377</a> (Fed. Cir. 2007).

<p class="Body-Text">Although the indefinite suspension is ordinarily used with serious criminal charges, security clearance suspensions, or for the purpose of taking personnel off the roles during an examination into their fitness for duty, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GONZALEZ_MANUEL_J_NY_0752_09_0052_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_514402.pdf">114 MSPR 318</a>, 2010 MSPB 132 (2010), OPM's view of the indefinite suspension is not so limited. In 73 Fed. Reg. 54075, 54076 (Sept. 18, 2008), proposing regulations to clarify adverse action rules regarding indefinite suspensions, the prelude to the amendments stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like all other adverse actions, indefinite suspensions must meet the statutory requirement of promoting the efficiency of the service. Moreover, indefinite suspensions are not restricted to occasions when employees have been indicted for a criminal offense. Indefinite suspensions may also be warranted when an employee is under investigation for other serious misconduct that, if proven to be true, would warrant removal when, for example, the employee is under investigation for an allegation of conduct posing a significant risk to the life, health or safety of others, government or public property, the effective accomplishment of the agency's operations, national security or privacy interests. An indefinite suspension with a 30-day notice period in these instances may be appropriate to ensure the efficiency of the service by maintaining public trust in the Federal workforce. It may also be appropriate when, for example, the employee is under investigation based on an allegation that the employee poses a risk to the health or safety of others, the employee's security clearance has been suspended or revoked, or the employee's fitness-for-duty examination or determination is pending.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The proposed regulation, 5 CFR 752.403(c) provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An agency may indefinitely suspend an employee, without invoking the crime provision in Sec. 752.404(d)(1) of this part when, for example--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The employee's fitness-for-duty examination or determination is</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">pending; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The employee is under investigation for serious misconduct that, if proven to be true, would warrant removal, such as when the employee is alleged to have engaged in conduct posing a significant, ongoing risk to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The life, health or safety of self or others;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Government or public property including, but not limited to, information technology systems;</p>

<p class="Body-Text">By final rulemaking notice, 74 Fed. Reg. 63531, 63531-32 (Dec. 4, 2009), OPM decided to leave bad enough alone and dropped its proposed regulatory revision, shifting the burden of trying to determine the meets and bounds of an extra-statutory adverse action in the form of an indefinite suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After reviewing the comments, OPM has decided not to make any changes in the current regulations relating to indefinite suspensions. The comments regarding standards and procedures for using indefinite suspensions persuade us that the issues raised are quite complex. These include the amount of evidence needed to justify use of indefinite suspensions, issues relating to the absence of external events limiting the duration of investigations, and the types of misconduct that would justify the indefinite suspension action. Accordingly, we have determined that we should await further delineation of the law by MSPB and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit before deciding whether to propose substantive regulations on this subject.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 752.402 was later amended, but not as to indefinite suspensions. <span class="italic">See</span> 87 Fed. Reg. 67765 (Nov. 10, 2022). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-13-124.html#sec6-123">Inquiry Into Other Issues</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The earliest and most comprehensive definition of the indefinite suspension appears in <span class="Italic">Martin v. Customs Serv.</span>, 12 MSPR 12, 17-20, 10 MSPB 568 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It would be helpful, at the outset, to examine the definition of the term "suspension" which is set forth at 5 USC 7501(2). That provision defines a suspension, for the first time statutorily, as "the placing of an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status without duties and pay." According to the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act, (C.S.R.A.), Congress' intent in enacting this provision was to adopt, rather than change, the definition of "suspension" utilized by the former Civil Service Commission (C.S.C.). The former C.S.C. had defined a suspension as "an action placing an employee in a temporary non-duty and non-pay status for disciplinary reasons <span class="Italic">or for other reasons pending inquiry</span>." Former FPM Supp. 752-1, S1-6(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The most essential criterion of an action, if it is to meet the definition of "suspension" set forth at 5 USC 7501(2), is that it be "temporary." Accordingly, while the exact duration of an indefinite suspension may not be ascertainable, such an action must have a condition subsequent such as the completion of a trial or investigation which will terminate the suspension. Although the time duration of the action may not be determinable, an indefinite suspension continuing beyond the given point of termination would be improper. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Erdwein v. United States</span>, 215 Ct. Cl. 54 at 65, n.8 (1977). Such an action imposed with no ascertainable end in sight is not sustainable as a suspension, because of failure to meet the criterion of temporariness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All of the indefinite suspension actions herein were purportedly imposed pending resolution of possible criminal misconduct by the appellants. As the Board noted in <span class="Italic">Cuellar v. United States Postal Service</span>, 8 MSPB 282, 284, 8 MSPR 624, 628 (1981), "[i]n passing the Reform Act, Congress maintained the 'crime exception' now contained in 5 USC 7513(b)(1) as the only instance in which an agency's need to protect its employees, property, and/or reputation could outweigh the employee's right to 30 days' notice [of an adverse action]." Courts have examined, and given approval to, suspension actions taken on shortened notice and based on examinations into charged criminal conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coleman v. United States Postal Service</span>, No. 79-4751 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 1980), (approving, "[a]s a practical matter," an indefinite suspension based upon an arrest on a serious charge and an arraignment on the basis of a felony complaint); <span class="Italic">Jankowitz v. United States</span>, 533 F.2d 538 at 543 (Ct. Cl. 1976), (holding "eminently fair" an indefinite suspension based upon an indictment because "[r]ecognizing that he might well have been acquitted, the agency even-handedly rejected the 'knee-jerk' approach, giving plaintiff a chance to save his job if exonerated.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another reason courts have approved of indefinite suspensions based upon examinations into criminal charges was set forth in <span class="Italic">Polcover v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 477 F.2d 1223, 1231-1232 (D.C. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 414 U.S. 1001 (1973). Quoting from <span class="Italic">Silver v. McCamey</span>, 221 F.2d 873, 874-875 (D.C. Cir. 1955), the court specifically warned of the dangers of subjecting an employee to an administrative hearing while criminal action is pending:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]e agree...that due process is not observed if an accused person is subjected, without his consent, to an administrative hearing on a serious criminal charge that is pending against him. His necessary defense in the administrative hearing may disclose his evidence long in advance of his criminal trial and prejudice his defense in that trial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2115"></span><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Peden v. United States</span>. 512 F.2d 1099, 1103 (Ct. Cl. 1975).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As has been stated, indefinite suspensions are based upon "reasonable cause."... As INS notes, "reasonable cause" is virtually synonymous with the "probable cause" which is necessary to support a grand jury indictment. Before returning an indictment, a Federal grand jury must be satisfied that "there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused has probably committed it." 8, Moore's <span class="Italic">Federal Practice</span>, "Rules of Criminal Procedure," Part III, at 6-18, 2d ed., 1978. "Probable cause" is defined as "reasonable cause," or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]n apparent state of facts found to exist upon reasonable inquiry (that is such inquiry as the given case renders convenient and proper) which would induce a reasonably intelligent and prudent man to believe, in a criminal case, that the accused person had committed the crime charged, or, in a civil case that a cause of action existed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span>, Revised 4th Ed., 1968, at 1365.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon this analysis, the Board agrees with INS that an indictment is sufficient, while an investigation, in and of itself, is insufficient, to give rise to "reasonable cause" to believe the employee has committed a crime for which imprisonment could be imposed. An arrest or investigation may, however, be accompanied by such circumstances as would give rise to a "reasonable cause." INS has cited as examples: an employee arrested and held for further legal action by a magistrate; an investigation resulting in evidence supporting a reasonable cause to believe; a "criminal information," (which differs from an indictment only in that it is brought by a prosecutor instead of by a grand jury); and, certain egregious acts detrimental to the accomplishment of the agency's mission, such as murder or national security offenses, brought to the agency's attention via the news media. Of course, the underlying facts and circumstances on which the agency bases its "reasonable cause to believe" must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence in order for the action to be sustained. 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An indefinite suspension based on reasonable cause to believe that a crime has been committed for which imprisonment may be imposed must meet the "efficiency of the service" standard of 5 USC 7513(a). Thus, there must be a nexus between the crime the employee is reasonably believed to have committed and his position. That is, as INS has stated in its petition,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the agency must prove that the charges may reasonably be expected to interfere with or prevent effective performance of the duties and responsibilities of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 6 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 585 (1981); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Bergland</span>, 586 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">Young v. Hampton</span>, 568 F.2d 1253 (7th Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">Jankowitz v. United States</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 533 F.2d at 549.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another element of the agency's proof is the reasonableness of its penalty. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280 (1981). Thus, agencies must show that a lesser penalty would be ineffective under the circumstances of the particular case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indefinite suspensions are not based upon provable misconduct but upon the examination into that misconduct. <span class="Italic">Jankowitz v. United States</span>, 533 F.2d 538 (Ct. Cl. 1976). Therefore, an indefinite suspension may be found to have been reasonable when imposed, although facts later developed may cause the Board to find that an agency acted unreasonably in failing or refusing to vacate the action. In this regard, however, the Board notes that before an agency or before the Board, the bare fact of a subsequent acquittal does not demonstrate that an indefinite suspension had been unjustified. An acquittal because a jury or a judge was not convinced beyond and to the exclusion of all "reasonable doubt," <span class="Italic">Speiser v. Randall</span>, 357 U.S. 513 (1958), is not binding on an administrative agency, <span class="Italic">Alsbury v. United States Postal Service</span>, 392 F. Supp. 71 (C.D. Calif. 1975), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 530 F.2d 852 (9th Cir. 1976), because the standard of proof before the Board is the "preponderance of the evidence." The Board concludes that where, after a full review of the attendant facts and circumstances, an indefinite suspension is found to have been reasonably imposed and maintained, the Board will sustain the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because a suspension is by definition temporary, an indefinite suspension must have a determinable condition subsequent which will bring the action to an end. Accordingly, the Board's order sustaining the action would explicitly or implicitly mandate that the agency move expeditiously, and that the suspension terminate upon the occurrence of the condition subsequent. Noncompliance with these terms of the order could be brought to the Board's attention via 5 CFR 1201.181, which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any party may petition the Board for enforcement of a final decision issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction. Submission of this petition shall be made to the field office which rendered the initial decision. The petition shall specifically set forth the reasons why the petitioning party believes there is non-compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board agrees with OPM that this provision gives an appellant the procedural opportunity to argue that conditions have occurred which should have brought about a termination of his suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The procedural and substantive elements of <span class="Italic">Martin v. Customs Serv.</span>, 12 MSPR 12, 10 MSPB 568 (1982) (including reliance on media reports), were modified by <span class="Italic">Barresi v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 656, 663 (1994), and other decisions that should be reviewed in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-13-114.html#sec6-113">Criminal Activity</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-11-050.html#sec4-51">Arrest</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-13-115.html#sec6-114">Indictment; Filing of Information; Referral for Prosecution</a>."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It seems at odds with our system of justice that on the basis of no more than an indictment--that being reasonable cause to believe that a crime has been committed--an individual can be stripped of his livelihood with no chance to stop the suspension until the criminal proceedings conclude. The indefinite suspension becomes an extrastatutory form of conditional discharge pending the initiation of an adverse action after the criminal proceedings. Because the indefinite suspension also includes employees whose security clearances are suspended during investigation, the indefinite suspension can affect a lot of employees. A big problem for employees who are indefinitely suspended is that under the Federal Circuit's view of the law they cannot recover back pay if they are eventually reinstated. Indefinite suspensions are, well, indefinite; some go on for months--years. The employee is not likely employable in the private sector and the employee cannot expect to get an interim job with another federal agency. Perhaps she can obtain unemployment compensation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An early court decision addressing indefinite suspensions was <span class="Italic">Jankowitz v. United States</span>, 533 F.2d 538 (Ct. Cl. 1976). The court did not become involved in an analysis of the legality or evolution of the indefinite suspension. The court assumed its validity and moved on to the question of what happens if the indictment is dismissed: does the employee get back pay for the period of the suspension? Reasoning that indictment is sufficient cause for the suspension, the court determined that back pay could not be recovered because the suspension itself was lawful. <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span> was reaffirmed in spirit by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Wiemers v. MSPB</span>, 792 F.2d 1113 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and <span class="Italic">Wiemers</span> is now controlling law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The indefinite suspension was more thoroughly analyzed by <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOJ</span>, 715 F.2d 662 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The employee argued that the indefinite suspension was invalid because disciplinary action depends on a finding of cause and cause depends, in turn, on a finding of misconduct. Not so, the court held. The statutory standard states that adverse action may be taken for such cause as may promote service efficiency. Cause is not the same as misconduct. Viewed from the perspective of the government, the court held, public confidence in a government agency might decline if the public learned that a person indicted by the government continued to work for the government. To avoid possible loss of public confidence, the court determined, it is reasonable for an agency to suspend the employee during the criminal proceedings. The "cause" is the cause of public confidence, not the misconduct of the employee. But to be fair, the court decided (although the result would not be subsequently followed), once the criminal proceedings are dropped, if the employee is victorious, then he must be granted back pay to avoid undue individual sacrifice for the public good and welfare. The government is still free to pursue termination proceedings even if the criminal proceedings turn out in the employee's favor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A dissenting opinion in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> explained what was fairly obvious: criminal proceedings, though shorter than many Board cases, may go on for many months and sometimes years. It is prejudicial to an employee to cut him off from his income, during the time he will probably need it most (the cost of defense counsel can be considerable), on no more than an indictment without proof of misconduct. Rather than the action against the employee being a conditional suspension, as it was termed by the majority opinion, the dissent characterized the action as a conditional discharge. The dissent suggested alternatives: administrative leave or reassignment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown</span> may be the better approach, but <span class="Italic">Wiemers</span>--stating that back pay is not necessary upon reinstatement of an employee at the conclusion of an indefinite suspension--is controlling law, since the MSPB is obliged to follow the decisions of that circuit and since most Board decisions are now appealable only to the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not long after <span class="Italic">Wiemers</span>, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed the validity of the indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572, 1575-78 (Fed. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">aff'g</span> <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 660, 664 (1989), involving an indefinite suspension based on a charge that the appellant sexually molested his daughter, determined that the indefinite suspension was constitutional. After finding an indefinite suspension to be disciplinary and within the jurisdiction of the MSPB when imposed to alleviate potential disruption at a government facility, the circuit court concluded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At a minimum, due process requires that an individual being deprived of his property interest be given "an opportunity to be heard 'at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.'" <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Eldridge</span>, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976).... Nonetheless, to determine exactly what process is due in any particular case, a more exacting analysis must be conducted that considers the particular circumstances and interests involved.... More specifically, three factors are to be considered: (1) the individual's interests affected by the government's adverse action; (2) the government's interests; and (3) the risk of an erroneous decision and whether more accurate procedures might not reduce that possibility....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2116"></span>No doubt, Engdahl has significant interests that were substantively affected. Suspension for cause without pay is likely to cut off subsistence income and to prevent one from obtaining other gainful employment. Although temporary, such a suspension has great practical impact on the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government's interests, however, were far more substantial. First, female co-workers were apprehensive about working around Engdahl and accordingly the Navy was concerned that co-workers' job performance would be affected.... Second, the government was legitimately concerned for the personal safety of its Naval base residents, including "many children."... Third, the government was concerned that permitting an employee to continue performing his duties when that employee faces criminal charges that have become notorious, partly through press coverage, would reflect poorly upon the government and would likely diminish public confidence in operations....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the procedures followed before Engdahl was deprived of pay provided him ample opportunity to persuade the government that its concerns were ill-founded.... In addition to a written reply, Engdahl personally met with government officials. He even had legal representation via a telephone conference call during that meeting....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Engdahl argues that the government denied him due process in not permitting him to directly rebut the allegations of criminal activity contained in the charges. There is nothing, on the record before us, however, that indicates that, assuming such an opportunity was constitutionally required, it was denied. In any event, once he pleaded guilty, any question about guilt became moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...There is no indication he tried to present evidence that he was innocent of the crimes charged.... The record merely shows that Engdahl was represented by counsel and that a number of <span class="Italic">legal</span> arguments were made by counsel.... In the absence of a factual predicate, we simply need not reach the legal argument advanced here by Engdahl. Again, the argument has no application for the period beyond February 22 when he pleaded guilty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Engdahl also claims that his right to substantive due process under the fifth amendment was violated.... Engdahl cites <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), as mandating that government employers suspend <span class="Italic">with pay</span> when acting because of "protective" concerns. He points particularly to the Supreme Court's statement that "in those situations where the employer perceives a significant hazard in keeping the employee on the job, it <span class="Italic">can</span> avoid the problem by suspending with pay."... This statement, however, was clearly dicta.... Moreover, the language, "can," is merely descriptive, not normative. We agree that in the instant case, the government <span class="Italic">could</span> have suspended with pay. Nevertheless, we cannot read <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> as holding that the government <span class="Italic">must</span> suspend him <span class="Italic">with pay</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's decisions generally address the peripheral aspects of indefinite suspensions. It is the agency's burden to prove the validity of a continuing indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Farris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 29 MSPR 518, 520 (1985). The information providing the reasonable cause must be in the possession of and relied upon by the agency in the proposal or decision to suspend; it cannot be garnered later. <span class="Italic">Larson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 260, 263 (1984). An agency need not intend to remove the employee to impose an indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Farris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 20 MSPR 547 (1984). According to the Federal Circuit, an indefinite suspension and subsequent removal must be separately appealed. If the suspension is reversed, but the removal is not appealed, the Board will not order the appellant's reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Orofino v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1581). Normally an AJ should not dismiss an appeal from an indefinite suspension pending trial. The suspension is based not on misconduct but on an indictment. <span class="Italic">Morris v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 20 MSPR 623, 624 (1984). [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-028.html#sec3-28">Dismissal Without Prejudice to Refile</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Martin v. Customs Serv.</span>, 12 MSPR 12, 17, 10 MSPB 568 (1982), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> the purpose of the indefinite suspension is not to punish but to allow examination of alleged criminal conduct. Because the suspension is not a punishment, it is improper to place an employee on indefinite suspension and remove the employee for the same acts. <span class="Italic">Giacobbi v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 39 (1986) (investigation was already complete and there was no pending charge; an indefinite suspension was set aside for lack of a condition ending the suspension, but the removal was sustained for underlying misconduct); <span class="Italic">Littlejohn v. USPS</span>, 25 MSPR 478, 481 (1984) ("The agency, further, effected appellant's "indefinite" suspension during the advance notice period of the removal action, and effected his removal for the same act of misconduct for which he was suspended. Where an agency has imposed disciplinary or adverse action because of an employee's misconduct, it is barred from subsequently taking another adverse action for the same reason. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Adamek v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> [13 MSPR 224] 11 MSPB 482, 483 (1982). Therefore, the agency in the instant case may not effect both suspension and removal actions against appellant for the same act of misconduct. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 425, 430-31 (1994) (nothing improper about the agency suspending an employee for a refusal to perform duties and taking adverse action based on the fraudulent submission of sick leave documentation (citing and distinguishing <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 634, 640 (1992) ("[W]e note that the agency took the emergency suspension and removal actions based on the same act of misconduct, i.e., the appellant's verbal and attempted physical assault of his supervisor.... Taking two such disciplinary actions on the same grounds is 'not in accordance with law' under <span class="Italic">Anderson [v. USPS]</span>, 24 MSPR 488].")); the Board ordered cancelation of the emergency suspension; on the merits, the appellant's removal was mitigated to suspension). Under the somewhat opaque analysis of <span class="Italic">Dawson v. USDA</span>, 121 MSPR 495, 2014 MSPB 67 (2014) (Member Robbins concurring), an indefinite suspension based on an ongoing investigation of alleged criminal misconduct may encompass the notice period of an adverse action (removal) based on the same conduct without running afoul of a prohibition against double jeopardy (two adverse actions for the same conduct) or other due process concerns. [Refer to Chapter 11, "<a href="0100-2023-18-034.html#sec11-35">Double Jeopardy</a>," for <span class="Italic">Dawson</span>; refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-017.html#sec2-18">Indefinite Suspension; Enforced Leave</a>," concerning the time for appealing an indefinite suspension; and refer to Chapter 1,"<a href="0100-2023-08-198.html#sec1-196">Suspension</a>," on Board jurisdiction over short-term suspensions.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Termination of a criminal investigation is the condition subsequent that brings the suspension to an end. It is improper for an agency to initiate an indefinite suspension when its investigation into alleged criminal misconduct is complete. <span class="Italic">Giacobbi v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 39, 41-42 (1986); <span class="Italic">Littlejohn, supra</span>. An indefinite suspension should not have been initiated after criminal charges against the appellant were resolved and there was no evidence that the agency conducted any other investigation into the matter during the intervening weeks prior to proposing his removal. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. DOJ</span>, 51 MSPR 43, 48 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Giacobbi v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 39 (1986)). The suspension may continue as long as the investigation is active, although an agency may not keep a case open to claim that an investigation is ongoing. <span class="Italic">Farris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 29 MSPR 518, 521-22 (1985). An appellant's agreement to a plea bargain, involving the entry of a guilty plea, does not stop an indefinite suspension. Only when the court accepts the plea and enters its judgment must the indefinite suspension be terminated. <span class="Italic">Campbell v. DLA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3135). If the case has not progressed to a criminal trial, the agency must receive an unambiguous communication from a prosecutor stating the decision to decline prosecution before the agency's duty is triggered to bring the indefinite suspension to an end. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Canevari v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 50 MSPR 311, 316 (1991) (suspension pending the disposition of possible criminal charges arising out of alleged drug use).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not require the employing agency to second-guess the validity of a government investigative or prosecutorial effort. If the prosecutor of a criminal case initiated on the basis of a valid indictment uses improper tactics that delay the resolution of criminal charges that are ultimately dismissed, the indefinite suspension, initially lawfully imposed, will not be set aside by reason of prosecutorial tactics beyond the control of the employing agency, <span class="Italic">Jarvis v. DOJ</span>, 45 MSPR 104, 109-110 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the administrative judge and the appellant that the indefinite suspension became improper when the government delayed the criminal prosecution in May 1987 by appealing the exclusion of evidence it had agreed not to use. The rationale behind an indefinite suspension based on an indictment is not to punish the alleged misconduct but to allow examination into such misconduct by the judicial system. <span class="Italic">See Martin,</span> 12 MSPR at 18. In allowing such examination, the administrative agency, as the employer, does not have any control over the progress of the litigation, including delays caused by prosecution tactics. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 USC &#x00A7; 547(l); <span class="Italic">United States v. Kysar,</span> 459 F.2d 422 (10th Cir. 1972). The Board finds that acts of impropriety occurring in the criminal prosecution of the appellant do not negate the propriety of the administrative indefinite suspension taken by the INS, since, despite any delays in the prosecution, the case was still before the court for examination purposes. Thus, as long as the court still had the case before it in order to examine the misconduct, the rationale for the indefinite suspension remained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To hold otherwise would place on the employing agency the impractical burden of having to evaluate and assess independently whether a prosecuting authority has acted improperly in continuing a criminal action against a federal employee despite the fact that a criminal indictment is still unresolved. In such a scenario, were the agency to decide to discontinue the indefinite suspension prior to the indictment's resolution, it would have to either allow the employee to continue working, or proceed with an adverse action against the employee. Allowing an employee to continue to work with criminal charges outstanding would not serve the government's interests, as it could have an adverse effect on the efficiency of the service. Moreover, an independent administrative investigation into the misconduct that has given rise to an employee's indictment on criminal charges is not advised while the criminal action is pending because of due process considerations. <span class="Italic">See Engdahl v. Department of the Navy,</span> 40 MSPR 660, 665 (1989). For example, in subjecting an accused person to an administrative hearing on serious criminal charges that are pending against him, his necessary defense in the administrative hearing may disclose his evidence long in advance of his criminal trial and prejudice his defense in that trial. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2117"></span>In so concluding, we find no merit in the appellant's premise that, but for the agency's delay, he could have been reinstated almost two years prior to when he was reinstated. This argument assumes that the appellant would have been found innocent had his case gone to trial. Since the indictment's dismissal was based on 6th Amendment grounds and did not exonerate him of all wrongdoing, the appellant's argument that he would have been reinstated two years earlier is as speculative as contending that he would have been found guilty and would have been permanently removed from his position.[5] Therefore, the Board finds that the indefinite suspension was valid until the indictment was dismissed on March 13, 1989, and that the appellant is not entitled to back pay for any period of time during which the indictment was still outstanding<span class="Italic">. See Wiemers v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 792 F.2d at 1116.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The appellant's reliance on <span class="Italic">Rampado v. United States Customs Service</span>, 28 MSPR 189 (1985), is misplaced. In that case, the appellant was indefinitely suspended based on reasonable cause to believe that he had committed a crime. The Board intimated that prosecutory delay in bringing the case to the grand jury for purposes of getting an indictment might be grounds to reverse a suspension because such a suspension may lose its requisite "temporary" character. However, in cases such as this one, where there is a valid indictment, there must be a resolution of the criminal charges in order for the "condition subsequent" to be met. We also find no analogy between indefinite suspensions based on an indictment and agency delays in processing adverse actions. As pointed out, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> unlike an adverse action, the employing agency does not have any control over the delays of the prosecution, and an indefinite suspension based on an indictment does not serve as a penalty for the underlying misconduct, but rather serves to permit judicial examination of the charges.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board undertook an extensive analysis of indefinite suspensions in 2010 and determined that the indefinite suspension should not be used when an agency simply wants to investigate potential misconduct, although an investigation, coupled with other factors and circumstances, may justify its use. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GONZALEZ_MANUEL_J_NY_0752_09_0052_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_514402.pdf">114 MSPR 318</a>, 320-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-28, 2010 MSPB 132 (2010).
