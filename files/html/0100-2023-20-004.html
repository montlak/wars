<h3 class="h3" id="sec13-5"><span class="space">A.</span> WHISTLEBLOWING REPRISAL</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the statute earlier reprinted is more complex, under 5 USC 2302(b)(8) it is a prohibited personnel practice to take or fail to take (or threaten to take or fail to take) a personnel action against any employee or applicant for employment as reprisal for a disclosure that the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences: (1) any violation of any law, rule, or regulation; (2) gross mismanagement; (3) a gross waste of funds; (4) an abuse of authority; or (5) a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. A violation of &#x00A7; 2302(b)8) is referred to as whistleblower reprisal. Reprisal occurs even if the individual taking the reprisal believes the allegations to be false; the question is whether the individual making the allegations reasonably believed them to be true. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Harvey</span>, 28 MSPR 595, 605 n.19 (1984). A good overview of the Whistleblower Protection Act is in the report for Congress from the Congressional Research Service, <span class="Italic">The Whistleblower Protection Act: An Overview</span> (March 12, 2007), <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/RL33918.pdf">https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/RL33918.pdf</a>. A more recent summary of whistleblowing protections, jurisdictional and proof requirements before the MSPB is in <span class="Italic">Whistleblower Protections for Federal Employees: A report to the President and the Congress</span> (MSPB Office of Policy &#x0026; Evaluation, Sept 2010). <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/studies/studies/Whistleblower_Protections_for_Federal_Employees_557972.pdf">https://www.mspb.gov/studies/studies/Whistleblower_Protections_for_Federal_Employees_557972.pdf</a> There are two ways whistleblower retaliation claims arise before the MSPB: (1) a stand-alone claim under 5 USC 1221 as an Individual Right of Action; or (2) as an affirmative defense to an adverse employment action over which the MSPB has jurisdiction under 5 USC 7513. <span class="Italic">Baca v. Dept. of Army,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20201222088">983 F.3d 1131,</a> (10th Cir. 2020).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whistleblower reprisal accounts for most of the prohibited personnel practice allegations (excluding EEO defenses) decided by the Board. The Board acknowledges that the Whistleblower Protection Act is a remedial statute and that "it should be broadly construed in favor of those whom it was intended to protect." <span class="Italic">Porter v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 80 MSPR 606, 609 &#x00B6; 10 (1999). Yet the Board and the Federal Circuit have interpreted the Whistleblower Protection Act narrowly, despite amendatory legislation attempting to overcome objectionable decisions by both tribunals, so that few whistleblowers prevail in Board litigation. Unlike the EEO process, where the EEOC can find discrimination when the Board has not, no other tribunal is specifically devoted to appellate redress of traditional whistleblower complaints within the federal service, although employees can avoid the Board entirely and seek redress through grievance arbitration procedures if they are fortunate enough to have those processes available to them and if they can obtain union backing to take their cases into arbitration. [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-22-001.html#sec15-1">Chapters 15</a> and <a href="0100-2023-23-001.html#sec16-1">16</a> for recovery of costs and consequential damages by successful whistleblowers.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The GAO summarized significant whistleblower legislation affecting federal employees in its report, "Whistleblowers--Key Practices for Congress to Consider When Receiving and Referring Information" (GAO-19-432):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 provided the first whistleblower protections for disclosures of violations of laws, mismanagement, or gross waste of funds for federal employees, former employees, and applicants for employment, among other things.[10] To strengthen protections for those who claim whistleblower retaliation, the Congress passed the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. In 2012, the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act clarified the scope of protected whistleblowing under the Whistleblower Protection Act and mandated broader outreach to inform certain federal employees of their whistleblower rights, among other things.[11] The No Fear Act requires agencies to notify and train employees, former employees, and applicants of their rights under antidiscrimination and whistleblower <span id="Page_3581"></span>protection laws and requires the Office of Personnel Management to report annually on certain topics regarding antidiscrimination and whistleblower protection laws, including disciplinary actions taken for conduct that is inconsistent with these laws.[12] Further, the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Act of 2017 enhanced disciplinary penalties for supervisors who engage in whistleblower retaliation.[13]</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The significance of the whistleblower and the whistleblowing process and the protections provided by that process was noted in House Report 112-508 (May 30, 2012), of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, accompanying the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, at pages 5-6 of the Committee Print:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whistleblowers are crucial in helping to expose waste, fraud, abuse, mismanagement and criminal activity across the Federal government. Their disclosures can save billions of dollars, and even human lives. It is vital that Congress encourage--not discourage--these well-intentioned individuals from coming forward. To accomplish that, prospective whistleblowers must be protected from reprisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Current law provides that an employee, former employee, or applicant has the independent right to seek review of whistleblower reprisal cases by the MSPB 60 days after the OSC closes an investigation, or 120 days after filing a complaint with the OSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unfortunately, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal District has eroded whistleblower protections over the years through a series of decisions. This has adversely impacted well-intentioned whistleblowers and led to an unwillingness by many to step forward. The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, H.R. 3289, (WPEA) reestablishes appropriate whistleblower protections from retaliation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An overview of the changes in whistleblower protections since the CSRA of 1978 is provided by the MSPB FY 2020-2024 <span class="Italic">Strategic Plan</span>, at pp. 27-29:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Whistleblowers and new PPPs</span>: Under the [1989] Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), MSPB exercises jurisdiction over claims made by whistleblowers in two types of appeals. An individual right of action (IRA) appeal is authorized by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) with respect to personnel actions that are allegedly threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing activities.[18] If the action is not otherwise appealable directly to MSPB, the appellant first must seek corrective action from OSC. An otherwise appealable action is a direct appeal to MSPB under laws, rules, or regulations other than 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a), providing MSPB with jurisdiction over the case, which also includes an allegation that the agency action was based on the employee's whistleblowing activities. The appellant may choose either to seek corrective action from OSC before appealing to MSPB or appeal directly to MSPB.[19] That choice determines the scope of review applicable to the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[18]&#x2003;IRA appeals involve personnel actions listed in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[19]&#x2003;Examples of such otherwise appealable actions are listed in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.3 (a)(1) through (a)(19).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress enacted significant changes to whistleblower protections in the WPEA [Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012].[20] This legislation amended the WPA to: (1) expand the scope of protected disclosures and activities; (2) eliminate or narrow some exclusions from coverage; (3) add to the covered actions over which MSPB has appellate jurisdiction; (4) extend protections to all Transportation Security Administration employees; (5) authorize MSPB to impose disciplinary action in some retaliation cases; (6) expand MSPB's authority to award compensatory and other damages; and (7) require MSPB to include whistleblowing case processing data in its APRs. The WPEA, as amended, also suspended, for five years, the exclusive jurisdiction of the CAFC over MSPB whistleblower cases. On July 7, 2018, the President signed the All Circuit Review Act.[21] The All Circuit Review Act reinstated (retroactive to November 26, 2017) and made permanent the authority for appellants to file petitions for judicial review of MSPB decisions in certain whistleblower reprisal cases with any circuit court of appeals of competent jurisdiction (instead of only the CAFC). The WPEA also added a 13th PPP, which involves appropriate enforcement of nondisclosure agreements. The WPEA enhanced whistleblower protections and gave MSPB more responsibility and authority in whistleblowing cases, which has added to MSPB's case workload and case complexity.[22] GAO issued a report on the WPEA in November 2016.[23] As discussed above, MSPB has made and is continuing to make changes to its processes for recording and reporting WPEA data in response to issues found and recommendations made in that report.[24]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Follow the Rules Act, which was signed into law on June 14, 2017, amended the right-to-disobey provision of the WPEA.[25] This provision originally protected covered employees from retaliation for refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law.[26] The Follow the Rules Act permits an employee to refuse to obey an order that would require him or her to violate a law, rule, or regulation. This includes agency-specific rules and regulations, and is likely to be the subject of appeals brought to MSPB when agencies attempt to discipline employees for failing to obey an order.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 26, 2017, the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 was signed into law.[27] This law creates a 14th PPP prohibiting access to medical records of another employee or an applicant for employment as a part of, or otherwise in furtherance of, any conduct described in PPPs 1 through 13. In addition, this law: (1) requires agency heads to propose disciplinary action against supervisors who are found to have committed a PPP; (2) provides certain whistleblower protections to probationary Federal employees; (3) provides guidelines to enhance Federal employee awareness of Federal whistleblower protections; and (4) enhances access to information by OSC.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 12, 2017, the FY 2018 NDAA was signed into law.[28] Section 1097 of this law reauthorized OSC. The most significant provision of this law relevant to whistleblower protection is section 1097(d), which amends 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4302 and 4313 to require that agencies establish criteria for adding the protection of whistleblowers as a critical element for supervisors' performance appraisals (including SES performance appraisals). The provision also requires agencies to report annually to Congress the number of performance appraisals that determine agency supervisors fail to meet these standards. Another provision of this law, section 1097(c), amends 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) to provide whistleblower protections for employees who cooperate with or disclose information not only to an Inspector General or the Special Counsel, but also to any other component responsible for internal investigation or review of an agency. The FY 2018 NDAA also contains a provision (similar to the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act) that requires the head of the agency to propose discipline of a supervisor determined by the agency head, an administrative law judge, the MSPB, OSC, a judge of the United States, or the agency's Inspector General to have committed a PPP.[29] If a suspension of more than 14 days, a demotion, or a removal is taken against a supervisor under this statute, the supervisor has the right to appeal the matter to the MSPB. Finally, section 1097(c)(4) amends 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214 to permit OSC to petition the MSPB to order corrective action against an agency if the agency's investigation of an employee was begun, expanded, or extended in retaliation for a protected disclosure or activity, regardless of whether a personnel action was taken.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Delgado v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200716121">966 F.3d 556</a>, 559-60 (7th Cir. 2020) (amended, without change to quoted section, on petition for rehearing, <span class="Italic">Delgado v. DOJ,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20201029132">977 F.3d 1295</a> (7th Cir. 2020)), described the Whistleblower Protection Act as complex, not easily navigated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first provide an overview of the Whistleblower Protection Act and how it frames the issues on this petition for judicial review. Covering most federal civil servants, the Act offers relief for employees who have suffered adverse personnel actions as a result of making protected disclosures of wrongdoing within their agencies. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(B) and (b)(8). The disclosure at issue in this appeal falls under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i), which protects "any disclosure of information by an employee <span id="Page_3582"></span>or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences any violation of any law, rule, or regulation...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act establishes a procedural obstacle course for employees who invoke its protections. A covered employee who believes he has suffered a prohibited personnel practice under the Act must first "seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before seeking corrective action from the [Merit Systems Protection] Board." &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). The Special Counsel must investigate any allegation received "to the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken." &#x00A7; 1214(a)(1)(A). If the Special Counsel "determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken which requires corrective action, the Special Counsel shall report the determination together with any findings or recommendations to the [Merit Systems Protection] Board, the agency involved and to the Office of Personnel Management, and may report such determination, findings and recommendations to the President." &#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the Office of Special Counsel has finished with the case, an employee may seek corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board. &#x00A7; 1221(a). The Board must order appropriate corrective action if the employee demonstrates that a protected disclosure "was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken against such employee...." &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). The employee may do so by means of "circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that--(A) the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure or protected activity; and (B) the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (This "knowledge/timing test" plays a key role in this case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Powers v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 554, 561 (2004); <span class="Italic">Grubb v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 377, 395 (2004); <span class="Italic">Redschlag v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 589, 634-35 (2001).) If the employee shows that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action, the agency may still avoid relief to the whistleblower by "demonstrat[ing] by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2).[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The procedural obstacle course also includes a number of deadly pitfalls, at least as the statutes are interpreted and applied by the administering agencies. <span class="Italic">See generally Delgado I</span>, 880 F.3d at 920-21, 923-27 (describing procedural rules and precedents used to reject Delgado's original complaint and appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whistleblower appeals are in two forms. If an action is within the appellate jurisdiction of MSPB, whistleblowing may be raised as an affirmative defense. Or whistleblowing may be raised through an Individual Right of Action, discussed later in this Chapter. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. DHHS</span>, DC-315I-18-0140-I-1 (NP 5/16/2022) ("The Board lacks jurisdiction over a whistleblower reprisal claim raised as an affirmative defense unless it is raised in connection with an otherwise appealable action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980) (finding that prohibited personnel practices under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) are not an independent source of Board jurisdiction), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982)." [Refer later in this chapter to "Individual Right of Action."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Retroactivity of various whistleblower-related amendments to the CSRA is discussed in sections of this Chapter concerning particular personnel actions, damages or other remedies, and disclosures. Refer to <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 2022 MSPB 9 (2022) (nonretroactivity of 2018 appropriations statute adding coverage for disclosures to an agency "component responsible for internal investigation or review"; <span class="Italic">Hooker v. VA</span>, 120 MSPR 629, 2014 MSPB 15 (2014) (retroactivity of WPEA amendment involving 5 USC 2302(b)(9)(B)); <span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 119 MSPR 663 (2013) (nonretroactivity of WPEA damages provisions); <span class="Italic">Day v. DHS</span>, 119 MSPR 589, 2013 MSPB 49 (2013) (Member Robbins concurring in part and dissenting in part) (retroactivity on amendments defining "disclosures"); <span class="Italic">Scott v. DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 211 (1995) (considering retroactivity of what was styled a WPEA procedural amendment). [Refer to Chapter 17, involving judicial review, "Retroactivity."]</p>
