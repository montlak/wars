<p class="Body-Text">The essential allegations in a VEOA case were summarized in <span class="Italic">Perkins v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 425, 430 &#x00B6; 14 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That test provides that, to establish the Board's jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal, the appellant must show that he exhausted his DoL remedy and make nonfrivolous allegations that he is a preference eligible within the meaning of the VEOA; that the action(s) at issue took place on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of VEOA; and that the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference<span class="Italic">. Abrahamsen v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Veterans Affairs,</span> MSPB Docket No. DA-3443-00-0217-1-1, 94 MSPR 377 &#x00B6; 6. 2003 WL 22239218 (2003).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A pleading presenting a VEOA claim is to be liberally construed; it should not dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the appellant can prove no facts in support of a claim within the Board's remedial authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. VA</span>, 113 MSPR 385, 389-90 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 2010 MSPB 48 (2010) ("an allegation, in general terms, that veterans' preference rights were violated is sufficient to meet the requirement of a non-frivolous allegation to establish Board jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal"; "the appellant's claim, that the agency unfairly failed to select him for the positions for which he applied, constitutes a non-frivolous allegation that the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference, and establishes Board jurisdiction over his VEOA claim with respect to those positions"); <span class="Italic">Haasz v. VA</span>, 108 MSPR 349, 352 &#x00B6; 7, 2008 MSPB 60 (2008) ("An appellant's allegation, in general terms, that his veterans' preference rights were violated is sufficient to meet the non-frivolous allegation requirement. <span class="Italic">Elliott v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 364, &#x00B6; 8 (2006)."); <span class="Italic">Young v. FMCS</span>, 93 MSPR 99, 102 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 6 (2002) (although the appellant cited to USERRA rather than VEOA, the pleading deficiency was not a proper basis for dismissal; the appellant alleged in general terms that his VEOA preference rights were violated; AJ did not inform the appellant of the means for proving a VEOA claim).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Yet the appellant in a VEOA case must at least present nonfrivolous factual allegations supporting jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen v. VA</span>, 94 MSPR 377, 379-80 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In some prior cases, the Board has stated the VEOA jurisdictional test as consisting of a <span class="Italic">claim</span> by the appellant that the agency violated his <span class="Italic">statutory</span> veterans' preference right, and a <span class="Italic">showing</span> that he is a preference eligible. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Abell v. Department of the Navy,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 397 &#x00B6; 5 (2002); <span class="Italic">Olson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 169 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (2002); <span class="Italic">Sherwood v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 208 &#x00B6; 5 (2001). We use this case to clarify the proper test, using the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Campion,</span> our opinion in <span class="Italic">Ruffin,</span> and the language of the statute, all of which arc cited above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is not enough to simply make a bare claim that a violation of preference eligible rights occurred. Rather, an appellant must make nonfrivolous allegations of such a violation. <span class="Italic">Campion,</span> 326 F.3d at 1215. Further, the statute provides that a VEOA appeal may be based not only on an alleged violation of a statutory right relating to preference eligibility, but that it also may be based on an alleged violation of a <span class="Italic">regulatory</span> right in that regard. Finally, for purposes of jurisdiction, the appellant need not actually prove that he is a preference eligible. Rather, if the appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation that he has such a status, he has met that part of the jurisdictional test. <span class="Italic">Accord Lourens v. Merit Systems</span> <span class="Italic">Protection Board,</span> 193 F.3d 1369, 1370-71 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (to establish the Board's jurisdiction over an appeal filed under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, the appellant needed to make nonfrivolous allegations that she was a member of a uniformed service, or had applied to perform, had performed or was obligated to perform service in a uniformed service). If the appellant meets his jurisdictional burden, the parties may submit any further and relevant evidence and argument addressing the merits. <span class="Italic">See Walley v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 279 F.3d 1010, 1018-19 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to section 4311(b), an employer may not retaliate against an employee for pursuing or assisting another individual in pursuing his USERRA rights.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that she engaged in activities protected under 38 U.S.C. chapter 43.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's allegations that an agency violated his veterans' preference rights should be liberally construed. <span class="Italic">See Abrahamsen v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 8 (2003). Although the appellant did not separately set forth below such jurisdictional allegations as to vacancy announcements 05-03, 05-05, and 05-14, DOL's termination notices addressed the appellant's apparent allegations that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights in not selecting him for the Loan Specialist vacancies. Such allegations are sufficient to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement to nonfrivolously allege that the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation related to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Young v.

In <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 8, the Board subsequently "clarif[ied] " the jurisdictional test, stating: "It is not enough to simply make a bare claim that a violation of preference eligible rights occurred. Rather, an appellant must make nonfrivolous allegations of such a violation." The Board did not explicitly modify or overrule <span class="Italic">Young,</span> however, and subsequently held that an allegation by an appellant that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights by selecting a nonveteran for a promotion was jurisdictionally sufficient, although the appellant did not state a claim on which relief could be granted. <span class="Italic">Goldberg</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 660, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 9, 10. We therefore find that the appellant's allegation that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights in not selecting him for the Loan Specialist vacancies is jurisdictionally sufficient and that the AJ erred in dismissing these matters on jurisdictional grounds.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. FDIC</span>, DC-3330-13-0504-I-1 (NP 4/17/2014) ("An appellant's assertions that his veterans' preference rights have been violated should be liberally construed, and an allegation, even in general terms, that an appellant's veterans' preference rights have been violated is sufficient to meet the requirement of a nonfrivolous allegation to establish Board jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Slater v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 6 (2009). The Board has previously found that an appellant's allegation that he was not selected for a position of employment in violation of his veterans' preference rights is sufficient to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement that he non-frivolously allege that the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation related to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coster v.

<p class="Body-Text">Despite liberal VEOA pleading standards, there must still be sufficient specificity as to the claimed violation so that the respondent understands the violations charged and so that the Board is not requested to render an advisory opinion, <span class="Italic">Shaver v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 106 MSPR 601, 608-10 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13, 2007 MSPB 229 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[G]iven the current state of the record, the agency's complaints regarding its difficulties in attempting to respond to the appellant's appeal are well-founded. In the appellant's submissions to the administrative judge, it appears that the appellant purposefully avoided identifying any specific agency actions as the subject of her appeal and, as the administrative judge recognized in the initial decision, instead sought a decision in the nature of an advisory opinion concerning the agency's use of military spouse preference. While the VEOA gives the Board jurisdiction to consider an appeal alleging that federal agencies have violated an individual's rights under any statute or regulation related to veterans' preference, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1), the terms used in the VEOA indicate that the statute is intended to apply to allegations that an agency has violated "the individual's rights," <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1) ("A preference eligible who alleges that an agency has violated <span class="Italic">such individual's rights under any statute or regulation related to veterans' preference</span> may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor.") (emphasis added). Accordingly, a more general claim--such as a complaint that an agency policy or regulation violated a statute or regulation related to veterans' preference, as opposed to a complaint that a discrete agency action violated the complainant's individual rights under such a statute or regulation--does not constitute a viable complaint under the VEOA, and the VEOA does not grant the Board jurisdiction over such a claim.[7] In addition, as the administrative judge noted in the initial decision, the provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act provide that "[t]he Board shall not issue advisory opinions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h). Thus, while the Board is not an Article III court subject to the case or controversy clause found in Art. III, &#x00A7; 2 of the U.S. Constitution, the Board is precluded from issuing an opinion where the issues presented are no longer "live" or the parties do not have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Tunik v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 407 F.3d 1326, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 6 (2006). Accordingly, to the extent that the appellant sought an advisory opinion <span id="Page_633"></span>from the Board regarding the agency's use of military spouse preference without any reference to a specific action affecting the appellant in which the agency applied the preference, we find that the administrative judge properly declined to issue such a decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Under particular circumstances, the Board can exercise jurisdiction over certain types of claims in the absence of a discrete agency action. For example, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f) gives the Board jurisdiction, on its own motion or on petition for review filed by any interested person or by the Special Counsel, to review any rule or regulation issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and authorizes the Board to declare such rule or regulation invalid if the Board determines that such provision, either on its face or as implemented by an agency, would require any employee to violate 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b). Subsection 2302(b) provides that federal employees shall not commit defined "prohibited personnel practices," including knowingly taking or failing to take any personnel action if the taking of such action, or the failure to take such action, would violate a veterans' preference requirement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11)(A), (B). During the course of her appeal, the appellant has not indicated that she is seeking review of an OPM rule or regulation, and she has not filed a petition for review of an OPM regulation in accordance with the Board's regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. Part 1203 (describing the procedures for review of OPM rules and regulations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Still, rather than finding that the Board had jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal and then denying corrective action on the basis of the garbled and vague nature of the appellant's allegations in the current record, the better practice would have been for the administrative judge to require the appellant to clarify her submissions to identify the specific agency actions at issue in her appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf. Schmittling v. Department of the Army,</span> 219 F.3d 1332, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (in an individual-right-of-action appeal, the Board may not assume that an appellant has met all of the jurisdictional requirements and then proceed to address the merits of the appeal). If the appellant had provided such clarification, the agency would have been in a position to file a response addressing the merits of its actions, and, after the record was complete with respect to those actions over which the appellant established jurisdiction, the administrative judge would have been in a position to adjudicate whether those actions violated the appellant's rights under any statute or regulation related to veterans preference. If the appellant failed to provide such clarification after being ordered to do so, the administrative judge could have declined to exercise jurisdiction over those actions for which the appellant failed to establish jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that the appellant did not identify a specific law or regulation concerning veterans' preference that had been violated; however, the appellant's failure to do so is not a basis for the dismissal of his VEOA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Young v.

Further, the Board has found that "an allegation by an appellant, in general terms, that his VEOA preference rights were violated is sufficient to meet the non-frivolous allegation requirement." <span class="Italic">Elliott v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 364, &#x00B6; 8 (2006) (the AJ erred by dismissing an appeal for lack of jurisdiction where a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant alleged in general terms that his VEOA preference rights were violated, even though the appellant did not specifically identify the statute or regulation that the agency allegedly violated). Thus, the AJ's finding that the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference so as to satisfy the requirements for Board jurisdiction under VEOA because he did not identify a statute or regulation concerning veterans' preference that was violated is not in accordance with our case precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights by preventing him from exercising his right to make a deposit for his post-1956 military service so that he could receive full credit for this service under FERS. Based on these assertions, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that his veterans' preference rights were violated and the AJ, therefore, erred by dismissing the appellant's VEOA claim on jurisdictional grounds. Therefore, we reverse the ID.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ's jurisdictional finding, although incorrect, does not affect the outcome of this appeal, however, because ultimately the appellant is not entitled to any relief, as he has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. An appeal that is within the Board's jurisdiction can be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted if the appellant cannot obtain effective relief before the Board even if his allegations are accepted as true. <span class="Italic">Will v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 283, &#x00B6; 9 (2007). In appraising the sufficiency of an appeal, the Board follows the accepted rule that an action should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the appellant can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">As <span class="Italic">Simpkins, supra,</span> concluded, a VEOA claim may be dismissed if it is plain that no VEOA violation is possible on the record before the Board, <span class="Italic">Cruz v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we still dismiss the appellant's VEOA claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In appraising the sufficiency of an appeal, the Board follows the accepted rule that an action should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the appellant can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. <span class="Italic">Young</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 99 &#x00B6; 5. In this case, the record establishes that the vacancy announcements at issue were merit promotions, not subject to veterans' preference, and the agency has presented undisputed evidence that the reference to veterans' preference in the announcements was inapplicable, surplus language. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have held that veterans usually are not entitled to any preference when seeking promotions or intra-agency transfers. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 247 F.3d 1222, 1224-25 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Hamner v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 84 &#x00B6; 20 (2002). Furthermore, the Federal Circuit and the Board have found that when an appellant is not entitled to a veterans' preference, the appeals should be dismissed as a failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 247 F.3d at 1225; <span class="Italic">Young</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 99 &#x00B6; 8-9. Accordingly, we dismiss the appellant's VEOA claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, the Board was really entering summary judgment against the appellant on his VEOA claim. But since the Board expressly disclaims summary judgment authority, and because it did not apparently want to remand the case for a hearing on the VEOA claim for disposition on the merits, the Board confused when it can, and when it cannot, dismiss a VEOA case for failure to state a claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alford v.

<p class="Body-Text">The same type of analysis was presented in <span class="Italic">Green v. USPS</span>, 103 MSPR 278, 287-89 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-21, 2006 MSPB 266 (2006), determining that "the appellant need not state a claim upon which relief can be granted for the Board to have jurisdiction over a VEOA claim," but dismissing the case because "he has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the AJ dismissed on jurisdictional grounds the appellant's claim that the agency has violated his rights to veterans' preference under the VEOA by its failure to restore him to duty. An AJ may dismiss a VEOA claim for lack of jurisdiction only when an appellant fails to meet one or more of the VEOA's jurisdictional requirements<span class="Italic">. Waddell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 411, &#x00B6; 9 (2003). To establish Board jurisdiction over an appeal brought under the VEOA, an appellant must (1) show that he exhausted his remedy with the DOL and (2) make nonfrivolous allegations that (i) he is a preference eligible within the meaning of the VEOA, (ii) the actions at issue took place on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of the VEOA, and (iii) the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a;<span class="Italic"> Abrahamsen v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 8 (2003).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the AJ determined that the appellant is a preference eligible who alleged, in part, that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights under the VEOA by denying him restoration following a compensable injury, and that he had exhausted the DOL complaint procedure. The AJ dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that the appellant had not alleged a violation of any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference that bears on the question that he presented to DOL and the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, however, identified an agency regulation that requires that preference eligible veterans who are placed on a reemployment priority list must be considered ahead of others on the list. Based on this assertion, we find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that his veterans' preference rights were violated. Accordingly, the AJ erred in dismissing the appellant's VEOA claim on this basis. Nevertheless, because the appellant has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the AJ's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction has not prejudiced his substantive rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of proof to establish that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights. In this appeal, that burden includes proving that he was entitled to restoration, i.e., priority consideration for a vacant position. In other words, under the circumstances of this appeal, the appellant must be able to establish that he is entitled to receive priority consideration as a fully recovered employee in order to state a VEOA claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b), an employee who recovers from a compensable injury more than one year from the date of the injury is entitled to priority consideration agencywide for restoration to the position he left or an equivalent one, "<span class="Italic">provided he [</span> <span class="Italic">]</span> <span class="Italic"> applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation</span>." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b) (emphasis supplied.) Here, it is undisputed that the appellant recovered more than one year from the date of injury. While the Federal Circuit found that the appellant was entitled to priority consideration after his timely 1998 restoration request, it found that he did not meet the agency's reasonable requirement for reemployment that he submit to a psychiatric evaluation. <span class="Italic">Green</span>, [194 F. 3d at *5] . Moreover, whether a subsequent request for restoration is considered to have been made when the appellant submitted to the examination by Dr. Roitman, when his attorney sent the letter making an inquiry sometime before June 2000, or when the appellant submitted the evaluation from Dr. Glovinsky in September 2000, such a request came long after the time limit of 30 days from the December 15, 1997, cessation of compensation. The time the appellant was challenging the AJ's decision before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court, and also litigating the agency's actions in district court and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, does not toll the time limit for making a request for restoration. The appellant has failed to allege any facts to support this element of his claim that he made a timely request for restoration within 30 days of full recovery from his compensable injury. Accordingly, he has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>
