<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-154"><span class="space">13.</span> Problems During Investigations: Lack of Cooperation; Interference; Self-Incrimination</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">"Employees have a duty to speak with agency investigators unless criminal proceedings are reasonably feared." <span class="Italic">Taylor v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 155, 160 (1991). <span class="Italic">Ashford v. DOJ, Bureau of Prisons</span>, 6 MSPR 458, 463-66, 6 MSPB 389 (1981), provides the Board's earliest comprehensive analysis of the employee's responsibilities to his agency during an investigation of the employee's alleged misconduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;EMPLOYEE RIGHTS IN AN AGENCY INVESTIGATION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent has argued that he had a right to refuse to answer the investigation's questions until he was adequately advised of the charges against him and until he was permitted to be represented by counsel at the investigative interview. Respondent's contention presents three legal issues: first, whether respondent had a right to be informed of the charges against him at the investigative interview; secondly, whether he was entitled to be represented at the interview by counsel; and thirdly, if neither of these rights attached in an investigative proceeding, whether the employee nevertheless had a right to refuse to answer questions on the basis that his statements might tend to incriminate him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">A.&#x2003;Notice of Charges</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The right to be informed of charges is a due process right which attaches to administrative adjudications, but not to administrative proceedings which are merely investigatory. <span class="Italic">Hannah v. Larche,</span> 363 U.S. 420, 441-42, 80 S. Ct. 1502, 1514-15, 4 L. Ed.2d 1307 (1960). Clearly, once an agency initiates the process of taking an adverse action against an employee, the employee is entitled to notice of the specific charges. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1). However, since the purpose of an agency investigation is to discover the facts, the agency may not be able to formulate the precise charge until its investigation is completed. Therefore, since respondent had no right to notice at the investigative stage, his refusal to answer questions was not justified by the agency's failure to advise him of the charges. <span class="Italic">See Womer v. Hampton</span>, 496 F.2d 99, 104-106 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">B.&#x2003;Right to Counsel</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are three possible sources for a non-statutory right to counsel: the <span id="Page_2630"></span>Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;This section does not address rights arising under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B), that provision being inapplicable to this case, since respondent was not a member of a bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is limited to criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">Middendorf v. Henry,</span> 425 U.S. 25, 96 S. Ct. 1281, 47 L. Ed.2d 556 (1976). Accordingly, a government employee has no Sixth Amendment right to counsel in an investigation undertaken by his employer. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Swing,</span> 463 F. Supp. 555, 560 (M.D. N.C. 1978); <span class="Italic">Boulware v. Battaglia,</span> 344 F. Supp. 889, 903 (D. Del. 1972), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 478 F.2d 1398 (3d Cir. 1973).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The due process right to representation is not limited to criminal proceedings, but as stated <span class="Italic">supra</span>, due process rights attach when an administrative case has moved from the investigative phase to the adjudicative phase. <span class="Italic">Hannah v. Larche,</span> 363 U.S. at 441-42, 80 S. Ct. at 1514. Thus, an employee has no due process right to be represented by counsel at an agency investigative interview. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Swing,</span> 463 F. Supp. at 561; <span class="Italic">Haines v. Askew,</span> 368 F. Supp. 369, 373, 376 (M.D. Fla. 1973) <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 417 U.S. 901, 94 S. Ct. 2596, 41 L.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The privilege against compulsory self-incrimination may be asserted in any "proceeding, civil or criminal, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory" where the individual reasonably believes that his statements may be used against him in a criminal proceeding.[8] In <span class="Italic">Garrity v.

Therefore, there was no reason for the respondent to believe that his statements would be used in a criminal proceeding.[10] Therefore, respondent's refusal to answer questions was not justified by the self-incrimination clause.

<p class="Body-Text">An agency could not sustain a charge that an employee refused to cooperate in an agency investigation with criminal overtones when the agency failed to provide the employee with a straightforward, unambiguous statement of immunity from criminal prosecution, <span class="Italic">Modrowski v. VA</span>, 252 F.3d 1344, 1347-1353 (Fed. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thereafter, DVA officials informed the local United States Attorney's Office of the situation, and ascertained that the U.S. Attorney declined to prosecute Modrowski. On July 30, 1997, Rogala sent Modrowski a letter on DVA letterhead, signed by himself, stating as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;The U.S. Attorney has been apprised of the situation, granted you immunity and has declined to prosecute you in the matter of the purchase of two properties by Ronald Perzanowski.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;You are hereby notified your assertion of your Fifth Amendment rights is unnecessary since you will not be prosecuted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;You are therefore ordered to respond to my questions concerning this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The very next day, July 31, 1997, Rogala questioned Modrowski for a third time. After Modrowski persisted in his refusal to respond to Rogala's questioning, Rogala terminated the meeting.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following week, on August 6, 1997, Rogala interrogated Modrowski for a fourth time in pursuit of the investigation. According to his testimony before the Board, Modrowski informed Rogala that he had made an appointment to meet with an attorney on August 8, 1997, and that he would not respond to Rogala's questions until after such consultation. It is undisputed that Modrowski did meet with his attorney on August 8, 1997. Why questioning did not resume after this consultation is unclear.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 22, 1997, however, apparently without any further questioning, Rogala sent Modrowski a letter proposing to remove him from his position with the DVA....&#8197;The agency also set forth two charges for refusing to cooperate, i.e., answering questions, in the investigative proceedings on July 31, 1997 and August 6, 1997, respectively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Regarding his alleged refusal to cooperate, Modrowski asserted that he was not able to meet with his lawyer until August 8, and that he was thus under no obligation to respond to Rogala's questions on pain of dismissal for refusal to answer until thereafter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's remaining charges allege that Modrowski refused to cooperate in the interrogations conducted on July 31 and August 6, 1997. The DVA contends that Modrowski had received by then its letter conveying the U.S. Attorney's declination, and thus that Modrowski no longer had a legal basis for refusing to answer Rogala's questions or face dismissal for such refusals. Modrowski argues that he was unclear about the scope of any immunity conferred as stated in the letter, and thus that he had a legitimate basis for refusing to answer the questions until he had time to meet with his attorney.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination may be asserted in an administrative investigation to protect against any disclosure an individual reasonably believes could be used in his own criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used. <span class="Italic">Kastigar v. United States</span>, 406 U.S. 441, 444-45 (1972). In addition, the threat of removal from one's position constitutes coercion, which renders any statements elicited thereby inadmissible in criminal proceedings against the party so coerced. <span class="Italic">Garrity v. New Jersey</span>, 385 U.S. 493, 497, 500 (1967) ("The option to lose their means of livelihood or to pay the penalty of self-incrimination is the antithesis of free choice to speak out or to remain silent."). Nevertheless, because an employee receives "use immunity" through the so-called <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> exclusion rule, he may be removed for failure to cooperate with an agency investigation. Gardner <span class="Italic">v. Broderick</span>, 392 U.S. 273, 276 (1968). Invocation of the <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> rule for compelling answers to pertinent questions about the performance of an employee's duties is adequately accomplished when that employee is duly advised of his options to answer under any immunity actually granted or remain silent and face dismissal. <span class="Italic">Weston v. Dep't of Hous</span>. <span class="Italic">&#x0026; Urban</span> Dev., 724 F.2d 943, 948 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Modrowski asserts, in essence, that he never had an opportunity to be "duly advised" of his options to respond to Rogala's questions under the immunity allegedly granted or face dismissal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Modrowski points to the sequence of events. He received Rogala's letter on July 30, 1997, and asserts that he had questions regarding the scope of any immunity described in that letter. The next day, July 31, 1997, he met with Rogala, and refused to respond to his questions, testifying during the Board hearing that he had "many questions regarding the immunity issue" because he "had no idea of the scope of said immunity." It is undisputed that Modrowski arranged to meet with his attorney the following week, on August 8, 1997, and that he justified his refusal to answer Rogala's questions at the August 6, 1997 meeting by arguing that he should not have to respond until consultation with his lawyer, only two days later. Accordingly, Modrowski argues that he should not be found to have refused to cooperate in the proceedings on these two dates, but that instead he should have been given sufficient opportunity to meet with an attorney to discuss the letter and its scope of immunity. In effect, he argues that the questioning should have been adjourned to August 9. The Board disagreed, determining that Modrowski had no right to delay the proceedings until he met with his lawyer. <span class="Italic">See</span> slip op. at 25 ("Although the appellant argues that the agency should have given him time to consult with his attorney concerning the scope of his immunity, I find no legal authority that imposes such an obligation on an agency once it has informed an employee he has been granted immunity.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Modrowski's legal rights in this case were far from clear cut. The June 30, 1997 letter stating that the U.S. Attorney had declined to prosecute Modrowski was written on DVA letterhead and signed by Rogala. Even if such a letter is a suitable means of conveying immunity, it is entirely understandable that Modrowski would suspect the validity and scope of the alleged grant. Furthermore, the letter only references the U.S. Attorney's decision to decline prosecution of Modrowski, without setting forth an express grant of immunity. Also, the only transaction covered in the alleged grant of immunity is the "purchase of two properties by Ronald Perzanowski." There is thus considerable ambiguity in the scope of this alleged immunity. The Board's opinion notes that Modrowski testified that he believed he would be subject to criminal prosecution as a result of the investigation, in particular for vandalism and improper issuance of checks. Watson, the Deciding Official, acknowledged during the hearing that the investigation started out focusing on whether "Modrowski might have been stealing materials from VA houses." Although it is unclear from the record whether the agency was continuing to investigate Modrowski for criminal violations at the time of the July 31 and August 6 interrogations, the agency never issued a formal statement announcing the close of such an investigation. The terse language of the letter suggests to us that Modrowski had a reasonable apprehension that any of his responses to Rogala made under the supposed grant of immunity with respect to the sale of the houses could nevertheless be used against him in any eventual criminal proceedings concerning theft from, or vandalism to, the houses. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Kastigar</span>, 406 U.S. at 449 ("If, on the other hand, the immunity granted is not as comprehensive as the protection afforded by the [Fifth Amendment] privilege, petitioners were justified in refusing to answer.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Watson, the Deciding Official in this case, testified similarly at the hearing before the Board that the legal significance of Rogala's letter was unclear. When asked whether Modrowski should have had a sufficient opportunity to talk to his lawyer about the letter, Watson acknowledged that it would be reasonable "to give the guy two days to get legal counsel so he can answer the questions." He testified:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Q:&#x2003;Can you see how a reasonable person would question, would want to have legal counsel to tell them whether they actually have immunity or not based on a letter of this type? Do you understand?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A:&#x2003;Yes, I could.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2632"></span>Q.&#x2003;And in this case, if Mr. Modrowski was faced with this letter, if he got this letter on July 31st, could you understand why he would want to obtain legal counsel to give him advise about this?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A:&#x2003;Yes, I can.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Q:&#x2003;And if that were true, would that also affect your decision in this matter, would that perhaps change your mind?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A:&#x2003;It would slow me down a little bit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Q:&#x2003;And do you think that instead of termination you might either choose an alternative discipline or give the guy the chance, give the guy two days to get legal counsel so he can answer the questions, and let him keep his job?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A:&#x2003;Probably.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Modrowski did, indeed, attempt to meet with his lawyer to ascertain his rights. He did so in a timely fashion, scheduling an appointment with his attorney for the week following his receipt of Rogala's letter. No evidence of record suggests that such a delay was unreasonable. Nonetheless, the agency refused to allow Modrowski the time to meet with his attorney, without explanation, then or now, as to why this request could not be accommodated. We find this to be an arbitrary and capricious decision that unfairly denied Modrowski the opportunity to consult with his attorney. We need not reach the question as to whether Modrowski had an absolute right to counsel, as provided by the Fifth or Sixth Amendments or the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 555(b) (1994). Nor do we hold that all federal employees who are called to respond to questions in an agency investigation have the right to delay proceedings to obtain legal counsel. In the limited circumstances of the present case, however, we conclude it was arbitrary and capricious to charge Modrowski with a refusal to cooperate. The dispositive factors here are: (1) the agency was admittedly investigating Modrowski for criminal violations; (2) the purported grant of immunity had ambiguous scope; (3) statements elicited under the alleged grant of immunity could conceivably be used against Modrowski in related criminal proceedings; (4) there was no formal assurance from the agency that the criminal investigation had terminated; (5) Modrowski was faced with the penalty of removal for failure to cooperate; (6) Modrowski timely arranged to meet with an attorney; and (7) there is no allegation that Modrowski's request was unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The present appeal is thus distinct from <span class="Italic">Weston</span>, where we affirmed the Board's decision sustaining the removal of a federal employee who refused to cooperate in an investigation. <span class="Italic">Weston</span>, 724 F.2d at 943. In <span class="Italic">Weston</span>, there was no allegation that the scope of protection conferred by the U.S. Attorney's declination to prosecute was ambiguous, and the employee had full access to counsel. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 946. The issue in <span class="Italic">Weston</span>, not present in the instant appeal, was whether the employee's penalty for noncooperation could be mitigated in light of her good-faith reliance on incorrect advice supplied by her lawyer. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 950-51. As distinct from <span class="Italic">Weston</span>, Modrowski was denied an adequate opportunity to consult with his lawyer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we reverse the part of the Board's decision sustaining the charges concerning Modrowski's alleged refusal to cooperate during the July 31 and August 6, 1997 proceedings, i.e., before his meeting with his attorney.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The properly warned and immunized employee is subject to removal for failure to cooperate with an agency's request for an investigatory interview, <span class="Italic">Curry v. USDA</span>, 217 Fed. Appx. 960, 962 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court finds no errors in the Board's determination that the agency properly justified Mr. Curry's removal. The request for an interview with Mr. Curry was determined to be a legitimate request. Having found a valid reason for the request for an interview, the Board then considered whether Mr. Curry properly invoked his Fifth Amendment rights. The USDA informed Mr. Curry that he would be removed if he did not participate in the interview and that his answers could not be used against him in a criminal case. He was further granted use immunity from the Department of Justice (DOJ). Contrary to Mr. Curry's arguments on appeal, both the immunity he received through the <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span> warnings, and the use immunity provided to him by the DOJ, were sufficient to protect him. Further as the government points out on appeal, Mr. Curry never appeared for his interview and so any questions concerning crimes of violence (an area not covered by his use immunity) are not applicable in this situation. Thus, in such a situation, the government possesses the power to remove him from his position because he subsequently did not participate in the interview. <span class="Italic">See Garrity v. New Jersey</span>, 385 U.S. 483, 500 (1967).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, Mr. Curry's failure to appear for an interview affected the efficiency of the USDA since Mr. Curry's involvement was of principal importance to its investigation. <span class="Italic">See Weston v. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev.</span>, 724 F.2d 943, 949 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The Board properly found that Mr. Curry had extensive involvement in the contracting issue that was being investigated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board properly determined that the penalty of removal was appropriate. As stated above, this court cannot overturn a penalty unless this court determines it is wholly unwarranted in light of all the relevant factors. <span class="Italic">Guise</span>, 330 F.3d at 1382. These factors are set out in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981). Here, the Board properly considered these factors, including the fact that Mr. Curry had 15 years of exemplary service prior to this incident. However, the Board noted that "the appellant acted intentionally and with full knowledge that he could be removed when he failed to attend the December 16th interview."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Failure to cooperate in an investigation justified removal of an agricultural specialist, despite claimed disparities in treatment of the appellant, <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. DHS</span>, 117 MSPR 384, 389-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-16, 2012 MSPB 19 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that, although the agency regarded failure to cooperate in an agency investigation a serious offense, mitigation was appropriate because: (1) the agency did not allege or show that the appellant's offense had any notoriety, or explain how his offense would impair his ability to perform his job in the satisfactory manner; (2) there was no reason to believe the appellant would in the future refuse to cooperate in an agency investigation; (3) the appellant was acting on the misguided advice of his attorney in deciding to end his cooperation with the internal affairs investigators; (4) although the investigators assured him that their investigation was administrative rather than criminal in nature, the appellant had recently been interviewed by law enforcement agencies and he may well have been confused about the possibility of incriminating himself; and (5) the agency does not always remove employees for the offense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The nature and seriousness of the appellant's offense, however, is the most significant factor in a penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Edwards,</span> 116 M.S.P.R.173, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of Transportation,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 153, &#x00B6; 13 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 224 Fed. Appx. 974 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In this regard, the charge is a serious one, and both the courts and the Board have held that removal from employment is an appropriate penalty for failure to cooperate with an investigation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Weston v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 724 F.2d 943, 950-51 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (declining to mitigate a removal for refusing to cooperate in an investigation); <span class="Italic">Negron v. Department of Justice,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 561, &#x00B6; 34 (2004) (even where not all charges were sustained, removal was the appropriate penalty for the single sustained charge of failure to cooperate during an official investigation in light of the seriousness of the offense and the impact the appellant's misconduct had on the agency's trust and confidence in him, and where the appellant had only 8 years of service); <span class="Italic">see also Sher v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 488 F.3d 489, 509 (1st Cir. 2007) ("Courts have repeatedly held that removal from employment is justified for failure to cooperate with an investigation.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the seriousness of the charge, consideration of the other relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors does not render removal outside the bounds of reasonableness under the circumstances of this case. As stated above, the administrative judge concluded that there was no reason to believe the appellant would refuse to cooperate in an agency investigation in the future. However, the basis for this conclusion is significantly undermined by the agency's evidence that the appellant eventually supplied misleading information in response to the agency's request for documentation concerning the appellant's alleged trip to Houston in 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even assuming that the appellant may have been acting on the misguided advice of his attorney or may have confused the agency's internal investigation with an earlier criminal investigation, an appellant is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative<span class="Italic">. Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981). Thus, in <span class="Italic">Weston,</span> the court declined to mitigate a removal on the grounds that the appellant had relied on the erroneous advice of her counsel in refusing to cooperate in an investigation. 724 F.2d at 950-51. Further, the appellant here received clear notice that the investigation was administrative in nature and not related to any criminal misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency concedes on review that it has not always removed employees for this offense. To establish disparate penalties, though, the appellant must show that the charges and the circumstances surrounding the charged behavior are substantially similar. <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 404, 407 (1983). Establishing that the charges and circumstances surrounding the charged behavior are substantially similar may include proof that the proffered comparison employee was in the same work unit, was with the same supervisor, was subjected to the same standards governing discipline, and faced discipline close in time to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 12 (2010). Other relevant considerations in a disparate penalty analysis may include whether the difference in treatment was knowing and intentional, whether an agency began levying a more severe penalty for a certain offense without giving notice of a change in policy, and whether an imposed penalty is appropriate for the sustained charges. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 15 n.4 (citing <span class="Italic">Williams v. Social Security Administration</span>, 586 F.3d 1365, 1368-69 <span id="Page_2633"></span>(Fed. Cir. 2009)). When an employee raises an allegation of disparate penalties in comparison to specified employees, the agency must prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by a preponderance of the evidence before the penalty can be upheld. <span class="Italic">Woebcke v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 20 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge noted that in one case, the agency had mitigated a supervisory agricultural specialist's penalty for a single charge of failing to cooperate in an agency investigation to a 15-day suspension based on his 36 years of service with no prior discipline. Similarly, the comparator employee indicated he would not answer any questions without his attorney present. According to the letter of decision in that case, however, the deciding official considered the employee's claim that, as a former employee of the Department of Agriculture, he may not have been fully acquainted with different agency procedures covering employees who are under investigation. Once that employee understood the procedures, he offered to fully cooperate in the investigation, which the deciding official reasonably regarded as evidence of the employee's ability to rehabilitate himself even though the offer came after the investigation had closed. The present appellant, however, never claimed to be unaware of his obligation to cooperate with the agency's investigation, and there is nothing in the record indicating that he later offered to cooperate. Indeed, unlike the former Agriculture Department employee-comparator, the appellant here provided only misleading information. The agency therefore established legitimate reasons for the difference in treatment of the appellant under the circumstances of this case. <span class="Italic">See Woebcke</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, this case bears many similarities to the other two instances in which the agency removed employees for similar misconduct. Although both of the employees who were removed were law enforcement officers and had significantly fewer years of service, distinctions from the case now before the Board, this evidence nonetheless shows the agency has removed employees in cases with similar factual backgrounds. In sum, the agency's imposition of a 15-day suspension in one case provides some basis for the imposition of a penalty less than removal. However, given the distinctions between that one case and the current appeal, without more, the record does not support the administrative judge's conclusion that a 15-day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty. Accordingly, we conclude that the agency's chosen penalty, removal, is the maximum reasonable penalty under the circumstances of this case. The agency's removal action is SUSTAINED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Failure of an employee to cooperate in an investigation into her misconduct, after being given proper immunity and warnings in a fair investigation, justified removal. The charges being investigated were serious breaches of agency standards of conduct. No lesser penalty would enable the agency to secure compliance with its investigative requirements. Not credited was the argument that the penalty should be mitigated because the appellant received incorrect advice from counsel. <span class="Italic">Weston v. DHUD</span>, 14 MSPR 321, 326 (1983). The result was affirmed. <span class="Italic">Weston v. DHUD</span>, 724 F.2d 943, 950 (Fed. Cir. 1983), opined that "[a] large enterprise cannot be managed effectively absent a willingness of its members to support its internal fact-finding endeavors." Per the court, "[w]e can think of few less serious first offenses than a refusal to cooperate in an agency investigation of abuse of office when criminal immunity has been granted." That the employee refused to cooperate on the basis of advice of counsel was not persuasive. The employee is accountable for the conclusions of designated counsel to the extent that she acceded to those conclusions or permitted the attorney to act in her stead. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hankins v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-0752-13-0423-I-1 (NP 9/8/2014) (charge of "Failure to cooperate in a properly authorized investigation": "In the notice of proposed removal, the agency explained that the appellant was evasive, refused to answer questions directly, and failed to provide candid and complete answers to the interview questions.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Representations concerning immunity from prosecution that were sufficiently clear permitted the agency to insist on cooperation with an investigatory inquiry, on the pain of discharge, <span class="Italic">Sher v. VA</span>, 97 MSPR 232, 236-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-13 (2004) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Sher v. VA</span>, 488 F.3d 489 (1st Cir. 2007), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency charged that on July 11, 2001, the appellant refused to provide information to an agent from the agency's Inspector General's office in relation to an administrative investigation, which violated Part O, Standards of Ethical Conduct and Related Responsibilities, Subpart B of 38 [C.F.R.] paragraph 0.735-12. According to the January 30, 2001 report filed by agency police officer Ralph McFee, Human Resources Chief James Schillinger and District Counsel Carol Moore informed the police by telephone that they had received information that the appellant had received a large amount of prescription drugs from a drug representative. The officers investigated and found the appellant in possession of the 672 Lipitor tablets. The officers filled out an "Evidence or Property Custody Record" form for the drugs. According to the report, the U.S. Attorney was notified, no charges were filed, and the case remained open pending further investigation. Special Agent Timothy Bond from the agency's Office of Inspector General investigated the incident. His April 18, 2001 Report of Investigation cites 18 U.S.C. section 201, part C--Bribery/Gratuity Statutes, as the criminal statute implicated by the appellant's receipt of the Lipitor samples. In a June 18, 2001 Supplemental Report of Investigation, Bond stated that the U.S. Attorney "declined this case for criminal prosecution."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 28, 2001, Chief of Staff Timothy Richardson sent the appellant a memorandum informing him that he was scheduled to be interviewed by Bond on July 10, 2001, that the U.S. Attorney had declined criminal prosecution in the matter before the Inspector General, that the matter was now an administrative investigation, and that he was entitled to a representative of his choice. Richardson quoted from the Code of Federal Regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Employees will furnish information and testify freely and honestly in cases respecting employment and disciplinary matters. Refusal to testify, concealment of material facts, or willfully inaccurate testimony in connection with an investigation or hearing may be ground for disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a July 2, 2001 letter in reply, the appellant requested that the interview be rescheduled because he was on annual leave until July 11, and his attorney, Sumner Lipman, was out of his office until July 15. The appellant received a memorandum rescheduling the interview for July 11, and otherwise repeating the information in the June 28 memorandum. Keith Varner, an attorney in practice with Lipman, telephoned Human Resources Chief Schillinger to attempt to reschedule the interview so that Lipman could attend, but had no success.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appeared for the July 11 interview with Varner. They again protested having the interview without the appellant's designated representative and expressed concern that the appellant could be forced to incriminate himself. District Counsel Moore offered to seek a letter from the U.S. Attorney with any language specified by the appellant. The letter was sent by facsimile with the requested language, but the appellant and Varner were not sufficiently reassured. The attempted interview was cancelled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Weston v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 724 F.2d 943, 947-48 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The fifth amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination may be asserted in an administrative investigation to protect against any disclosure that an individual reasonably believes could be used in his own criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used. <span class="Italic">Kastigar v.</span> United States, 406 U.S. 441, 444-45, 92 S. Ct. 1653, 1656, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212 (1972). In addition, the threat of removal from one's position constitutes coercion which renders any statements elicited thereby inadmissible in criminal proceedings against the party so coerced. <span class="Italic">Garrity v. New Jersey</span>, 385 U.S. 493, 500, 87 S. Ct. 616, 620, 17 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1967). Nevertheless, when an employee is once granted immunity through this so-called <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> exclusion rule, he may be removed for failure to cooperate with an agency investigation. <span class="Italic">Gardner v. Broderick</span>, 392 U.S. 273, 278, 88 S. Ct. 1913, 1916, 20 L. Ed. 2d. 1082 (1968); <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass'n v. Commissioner of Sanitation</span>, 392 U.S. 280, 284-85, 88 S. Ct. 1917, 1919-20, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1089 (1968). Invocation of the <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> rule for compelling answers to pertinent questions about the performance of an employee's duties is adequately accomplished when that employee is duly advised of his options to answer under the immunity granted or remain silent and face dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Weston</span>, 724 F.2d at 947-48. The court applied this analysis to the facts in <span class="Italic">Weston</span> and found that the agency had properly removed the employee for refusing to cooperate in an agency investigation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 948. The court found it significant that the employee was "informed that (1) criminal prosecution against her had been declined by the United States Attorney, (2) no information gained from the interview could be used against her in a criminal proceeding, and (3) her failure to cooperate could subject her to...disciplinary action, specifically including removal from employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 946. The employee in <span class="Italic">Weston</span> had her attorney with her when she received a copy of the statement advising her of her rights, and she declined to answer. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court found that, having been advised of the invocation of the <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> rule, her refusal to participate in the investigation was not justifiable out of any valid fifth amendment considerations and that the charge was correctly sustained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 948.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More recently, in <span class="Italic">Modrowski v</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 252 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the court again addressed the application of the <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> rule and found that the scope of the immunity granted to Modrowski was ambiguous because the letter informing him that the U.S. Attorney declined to prosecute was written on agency letterhead, did not expressly grant immunity, and only covered some of the actions that the agency was investigating. <span class="Italic">Modrowski</span>, 252 F.3d at 1351. The court also relied on the fact that Modrowski had no opportunity to meet with his attorney to discuss the letter and the scope of the immunity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1352. It found that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in charging the appellant with a refusal to cooperate, setting forth these dispositive factors:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2634"></span>(1) the agency was admittedly investigating Modrowski for criminal violations; (2) the purported grant of immunity had ambiguous scope; (3) statements elicited under the alleged grant of immunity could conceivably be used against Modrowski in related criminal proceedings; (4) there was no formal assurance from the agency that the criminal investigation had terminated; (5) Modrowski was faced with the penalty of removal for failure to cooperate; (6) Modrowski timely arranged to meet with an attorney; and (7) there is no allegation that Modrowski's request was unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court distinguished <span class="Italic">Modrowski</span> from <span class="Italic">Weston</span>, stating that in <span class="Italic">Weston</span> there was no allegation that the scope of protection conferred by the U.S. Attorney's declination to prosecute was ambiguous and the employee had full access to counsel. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1352-53.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">Weston</span> and <span class="Italic">Modrowski</span>, the agency's inquiry began as a criminal investigation. Also, there was no explicit grant of immunity. However, in the June 28 letter, the agency informed the appellant that the U.S. Attorney "declined criminal prosecution in the matter before the Inspector General" and "[t]he matter is therefore an administrative investigation." Thus, the agency informed him that its criminal investigation had terminated. Moreover, the letter sent by facsimile corroborated the agency's statement that the U.S. Attorney declined to prosecute the appellant. It stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This is to confirm that on March 7, 2001, this office declined criminal prosecution of [the appellant] in favor of administrative action. The conduct for which [the appellant] was being considered for prosecution was his request and receipt of drug samples (specifically Lipitor) in August of 2000 and in January and February of 2001.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only ambiguity concerns the dates of the misconduct. The letter did not mention the June 2000 "Free Goods Requisition" form, and there were no allegations that the appellant requested or received drug samples in February 2001. The appellant argues that the letter from the U.S. Attorney contains an ambiguity that put him in reasonable fear that he remained subject to prosecution. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the letter from the U.S. Attorney was sufficient to provide the appellant with "use" immunity[2] from prosecution under the <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> rule based on any statement that he made during any subsequent interview regarding "the conduct for which [the appellant] was being considered for prosecution." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Unlike the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Modrowski</span>, there was no other activity that the agency was investigating. Furthermore, in contrast to the facts in <span class="Italic">Modrowski</span>, the assurance came from the U.S. Attorney and not merely from the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;"Use" immunity is defined as "[i]mmunity from the use of the compelled testimony (or any information derived from that testimony) in a future prosecution against the witness." Black's Law Dictionary 754 (7th Ed. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More important, in contrast to the employee in <span class="Italic">Modrowski</span>, who had never spoken to an attorney about the matter, the appellant had access to an attorney. He had the services of his named representative Lipman since February 2000. On July 11, he had the advice of Varner, a licensed attorney, albeit not one experienced in criminal law. Additionally, he had the advice of Lipman by telephone on July 11. Considering these circumstances, we find that the appellant had no right to decline to be interviewed on July 11, and the agency correctly charged him with failing to provide information in an administrative investigation. Accordingly, we sustain the charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal through the mixed case process, the result on the <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> issue in <span class="Italic">Sher</span> was affirmed, over the dissent of Senior Circuit Judge Stahl, in <span class="Italic">Sher v. VA</span>, 488 F.3d 489, 494-506 (1st Cir. 2007), considering the legal implications of <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> and the practical implications of the availability of counsel to advise the employee who was being investigated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VA initiated an investigation of Sher's activities related to sampling. Under 38 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 0.735-12(b), federal employees must furnish information with respect to employment and disciplinary matters unless to do so would be self-incriminating. On February 1, VA Investigator Timothy Bond interviewed Sher, who admitted receiving free samples of Lipitor from Pfizer sales representatives. Having retained attorney Sumner Lipman to represent him, Sher attempted, unsuccessfully, to contact Lipman by phone during the interview. The parties dispute the events that took place at this interview. Sher asserts that, although he agreed to participate in the interview, he did so only because Bond gave him no choice. For its part, the VA contends that Bond informed Sher of his rights under <span class="Italic">Garrity,</span> 385 U.S. 493, 87 S. Ct. 616, 17 L. Ed.2d 562, at the meeting, and that Sher subsequently consented to the interview.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bond presented the case against Sher to the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Maine for consideration for criminal prosecution. On March 7, the U.S. Attorney's Office verbally declined prosecution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 5, Bond again attempted to interview Sher without Lipman present. The parties agree that Sher unsuccessfully tried to reach Lipman by phone during the interview, but the record offers no other information about the events that took place at this interview.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a letter dated June 28, 2001, Togus Chief of Staff Timothy Richardson notified Sher that an administrative interview had been scheduled for July 10. The letter informed Sher that "the United States Attorney of the District of Maine has declined criminal prosecution in the matter before the Inspector General," that "the matter is therefore an administrative investigation," that he was "entitled to the representative of his choice," that federal regulations require employees to "furnish information...in cases respecting employment and disciplinary matters," and that "[r]efusal...may be ground for disciplinary action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated July 2, Sher asked to reschedule the interview because he had planned to be on vacation until July 11 and his attorney, Sumner Lipman, was unavailable until July 15. Acting on behalf of Togus Director John Sims, Schillinger rescheduled the interview for July 11, thereby effectively refusing Sher's request to have his preferred representative present. The letter rescheduling the interview, dated July 2, reiterated that the U.S. Attorney's Office had declined criminal prosecution, that the issue was now an administrative matter, that Sher was obliged by regulation to provide information, and that he could be disciplined if he refused.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 11, Sher appeared with attorney Keith Varner, a partner of Lipman, for the interview with Investigator Bond. VA Counsel Moore also attended the meeting. Varner requested that they postpone the interview until July 13 to allow Lipman to attend. Moore refused the request. Varner also expressed his concern that the interview would expose Sher to criminal liability. In an attempt to address this concern, Moore obtained, by fax, a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maine declining prosecution. The letter from First Assistant United States Attorney William H. Browder stated, in its entirety:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On March 7, 2001, this office declined criminal prosecution of Mr. Sher in favor of administrative action. The conduct for which Mr. Sher was being considered for prosecution was his request and receipt of drug samples (specifically Lipitor) in August of 2000 and January and February of 2001.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After reviewing this fax, Varner consulted with Lipman by phone. Lipman was concerned that the letter still left Sher at risk of criminal prosecution, and Sher ultimately declined to be interviewed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the result of its investigation, the VA subsequently sustained administrative charges against Sher for soliciting Lipitor on five occasions between June 2000 and January 2001 and for receiving and possessing 672 individual samples of Lipitor on January 29, 2001, all in violation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635. The VA also sustained a charge of failure to cooperate with an administrative investigation, in violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 0.735-12. As punishment for these violations, Sims imposed a forty-five day suspension and demoted Sher from his position as Chief Pharmacist, with a corresponding reduction in pay grade from GS-13 to GS-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the result of his refusal to answer questions on July 11, 2001, the VA charged Sher with failure to cooperate with its investigation into his alleged improper sampling in violation of 38 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 0.735-12(b). The VA contends that Sher had no legal basis for his refusal to cooperate. It notes that Sher was represented by Varner at the interview and had access to his first choice counsel, Lipman, by phone. The VA also emphasizes that it informed Sher and his attorneys orally and in writing that criminal prosecution had been declined and that the investigation was purely administrative. Sher argues that he had legitimate reasons for refusing to answer questions because the letter stated only that the U.S. Attorney had declined to prosecute as of a certain date, not that it conferred immunity; the dates in the letter did not match the dates that he sought Lipitor; and the VA did not reschedule the interview so that Lipman could be present. The question before us, therefore, is whether the MSPB was arbitrary and capricious in upholding the failure to cooperate charge on the ground that Sher had no legal basis for refusing to answer the questions posed to him.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Immunity Under <span class="Italic">Garrity</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Garrity v. New Jersey,</span> 385 U.S. 493, 499, 87 S. Ct. 616, 17 L. Ed.2d 562 (1967), the Supreme Court considered whether the government "can use the threat of discharge to secure incriminatory evidence against an employee." <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> involved an investigation by the Attorney General of New Jersey into alleged irregularities in the handling of cases in which the appellant police officers were told that if they did not answer questions, they would be subject to removal from office. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 494, 87 S. Ct. 616. After the police officers answered the questions, their statements were used in a subsequent prosecution against them. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 495, 87 S. Ct. 616. After noting that "[t]he option to lose their means of livelihood or to pay the penalty of self-incrimination is the antithesis of free choice to speak out or to remain silent," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 497, 87 S. Ct. 616, the Court held unconstitutional the "use in subsequent criminal proceedings of statements obtained under threat of removal from office," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 500, 87 S. Ct. 616.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2635"></span>Subsequently, the Court held that <span class="Italic">Garrity</span>'s prohibition on the use of statements made under threat of adverse employment action also means that if an employee</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">refuse[s] to answer questions specifically, directly, and narrowly relating to the performance of his official duties, without being required to waive his immunity with respect to the use of his answers or the fruits thereof in a criminal prosecution of himself, the privilege against self-incrimination would not [be] a bar to his dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Gardner v. Broderick,</span> 392 U.S. 273, 278, 88 S. Ct. 1913, 20 L. Ed.2d 1082 (1968) (internal footnote and citation omitted). Thus, together, <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> and <span class="Italic">Gardner</span> stand for the proposition that a government employee who has been threatened with an adverse employment action by her employer for failure to answer questions put to her by her employer receives immunity from the use of her statements or their fruits in subsequent criminal proceedings, and, consequently, may be subject to such an adverse employment action for remaining silent. Importantly, the employee is not guaranteed transactional immunity. Rather, "the United States is prohibited from using the testimony or its fruits, and...this degree of prohibition is enough." <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation Men v. Comm'r of Sanitation,</span> 426 F.2d 619, 624 n.2 (2d Cir. 1970).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee is confronted with the threat of an adverse employment action for refusal to answer questions, "the very act of...telling the witness that he would be subject to removal if he refused to answer was held to have conferred such immunity." <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation Men,</span> 426 F.2d at 626.11 Under these circumstances, no specific grant of immunity is necessary: "It is the very fact that the testimony was compelled which prevents its use in subsequent proceedings, not any affirmative tender of immunity." <span class="Italic">Gulden v. McCorkle,</span> 680 F.2d 1070, 1075 (5th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">see also United States v. Veal,</span> 153 F.3d 1233, 1239 n.4 (11th Cir. 1998) ("The Fifth Amendment protection afforded by <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> to an accused who reasonably believes that he may lose his job if he does not answer investigation questions is Supreme Court-created and self-executing; it arises by operation of law; no authority or statute needs to grant it.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the letters that Sher received from the VA on June 28 and July 2 quoted regulations stating that "[e]mployees will furnish information and testify freely and honestly in cases respecting employment and disciplinary matters. Refusal to testify...in connection with an investigation or hearing may be ground for disciplinary action." This notification was a threat of removal sufficient to constitute coercion under <span class="Italic">Garrity</span>. Under such conditions, Sher's statements and their fruits would be inadmissible in subsequent criminal prosecutions <span class="Italic">regardless</span> of the subsequent letter faxed from the U.S. Attorney's Office stating that the office had declined prosecution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We emphasize this point to clarify an apparent misconception by both the MSPB and Sher. In its decision, the MSPB stated that "we find that the letter from the U.S. Attorney was sufficient to provide the appellant with `use' immunity from prosecution under the <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> rule." Similarly, Sher's brief refers to the letter's "failure to confer immunity." These statements incorrectly suggest that the letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office was the source of any immunity. As a matter of law, the immunity attached automatically when Sher faced the loss of his job for refusal to testify, and the letter served at most to notify Sher of the existing immunity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sher thus had no basis under the Fifth Amendment for refusing to answer the VA's questions. However, in assessing the propriety of the failure to cooperate charge, we still must consider whether Sher received adequate notice from his employer of his immunity under <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> to justify the failure to cooperate charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Notice of <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> Immunity</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of whether an employee has adequate notice of his immunity under <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> to justify a failure to cooperate charge arises because the consequences of <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> immunity are not self-evident. As the Seventh Circuit has observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Uncounselled persons are much more likely to know about their "Fifth Amendment" right than they are to know about an immunity that qualifies the right. Asked to give answers to questions put to them in the course of an investigation of their arguably criminal conduct, they may instinctively "take the Fifth" and by doing so unknowingly set themselves up to be fired without recourse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Atwell v. Lisle Park Dist.,</span> 286 F.3d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 2002). Thus, to provide adequate notice of immunity under <span class="Italic">Garrity,</span> a government employer might have to explain two concepts. First, the employer might have to explain that the threat of an adverse employment action for a failure to answer questions means, as a matter of Fifth Amendment law, that the employee's statements and their fruits may not be used in subsequent criminal proceedings. We refer to this concept as the "application of <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> immunity." Second, the employer might have to explain that the employee, now afforded the self-incrimination protection of the Fifth Amendment by operation of law, may be subject to adverse employment action for remaining silent. We refer to this concept as the "consequences of <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> immunity."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The circuits have taken different approaches to the issue of whether a government employer is required to provide such notice to an employee. The Seventh Circuit has indicated that a government employer has an affirmative duty to apprise an employee of both the application and consequences of <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> immunity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Our court has ruled in several cases that the government employer who wants to ask an employee potentially incriminating questions must first warn him that because of the immunity to which the cases entitle him, he may not refuse to answer the questions on the ground that the answers may incriminate him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Atwell,</span> 286 F.3d at 990. Similarly, the Federal Circuit has held that "[i]nvocation of the <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> rule for compelling answers to pertinent questions about the performance of an employee's duties is adequately accomplished when that employee is <span class="Italic">duly advised</span> of his options to answer under the immunity granted or remain silent and face dismissal." <span class="Italic">Weston,</span> 724 F.2d at 948 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other circuits have been less directive. In <span class="Italic">Gulden,</span> the Fifth Circuit found that a municipality did not have to make "an affirmative tender of immunity...prior to an employee's appearance at a polygraph exam." 680 F.2d at 1075. Although the court referred to a <span class="Italic">tender</span> of immunity, the context of this phrase indicates that the court actually meant that the employer need not <span class="Italic">advise</span> the employee of the immunity conferred by <span class="Italic">Garrity.</span> However, because the employees did not actually show up for their interview, the court held that "the inquiry had not advanced to a level of specificity in which the competing concerns of immunity could be properly addressed," and, consequently, that "no affirmative duty (if any such duty may ever be found) had devolved upon the employer to advise [the employees] that immunity was available." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1076.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Hester v. City of Milledgeville,</span> the Eleventh Circuit indicated by omission that it recognized no duty of the employer to advise the employee of the application and consequences of <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> immunity. It stated: "We fail, however, to see how the city's failure to offer the plaintiffs use immunity could make any constitutional difference.... Such a guarantee would serve no useful purpose." 777 F.2d 1492, 1496 (11th Cir. 1985). The court then explained that "any grant of use immunity to the plaintiffs would have been duplicative." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Gulden,</span> 680 F.2d at 1073-76). The court's statement that offering immunity would serve no purpose and its silence as to any duty of the employer to provide notice indicate a view that the employer has no such duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This disagreement among the circuits notwithstanding, no circuit has held that an employee who is represented by counsel is entitled to notice from his employer of his <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> immunity. In <span class="Italic">Atwell</span>, the Seventh Circuit considered a situation in which an attorney for a municipality had told an employee under investigation that her attorney would probably instruct her to remain silent. 286 F.3d at 989. After consulting with her attorney, the employee refused to be interviewed and was terminated for insubordination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> While acknowledging its rule that employers must explain to employees the nature of their immunity under <span class="Italic">Garrity,</span> the court suggested that the justification for such a duty is most compelling for unrepresented employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 990. The court specifically left open the question of "whether, in light of its rationale, [the Seventh Circuit's rule that an employer has a duty to warn an employee of his immunity under <span class="Italic">Garrity</span>] has any possible application when the employee has a lawyer" and emphasized that the employee "was not being asked to meet with the investigator in the absence of her lawyer." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 991. However, the court ultimately concluded that, because the employee did not actually attend the interview, the municipality had not violated her rights by failing to warn her about her immunity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit also has deemed representation by a lawyer significant. In <span class="Italic">Modrowski v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 252 F.3d 1344, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the VA had investigated an employee for violating rules prohibiting the unauthorized sale of VA-owned property to close family members. The employee received a letter on VA letterhead stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;The U.S. Attorney has been apprised of the situation, granted you immunity and has declined to prosecute you in the matter of the purchase of two properties by Ronald Perzanowski. 2. You are hereby notified your assertion of your Fifth Amendment rights is unnecessary since you will not be prosecuted. 3. You are therefore ordered to respond to my questions concerning this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1347. After the employee refused to answer questions until he could meet with his attorney, the VA charged him with failure to cooperate in the investigative proceedings, and ultimately he was removed from his position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1348. The court concluded that it was arbitrary and capricious to charge an employee for failing to cooperate with an investigation "[i]n the limited circumstances of the present case," noting several "dispositive factors," including the ambiguity of the scope of immunity, the existence of pending criminal proceedings on a different <span id="Page_2636"></span>but related matter, and the agency's acknowledgment that it would have been reasonable to allow Modrowski to consult with counsel. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1352. The court specifically stated that it did not reach the question of "whether Modrowski had an absolute right to counsel" and that it did not "hold that all federal employees who are called to respond to questions in an agency investigation have the right to delay proceedings to obtain legal counsel." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the circuits have reached different conclusions about the notice, if any, that the government employer must give to an unrepresented employee about his <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> immunity. However, no court has held that the government employer must give notice of Garrity immunity to an employee represented by counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D.&#x2003;Sher's Circumstances</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying this authority to Sher's circumstances, our inquiry is limited to determining whether the MSPB acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it concluded that the VA properly charged Sher with failure to cooperate. In the circumstances of this case, we do not have to decide whether the VA as employer had to give Sher notice of the application and consequences of his <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> immunity. Regardless of whether there was any duty, Sher may be fairly charged with such notice under the circumstances present here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we agree with Sher that the VA's conduct in refusing to delay the interview so that Lipman could attend was not exemplary, we cannot conclude that Sher was effectively without legal representation. Sher's brief emphasizes that the June 28 and July 2, 2001 letters from the VA stated that Sher was "entitled to a representative of [his] choice." Sher had been represented by Lipman since February 2001 and was accompanied to the interview by Varner, an attorney who had been practicing since 1979 (albeit not in criminal law). Varner consulted with Lipman on the phone during the interview. As the district court noted, it is unclear what more Lipman could have done if he had been present at the interview. Without doubt, Sher's request to delay the interview for a few days so that Lipman could attend in person was not unreasonable; the agency had already waited four months to take administrative action. Nonetheless, with Varner present and Lipman available by phone, we conclude that Sher had access to counsel of his choice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the June 28 and July 2, 2001 letters from the VA clearly contained a threat of removal sufficient to provide notice of the application of immunity under <span class="Italic">Garrity.</span> Subsequently, a July 25 letter from Lipman to Carol Moore, counsel for the VA--written after the July 11 interview but well before charges were filed against Sher on August 31--indicated that Lipman had a conversation with Moore in which she referred him to <span class="Italic">Weston,</span> 724 F.2d 943, and <span class="Italic">Hanna v. Department of Labor,</span> 18 Fed. Appx. 787 (Fed. Cir. 2001). As we explained in Section IV.C, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> <span class="Italic">Weston</span> held that an employee was duly advised of her immunity under <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> when she and her counsel were read a statement that the U.S. Attorney's office had declined prosecution, that her failure to answer questions could subject her to removal, and her statements and their fruits would not be used criminally. 724 F.2d at 948. <span class="Italic">Hanna</span> explained that, "[a]s a consequence of the directive compelling [the employee] to respond to questions at the interview under threat of removal, [the employee] was automatically entitled to use immunity for any statements made at the interview" and thus had no basis for refusing to answer questions. 18 Fed. Appx. at 791.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If Sher had not been represented by counsel, these communications from the VA may or may not have provided Sher with adequate notice to justify a failure to cooperate charge. We do not have to decide that issue here because of the involvement of counsel. Since Sher received the June 28 letter more than two weeks before the scheduled interview on July 11, his attorneys had sufficient time to explain to Sher that the automatic conferral of <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> immunity meant that he could answer the VA's questions without fear that his answers could be used against him in a criminal prosecution. Although Moore apparently had not referred Lipman to <span class="Italic">Weston</span> and <span class="Italic">Hanna</span> by the time of the July 11 interview, there was ample opportunity after she did so for his attorneys to advise Sher of consequences of his immunity and schedule another interview at which he could respond to questions prior to the filing of charges on August 31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under such circumstances, we hold that Sher may be fairly charged with adequate notice of his immunity under <span class="Italic">Garrity.</span> Thus, the MSPB was not arbitrary and capricious in sustaining the failure to cooperate charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The mistaken opinion of an attorney concerning the scope of immunity during an investigation led to an employee's failure to cooperate and ultimate discharge, sustained in <span class="Italic">Hanna v. Dept. of Labor</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3240):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Hanna appeared with his union representative and his attorney, William Schladt. At the outset of the interview, OIG agent Tracy Hapeman presented OIG form 117A to Dr. Hanna, told him it was his duty as a federal employee to answer questions, and asked him to acknowledge receipt of the form. The form was quite brief, consisting mainly of the following statement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You have a duty to reply to these questions and department disciplinary proceedings resulting in your discharge may be initiated as a result of your answers; however, neither your answers nor any information or evidence which is gained by reason of such statements can be used against you in any criminal proceedings, except that you may be subject to criminal prosecution for any false answers that you may knowingly give to the questions asked you. Your failure to answer questions or knowingly furnishing false and/or misleading information could be a basis for dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Schladt took the form from Ms. Hapeman before it reached Dr. Hanna. He testified that he looked at the form but did not read it in its entirety. Mr. Schladt then asked Ms. Hapeman for assurances that Dr. Hanna's testimony could not be used against him in a criminal prosecution. Ms. Hapeman responded by tendering the October 6, 1998, letter reflecting the United States Attorney's decision not to prosecute Dr. Hanna. Mr. Schladt then said that the letter was not sufficient, and Dr. Hanna thereafter refused to answer any questions asked by the OIG agents. The Department of Labor subsequently removed Dr. Hanna for refusing to obey an order to report for an investigative interview in the fall of 1998 and refusing to cooperate with an investigative interview on March 26, 1999. Dr. Hanna appealed the removal action and the case was assigned to an arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Hanna's principal argument on appeal is that he was not adequately assured that his statements at the March 26, 1999, interview would not be used against him in a criminal prosecution. That argument fails in light of the express findings of the arbitrator as to events that occurred at the outset of the interview. The arbitrator concluded that OIG form 117A, which was given to Dr. Hanna and his attorney at the meeting, contained a clear and unambiguous statement that nothing Dr. Hanna said at the interview could be used against him in a criminal proceeding. The arbitrator further concluded that Ms. Hapeman's usual practice of reading the form to the interviewee was interrupted by Dr. Hanna's lawyer, Mr. Schladt. Both of those findings are supported by substantial evidence. Ms. Hapeman testified that her normal procedure was to present the form to the interviewee and read it to the interviewee, but that Mr. Schladt had taken the form from her and had said that it was not necessary for her to read the form to Dr. Hanna. Moreover, Mr. Schladt admitted that he looked at the form but said that he did not study it. The form, which contains only 11 lines of text, is a model of clarity in setting forth that the interviewee was required to respond to the questioning, that the interviewee's responses could not be used against him in a criminal prosecution, and that a refusal to respond could result in disciplinary action, including removal. Under those circumstances, the arbitrator was justified in finding that if there was any confusion regarding the immunity granted to Dr. Hanna, it was caused by Mr. Schladt, not by the OIG agents. The arbitrator further concluded that Dr. Hanna was "fully responsible for failing to cooperate in the OIG investigation on March 26, 1999, despite the erroneous advice of counsel regarding the full protection of his privilege against self-incrimination," and we agree. <span class="Italic">See Weston v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev.</span>, 724 F.2d 943, 951 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (an employee "must be held accountable for the conclusions of [his] designated attorney to the extent that [he] acceded to those conclusions or permitted counsel to act in [his] stead").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Hanna focuses on the fact that in response to Mr. Schladt's request for assurance that Dr. Hanna would have immunity from prosecution, the OIG agents produced the letter written to the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland confirming the United States Attorney's decision not to prosecute Dr. Hanna. He argues that the letter was confusing because it did not provide an adequate guarantee of the constitutionally required immunity. Moreover, Dr. Hanna and his union representative testified that when Mr. Schladt objected that the letter was insufficient, one of the OIG agents responded, "That letter is all you are going to get."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is true that the letter did not ensure that Dr. Hanna could never be prosecuted in connection with the workers compensation claim, no such guarantee was required. Instead, all that was required was that he be given immunity from the use of his statements at the interview in any such prosecution. <span class="Italic">See Kastigar v. United States</span>, 406 U.S. 441, 449-53 (1972). OIG form 117A made clear that Dr. Hanna had that form of immunity. To the extent that Mr. Schladt overlooked the language of the form and focused on the letter to the United States Attorney, he was mistaken. As a consequence of the directive compelling Dr. Hanna to respond to questions at the interview under threat of removal, Dr. Hanna was automatically entitled to use immunity for any statements made at the interview, <span class="Italic">see Garrity v. New Jersey</span>, 385 U.S. 493, 500 (1966), an entitlement that was confirmed in plain terms by OIG form 117A, <span class="Italic">see Kalkines v. United States</span>, 473 F.2d 1391 (Ct. Cl. 1973).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the OIG agents could have done more to ensure that there was no doubt that Dr. Hanna was entitled to use immunity, there was substantial evidence to support the arbitrator's conclusion that any confusion about Dr. Hanna's legal situation was ultimately attributable to Mr. Schladt, <span id="Page_2637"></span>not to the OIG agents. The form given to Dr. Hanna and Mr. Schladt was straightforward and clear; the fact that Mr. Schladt declined Ms. Hapeman's offer to read the form and did not himself read it thoroughly or allow his client to read it is no basis for finding that the advice that the government agents gave Dr. Hanna was inadequate. Moreover, the references to the October 6, 1998, letter should not have confused Mr. Schladt, because that letter addressed the question whether there would be a criminal prosecution, not the separate question whether Dr. Hanna's statements could be used in any such prosecution. We therefore agree with the government that substantial evidence supports the arbitrator's finding that Dr. Hanna was adequately advised that the statements he made at the interview could not be used against him in any criminal prosecution. Dr. Hanna's refusal to respond to questioning, despite that advisement, was thus a valid ground for disciplining him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Dr. Hanna argues that the penalty of removal was unconscionably disproportionate to his offense and must be set aside. Our review on the issue of the choice of penalty is extremely narrow and the agency's exercise of discretion in this area is respected except in the most exceptional cases. <span class="Italic">See Schapansky v. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 735 F.2d 477, 484 (Fed. Cir. 1984). We have previously upheld the sanction of removal for refusal to cooperate in an agency investigation, <span class="Italic">see Weston</span>, 724 F.2d at 949-50, and we see no reason to depart from that precedent. In light of the <span class="Italic">Weston</span> case, we also decline to treat Dr. Hanna's reliance on the advice of his attorney, Mr. Schladt, as a mitigating factor. As noted above, the court explained in <span class="Italic">Weston</span> that an employee is responsible for actions taken on the advice of his designated counsel or by his counsel on his behalf. 724 F.2d at 915. Dr. Hanna's decision not to cooperate with the OIG investigation is therefore fully attributable to him, even though the decision may have been made on the advice of his counsel. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the arbitrator upholding the Department of Labor's decision to remove Dr. Hanna from his position with the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Failure to cooperate in an investigation is particularly serious for a law enforcement officer. The misconduct leads to "a loss of supervisors' confidence in [the appellant's] dependability and therefore to a significant breach in the employer-employee relationship." <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOJ</span>, 22 MSPR 92, 94 n.2 (1984). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Franklin v. DOJ</span>, 71 MSPR 583, 591 (1996) (mitigating removal of a correctional officer who once declined to provide information during the course of an investigation; <span class="Italic">Weston</span> was distinguished because in that case, the refusal to cooperate was "sustained and protracted"). The Board assesses the employee's alleged failure to cooperate with an investigation by viewing all the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Negron v.

<p class="Body-Text">Brief delays in complying with investigatory directives do not support adverse action unless there is prejudice to the agency. Adverse action was not sustained against an employee who declined to provide information to an investigator but who quickly provided the necessary information to another agency official, <span class="Italic">Milner v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency has not shown by preponderant evidence that an employee who is asked to furnish a statement on a matter and who prepares and signs his own statement dated the same day addressing that matter, and who submits that statement to an agency official, failed to cooperate in an investigation. The agency did not charge the appellant with unreasonable delay in furnishing the statement to Benov. <span class="Italic">See Mann v. Veterans Administration</span>, 27 MSPR 265, 266-67 (1985). Further, the agency did not allege in its removal proposal notice or before the Board that the appellant's signed letter to Benov explaining his refusal to work failed to address any questions that Celli asked or intended to ask him, or that the appellant refused to provide the agency with any additional information, if such information were needed and requested. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge erred by sustaining the charge of failure to cooperate in an agency investigation. <span class="Italic">Cf. Weston v.

<p class="Body-Text">Akin to cases involving refusal to cooperate in interrogations are refusals to supply documents to agency investigators. In <span class="Italic">Taylor v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 155, 162 (1991), the employee apparently collected statements from employees because he feared that he would need supporting evidence to rebut evidence that might result from an ongoing official agency investigation involving other employees. The appellant's refusal to supply the materials he compiled to the agency investigators supported disciplinary action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant collected the statements while he and the employees were on duty and the statements dealt with a Postal Service investigation. Thus there is no basis on which they can be found to be private information. The appellant had a duty to cooperate in the investigation and, as [to] agency material, surrender the statements to the investigators when requested....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Interference in the investigation of another employee, the appellant having apparently alerted the employee to an investigation into that employee's activities, warranted demotion to a nonsupervisory position. Removal was too harsh in light of other, unsustained charges and an excellent past record. <span class="Italic">Fowler v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 559, 563-64 (1987). The demotion was then set aside for lack of evidence of an investigation underpinning the charge of interference with an investigation. <span class="Italic">Fowler v. USPS</span> (Fed.

Violation by an employee of a supervisor's direction not to discuss an inquiry with other employees concerning misuse of government equipment was grounds for discipline in <span class="Italic">Von Muller v.

"It was not the appellant's place...to determine that the agency's investigation was unnecessary, and he had no right to address what he saw as a problem by committing deceptive acts and omissions in an attempt to thwart the agency's efforts." <span class="Italic">Simmons v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 99 MSPR 28, 37 &#x00B6; 18 (2005); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Gebhardt v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 99 MSPR 49 (2005) (companion case to <span class="Italic">Simmons</span>), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Gebhardt v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> 180 Fed. Appx. 951 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant did not interfere with an investigation by suggesting to the person being investigated that she seek legal advice when the target of the investigation was already aware that she was being investigated. The appellant did not provide her with any additional warning or disclosure. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 155, 160 (1991), noted, "[s]ince employees always have the right to seek legal advice, we cannot conclude that recommending that an employee who is already aware that they are under investigation seek such advice constitutes interference with the investigation," and continued:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the advice to Bonner that she need not answer any of the inspector's questions does constitute interference with the investigation. Employees have a duty to speak with agency investigators unless criminal proceedings are reasonably feared....&#8197;As a supervisor, the appellant owes a duty of loyalty to the agency, and thus it was improper for him to recommend to Bonner that she not talk with the investigators....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is unobjectionable if employees vehemently state to others, including subordinates, their belief that witnesses should tell the truth. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garst v. Dept. of Army</span>, 56 MSPR 371, 380-81 (1993) (supervisor could not be disciplined for telling employees that they should be truthful and honest, apparently in grievance proceedings; nothing in the appellant's statements had a chilling effect on the right of employees to grieve, appeal, file a complaint or exercise other protected rights if they did not allege untrue statements in the exercise of those rights). <span class="Italic">Alsedek v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 229, 237-39 (1993), expanded on <span class="Italic">Garst</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the administrative judge erred in finding that he intentionally attempted to influence and intimidate witnesses during the agency investigation. The appellant admitted making comments to his subordinates exhorting them to tell the truth and indicating that he would take action if the truth were not told. He maintains that his comments were not meant to intimidate. The administrative judge determined that the appellant's words, tone, and method of delivery combined to show that the appellant must have known that his employees would feel intimidated by his comments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2638"></span>The record shows that the appellant called an employee, Mr. Carattini, into his office, demanded information about the ongoing investigation into the charges of sexual harassment, and stated in an angry manner that Mr. Carattini had better have his facts straight because the appellant would file a civil suit if any disciplinary action resulted from the investigation. Mr. Carattini also felt that the appellant's attitude towards him changed for the worse after this conversation. The appellant made similar comments to two other employees, Mr. Dura and Ms. Eisaman, during a conversation in his office initiated by Ms. Eisaman, following her realization that the EEO report contained errors in her testimony. According to the testimony, the appellant, after first assuring these employees that he was not threatening them, told them that he was going to retain "some lawyers," and that he intended to make sure everyone told the truth. A third employee, Mr. Stouffer, overheard comments made by the appellant to another witness outside of the hearing room where he and others had been testifying concerning the appellant's conduct. According to Mr. Stouffer's testimony, the appellant told a witness that the testimony at the hearing had better be truthful and mentioned a possible civil suit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant had intentionally intimidated these witnesses, the administrative judge focused on the "demand" words used (the witnesses had "better tell the truth" and "better have their facts straight"), the angry tone, the timing and location of the comments (after calling an employee in to discuss the investigation, outside the hearing room, and after being told of errors in the EEO report), and the appellant's references to lawyers and the possible filing of a civil suit. She found that the appellant, as an articulate, experienced person in a position of authority over these witnesses, must have known that these comments would have an intimidating effect upon those witnesses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the initial decision was issued in this case, the Board has decided another case involving a charge of intimidation of witnesses which is factually similar to this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garst v. Department of the Army</span>, 56 MSPR 371 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Garst</span>, the appellant allegedly informed employees at a meeting that they could be subject to disciplinary action or a personal lawsuit if they caused a supervisor to lose a job or an opportunity for promotion because of untrue statements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 374. The agency charged that the appellant engaged in reprisal by intentionally interfering with the employees' exercise of their right to grieve, appeal, file a complaint, or exercise a right under 5 USC 7101. The Board found:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">that there was nothing improper in the appellant's statements to his subordinates and that, regardless of how emphatically and vigorously he made those statements, they could not reasonably be interpreted as a threat to employees whose allegations against supervisors or other employees were based on their honest beliefs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Garst</span>, 56 MSPR at 380-81.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, when a supervisor called an appellant at home to discuss "end-of-service termination options" following an initial decision sustaining the agency's action, the Board held that such conduct did not amount to intimidation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">West v. US Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 551, 560-61 (1990). The supervisor had not attempted to dissuade the appellant from filing a petition for review and had not intimated that adverse consequences would befall him if he did so. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the Board found that evidence showing that an agency representative had implied that an employee's sick leave record would be investigated should he testify unfavorably raised the spectre of intimidation of witnesses and warranted a remand to determine if the testimony had been tainted by such misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bowers v. US Postal Service</span>, 3 MSPR 562, 564-65 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant admonished his employees to tell the truth. Regardless of how vehemently this was done or in what setting, it does not amount to intimidation, as it was the duty of all parties to tell the truth. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garst</span>, 56 MSPR at 380. Furthermore, the appellant's comments regarding retaining an attorney and possibly filing a civil suit do not constitute intimidation. The appellant clearly has the right to take such actions, and it cannot have been a surprise to learn that he would hire an attorney to represent him in these proceedings. Although the witnesses may not have thought of the possibility of a civil suit, the appellant's informing his employees that he might take an action that is within his rights cannot be construed as intimidation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not contain evidence showing that the appellant suggested that an employee either not testify or not testify truthfully. Nor does it contain evidence showing that the appellant directed any personal threats toward an employee or intimated that adverse consequences would befall a particular employee should testimony be unfavorable. Thus, we find that the administrative judge erred in sustaining this charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency may conclude that an employee has improperly taken matters into his own hands by conducting an impromptu inquiry when an investigation, if called for, should have been undertaken by another individual or component of the agency. But in <span class="Italic">Asberry v. DOJ</span>, 62 MSPR 603, 607 (1994), the appellant related allegations or rumors of sexual misconduct among the staff and, in turn, the appellant was invited to talk to and produce witnesses and provide "specifics" and a list of names for further action. Having given the appellant this direction, the agency erred by then charging the employee with conducting an unauthorized investigation. <span class="Italic">Lowe v. DOJ</span>, 63 MSPR 73, 78-79 (1994), sustained a charge that an employee failed to follow an order not to contact a woman whom he allegedly sexually harassed; the order was given while the harassment allegations were being investigated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Levick v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 75 MSPR 84, 92 (1997) (discipline against an employee who compromised an investigation by violating instructions not to disclose information about the investigation to individuals outside his working group).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Parkinson v. DOJ</span>, SF-0752-13-0032-I-2 (NP 10/10/2014) (Vice Chairman Wagner dissenting on other grounds), remanded for penalty reconsideration and other reasons, <span class="Italic">Parkinson v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20160229174">815 F.3d 757</a> (Fed. Cir. 2016) (Judge Taranto dissented in part), upheld an adverse action based, in part, on a charge that the appellant interfered with or obstructed an ongoing investigation of him by contacting a witness to secure a statement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the agency proved this charge. The evidence in the record supports the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant intended to influence the OPR process when he met with the landlord and a member of his staff to agree on why the landlord wrote a check directly payable to the appellant. The appellant testified at the hearing on this charge as follows, "My intent was to sit down with [the landlord and a member of landlord's staff] and look at the documents which are appended to [the landlord's statement] and come to a meeting of the minds as to what actually occurred." The appellant met with the landlord to review and draft for the landlord a statement regarding expenses incurred nearly 3 years prior. The appellant drafted the document and worked with the landlord's staff member to type it up for the landlord's signature. This meeting occurred during the course of the OIG's investigation into the appellant's activities during the office build-out, and the appellant was not part of the OIG investigative team. Contrary to the appellant's argument, we find that the appellant did intend to influence the investigation as referenced by his hearing testimony that he intended to meet with the landlord so they could reach a common version of what actually occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency was required to prove that he actually obstructed the OPR process to prove the charge. We disagree. The agency code cited in the proposal notice as the basis for the charge provides that "an employee must refrain from '[t]aking any action to influence, intimidate, impede or otherwise obstruct the OPR process.'" Actual success in obstructing the process is not required. Therefore, if the agency proves by preponderant evidence that the appellant attempted to obstruct the OPR process, then the agency has proven the charge. <span class="Italic">See Parbs v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 559, &#x00B6; 8 (2007) (the agency is required to prove the charge as it is set out in the notice of proposed removal, and the charge is construed by examining the structure and language of the proposal and decision notice). Regardless, looking at the hearing transcript, it appears that the appellant, in fact, did obstruct the process. Less than 3 months after the landlord signed the statement that the appellant drafted, neither he nor his former bookkeeper could recall why a check for $1,215.67 was made out to the appellant. This contradicted the representation in the landlord's prior statement that this money was "to cover the cost of installing interior doors at the building." Thus, we find that the evidence proves that, more likely than not, the appellant's actions prevented OIG from obtaining the landlord's untainted recollections.</p>
