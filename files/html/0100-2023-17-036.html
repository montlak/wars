<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-37"><span class="space">7.</span> Classification Issue</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">"To be appealable as a RIF action, a personnel action must not only be included on the list of personnel actions at 5 CFR 351.201(a)(2), but it must also be effected for a legitimate reason to take a RIF as enumerated under that regulation." <span class="Italic">Vercelli v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 322, 326 (1996). Downgrades through reclassifications require analysis to determine when RIF protections and appeal rights apply. To understand the interrelation between RIF and the reclassification of positions, recall that OPM regulations essentially define RIF entitlements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 351.201(a)(2) (2022) explains as to use of RIF regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Each agency shall follow this part when it releases a competing employee from his or her competitive level by...demotion...when the release is required because of...reclassification of an employee's position [due] to erosion of duties when such action will take effect after an agency has formally announced a reduction in force in the employee's competitive area and when the reduction in force will take effect within 180 days.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Classification issues are also addressed by 5 CFR 351.202 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Coverage</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Actions excluded</span>. This part does not apply to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A change to lower grade based on the reclassification of an employee's position due to the application of new classification standards or the correction of a classification error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;A change to lower grade based on reclassification of an employee's position due to erosion of duties, except that this exclusion does not apply to such reclassification actions that will take effect after an agency has formally announced a reduction in force in the employee's competitive area and when the reduction in force will take effect within 180 days. This exception ends at the completion of the reduction in force.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to classification downgradings, grade retention is addressed by 5 CFR 536.201 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Subject to the requirements in this section and in &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 536.102 and 536.203, an agency must provide grade retention to an employee who moves from a position under a covered pay system to a lower-graded position under a covered pay system as a result of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A reclassification process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Pay retention is addressed by 5 CFR 536.301 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Subject to the requirements in &#x00A7; 536.102 and this section, an agency must provide pay retention to an employee who moves between positions under a covered pay system or from a position not under a covered pay system to a position under a covered pay system and whose payable rate of basic pay otherwise would be reduced (after application of any applicable geographic conversion under &#x00A7; 536.303(a)) as a result of--</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Additional guidance was provided by the late FPM Supp. 351-S2-4 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S2-4. RECLASSIFICATION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">c.&#x2003;Reclassification due to new standards or correction of error. If the grade of a position must be reduced because of the application of new OPM classification standards or the correction of classification error, RIF procedures are not applied. In these situations, the duties of the position do not change; the grade changes because of new standards or the correction of error. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM chapters 511, 536, and 752 for instructions on effecting these actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">d.&#x2003;Reclassification due to erosion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;This describes a situation where the grade of a position must be reduced because duties have gradually drifted away through an extended erosion process. In job erosion cases an evaluation of the position shows no proximate cause or determinable time for the change in duties. This contrasts with a reclassification due to reorganization where a planned change in duties has occurred in which the cause of reclassification and timeframe are clear, as for example when, at an identifiable time, a statute or agency procedure changed or expired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;In job erosion cases, the proper procedures for downgrading the employee depend on whether a RIF has been announced, and will take effect within 180 days, in the employee's competitive area. RIF procedures must be followed in job erosion reclassification actions when the downgrading action will take effect after an agency has formally announced a RIF in the employee's competitive area and when the RIF will occur within 180 days after the effective date of the downgrading action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;In determining whether RIF procedures are required, the agency considers announced RIFs. In this context, "announced" means that a general or specific RIF notice has been issued in the competitive area. Many times a RIF is a possibility that will not occur, so the agency may proceed with the downgrading due to erosion of duties without using RIF procedures unless an actual decision, as signified by the announcement, has been made to conduct a RIF. The purpose of the 180-day rule is to preclude reclassifications based on job erosion when RIF actions are pending.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Example: On January 15 an agency determined that the position of Employee X was overgraded due to erosion of duties and proposed the employee's downgrading to be effective on February 15. On January 20 the agency announced a RIF to take effect on April 1. In this instance, the agency must delay the downgrading action and correct the position grade as part of the RIF because the downgrading will occur within the 180 day period prior to an announced RIF. The employee would compete in the April 1 RIF to remain in his or her competitive level at the grade of the misclassified position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Example: An agency has obtained prior approval from OPM and on January 10 issued notices for a RIF to take effect on August 30. On January 15 the agency proposed the downgrading of Employee X due to erosion of duties to be effective on February 15. In this instance the agency may proceed with the downgrading action because it will occur more than 180 days before an announced RIF. RIF procedures are not required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Example: On January 15 an agency proposed the downgrading of Employee X due to erosion of duties; the action took effect on February 15. On April 1 the agency issued notices for a RIF to take effect on June 1. In this instance, no additional action is required. The downgrading took place before a RIF was announced even though the RIF occurred less than 180 days after the downgrading.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Reclassification actions due to job erosion that are not subject to RIF procedures are effected under the provisions of FPM chapters 511, 536, and 752.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Downgrading resulting from reclassification, if subject to pay and grade retention, is not a RIF and is not an action within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. MSPB</span>, 751 F.2d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1985). <span class="Italic">Knepp v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 709 F.2d 37, 38-39 (9th Cir. 1983), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners argue that under section 5366 the unappealable 'action which is the basis for the entitlement to benefits' of grade and pay retention is the reclassification of the position. In contrast, they argue, an individual employee's 'reduction in grade' is a separate action, and constitutes an 'adverse action' that is appealable to the MSPB under section 7512. In other words, petitioners concede that the general reclassification of a position is not appealable, but argue the specific individual's reduction in grade that follows the reclassification is appealable. Like the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">Atwell,</span> we are unpersuaded by this attempted distinction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 670 F.2d at 283. We agree with the thorough and well-reasoned analysis of <span class="Italic">Atwell.</span> <span class="Italic">Atwell</span> concluded from the language and statutory history of the Act that it was the intent of Congress to preclude appeals of individual downgradings when pay and grade retentions are available. We adopt that analysis and conclusion and agree the MSPB properly concluded that it had no jurisdiction to consider petitioners' appeals, based as they were on an 'action which is the basis of [their] entitlement' to grade and pay retention benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5366 (Supp. V 1981).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We are led to the conclusion that it was the intent of Congress to preclude appeals to the MSPB of individual downgradings where pay and grade retention are available. Thus, as a strict matter of logic, we conclude that a <span id="Page_3045"></span>reclassification decision that leads, at the end of pay and grade retention, to a reduction in grade is not an appealable action under the terms of section 7512. We readily acknowledge that an individual employee whose position is downgraded is negatively affected by the agency decision; at minimum, there is the present value loss of future earnings, and a variety of other consequential injuries. We believe, however, that it was the intent of Congress to eliminate individual appeals of the type brought by petitioners. To explain our holding more fully, it is necessary to move to a consideration of the impact of section 5366(b).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Stated as an exception to the RIF process is "a change to lower grade based on reclassification of an employee's position due to erosion of duties," subject to the proviso earlier noted in &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2). 5 CFR 351.202(c)(3) (2022). Also excluded is "[a] change to lower grade based on the reclassification of an employee's position due to the application of new classification standards or the correction of a classification error." 5 CFR 351.202(c)(2) (2022); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Vercelli v.

The agency's characterization of an action is not conclusive. A purported reclassification may be appealed if the action is either a disguised RIF or results in the delayed implementation of a reorganization. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Habdas v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 84 MSPR 412, 416 &#x00B6; 7 (1999) (requiring a jurisdictional hearing on conflicting assertions concerning the reasons for a reclassification downgrading: "A reclassification resulting from the delayed recognition of a reorganization is within the Board's jurisdiction, even when the reclassification occurs long after the reorganization."); <span class="Italic">Barry v.

Reclassifications made in delayed recognition of the effects of an earlier reorganization are considered within the Board's jurisdiction.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The interplay of appealable RIFs and nonappealable reclassifications was noted in <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Dept. of Army</span>, 41 MSPR 612, 617 n.3 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant cites testimony...to the effect that the change in the appellant's position resulted simply from a reclassification, and references by witnesses to the appellant's position being "upgraded." To begin with, the fact that the agency reclassified positions does not preclude a finding that a reorganization also occurred. Moreover...whether a reorganization occurred is determined not by consulting the labels attached to the action, but by examining the underlying evidence....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board provided a more elaborate explanation of the relation between RIFs and reclassifications in <span class="Italic">Boudreaux v. Dept. of Army</span>, 82 MSPR 393, 396-97 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5 (1999). The appellants were downgraded through reclassification, with grade and pay retention. They contended they were subjected to an appealable RIF. Although the AJ properly determined that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider claims of harmful error involving the reclassification process, the AJ should have given the appellants a hearing to resolve the jurisdictional issue of the application of RIF regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board [has] jurisdiction...over an appeal from an employee who has been demoted by a reduction-in-force (RIF) action, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901, and there are particular circumstances when an agency must use RIF procedures when it releases an employee from his competitive level by demotion. These circumstances include releases required because of lack of work, shortage of funds, insufficient personnel ceiling, reorganization, the exercise of reemployment rights or restoration rights, or reclassification of an employee's position due to an erosion of duties when such action will take effect after an agency has formally announced a RIF in the employee's competitive area and the RIF will take effect within 180 days. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2). However, a change to a lower grade based on the reclassification of an employee's position due to the application of new classification standards or the correction of a classification error is specifically excluded from the category of personnel actions requiring the application of RIF procedures. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.202(c)(2); <span class="Italic">see Vercelli v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 MSPR 322, 325 (1996). Thus, in determining whether the Board has jurisdiction over a reclassification downgrade as an appealable RIF demotion, the primary issue is the agency's motive. <span class="Italic">See Hardy v. Department of the Army</span>, 67 MSPR 292, 296-97 (1995). If the agency downgraded the appellants' positions due to new classification standards or the correction of a classification error, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the action. <span class="Italic">Saunders</span>, 757 F.2d at 1290. On the other hand, if the agency demoted the appellants for one of the reasons that require the use of RIF procedures, the demotions are appealable pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901. <span class="Italic">See Crum v. Department of the Navy</span>, 75 MSPR 75, 82 (1997) (a reclassification due to a reorganization is an appealable RIF demotion). Specifically, if the reclassification downgrade is due to the agency's delayed recognition of the effect of a prior reorganization, it is also an appealable RIF demotion. <span class="Italic">See Barry v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 74 MSPR 164, 170 (1997). Reorganization means the planned elimination, addition, or redistribution of functions or duties in an organization. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.203.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Each of the appellants alleged that their duties as program manager for their respective divisions were affected by a reorganization. Boudreaux alleged that in October, 1997, his division, Project Manager for Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (PM CATT) was reorganized, and that as a result, he was no longer responsible for certain financial duties associated with another Project Manager division. Beerman alleged that she was involved in a reorganization in July, 1997, when the change in her division from Project Manager for Distributed Interactive Simulation (PM DIS) to Project Manager for Advanced Distributed Simulation (PM ADS) involved transferred functions, positions and personnel into and out of PM ADS. Seaton alleged that her duties changed when the agency eliminated a GM-15 Business Manager position, and the agency divided the duties associated with this position between the appellant and the deputy project manager of her position. If the appellants prove that their downgrades were the delayed result of a change in their duties brought about by the planned elimination, addition, or redistribution of functions or duties within their organizations, they will establish Board jurisdiction over their appeals. <span class="Italic">See Barry</span>, 74 MSPR at 170. Therefore, we find that the appellants have raised nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction entitling them to a jurisdictional hearing. Because the appellants raised nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction, the administrative judge erred in accepting the agency's contentions that the downgrades were the result of classification errors. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994) (in determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a hearing, the administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive); <span class="Italic">see also Barry</span>, 74 MSPR at 170.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Shifflett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 83 MSPR 472, 475-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (1999), summarized the distinctions between a reclassification action that is a RIF, and one that is not. In <span class="Italic">Shifflet</span>, the appellants were downgraded with saved grade and pay. The Board explained that a reclassification due to a reorganization is appealable as a RIF demotion, even if the reclassification was made in delayed recognition of a reorganization that occurred long before the reclassification. If the appellant can show that his duties changed because of the planned elimination, addition, or redistribution of functions or duties within his organization, the Board has RIF jurisdiction over the appeal. But a demotion resulting from a reclassification due to erosion of duties is not appealable as a RIF. Nor do RIF appeal rights vest when there was a change to lower grade based on reclassification resulting from application of new classification standards or the correction of a classification error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3046"></span>The analysis in the decisions that follow depends on the regulations in effect at the time the RIF is appealed. The case law is jumbled because of the regulatory changes and conceptual confusion as to what is and is not covered by RIF regulations. One must also be mindful of the labels attached to actions. The regulations changed over the years. From 1980 to 1983, 5 CFR 351.201 required agencies to invoke RIF regulations for "reclassification due to change in duties." <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bright v. Macy</span>, 278 F. Supp. 215 (D. Md. 1967) (discussing the earlier history of the relationship between reclassification, RIF and adverse action); <span class="Italic">Betts v. Dept. of Army</span>, 12 MSPR 327, 329 (1982) (RIF procedures were properly applied to a reclassification due to a change of duties). In 1984 the regulatory scheme changed. 5 CFR 351.202(c)(2) excluded from RIF coverage "[a] change to lower grade based on the reclassification of an employee's position due to erosion of duties, the application of new classification standards, or the correction of a classification error." In 1986 the regulations again changed to the version now still in effect, including within RIF coverage the "reclassification of an employee's position due to erosion of duties when such action will take effect after an agency has formally announced a reduction in force in the employee's competitive area and when the reduction in force will take effect within 180 days." 5 CFR 351.201(a)(2) (2022). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burwell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 78 MSPR 645, 648 &#x00B6; 6 (1998); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Cook v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 74 MSPR 454, 462 (1997) (a 180-day notice is not required for other RIFs, when notice is issued under 5 CFR 351.801(a)(1)).</p>
