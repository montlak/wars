<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-209"><span class="space">B.</span> SIGNIFICANCE OF OWCP DETERMINATION; RECEIPT OF COMPENSATION</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">To determine whether a partially recovered employee has restoration rights, the Board places considerable reliance on OWCP findings as to recovery, although not every statement in OWCP correspondence concerning recovery is a binding OWCP determination. The evaluation of an appeal from the denial of a request for restoration by a partially recovered employee was considered in <span class="Italic">Bynum v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 403, 406-13 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-18, 22-25, 2009 MSPB 194 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Bynum v. USPS</span>, 382 Fed. Appx. 934 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted on review that the AJ erred in finding that a November 7, 2008 letter from OWCP established that her on-the-job injury was resolved and she could return to duty without restriction. She further asserted that medical restrictions dated November 24, 2008, and December 29, 2008, along with a January 16, 2009 letter written in response to the agency's Notice of Removal, constituted requests for work within her restrictions and that she "should have been restored as a partially recovered individual to a limited duty job."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may have jurisdiction over a Postal Service employee's claim that the agency violated her restoration rights following her full or partial recovery from a compensable injury, regardless of whether the employee would satisfy the definition of "employee" for the purposes of the Board's adverse action jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.102-.103; 353.304; <span class="Italic">Rumph v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 243, &#x00B6; 9 (2006). The extent of an employee's rights to restoration depends on whether she is fully or partially recovered and if fully recovered how long such recovery took. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102, "[p]artially recovered means an injured employee, though not ready to resume the full range of his or her regular duties, has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements." Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), "[a]gencies must make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty." A partially recovered employee may appeal to the Board for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily or capriciously in denying restoration. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). Where there is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> dispute as to any of these elements, the appellant bears the burden of proving them because they are issues that implicate both jurisdiction and the merits. <span class="Italic">See Welby v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 16 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish Board jurisdiction over a restoration claim as a partially recovered employee, the appellant must allege facts that would show, if proven, that: (1) She was absent from her position due to a compensable injury; (2) she recovered sufficiently to return to duty on a part-time basis, or to return to work in a position with less demanding physical requirements than those previously required of her; (3) the agency denied her request for restoration; and (4) the denial was "arbitrary and capricious." <span class="Italic">Chen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 13 (2004); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A compensable injury is defined as one that is accepted by OWCP as job-related and for which medical monetary benefits are payable from the Employees' Compensation Fund. <span class="Italic">Norwood v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 494, &#x00B6; 4 (2005). While OWCP's November 7, 2008 letter noted that the physicians who examined the appellant found that her condition had "resolved" and that she was "able to return to work without restrictions," the appellant submitted evidence below showing that she continued to receive OWCP benefits after the November 7, 2008 letter. Indeed, the record reveals that she continued to receive benefits through at least February 14, 2009. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OWCP's position on the appellant's compensable injury is not entirely clear given that its November 7, 2008 letter noted that the appellant's condition had resolved and that she was able to return to work without restrictions. However, it is clear that OWCP never terminated her benefits before her removal. Board precedent establishes that an OWCP determination that the appellant is fully recovered from the work-related portion of her injury is considered final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law and fact. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 374, &#x00B6; 6 (1999). In so holding, the Board has relied on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8128(b)(1), which provides that determinations "in allowing or denying a payment" are considered final and conclusive and are not subject to review. Here, however, OWCP's November 7, 2008 letter was written solely in response to the appellant's October 2, 2008 letter, in which she requested authorization to obtain another medical opinion, and OWCP's letter primarily detailed why it could not authorize her request. While it stated that her physicians indicated that she was able to return to work without restrictions, it did not propose to terminate or actually terminate her benefits and thus did not allow or deny payment under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8128(b)(1). Accordingly, the Board is not bound by the statement in OWCP's November 7, 2008 letter that the appellant could return to work without restrictions. The appellant therefore has made a nonfrivolous allegation that her absence from work was due to a compensable injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record also reveals that the appellant recovered sufficiently to return to duty in a position with less demanding physical requirements. However, the AJ found that the appellant "made no allegation that if proven would show that she requested restoration as a partially recovered employee," and indicated that he did not consider her January 16, 2009 letter to her supervisor in response to the agency's Notice of Removal to constitute a request for restoration. The appellant asserts that her January 16, 2009 letter, as well as her November 24, 2008, and December 29, 2008 medical restrictions constituted requests for restoration as a partially recovered employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has specifically cautioned against the imposition of additional notice requirements for an individual who seeks restoration to his former employing agency. <span class="Italic">Gerdes v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 500, &#x00B6; 12 (2001); <span class="Italic">Larsen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 669, 671 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Larsen,</span> the Board explicitly rejected the agency's attempt to require that a request for restoration be in writing to constitute a proper request. <span class="Italic">Larsen,</span> 36 M.S.P.R. at 671. The Board also disapproved of the agency's further argument that an individual must submit an actual application for employment before the agency is required to consider her restoration. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 671-72. In <span class="Italic">Gerdes,</span> the Board found that "aside from making a request for restoration, e.g., submitting a reemployment application, or making an oral or written request for reemployment with the agency, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(c) [applying to physically disqualified individuals] contains no additional requirements for placing an agency on notice that restoration is sought." <span class="Italic">Gerdes,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 500, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The November 24, 2008, and December 29, 2008 medical restrictions submitted by the appellant do not constitute requests for restoration. The record is devoid of evidence that the appellant communicated a desire to return to duty with the agency or asked to return to work within the medical restrictions outlined in the documentation submitted prior to her January 16, 2009 letter. Indeed, the medical documentation is not accompanied by any type of communication from the appellant, and she has not alleged that she communicated orally or in writing with anyone at the agency about returning to work until her January 16, 2009 letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ erred, however, in finding that the appellant's January 16, 2009 letter was not a request for restoration. In her January 16, 2009 letter, written in response to the agency's January 7, 2009 Notice of Removal, the appellant, citing the work restrictions she had previously submitted, explicitly requested that the agency "rescind the removal dated January 7, 2009, offer [her] a written job offer, and allow [her] a 30-day extension to reply so [her] physician [could] review the job offer." She stated that she believed the agency was "required to offer [her] a written limit[ed] duty job offer within [her] restrictions" based on the medical restrictions she previously submitted.<span class="Italic"></span> Accordingly, her January 16, 2009 letter constitutes a "written request for reemployment with the agency" and thus a request for restoration. <span class="Italic">See Gerdes</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 500, &#x00B6; 13. The appellant also made allegations of fact that, if proven, show that the agency denied the appellant's January 16, 2009 request for restoration as the agency responded to the appellant's request for restoration by removing her effective February 6, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the last prong of the jurisdictional test, an appellant who is partially recovered from a compensable injury must allege facts that would show, if proven, that the agency "is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). In determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, the AJ may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the AJ may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive<span class="Italic">. Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that she was ordered to return to duty in a position whose duties she alleges she was physically unable to perform. Her allegation was supported by medical evidence indicating that her physician imposed 10-pound and 20-pound lifting restrictions and by evidence indicating that she was still receiving OWCP benefits for her injury. Accordingly, the appellant made allegations that, if proven, would establish that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying her request for restoration as a partially recovered employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has thus met all four prongs of the jurisdictional test for a restoration claim brought by a partially recovered employee, and the Board therefore has jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Chen</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. <span id="Page_4458"></span>527, &#x00B6; 13; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). If an employee makes all the requisite nonfrivolous allegations needed to establish Board jurisdiction over her partial restoration appeal, then she is entitled to an adjudication of the merits of her appeal, including a hearing on the merits if requested. <span class="Italic">Barrett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 688, &#x00B6; 8 (2008). Because the appellant did not request a hearing, the Board has decided the merits of the appeal on the basis of the written record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency's denial of the appellant's request for restoration was not arbitrary and capricious.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has concluded that an agency does not act arbitrarily or capriciously in denying restoration where the agency is faced with conflicting assessments of the appellant's abilities. <span class="Italic">See Hardy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 387, &#x00B6; 21 (concluding that the agency's decision to delay restoration was not an arbitrary and capricious denial of restoration when an earlier report stated the appellant required no restrictions in the workplace and a later report stated the appellant continued to have very limited range of motion), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 250 Fed. Appx. 332 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Decisions on the suitability of an offered position are within the exclusive domain of OWCP, and it is that agency, not the employing agency and not the Board, which possesses the requisite expertise to evaluate whether a position is suitable in light of that employee's particular medical condition. <span class="Italic">See New v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1259, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">McLain v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 526, &#x00B6; 9 (1999). There is no indication in the record that OWCP has made an official determination that the appellant could return to work without restrictions, or that it has made any final determination regarding any restrictions on the appellant's duties. As we have noted above, however, OWCP issued a letter on November 7, 2008, indicating that examining physicians had found the appellant able to work without restrictions. In light of this letter, it is understandable that the agency issued its November 21, 2008 letter to the appellant ordering her to return to work or bring "acceptable documentation to [her] supervisor...as to why [she was] unable to work and the expected duration of incapacity." The appellant failed to report for work but asserts that she submitted medical documentation dated November 24, 2008 by mail and fax, indicating that she had a lifting restriction of 10 pounds. As noted previously, the medical documentation, which consisted of a prescription indicating simply that she was to "[l]imit lifting to no more than <span class="Italic">10 lbs</span> until Dec[.] 16, 2008," was not accompanied by a request to return to work or any other written or oral communication on behalf of the appellant.<span class="Italic"></span> The appellant continued to fail to report to work or contact the agency following her submission, and the agency issued a December 11, 2008 letter stating that the appellant was required to submit medical documentation stating that she was "incapacitated from duty and...could not perform any of the duties of [her] position" since submitting her 10-pound lifting restriction. The agency directed the appellant to report to work with such documentation on December 12, 2008. The appellant does not deny that she failed to report on December 12, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated December 20, 2008, the agency ordered the appellant to report to work on December 23, 2008, for a pre-disciplinary interview regarding her attendance situation and to bring any documentation supporting her continued absence. The letter notified the appellant that failure to report on December 23, 2008 would "result in the appropriate disciplinary action...."<span class="Italic"></span> The appellant does not dispute the agency's assertion that she failed to report to the December 23, 2008 pre-disciplinary interview, and she has failed to assert that she in any way contacted the agency from November 24, 2008, until December 31, 2008, when she submitted medical documentation dated December 29, 2008, indicating a 20-pound lifting restriction. The December 29, 2008 medical documentation more fully described the appellant's condition and indicated that the appellant should "not lift anything over 20 lbs...indefinitely." Again, the medical documentation was not accompanied by any written or oral communication from the appellant. Therefore, as of December 31, 2008, the agency was faced with conflicting evidence regarding the appellant's restrictions, based on OWCP's letter and the appellant's medical documentation, and an employee who refused to report to the work site as directed or to otherwise contact the agency. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee also Hardy</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 387, &#x00B6; 21. The agency thus issued a Notice of Removal on January 7, 2009, to which the appellant responded by making her request for restoration as a partially recovered employee on January 16, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has presented no evidence to show that she complied with the agency's repeated instructions to report to the work site with clear documentation of her medical restrictions. Accordingly, the appellant has not presented sufficient evidence to show that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying her request for restoration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bynum</span> was affirmed on appeal, <span class="Italic">Bynum v. USPS</span>, 382 Fed. Appx. 934, 936-937 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bynum contends that the agency's action violated her rights under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794. In order to prevail on her restoration claim, Bynum must establish (1) she was absent from her position due to a compensable injury; (2) she recovered sufficiently to return to duty on a part-time basis, or to return to work in a position with less demanding physical requirements than those previously required; (3) the Postal Service denied her request for restoration; and (4) the denial was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">See Chen</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. at 533. Removing an employee solely because she insists on compliance with the Rehabilitation Act is a violation of the statute. <span class="Italic">See Walley v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 279 F.3d 1010, 1016-18 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">see also New v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1259, 1264-65 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bynum's primary contention is that the Board erred in failing to find that the Postal Service acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying her request for restoration because the agency was obligated "to accommodate [her] physical limitations or make every effort to restore [her] to a position within [her] medical restrictions or within [her] local commuting area." More specifically, she complains that she was required to report for work in the absence of an OWCP suitability determination and asserts that she "did not return to full duty because [she] was afraid [her] health was endangered due to [her] medical restrictions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> She contends that, pursuant to <span class="Italic">New</span>, an employee may decline to follow agency instructions that would put the employee in a clearly dangerous position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that the agency's decision to remove Bynum was not arbitrary or capricious. While it is true that the OWCP did not make a suitability determination with respect to Bynum, we held in <span class="Italic">Walley</span> that "the absence of an OWCP suitability determination is not a necessary predicate to the employee's obligation to return to work." 279 F.3d at 1021. Rather, "an employee [must] return to work if the accommodations offered by the agency correspond to the recommendations of the attending physician." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Although the OWCP regulations considered in the <span class="Italic">Walley</span> decision have since been revised, these principles were re-codified in the revised agency regulations. For example, 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.515(b) states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If an employee cannot return to the job held at the time of injury due to partial disability from the effects of the work-related injury, but has recovered enough to perform some time of work, he or she must seek work. In the alternative, the employee <span class="Italic">must accept suitable work</span> offered to him or her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis added). In accordance with the agency's current regulations and consistent with our earlier holdings in <span class="Italic">New</span> and <span class="Italic">Walley</span>, we hold that Bynum was obligated to accept work from the Postal Service that complied with her physician's instructions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the only restriction imposed on Bynum by the November 24, 2008, medical documentation that Bynum submitted to the Postal Service was that she "[l]imit lifting to no more than <span class="Italic">10 lbs</span> until Dec[.] 16, 2008." <span class="Italic">Bynum</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. at 412. While the Postal Service erred in ordering Bynum to report for work on December 12, 2008, without recognizing that restriction, that restriction had expired by December 23, 2008, when Bynum was again ordered to report for work. Hence, the Postal Service's order to report to work on December 23, 2008, was not contrary to the instructions of Bynum's physician at that time. Moreover, the order was coupled with an invitation for Bynum to "bring any documentation to substantiate [her] unscheduled absences." When Bynum failed to return to work on December 23, 2008, or to supply medical documentation supporting her need for restricted duties, the agency was entitled to discharge her. The fact that thereafter she submitted a physician's document dated December 29, 2008, concerning restrictions on her duties is irrelevant to the question of discipline for her failure to appear on December 23, 2008.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of the significance of OWCP findings, <span class="Italic">Hodges v. DOJ</span>, 121 MSPR 337, 339 n.1, 2014 MSPB 54 (2014), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal employees who have fully or partially recovered from employment-related injuries have certain job retention rights under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8101, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, 20 C.F.R. Part 10, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> FECA insures that federal employees who are injured on the job and who have received or are receiving compensation will incur no loss of benefits which they would have received but for the injury or disease when they return to federal employment. Because compensation benefits are payable only while an employee has a work-related, viz., "compensable," injury, OWCP's decisions reflect its determination that the appellant remained a compensably injured, partially-recovered employee until he fully recovers from his injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102 (defining a "partially-recovered" individual as one who suffers from residuals of a "compensable injury" and "fully recovered" as "compensation benefits have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to perform all of the duties of the position he or she left or an equivalent one"); 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 10.5(14), (17), 10.300 (to receive wage-loss compensation based on "disability," the employee must have a work-related injury); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.500 (benefits under FECA are available only while the effects of a work-related condition continue). <span id="Page_4459"></span>Until OWCP issues a decision to terminate the appellant's compensation benefits, the employing agency is without authority to determine on its own that his medical restrictions are no longer causally related to his employment injury, i.e., that he is no longer a "partially recovered" employee for the purposes of restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). <span class="Italic">See New v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...While the administrative judge is correct that, as discussed below, where OWCP has made a determination of suitability with regard to a specific job offer the Board is precluded from finding to the contrary, we are not aware of any authority which mandates that OWCP must make such a suitability determination before the Board can exercise jurisdiction over an appeal involving an alleged denial of restoration. <span class="Italic">See Scott</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 248-49 (in the apparent absence of an OWCP suitability determination, the Board considered the reasonableness of the agency's job offer to determine if it amounted to an effective denial of restoration)....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the AJ found that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal because the record indicates that the appellant was never separated from her position. In so finding, the AJ relied on<span class="Italic"> Foley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 8 (2001), and <span class="Italic">As Salaam v.

The AJ was correct that both<span class="Italic"> Foley</span> and <span class="Italic">As Salaam</span> state that proof of separation is part of the appellant's jurisdictional burden in a restoration case involving a partially recovered employee. Certainly, the typical restoration appeal involves a situation in which a fully or partially recovered employee exercises a restoration right after having been separated from Federal service for a period of time. However, in some cases, the employee was not separated from the rolls while on compensation, but instead was absent on some form of leave or, as in this case, on LWOP. In fact, the restoration regulations expressly contemplate restoration following an absence not due to separation by referring to an agency's failure to restore, improper restoration, or failure to return an employee following a leave of absence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(a). Despite language in cases such as <span class="Italic">Foley</span> and <span class="Italic">As Salaam</span> suggesting that restoration rights do not attach unless the employee has been separated from service, the Board recently acknowledged that the employee need not show that she was separated from duty, merely that she was absent from her position due to a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See Chen v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 13 (2004); <span class="Italic">Bennett v.

Therefore, the AJ erred by finding that, because the appellant was never separated from her position, the Board lacks jurisdiction over her appeal.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;In some cases, the jurisdictional analysis properly focuses on whether the appellant was separated because of a compensable injury, but that is because an employee who is separated for cause unrelated to a compensable injury has no right to restoration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cox v.

Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">Brown-Cummings v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 627, 630 (1989). A compensable injury is a medical condition accepted by OWCP to be job related and for which medical or monetary benefits are payable pursuant to FECA. <span class="Italic">Tat</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 562, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the typical restoration appeal involves a situation in which a fully or partially recovered employee exercises a restoration right after having been separated from Federal service for a period of time, the Board has held that an employee need not show that he was separated from duty, merely that he was absent from his position due to a compensable injury, e.g., on sick leave or leave without pay (LWOP). <span class="Italic">Wilson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 9 (2005). A compensably injured individual who has been separated from Federal service is not precluded from exercising restoration rights merely because the separation was voluntary rather than involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Hays v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 16 (1999); <span class="Italic">Morman v. Department of Defense</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 6 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant nonfrivolously alleged that his separation resulted from, or was substantially related to, a compensable injury.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that he was separated as a result of a compensable injury because his OWCP benefits terminated on August 23, 2004, over a month before his separation via voluntary retirement on September 30, 2004. The administrative judge appears to have based this finding solely on the appellant's schedule awards, without considering OWCP's retroactive award of wage loss benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under FECA, a schedule compensation award involves compensation for a permanent disability due to "the loss, or loss of use, of a member or function of the body or involving disfigurement" without regard to the effect of that loss on an employee's earning capacity or ability to perform the functions of his position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8107(a); <span class="Italic">see Carter v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 252, 254-55 (1985). The employee is entitled to "basic compensation" for the disability for a predetermined number of weeks as set forth in the statutory compensation schedule. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8107(a), (c). A schedule compensation award is "in addition to compensation for temporary total or temporary partial disability." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8107(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, periodic support payments, or wage loss benefits, for a total or partial disability are available only if the claimant submits evidence that he is incapacitated, because of an employment injury, to earn the wages he was receiving at the time of injury. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8105-8106; <span class="Italic">Hays</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 16 (explaining that, by awarding wage loss benefits to the appellant, OWCP made an implicit finding that the appellant's compensable injury made her incapable of earning the wages she was receiving at the time of the injury); 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.115(f) (stating that, to obtain wage loss benefits, the claimant must submit medical evidence showing that the condition claimed is disabling); 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.5(f) (defining disability as the incapacity, because of an employment injury, to earn the wages the employee was receiving at the time of injury).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is the cessation of the periodic support payments while temporarily <span id="Page_4460"></span>totally or partially disabled, not the payment of a schedule award for a permanent injury, that triggers the restoration rights set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304. <span class="Italic">See Stewart v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 534 F. App'x 956, 962 (Fed. Cir. 2013); <span class="Italic">Nixon v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 9 (2006); <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. at 255. Thus, the fact that the appellant received two schedule awards does not give rise to restoration rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee requests (and appeals from alleged denial of) restoration rights based on an OWCP finding of recovery, the appeal is moot if OWCP then vacates its earlier decision and returns the appellant to compensation status, even if compensation itself is not immediately resumed, <span class="Italic">Knight v. DOJ</span>, AT-0353-15-0107-I-1 (NP 9/21/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Even if the OWCP has not yet resumed the ministerial function of processing the appellant's benefits payments, that agency clearly set aside its finding that he had fully recovered from his injuries. It also acknowledged that he is entitled to benefits retroactive to June 1, 2014, the date that his benefits previously ended. The OWCP's actions thus returned him to his status prior to the May 28, 2014 determination. Specifically, the December 17, 2014 action extinguished his basis for restoration and thus his Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Balfour v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 340, 341-42 (1984); <span class="Italic">see also Welber v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 195, 201-02 (1995) (finding that an employee's reemployment rights terminated when his compensable injury recurred and his workers' compensation were reinstated). Accordingly, we find that there is no longer a live controversy for the Board to adjudicate. <span class="Italic">See Occhipinti v. Department of Justice</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 504, 507 (1994) (holding that there must be a live case or controversy when a case is decided, not merely when the complaint is filed) (citing <span class="Italic">Spectronics Corp. v. H.B. Fuller Co., Inc</span>., 940 F.2d 631, 635 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). Accordingly, we find that the appeal is moot. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 507.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that he has not received any of the relief that he might have received had the matter been adjudicated. He alleges that his affirmative defenses--race, age, and disability discrimination--were not adjudicated and that he would have received attorney's fees had he prevailed. He argues that he also did not receive such benefits as restored annual leave, sick leave, and contributions to his Thrift Savings Plan account, which would have been awarded had the Board found that he was entitled to restoration and back pay. He further argues that he suffered unspecified "additional compensatory harm" because of the delay in restoration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although a claim of disability discrimination may prove that a denial of restoration rights was arbitrary and capricious, <span class="Italic">see Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 11 (2012), the agency did not deny the appellant's restoration rights. Instead, the OWCP vacated its finding that he had fully recovered from his compensable injuries, an act that extinguished his restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). <span class="Italic">See Balfour</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. at 342. The OWCP's reconsideration of the appellant's status occurred at his own request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the appellant's argument that he has not received the relief that he might have received had the matter been adjudicated also fails because the OWCP has not deemed him to be a fully-recovered employee. His reliance upon <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 443 (2007), is misplaced because the circumstances here are different than in that case. In <span class="Italic">Fernandez</span>, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as moot after the agency rescinded the underlying removal action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 3. The Board vacated the initial decision and remanded the appeal to the regional office because the agency had failed to pay the appellant all of the back pay and interest to which he was entitled and failed to restore his health benefits retroactively. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-18. These steps were necessary to return the appellant to his status prior to the removal action. Here, no such steps are required on the agency's part to return the appellant to his status prior to the May 28, 2014 OWCP decision. In any event, the appellant has not cited any authority refuting the holding that he must have a live controversy to proceed before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the agency cannot require him to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination because the OWCP's determination that an individual is fully recovered is "final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law and fact" and thus binding on the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8128(b)(1); <span class="Italic">As'Salaam v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 76, &#x00B6; 15 (2000). He additionally argues that, in requiring him to take a fitness-for-duty examination, the agency failed to grant him a reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Davis</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 11. Because the OWCP's action setting aside its earlier finding ended any live controversy here, these issues are no longer before the Board. In any event, a person who has fully recovered from a compensable injury may not meet all the physical requirements of the position in which he served, or an equivalent position, for reasons that are unrelated to the injury. <span class="Italic">See Simonton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 13 n.9 (2000); <span class="Italic">see also Tisdale v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 390, 395 (1990) (finding that the agency did not violate an employee's restoration rights in delaying restoration to duty following his recovery from compensable injury, as its delay was due to completion of necessary investigations involving medical, background, and drug screening determinations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An OWCP determination may have retroactive effect as to restoration rights, <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. USPS</span>, 2023 MSPB 8, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 13 (2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also on August 9, 2011, the appellant filed the instant Board appeal, arguing that the agency constructively suspended her, discriminated against her on the basis of her disability, and deprived her of her statutory rights by not properly affording her the opportunity to respond to the notice of proposed placement on enforced leave. On September 19, 2011, while the appeal was still pending in the regional office, OWCP issued a reconsideration decision vacating its November 29, 2010 decision and finding, based on the appellant's newly submitted medical evidence, that her September 10, 2009 injury was a recurrence of her 2004 injury and therefore compensable....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also has held that when, as in this case, OWCP reverses a previous ruling that an employee's injury was not compensable, restoration rights are conferred retroactively. <span class="Italic">See Welber v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 98, 103-04 (1994) (reopening a restoration appeal when the Board's decision in the agency's favor was predicated on OWCP's denying the appellant's claim for compensation, and OWCP subsequently reversed its earlier decision, thus entitling him to restoration rights during the period at issue). We therefore conclude that, upon the appellant's partial recovery from her September 10, 2009 injury, she acquired restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). From that point forward, her rights and remedies concerning her attempted return to duty were subsumed under the restoration process. <span class="Italic">See Bohannon</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Kinglee</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-22. Hence, if the appellant believes that, subsequent to September 10, 2009, the agency arbitrarily and capriciously denied her restoration as a partially recovered employee, her exclusive avenue of remedy is an appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Continuation of pay alone does not establish whether an employee suffered a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">Bowman v. VA</span>, PH-315H-17-0132-I-1 (NP 5/16/2022) (n.5: "However, the COP is expressly excluded from the definition of 'compensation' used in determining whether an employee suffered a 'compensable injury.' <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8101(12), 8118(e); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 812 F.2d 705, 709 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Therefore, the receipt of COP does not establish that the appellant sustained a compensable injury.").</p>
