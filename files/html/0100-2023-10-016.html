<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-18"><span class="space">2.</span> Supervisors; 5 USC 7112(b)(1)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Section 7112(b)(1) provides that a unit will not be appropriate for labor organization representation if it includes a supervisory employee, defined by 5 USC 7103(a)(10) as:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]n individual employed by an agency having authority in the interest of the agency to hire, direct, assign, promote, reward, transfer, furlough, layoff, recall, suspend, discipline, or remove employees, to adjust their grievances, or to effectively recommend such action, if the exercise of the authority is not merely routine or clerical in nature but requires the consistent exercise of independent judgment, except that, with respect to any unit which includes firefighters or nurses, the term "supervisor" includes only those individuals who devote a preponderance of their employment time to exercising such authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unit status depends on duties, not titles. <span class="Italic">AAFES Base Exch., Ft. Carson and AFGE Local 1345</span>, 3 FLRA 596, 597 (1980). Current duties are examined. To qualify an individual as a supervisor, the exercise of independent supervisory responsibility should be consistent. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 58 FLRA 170, 174 (2002) (although assignment of work is an element of supervisory status, there must be evidence that the employee consistently exercises independent judgment in assigning work). But not all supervisory functions must be exercised for the employee to be a supervisor. A food activity foreman was a supervisor. Even though she had not exercised authority by suspending, firing, transferring or promoting an employee, she effectively recommended the selection of applicants on several occasions and who consistently determined the hours of two part-time employees. The exercise of authority to recommend hiring and to recommend the discharge of a probationer by a newly promoted employee for a period of several weeks was sufficient to establish a food activity foreman a supervisor. An operations clerk supervisor who spent 50% of her time directing other employees and inspecting their work, and who made recommendations as to hiring, was a supervisor. <span class="Italic">Ft. Carson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 3 FLRA at 600-01.</p>
<p class="noindent">An individual who apparently supervised only one employee was excluded from the unit as a supervisor. The GS-303-06 Hospital Facilities Work Coordinator was responsible for providing maintenance work for 25 buildings, assigned and directed the work of a maintenance employee, and effectively recommended an award for that employee. <span class="Italic">Ft. Hood, Tex. and AFGE Local 1920</span>, 13 FLRA 479, 480 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Nat'l Mediation Bd. and AFGE</span>, 56 FLRA 1, 7-8 (2000), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 56 FLRA 320 (2000), distinguished the status of supervisor and work leader:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As concerns the supervisory status of Linda Gathings, section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute defines a "supervisor" as an individual employed by an agency who has authority "to hire, direct, assign, promote, reward, transfer, furlough, layoff, recall, suspend, discipline, or remove employees, to adjust their grievances, or to effectively recommend such action, if the exercise of the authority is not merely routine or clerical in nature but requires the consistent exercise of independent judgment[.]" It is well-settled that an employee will be found to be a supervisor if the employee consistently exercises independent judgment with regard to the supervisory indicia set forth in section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Army and Air Force Exchange</span> <span class="Italic">Service, Base Exchange, Fort Carson, Fort Carson, Colorado, </span>3 FLRA 596, 599 (1980). It is also well-settled that an employee need exercise only one of the responsibilities set forth in section 7103(a)(10) in conjunction with independent judgment in order to be found a supervisor. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Allen Park,</span> <span class="Italic">Michigan, </span>35 FLRA 1206 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing whether an employee is a supervisor, the Authority has distinguished employees who encumber "leader" positions in relation to other employees with whom they work. The Authority has determined in this regard that employees will be found to be "leaders" rather than supervisors within the meaning of section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute if their responsibilities are routine in nature and do not consistently involve the exercise of independent judgement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Army Aviation Systems Command and Army Troop Support Command, St. Louis, </span>36 FLRA 587 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record in this case fully supports the RD's conclusion that Gathings is not a supervisor within the meaning of section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute. It is true that at the hearing, Gathings testified that she supervises Linda Safford, as the Agency contends. However, Gathings further testified that she does not have the authority to write Safford's performance appraisal and had never written such an appraisal; that she does not have the authority to approve Safford's requests for leave; and that in reviewing Safford's work, she "just ha[s] to make sure that everything is accurate, when it goes out[.]" Gathings also testified that although she had once signed a Performance Improvement Plan, she had not drafted the plan, did not supervise the employee to whom the plan applied, and had only signed the plan because she had been told to do so. Based on this and other similar testimony, it is clear that Gathings's responsibilities with regard to Safford are merely routine in nature and do not involve the exercise independent judgment. We, therefore, conclude that the Agency has failed to establish that review should be granted regarding the supervisory status of this employee.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 59 FLRA 853, 856-57 (2004), restated some factors determining supervisory status:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the definition of "supervisor" set forth in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10), the Authority has consistently held that "an employee will be found to be a supervisor if the employee consistently exercises independent judgment with regard to the supervisory indicia set forth" in that section. <span class="Italic">NMB</span>, 56 FLRA at 7-8 (citing Army<span class="Italic"> and Air Force Exchange Service, Base Exchange, Fort Carson, Fort Carson, Colo.</span>, 3 FLRA 596, 599 (1980)). "[A]n employee need exercise only one of the responsibilities set forth in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) in conjunction with independent judgment in order to be found a supervisor." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 8. Where an employee's actions in connection with any of the supervisory indicia are of a routine nature, entailing the exercise of very little judgment or no consistent exercise of discretion, the employee will not be found to be a supervisor. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NMB</span>, 56 FLRA at 8; <span class="Italic">United <span id="Page_21"></span>States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 32 FLRA 1255, 1259 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, although performance evaluation is not listed among the supervisory indicia, an employee may nevertheless be a supervisor within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) if that employee "exercises independent judgment in evaluating employee performance, and...that evaluation is relied on by upper-level management in taking an action listed among the indicia of supervisory authority..., thereby constituting the effective recommendation of that action[.]" <span class="Italic">Navajo Area Office</span>, 45 FLRA at 651. The Authority also noted that "[i]t is not necessary, however, that [the employee's] evaluations and recommendations constitute management's final decision..., only that management rely on them in making [its final decision on a matter related to the supervisory indicia] without seeking independent information." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 656-57.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD determined that Felegie is not a supervisor because she found that he: (1) only assigned work on a routine basis; (2) generally reviewed work on a technical basis; and (3) did not authorize leave. The RD also found that, while there was "some evidence to indicate that Felegie has made promotion and/or award recommendations, the record <span class="Italic">does not</span> establish that these recommendations have been accepted or relied upon by upper-level management."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency relies primarily on <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span> and <span class="Italic">Navajo Area Office</span> in support of its claim that Authority precedent demonstrates that Felegie is a supervisor. The RD's findings, which are supported by the record, however, demonstrate that <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span> is distinguishable. In particular, consistent with Felegie's testimony that he assigned work to those who did that particular work on a routine basis, that he did not reassign work or change work priorities, that he reviewed work for accuracy and adherence to policy, the evidence indicates that his responsibilities are more akin to the individuals who were found not to be supervisors in<span class="Italic"> Aviation Systems Command</span> than those who were. <span class="Italic">Compare Aviation Systems Command</span>, 36 FLRA at 596-97 <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span>, 36 FLRA at 593-96.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also relies on <span class="Italic">Navajo Area Office, </span>arguing that the fact that Felegie drafted performance appraisals demonstrates his supervisory status. However,<span class="Italic"> Navajo Area Office</span>, 45 FLRA at 651, holds only that the responsibility to prepare performance appraisals may indicate supervisory status where the appraisals are relied on by upper-level management in making decisions to hire, promote, reward or discipline employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In this case, the RD found that Felegie drafted performance appraisals and made promotion and/or award recommendations. The RD also found that, under Authority precedent, "where an individual exercises independent judgment in evaluating employee performance and that evaluation is relied upon by upper-level management[,]" a sufficient basis exists to find that the individual is a supervisor. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 27 (citing <span class="Italic">Navajo Area Office)</span>. Applying that precedent, however, the RD concluded that "the record <span class="Italic">does not</span> establish" that Felegie's recommendations were accepted or relied on by upper-level management. In these circumstances, the Agency has not demonstrated that the RD's conclusion that Felegie is not a supervisor is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Navajo Area Office</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">A supervisor supervises "employees." 5 USC 7103(a)(2). A "foreman" is not a "supervisor" if the subordinates he supervises are inmates. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pa. and AFGE, Council of Prison Locals</span>, 7 FLRA 126, 128 (1981). Because supervisors must supervise employees, individuals who supervise only military personnel are not supervisors. <span class="Italic">Adjutant Gen. of Mich. and Mich. State Council, ACT</span>, 11 FLRA 66, 67 (1983). Speaking of nonemployees, <span class="Italic">Adjutant Gen., Ga. DOD and Ga.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority further finds that the incumbent in the job classification of Security Officer is not a supervisor within the meaning of section 7103(a)(10) as he does not supervise "employees." In this regard, section 7103(a)(2) of the Statute defines an "employee" as an individual "employed in an agency." Section 7103(a)(3) defines agency in principle part as "an Executive Agency." However, the individuals supervised by the Security Officer herein are employed by the State of Georgia which pays their salaries and fringe benefits and under whose laws they are covered. Therefore, the Authority finds that the Security Officer is not a supervisor as defined in the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the employee's supervisory duties are routine and do not involve the exercise of independent judgment, the chances are slim that the employee will be deemed a supervisor. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel and NTEU</span>, 32 FLRA 1255, 1259-60 (1988). How little supervisory authority can a supervisor exercise and still a supervisor be? The question was posed in <span class="Italic">VA, VAMC, Allen Park, Mich. and AFGE Local 933</span>, 35 FLRA 1206, 1211-12 (1990), whether an individual who shares with another person one of the indicia of supervisory authority in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) is a supervisor. Finding in the affirmative, FLRA stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that an employee is a supervisor when that employee exercises at least one of the supervisory criteria set forth in section 7103(a)(10) or recommends subordinates for one of these actions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's position is consistent with the court's interpretation of analogous supervisory status criteria under the National Labor Relations Act....&#8197;<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Diversified Foods, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 640 F.2d 893, 896 (7th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Walla Walla Union-Bulletin v. NLRB</span>, 631 F.2d 609, 613 (9th Cir. 1980). Independent judgment must be exercised in conjunction with the exercise of any one of the &#x00A7; 152(11) criteria, however, in order to confer supervisory status on an employee....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]n employee is required only to exercise one of these criteria in conjunction with independent judgment in order to attain supervisory status....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e reject the Union's assertion that because the Foremen jointly recommended that the employee be hired, the second shift Foreman did not use independent judgment, as required by the Statute. The Statute does not state that a decision requiring the exercise of independent judgment must only be made by one individual. We find instead that prior to reaching a final joint recommendation, the second shift Foreman was required to form his own preliminary assessment of the candidates. In doing so, he exercised independent judgment. Furthermore, the second shift Foreman's assessment of candidates was accorded the same degree of consideration as was the first shift Foreman's assessment. Stated otherwise, the second shift Foreman could reject the candidate favored by the first shift Foreman and vice versa....</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee's responsibility for rating other employees may be sufficient to establish supervisory status, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Navajo Area Office and Am.

<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we conclude that Carr is a supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ARD concluded that Carr's responsibility for evaluating the performance of Dorm Managers was not a sufficient basis for finding that Carr is a supervisor because the authority to evaluate employee performance is not among the authorities listed as indicia of supervisory status in section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute. It is clear that the authority to evaluate employee performance is not specified as an indicia of supervisory status in section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute. Nevertheless, we disagree with the ARD's conclusion that, because it is not listed among those indicia, the responsibility for evaluating employee performance is not a sufficient basis for finding that an individual is a supervisor within the meaning of section 7103(a)(10).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the ARD's conclusion that evaluation of employee performance is not an indicia of supervisory status under section 7103(a)(10) fails to take into account the fact that when evaluations of employee performance are relied on by upper-level management when making decisions to hire, promote, reward, or discipline employees, the evaluations constitute the effective recommendation of those actions within the meaning of section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute. This conclusion is consistent with the Authority's determinations regarding the connection between performance evaluation and other management actions in cases where the Authority has considered the negotiability of proposals governing the use by management of performance evaluations for the purposes of rewarding, promoting, or disciplining employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note in this connection that for employees covered by chapter 43 of title 5 of the United States Code, performance evaluations form the basis for decisions to reward, promote, reassign, retain, and discipline employees. 5 USC 4302(a)(3). We note, moreover, that for employees who are not covered by chapter 43 of title 5 of the United States Code, the performance appraisal systems under which they are evaluated may similarly require that decisions to reward, promote, or discipline employees be based on the results of performance evaluations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude, therefore, that where an individual exercises independent judgment in evaluating employee performance, and where that evaluation is relied on by upper-level management in taking an action listed among the indicia of supervisory authority specified in section 7103(a)(10), thereby constituting the effective recommendation of that action, a sufficient basis exists to conclude that the individual constitutes a supervisor within the meaning of section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute. To the extent that the decision in <span class="Italic">VANG</span> [<span class="Italic">The Adjutant General, State of Vermont</span>, 5 FLRA 779, 784 (1981)] is inconsistent with this conclusion, we will no longer follow that decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the NLRB will find that an individual constitutes a supervisor within the meaning of section 2(11) of the NLRA where a performance evaluation prepared by that individual may affect the employment status of an employee, the NLRB has also held that the fact that an individual evaluates unit employees is not by itself dispositive of supervisory status....&#8197;Among the factors that the NLRB considers in determining whether evaluations of employee performance constitute effective recommendations of actions affecting employees' employment status are: (1) whether evaluations are directly linked, for example, to merit <span id="Page_22"></span>pay increases and promotions, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">The Trustees of Noble Hospital</span>, 218 NLRB 1441, 1442 (1975); (2) whether, and the degree to which, higher-level management relies on, and gives weight to, the evaluations, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">St. Alphonsus Hospital</span>, 261 NLRB 620, 631 (1981); <span class="Italic">Simpson Electric Company</span>, 250 NLRB 309 (1980); <span class="Italic">University of Vermont</span>, 223 NLRB 423, 426 (1976); (3) whether higher-level management independently investigates the evaluations, <span class="Italic">compare</span> <span class="Italic">Wedgewood Health Care</span>, 267 NLRB 525, 526 (1983) <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Newton-Wellesley Hospital</span>, 219 NLRB 699, 701 (1975); and (4) whether the evaluations are placed in employees' permanent personnel files, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Wedgewood Health Care</span>, 267 NLRB at 526 and <span class="Italic">Comprehensive Health Planning Council of Southeastern Michigan</span>, 256 NLRB 1191, 1192 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that in cases where the evidence does not conclusively establish that an individual possesses supervisory authority within the meaning of section 2(11), the NLRB considers certain "secondary indicia" of supervisory status....&#8197;These secondary factors include whether the individual: (1) attends management meetings, including supervisory training sessions,...and (2) has the authority to grant time off to employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because of the essential similarity of the definition of the term "supervisor" in section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute and in section 2(11) of the NLRA, we find that the principles established in private sector case law as to the determination of supervisory status provide useful guidance. Specifically, insofar as it is relevant to the issues in this case, we find no basis on which to conclude that the principles applicable to the determination of supervisory status established by section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute are sufficiently unique to the Federal sector as to require us to ignore the experience gained in the private sector under section 2(11) of the NLRA....&#8197;Consequently, we adopt the principles used by the NLRB to determine supervisory status and will apply them in determining whether Carr is a supervisor within the meaning of section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed in this case that Carr, as a Homeliving Specialist, is responsible for evaluating the performance of the Dorm Managers. We find, based on the record in this case, that Carr evaluates the Dorm Managers using a standard Agency form covering their positions and that he records his determination as to the level of their performance by entering the applicable numerical designation for that level as to each standard. We also find, based on the record, that the form contains a space for additional conclusions as to the Dorm Managers' performance by the individual who is rating those employees and that Carr has used the space to express specific findings in support of his evaluations. After he completes the evaluations, Carr discusses the result with the Dorm Managers. The evaluation is ultimately placed in the Dorm Managers' permanent personnel files and constitutes the official rating of record for those employees. We further find, based on the record, that the Principal has not changed Carr's evaluations of the Dorm Managers and that she has not conducted an independent investigation of the Dorm Managers' performance. Rather, the evidence supports the conclusion that she accepts his evaluations. Specifically, the Principal testified that Carr independently appraises the Dorm Managers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both Carr and the Principal testified that Carr had the authority to recommend the Dorm Managers for awards based on his evaluation of their performance, but the record does not contain any evidence demonstrating that he has done so. The evidence is less clear as to the relationship between Carr's evaluations of the Dorm Managers and his recommendations as to their continued employment. While the record indicates that Carr's recommendation that a Dorm Manager be retained is based on his evaluation of that employee's performance, the evidence in the record as to the weight that his recommendation carries in the decision to retain the employee is limited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record supports the conclusion that Carr's recommendations that a Dorm Manager's contract be renewed are not final....&#8197;However, the Principal testified that she routinely forwards Carr's recommendations to the School Board without change and does not independently investigate to confirm the validity of those recommendations. She also testified that she has never disagreed with his recommendations and that, prior to hiring the current Dorm Managers, she discussed with Carr his evaluation of the two Dorm Aides who were ultimately offered contracts as Dorm Managers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find, based on the record, that Carr has authority to grant requests of the Dorm Managers for annual or sick leave and that the Principal does not review or approve those grants of leave....&#8197;We also find, based on the record, that Carr routinely attends management meetings and has taken supervisory training....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the relevant factors outlined above to the record in this case, we find that Carr is a supervisor within the meaning of section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute. Specifically, we find that Carr's evaluations of the performance of the Dorm Managers constitute the effective recommendation of the retention of the Dorm Managers. We note, based on the record, that the Dorm Managers are contract employees. The continued employment of the Dorm Managers is dependent on the annual renewal of their contract. The School Board's decision to renew the Dorm Managers' contracts is based on Carr's recommendations which, in turn, are based on his evaluations of their performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, based on the record, that Carr's evaluations are routinely accepted by the Principal and forwarded to the School Board without any separate investigation. The Principal clearly relies on Carr's recommendations and evaluations of the Dorm Managers' performance when requesting that the School Board renew the Dorm Managers' contracts. While Carr's evaluations and recommendations are not the only factor relied on in the decision to renew the contracts, they are clearly one of the most significant factors. It is not necessary, however, that Carr's evaluations and recommendations constitute management's final decision to renew the contracts; only that management rely on them in making the contract renewal decision without seeking independent information....&#8197;We conclude, therefore, based on the record in this case, that Carr, through his evaluations of the Dorm Managers' performance, effectively recommends their continued employment by the School Board.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find that Carr's evaluations and recommendations constitute an exercise of independent judgment within the meaning of section 7103(a)(10). Carr testified that the Principal did not tell him how to evaluate the Dorm Managers. The Principal testified that she did not change Carr's appraisals and that his evaluations constituted his own judgment as to their performance. We conclude, therefore, based on this consistent testimony, that Carr exercised independent judgment in evaluating the Dorm Managers' performance and in recommending that their contracts be renewed....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the authority to renew the Dorm Managers' employment contracts--that is, to retain the Dorm Managers--is integrally related to the statutory indicia of supervisory status under section 7103(a)(10)....&#8197;We note in this regard, for example, that where employees are subject to the annual renewal of a contract, the decision to renew that contract is, in effect, a decision to rehire. Moreover, in such circumstances, the decision to retain an employee whose contract is up for renewal is also a decision as to whether to remove or terminate that employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, in effectively recommending the retention of the Dorm Managers, based upon his evaluation of their performance, we conclude that Carr effectively recommends actions indicative of a supervisory authority listed in section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute. Our conclusion as to Carr's supervisory status is further supported by such secondary factors as his authority to grant leave requests and his attendance at management meetings and supervisory training....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taken as a whole, therefore, we find that the record in this case supports the conclusion that Carr is a supervisor within the meaning of section 7103(a)(10) of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has also held that an individual is a supervisor where an individual's exercise of independent judgment in evaluating employee performance "is relied on by upper-level management in taking an action listed among the indicia of supervisory authority specified in [&#x00A7;] 7103(a)(10)," effectively making the individual's evaluation a "recommendation of that action."[25] Additionally, it is "not necessary...that [an individual's] evaluations and recommendations constitute management's final decision...; only that management rely on them in making the...decision without seeking independent information."[26]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the Union's first argument, the Union asserts that the RD erred in relying on <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Navajo Area Office, Gallup, New Mexico (Navajo)</span>[27] because the sergeants' participation in creating and applying individual EPAPs is "merely clerical." Specifically, the Union argues that, unlike the employee at issue in <span class="Italic">Navajo</span>, "sergeants merely record what [a subordinate employee] has done during the year.... [and] do not evaluate what tasks the employee has performed." We find the Union's first argument unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[27]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 646.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Navajo</span>, the Authority found that an employee was a supervisor because he evaluated employees by rating their performance, conducting performance-appraisal meetings with those employees, and making recommendations concerning the employees' continued employment.[30] Here, the RD made similar factual findings supporting her determination concerning the sergeant's consistent exercise of independent judgment in performing a supervisory function. Analogous to <span class="Italic">Navajo</span>--and contrary to the Union's argument--the RD found that <span id="Page_23"></span>sergeants: (1) meet with subordinate employees at least two times in a performance year to discuss performance-appraisal issues; (2) "exercise independent discretion" in applying Agency "standards to <span class="Italic">evaluate their daily interactions</span> with [their] employees"; (3) formally rate employees' performances at the end of the performance year; and (4) draft narratives supporting each rating. Furthermore, comparable to <span class="Italic">Navajo</span>, the performance appraisals are "used to determine whether employees qualify for performance awards and for promotion or advancement." The Union does not challenge the RD's factual findings. Accordingly, we find that the Union's first argument does not demonstrate that the sergeants' actions in creating and applying individual EPAPs are "merely clerical."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[30]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Navajo</span>, 45 FLRA at 655.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the Union's second argument, the Union asserts that EPAPs with employee evaluations must be "reviewed by and approved by [a] lieutenant"--effectively minimizing a sergeant's independent discretion in evaluating employees. We find the Union's second argument unpersuasive for two reasons. First, contrary to the Union's assertion, the record reflects that annual performance evaluations with mid-tier ratings (Fully Successful and Superior) do not require a lieutenant's approval. Therefore, EPAPs with mid-tier ratings that are completed by sergeants do not require a lieutenant's review and are final. Second, as to the Exceptional and Unsatisfactory evaluations, the RD determined--consistent with the record--that "a vast majority of the ratings issued by [s]ergeants are upheld upon review." Authority precedent provides that it is "not necessary...that [a supervisor's] evaluations and recommendations constitute management's final decision...; only that management rely on them in making...decision[s] without seeking independent information."[43] Here, lieutenants "by and large...upheld [s]ergeants' initial ratings of [subordinate employees]," and management uses those ratings "in deciding whether to promote or reward employees"--two supervisory functions listed under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10).[46] Therefore, because management relies upon the sergeants' discretionary evaluations in deciding whether to promote or reward employees, we find the Union's second argument unpersuasive.</p>

<p class="noindent">If the employee evaluates work but does not participate in the performance evaluation process, the employee does not become a supervisor only because management uses the work evaluation in the appraisal process, as FLRA explained, distinguishing <span class="Italic">Navajo Area</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, in <span class="Italic">USDA, Rural Housing Serv. and AFGE Local 3354</span>, 67 FLRA 207, 207-10 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a petition seeking to clarify the bargaining-unit status of coordinators who the Activity claimed were supervisors of the Activity's employees (processors). Section 7112(b)(1) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that many of the coordinators perform quality reviews of processors' work, and that these reviews involve randomly selecting examples of processors' work and using a checklist to determine whether the processors have complied with Activity procedures. The RD found that, as a result of the quality reviews, coordinators prepare forms documenting each processor's errors, and that management uses these forms when they review the processors' performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Activity alleged before the RD that these coordinators are supervisors because they evaluate processors' performance when they perform these quality reviews. To analyze the Activity's argument, the RD discussed the Authority's determination in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Navajo Area Office, Gallup, New Mexico</span> (<span class="Italic">Navajo</span>)[3] that an employee who evaluated other employees' performance was a supervisor. Specifically, the RD emphasized that the supervisor in <span class="Italic">Navajo</span> not only evaluated employees' performance, but also effectively recommended the retention or termination of those employees--thereby effectively recommending actions set forth in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10). Applying this precedent, the RD addressed whether two of the Activity's coordinators--the coordinator for the "Field Assistance Desk" (field coordinator), and the coordinator for the "Multi&#8209;Family Housing Section" (multifamily coordinator)--are supervisors.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;45 FLRA 646 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the field coordinator "perform[s] quality reviews of...[p]rocessors' work, but she doesn't sit in with her supervisor during the [p]rocessors' performance[-]appraisal meetings." Additionally, the RD found that the evidence did not establish that the field coordinator "effectively recommends employee appraisal ratings, or that her supervisor's rating of employees are directly tied to the exercise of any supervisory criteria listed in [&#x00A7;] 7103(a)(10)." The RD concluded that the field coordinator is not a supervisor and, thus, is included in the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the multi-family coordinator, the RD found that management uses the results of the coordinator's quality reviews in the processors' monthly reviews. But the RD found that the multi-family coordinator "rarely participates in these monthly reviews, and...never participates in the [p]rocessors' annual performance[-]appraisal meetings." Further, citing <span class="Italic">Navajo</span>, the RD found that "[e]ven if [the multi-family coordinator] effectively recommend[s] the evaluations issued to [p]rocessors in her unit, there is no evidence of any direct link between [her] role in evaluating [p]rocessor performance and the exercise of any supervisory criteria listed in [&#x00A7;] 7103(a)(10)."[9] The RD concluded that the multi-family coordinator is not a supervisor and, thus, is included in the unit.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that all of the Activity's other coordinators--including the coordinator for the "Appeals, Audits and Unauthorized Assistance Section" (audit coordinator)--are supervisors, and, thus, are excluded from the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the audit coordinator is a supervisor, the RD rejected the Activity's argument that the audit coordinator's quality-review duties establish her supervisory status, but, instead, found that the audit coordinator is a supervisor based on her training duties. Regarding the audit coordinator's quality-review duties, the RD found that management's reliance upon the audit coordinator's quality reviews established that the coordinator's reviews "effectively recommend the [p]rocessors' performance ratings." However, citing <span class="Italic">Navajo</span>,the RD found that these duties did not provide a basis for finding that the audit coordinator is a supervisor because there was no evidence of "a direct link between [the audit coordinator's] role in evaluating [p]rocessor performance and the exercise of any supervisory criteria listed in [&#x00A7;] 7103(a)(10)."[14]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity argues that the RD failed to apply established law, and asks the Authority to reconsider the RD's determinations as to the status of the audit, field, and multi-family coordinators. The Authority will grant an application for review if the application demonstrates that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the audit coordinator, the Activity agrees that the RD appropriately excluded the position from the unit based on her training duties. Nevertheless, the Activity challenges the RD's determination that the audit coordinator's quality-review duties do not establish that she exercises supervisory authority. Under &#x00A7; 2429.10 of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority will not issue advisory opinions. The determination that the Activity seeks--that the audit coordinator exercises supervisory authority for reasons in addition to those found by the RD--would not change the unit status of the audit coordinator. As a result, addressing the Activity's argument would involve issuing an advisory opinion. Consistent with &#x00A7; 2429.10, we decline to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the field and multi-family coordinators, the Activity argues that the RD misinterpreted <span class="Italic">Navajo</span> to require the Activity to show a "direct link" between appraising performance and the exercise of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) supervisory authority in order to establish that the coordinators are supervisors. According to the Activity, the Authority should presume a "direct link" between the coordinators' quality-review duties and management's exercise of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) supervisory authority because federal statute and regulations--as well as the Activity's own regulations--require that performance evaluations form the basis of the Activity's decisions to reward, promote, reassign, retain, and discipline employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Navajo</span> involved a specialist who evaluated contract employees by rating their performance, conducting performance-appraisal meetings with those employees, and making recommendations concerning their continued employment. In determining that the specialist was a supervisor, the Authority stated that "where an individual exercises independent judgment in evaluating employee performance, and where that evaluation is relied on by upper-level management in taking an action listed among the indicia of supervisory authority specified in [&#x00A7;] 7103(a)(10), thereby constituting the effective recommendation of that action," there is a sufficient basis to conclude that the individual is a supervisor. Because management in <span class="Italic">Navajo</span> relied heavily on the specialist's evaluations in deciding whether to renew the evaluated employees' contracts, the Authority held that the specialist effectively recommended the retention of those employees. Thus, the Authority found that the specialist was a supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the RD did not find--and the record does not establish--that any managers relied on coordinators' quality reviews in exercising supervisory authority. And, unlike the specialist in <span class="Italic">Navajo</span>, the coordinators here do not draft performance appraisals or conduct performance-review meetings. Rather, the coordinators use a checklist to determine whether processors have complied with Activity procedures, and then prepare forms for management tabulating the number of errors committed by each processor. And the Activity does not claim that, by conducting <span id="Page_24"></span>quality reviews, the coordinators effectively recommend performance ratings in <span class="Italic">all</span> of processors' performance elements. Instead, undisputed record evidence shows that management uses the field coordinator's quality reviews in connection with only two out of six performance elements, and that the multi-family coordinator's quality-review statistics affect only two out of four performance elements. Thus, the record does not establish that the coordinators' quality-review duties--which involve producing statistics for managers to use in determining the ratings in some, but not all, of processors' performance elements--constitute appraising performance, let alone amount to effectively recommending the exercise of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) supervisory authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity cites a statute and various regulations that require performance appraisals to form the basis of Activity decisions to reward, promote, retain, and discipline employees. According to the Activity, these authorities establish the requisite "connection" between performance appraisals and these types of decisions as a matter of law. However, these authorities do not provide a basis for eliminating the Authority's requirement that a party seeking to exclude an employee from a bargaining unit establish, through record evidence, the link between that employee's performance appraisal duties and the actual exercise of supervisory authority. And, although the Activity argues that <span class="Italic">Navajo</span> limited this requirement to employees who evaluate the performance of contract employees, the Authority has applied this requirement in subsequent decisions concerning federal-government employees.[33]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SSA, Office of Disability Adjudication &#x0026; Review, Balt., Md</span>., 64 FLRA 896, 896-97, 903 (2010) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>) (judges excluded as supervisors where their evaluations were relied upon by upper-level management in retention, promotion, and award-eligibility decisions); <span class="Italic">U.S. DOL, Wash., D.C</span>., 59 FLRA 853, 856-57 (2004) (DOL)(Chairman Cabaniss dissenting in part) (budget officer who appraised employees' performance not a supervisor where "the record <span class="Italic">[did]</span> <span class="Italic"> not</span> establish" that his recommendations were "accepted or relied on by upper-level management").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Alternatively, the Activity asks the Authority to overrule <span class="Italic">Navajo</span> as "[i]rrational and unworkable,"and argues that because evaluating employee performance is included within the management rights to "direct employees" and "assign work" under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, employees who evaluate performance must be supervisors under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7112(b)(1) and 7103(a)(10).[35] However, the Authority's consistent application of <span class="Italic">Navajo's</span> central holding undermines the Activity's argument that <span class="Italic">Navajo</span> is "unworkable." And the Activity's citation to &#x00A7; 7106 provides no basis for eliminating the requirement that excluding an employee from a bargaining unit be based on evidence that the employee actually exercises supervisory authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[35]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 9-11 (citing <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org</span>., 63 FLRA 450, 452 (2009); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 47 FLRA 705 (1993) (Member Armendariz concurring in part, dissenting in part); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1760</span>, 28 FLRA 160, 169 (1987); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1760, AFL-CIO</span>, 15 FLRA 909 (1984)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although, as discussed above, the Activity asks the Authority to presume a "direct link" between performance appraisals and management's exercise of supervisory authority,the Activity does not assert--and the RD did not find--that the Activity established this link as a factual matter. Therefore, the RD's decision is consistent with <span class="Italic">Navajo</span>, and subsequent Authority decisions, requiring a demonstrated link between performance-appraisal duties and the exercise of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) supervisory authority in order to demonstrate that an employee is a supervisor.[38]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we note that even if the Activity had shown that coordinators' quality-review duties effectively recommend the exercise of supervisory authority, the record evidence--including the evidence cited by the Activity in its application--does not clearly establish that these coordinators exercise <span class="Italic">independent judgment</span> when they conduct quality reviews. In this regard, the RD made no finding whether coordinators exercise independent judgment when performing these duties. And the coordinators acknowledged before the RD that identifying errors for quality reviews is often "cut and dry." Therefore, there is no basis for finding that these duties involve the "consistent exercise of independent judgment" necessary to demonstrate that the coordinators are supervisors under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10).</p>
