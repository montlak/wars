<h2 class="h2" id="sec13-2"><span class="space">I.</span> OVERVIEW</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">A prohibited personnel practice occurs if a supervisor recommends, approves, or takes a personnel action enumerated in 5 USC 2302(a)(2) for one of the reasons specified in 5 USC 2302(b). The failure to take a personnel action, or the threat to take or fail to take an action, is covered by 5 USC 2302(b)(8, 9, 11, 12). If the prohibited personnel practice involves a personnel action within the appellate jurisdiction of the Board, the employee may raise the contention that the action was taken for forbidden reasons through an affirmative defense to the action. Because a prohibited personnel practice may be raised as an affirmative defense in the course of an ordinary appeal, discussion of prohibited personnel practice allegations can be found throughout the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> (especially in <a href="0100-2023-14-001.html#sec7-1">Chapters 7</a>, <a href="0100-2023-15-001.html#sec8-1">8</a>, <a href="0100-2023-08-102.html#sec1-101">9</a>, <a href="0100-2023-09-102.html#sec2-101">10</a>, and <a href="0100-2023-11-100.html#sec4-101">12</a>). The Board acquires the authority to address a prohibited personnel practice either as a defense to an appeal otherwise within its jurisdiction or through an Individual Right of Action; indirect authority to address prohibited personnel practices may involve regulation review or regulation implementation review appeals, discussed in <a href="0100-2023-08-001.html#sec1-1">Chapter 1</a>. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Galindo v. DOD</span>, DC-3443-12-0742-I-1 (NP 5/16/2013) ("However, where, as here, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the underlying appeal, the Board is without jurisdiction to hear claims that the agency committed prohibited personnel practices, which includes reprisal for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Shannon v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 17 n.2 (2005).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As with affirmative defenses of discrimination, of the many allegations of prohibited personnel practices, particularly whistleblowing reprisal, that are raised through IRA appeals or as affirmative defenses in otherwise appealable actions, few findings of reprisal appear in Board final decisions, excluding the occasional disciplinary or corrective action case brought by the Office of Special Counsel (OSC). Whistleblowing reprisal was found in <span class="Italic">Miller v.

<p class="Body-Text">Whether or not the prohibited personnel practice involves a personnel action within the appellate jurisdiction of the Board, the employee may seek relief by filing a complaint with OSC<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Bowen</span>, 815 F.2d 1505 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (excepted service attorney who could not appeal a termination to the Board could file an OSC complaint). OSC should then investigate the complaint and may in its discretion seek corrective or disciplinary action before the Board. For whistleblowers--that is, for employees who suffer reprisals or threats of reprisal because of statutorily-defined protected disclosures of gross waste, fraud, mismanagement, or other specified practices in the government--OSC is available for initial review of allegations. Once the OSC review process is exhausted, the whistleblower takes his or her reprisal case to the MSPB pursuant to the Individual Right of Action (IRA) provisions of the Reform Act (also referred to as Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) cases). The IRA appeal is limited in scope, but it is within the appellant's discretion to prosecute before the Board. Victims of prohibited personnel practices not constituting whistleblowing reprisal and not involving otherwise appealable actions have their cases brought to the attention of the Board only if OSC files a case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Prior v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 561, 568 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will not bootstrap its jurisdiction by first considering an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice in order to establish that it has appellate jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Mundy v. DOD</span>, 4 MSPR 287, 292 (1980). An individual with an IRA claim who must exhaust administrative remedies with OSC may join that claim with an otherwise appealable action, e.g., an involuntary retirement claim, and bring the actions to the Board after the OSC case is closed out (although in practice, because the otherwise appealable action has to be timely filed based on the date of the action, that action would likely first be appealed and that appeal would later be joined to the IRA case after exhaustion of the OSC remedy). <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Schaeffer v.

<p class="Body-Text">The distinction between treatment of whistleblowing reprisal in an IRA case (a personnel action that must first be brought to the attention of OSC before it is taken to the Board) and an otherwise appealable action (a personnel action that may be taken to the Board whether or not it is first brought to the attention of OSC) is explained in <span class="Italic">Grubb v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 96 MSPR 377, 384-86 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to show Board jurisdiction in an individual right of action (IRA) appeal, the appellant must show that she has exhausted her remedies before OSC and she must make nonfrivolous allegations that she made a disclosure protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a). <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Rusin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298, &#x00B6; 12 (2002). In order to establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, an appellant is not required to <span class="Italic">prove</span> that she made protected disclosures, merely to make a nonfrivolous allegation that her disclosures were protected. <span class="Italic">Rusin</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11. Protected whistleblowing takes place where an appellant made disclosures that she reasonably believed evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety. <span class="Italic">Stauner v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 179, &#x00B6; 4 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once jurisdiction has been established, an appellant must then prove the elements of her claim by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 327 F.3d 1354, 1356-57 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Thus, an appellant must show that she made a protected disclosure and that it was a contributing factor in the decision to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1998). The agency may still prevail if it shows by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action in the absence of any protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Rusin</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298, &#x00B6; 9. Clear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof that produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established. <span class="Italic">Shaw v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When the complained-of personnel action is an otherwise appealable action, the burden of proof is somewhat different. An otherwise appealable action is a personnel action that is within the Board's statutory or regulatory jurisdiction independent of the Whistleblower Protection Act and its amendments. For example, a removal action, a reduction in pay, a suspension for more than 14 days, or a demotion resulting from a RIF are otherwise appealable actions<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. In contrast, for example, a suspension for 14 or fewer days, a performance appraisal, and a reassignment are not otherwise appealable actions, and can only be appealed to the Board if an appellant can prove jurisdiction over those actions as IRA claims<span class="Italic">. Smith v. Department of the Army</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 311 &#x00B6; 11 (1998) (a 14-day suspension, a performance appraisal, and a reassignment are all personnel actions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Department of Defense</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 649 &#x00B6; 15 (1999) (suspensions of 14 days or less and reassignments are not appealable to the Board); <span class="Italic">Doster v. Department of the Army</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 251, 253 (1993) (performance appraisal is not independently appealable to the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In whistleblower claims involving an otherwise appealable action, the initial burden is on the agency to prove its case by preponderant evidence (with some exceptions not relevant here). If the agency proves its case, the appellant's whistleblower claim is treated as an affirmative defense. In such a case, because the Board's jurisdiction is not at issue, the IRA jurisdictional standards are inapplicable. Instead, once the agency proves its case, the appellant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that she made a disclosure protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's personnel action<span class="Italic">. Redschlag v. Department of the Army</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 589 &#x00B6; 70 (2001), <span class="Italic">rev. dismissed</span>, 32 Fed. Appx. 543 (Fed.

The appellant may show that a disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure and that the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action<span class="Italic">. Redschlag</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 598 &#x00B6; 70; <span class="Italic">Shaw</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. at 113-14.

<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal for whistleblowing, the burden of persuasion shifts to the agency to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action absent any protected activity<span class="Italic">.

When determining whether the agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing, the Board considers the following factors: the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers, but who are otherwise similarly situated<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Body-Text">Ordinary appeals raising affirmative defenses of reprisal and IRA cases are known as appellate cases because they are initiated at the regional or field offices of the Board and then reviewed, through petitions for review, at Board headquarters. OSC disciplinary and corrective actions, as well as regulatory review proceedings, are known as original jurisdiction cases because they are initiated with the Board headquarters rather than at the regional or field offices. The distinction between original jurisdiction (obtained by an OSC complaint to the Board) and appellate jurisdiction (invoked through adverse action appeals to MSPB regional offices) is apparent from the nature of the allegations that the Board may hear. For example, although the Board lacks ordinary appellate jurisdiction over an appeal by an employee who is not selected for promotion, if the individual alleges that the nonselection was in reprisal for filing a grievance, OSC may investigate the case and determine that it warrants a corrective action complaint to the Board. The result is that the Board's authority over the complaint by OSC is broader than its jurisdiction in other appellate cases not involving IRA claims. <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. ICC</span>, 3 MSPR 394, 396, 3 MSPB 473 (1980). IRA cases may and often do involve personnel matters, e.g., nonpromotion, that are first be taken to OSC and then to the Board. The analogue is the EEO case: many matters described as personnel actions can be addressed through the EEO process governed by EEOC regulations that are not personnel actions within the Board's limited statutory and regulatory jurisdiction. The distinction was illustrated in <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. Customs Serv.</span>, 31 MSPR 342, 344-45 (1986), involving a stay sought by OSC on behalf of a member of the SES, a reemployed annuitant who, the agency contended, served at the pleasure of the agency head and could be fired at will. From this argument the agency sought to convince the Board that, if the employee could be fired at will, there was no Board jurisdiction to review the termination, i.e., there was no personnel action that could be reviewed. Not so, the Board held, concluding that whether an employee could be removed without cause was not determinative of its jurisdiction over OSC cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that an action may not be appealable to the Board, however, is not determinative of whether a personnel action has occurred. There are many personnel actions--such as appointment, promotion, detail, and reassignment--that are not appealable to the Board, and yet the Special Counsel has the authority to seek redress for an employee in a covered position if any of these actions are based on a prohibited personnel practice. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue of whether an action is a personnel action focuses on the nature of the action at issue--not on the status of the employee who is the subject of the action. A termination of an employee, regardless of whether he or she has an appeal right under chapter 75 of title 5, is a disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wren v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2 MSPB 174, 2 MSPR 1 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Poorsina v. MSPB</span>, 726 F.2d 507 (9th Cir. 1984) (probationary employee who alleges that he or she is being terminated in reprisal for whistleblowing has no right of appeal to the Board but may seek redress through the Office of Special Counsel).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A prohibited personnel practice is defined by 5 USC 2302 as a personnel action taken for any one of a number of enumerated prohibited reasons. The actions prohibited are the following: (1) discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disabling (handicapping) condition, marital status, or political affiliation; (2) use of a recommendation for personnel action if the recommendation is not based on personal knowledge and does not consist of an evaluation of work-related factors; (3) coercion of political activity or action against an individual as reprisal for refusal to engage in political activity; (4) deception or obstruction of an individual's right to compete for employment; (5) improvement or impairment of the employment prospects of an individual by influencing another to withdraw from competition for a position; (6) improvement or impairment of the employment prospects of an individual by granting a preference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or regulation; (7) nepotism; (8) reprisal against statutorily defined whistleblowers; (9) reprisal against individuals who exercise appeal rights, testify for or assist others in covered appeals, cooperate with or disclose information to an Inspector General or to OSC, or refuse to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law; (10) discrimination on the basis of individual conduct unrelated to work requirements, suitability, or fitness; (11) violation of a veterans preference requirement; (12) actions that violate laws, rules, or regulations implementing or concerning merit system principles identified in 5 USC 2301; (13) use of certain nondisclosure agreements or policies; (14) access to medical records of an employee or applicant as part of, or in furtherance of, conduct in (1-13). [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-11-100.html#sec4-101">Chapter 12</a> for Board appeals raising affirmative defenses of discrimination under the civil rights laws.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Prohibited personnel practice defensive allegations occur in personnel actions within the appellate jurisdiction of the Board or, in IRA appeals, as affirmative allegations concerning actual or threatened statutorily defined personnel actions. For purposes of IRA or OSC corrective action jurisdiction, a personnel action is defined at 5 USC 2302(a)(2) as an appointment, promotion, detail, transfer or reassignment, reinstatement, restoration or reemployment, performance evaluation under Chapter 43, or any action under Chapter 75 or other disciplinary or corrective action; a decision concerning pay, benefits, awards, or education and training if the education or training may reasonably be expected to lead to an appointment, promotion, or performance evaluation; or a decision to order psychiatric testing or examination, or a significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appeal is analyzed by the Board to determine if the action complained of comes within the appellate jurisdiction of the Board under 5 USC 7512 or under the IRA provisions at 5 USC 1221 (providing protection to whistleblowers) and 5 USC 2302(b)(8, 9), indirectly incorporating the personnel actions enumerated at 5 USC 2302(a)(2). If it does, the appeal can be filed directly with the MSPB, subject to preliminary resort to OSC for IRA appeals. If the action does not fall within the appellate jurisdiction of the Board, but the employee believes a personnel action (or threatened action) under &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2) was taken for one of the prohibited motives listed in 5 USC 2302(b) other than whistleblowing, a complaint can be filed with OSC. That right can be important for employees who have suffered a job action not directly appealable to the Board. The OSC complaint may be the employee's only redress. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Bowen</span>, 815 F.2d 1505 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (and cases discussed by the court). If there is a choice between initiating a case with OSC as an IRA and then taking it to the MSPB, or first taking the case to MSPB as an otherwise appealable action, consideration must be given to delay that may be entailed through the OSC process, the possibility of obtaining a stay of the personnel action through the OSC process, and the limitation of the scope of the case before the MSPB if the case started with OSC is then taken to the MSPB--matters discussed in later sections of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Postal Service is not an agency covered by the prohibited personnel practice provisions of the Reform Act, its employees may raise through appealable actions affirmative defenses that include prohibited personnel practices, <span class="Italic">Butler v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 45, 48 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We concur with the Postal Service's contention that it is excluded from the provisions of &#x00A7; 2302(b) and therefore from direct application of those provisions by virtue of the fact that it is not an executive agency pursuant to &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C). However, this had no bearing upon the right of a covered employee, entitled to appeal to the Board, to present an affirmative defense to the agency action pursuant to &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B). By the plain terms of &#x00A7; 7701 all employees who have the right to appeal must have the same rights. Furthermore, &#x00A7; 2302(b) does not "refer" to &#x00A7; 7701. Rather, &#x00A7; 7701 refers to &#x00A7; 2303(b) and to prohibited personnel practices described therein. It is a well settled principle of law that "[w]hen the reference is made to a specific section of a statute, that part of a statute is taken as though written into the referenced statute." <span class="Italic">See 2A, Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction &#x00A7;</span> 51.08 n.6. (4th ed. 1972). Consequently, employees entitled to appeal to the Board are entitled to raise the affirmative defenses set forth in &#x00A7; 7701 including an allegation of an agency prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The procedures for bringing prohibited personnel practice cases to the Board before the 1989 WPA (and still in effect for non-IRA cases) were discussed in <span class="Italic">Wren v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2 MSPR 1, 2, 2 MSPB 174 (1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act provides three routes by which allegations of prohibited personnel practices may be brought within the Board's adjudicative jurisdiction: (1) by petition of the Special Counsel under 1206 and 1208; (2) by petition of "any interested person" for review under 1205(3) of an allegedly invalid OPM regulation; or (3) as an affirmative defense under 7701(c)(2)(B) to any action which "is appealable to the Board under law, rule or regulation," as provided in 7701(a). With respect to the latter route, 2302(b) is not an independent source of appellate jurisdiction for the Board; that provision itself authorizes no appeals. Therefore, the personnel action which is the subject of the appeal must first be brought within the Board's appellate jurisdiction under some other "law, rule, or regulation," 7701(a), before the Board may consider a <span id="Page_3577"></span>7701(c)(2)(B) affirmative defense. Not only is this plain from the language of 7701, Congress also expressly recognized that not all prohibited personnel practices are appealable to the Board in authorizing the Special Counsel to seek corrective action for patterns of prohibited personnel practices which involve "matters not otherwise appealable to the Board[.]" 1206(h).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 153 F.3d 1348, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1998) ("Section 2302(b)(4) cannot establish Board jurisdiction because &#x00A7; 2302(b) is not an independent source of appellate jurisdiction and does not by itself authorize an appeal to the Board.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A cautionary note: OSC does a thorough investigation of a small fraction of the complaints filed by employees, and it brings far fewer cases before the Board. IRA cases present immediate jurisdictional issues for the Board and for practitioners. When an IRA appeal is filed, an appellant is often immediately confronted with an order from the AJ, or a dismissal motion from the agency, or both, testing the legal sufficiency of the appeal. The Board essentially challenges the appellant to demonstrate that the Board has been presented with a legally sufficient whistleblower case. A firm understanding of Board case law is important when filing a complaint with OSC (an OSC-14 [previously OSC-11] form is used in an IRA case), as well as when asserting affirmative defenses in appeals before the Board. The OSC complaint and the later Board appeal must both encompass allegations sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because a legally sufficient IRA appeal to the Board depends on a legally sufficient underlying complaint to OSC, the complaint to OSC should be specific. It should be accompanied by relevant evidence at the complainant's disposal and a legal memorandum relating Board case law to the evidence submitted. It is useful to provide a cover letter with the complaint informing OSC that the evidence being provided is not all-inclusive and that further evidence will be provided on request, and requesting that the complainant be kept informed of all developments concerning the OSC inquiry. Although even this does not guarantee an OSC investigation, less will likely result in summary rejection of the complaint. The format of an OSC complaint will be subsequently discussed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although more attention and analysis is provided in Board cases to IRA appeals than to other types of prohibited personnel practice cases, the greatest number of prohibited practice allegations (often involving race, sex, or age discrimination) arise in affirmative defenses to straightforward appeals involving removals, suspensions, and demotions. An affirmative defense includes a prohibited personnel practice identified by 5 USC 2302(b). <span class="Italic">Baum v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 14 MSPR 392, 395 (1983) (claim that the agency deliberately assigned too much work to the appellant). The burden of proof in all affirmative defenses rests with the party who asserts the defense. <span class="Italic">Zidele v. DLA</span>, 6 MSPR 455, 457 (1981); <span class="Italic">Riggin v. DHHS</span>, 6 MSPR 24, 27-28 (1981)("As set forth in <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 1 M.S.P.R. 505 (1980), the burden of establishing an affirmative defense is on the employee."). [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-11-100.html#sec4-101">Chapter 12</a> for EEO affirmative defenses and mixed case appeals.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As an affirmative defense, proof of a prohibited personnel practice may negate an otherwise valid personnel action. The allegation that the personnel action is based on a prohibited reason is not reached by the AJ until it is determined that the agency proved its case against the employee. This point was emphasized by a concurring opinion of the late Judge Helen Nies of the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 7701(c)(2)(B) provides that an adverse action may not be sustained if the employee shows that the decision was based on any prohibited personnel practice described in 2302(b). In an adverse action proceeding, the affirmative defense of reprisal is significant only in those cases which have been determined to have merit. Thus, the merits cannot be the determinative factor that there was no reprisal. A meritorious adverse action must be set aside where there is reprisal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming an otherwise valid agency action against the employee, under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(b) the agency action, even though supported by preponderant evidence, must be reversed if the appellant establishes an affirmative defense, e.g., reprisal for the exercise of an appeal right, <span class="Italic">Parker v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 4 MSPR 97, 99 (1980), if the requisite burden of proof, discussed below, is met.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once the affirmative defense of a prohibited personnel practice is asserted in an appeal, the AJ is charged with proper analysis of the affirmative defense. In <span class="Italic">Buercklin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 1 MSPR 390, 1 MSPB 375 (1980), the appellant defended against a RIF action by claiming that it was a reprisal for his successful pursuit of classification appeals. The AJ's analysis was incomplete. Summarizing the elements of proof that will later be covered in this chapter, the Board required an analysis of whether the employee was engaged in protected activity, whether he was subsequently treated in an adverse fashion by the employer, and whether there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 391. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of Army</span>, 1 MSPR 428, 429, 1 MSPB 413 (1980) (lawsuit against employee's agency as cause of reprisal). The order of proof is significant: the AJ first determines the merits of the charges and then addresses the prohibited personnel practice defense. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Romero v. EEOC</span>, 55 MSPR 527, 538 (1992) ("The instant performance-based demotion action is within the Board's jurisdiction. Therefore, in connection with this appeal, the appellant is entitled to raise, as an affirmative defense, a claim that the agency violated 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) in taking that action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Golden v. Department of the Army</span>, 41 MSPR 501, 506 (1989)."); <span class="Italic">Wright v. FAA</span>, 40 MSPR 355, 357 (1989) ("Proper disposition of the case requires that a decision be reached on the merits of the case prior to consideration of appellant's affirmative defenses."). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-20-198.html#sec13-192">Order of Proof</a>."] For IRA appeals, the analysis differs. IRA appeals are discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-09-018.html#sec2-19">Individual Right of Action</a>."</p>
