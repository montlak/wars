<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-81"><span class="space">h.</span> Timeliness of Appeal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency may raise an issue concerning the timeliness of an appeal of a constructive demotion if the appellant's appeal is not filed within 30 days of a reclassification of his former job. The Board did not address timeliness of these appeals at length, <span class="Italic">Best v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 670, 674 (1993), noted that "we find that good cause exists for the untimely filing because the agency did not provide him with notice of any appeal rights to the Board, and the evidence does not indicate that he delayed in filing the appeal after he became aware of the basis for his claim." In <span class="Italic">Best</span> the reassignment was in October of 1990; <span id="Page_2051"></span>the reclassification was in January of 1992; and the appeal was filed several months after the reclassification. <span class="Italic">Wasson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 61 MSPR 575, 578-80 (1994), involved a delay of sixteen years in an appeal based on what was apparently claimed by the appellant to be a constructive downgrading when, in 1977, the GS-13 Air Traffic Controller position that he left through geographical reassignment was upgraded shortly after the reassignment. The Board did not actually acknowledge the case as a <span class="Italic">Russell</span> appeal, but avoiding close analysis of when the appellant should have been on notice of an appeal right, the Board found the appellant had not exercised due diligence in determining the existence of that right:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant explained below his delay in filing the appeal by citing severe health problems that he has experienced. He also asserted that he had gone "through all the appropriate channels" within the agency to obtain the relief that he sought and that he had "contacted various [agency] officials by phone" for that purpose. He stated that he had communicated with Senator David Boren and Congressman Dave McCurdy in an unsuccessful effort to have the problem resolved. Finally, as noted above, he claimed that he was unaware of the Board's existence until Congressman McCurdy informed him about it. Even assuming the truth of these statements, and that they also encompass unfamiliarity with the Civil Service Commission, we find that they do not establish good cause for the long delay in filing this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim that he was unaware of the Board's existence is implicitly an argument that his appeal was untimely because the agency failed to inform him of his appeal rights. In <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 673 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the court held that the failure of an agency to give notice to an appellant of appeal rights constituted good cause for the late filing of her appeal. In <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, however, the agency had a clear duty under the regulations to inform the appellant of her appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 839 F.2d at 671-72.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant here transferred to the Shreveport facility, a reassignment that the appellant has stated was taken to advance his career and/or to correct problems at that facility; it is unclear whether the reassignment was ordered by the agency or was effected at his request. In any event, his transfer to the Shreveport facility apparently resulted in his not receiving the upgrade to the GS-14 level that was allegedly given to all GS-13 Air Traffic Controllers at DFW. The appellant, however, has not offered into the record any contemporaneous agency document that would constitute a specific "decision" by the agency to deny him an upgrade to the GS-14 level, nor has he introduced any evidence that the agency refused to give him appeal rights in connection with an appealable action. Similarly, the appellant has not specifically described the content of his conversations with agency officials regarding this matter. Under the circumstances of this appeal, then, we cannot find that the failure to upgrade the appellant's position was on its face an action within the Board's jurisdiction, so that the agency's obligation to inform the appellant of Board appeal rights was clearly triggered. For that reason, we reject the argument that his untimely filing should be excused based on the agency's failure to inform him of his appeal rights<span class="Italic">. See Schrum v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 42 MSPR 103, 104-07 (1989); <span class="Italic">Ricci v. Veterans Administration</span>, 40 MSPR 113, 116 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the record does not show that the appellant made diligent efforts to pursue his appeal rights during the period (more than sixteen years) preceding this appeal. We recognize that the appellant has stated both below and on petition for review that he has serious health problems. Those health problems, however, did not prevent his apparently extensive efforts to resolve the matter through contacts with agency officials as well as with Senator Boren and Congressman McCurdy. Regarding those contacts, his general comments about conversations with agency officials, do not show that he directly asked them whether he had appeal rights, and are thus insufficient to establish that he acted with due diligence, <span class="Italic">see Glugoski</span>, 58 MSPR at 519. The appellant has stated that Congressman McCurdy informed him about the Board; the record contains a February 1993 letter to the congressman in which the appellant states that the congressman "mentioned some...Board I could appeal to...I'm not familiar with this, plus I doubt I would have a chance...people look down on OWCP recipients." The appellant has not offered any explanation of why he did not pursue this information further by finding out how to contact the Board in order to explore any possible appeal rights, so that the remaining six months of his filing delay could have been avoided.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the exceptionally lengthy period of untimeliness at issue here, then, as well as indications in the record that the appellant was capable of discovering and exploring possible avenues of relief, we cannot find that he pursued a possible Board appeal with due diligence<span class="Italic">. See Glugoski</span>, 58 MSPR at 519; <span class="Italic">Farrell v. Department of Justice</span>, 50 MSPR 504, 509 (1991). Accordingly, we find no good cause to waive the deadline for filing this appeal<span class="Italic">. See Alonzo</span>, 4 MSPR at 184.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Guzy v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 64 MSPR 470, 472 (1994), suggested that an appeal would likely be timely when it was filed soon after the appellant's discovery that a prior position was recently upgraded; timeliness was not to be measured from the date of the appellant's reassignment but from the time he became aware of the subsequent upgrading of the job. <span class="Italic">Ellis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 80 MSPR 321, 324-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11 (1998), refined analysis of the timeliness of a <span class="Italic">Russell</span> appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, an appellant must show that she exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR at 184. To determine whether the appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of her excuse and her showing of due diligence, whether she is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether she has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond her control, unavoidable casualty, or misfortune that affected her ability to comply with the time limits. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Guzy v. Department of the Interior,</span> 64 MSPR 470, 472 (1994), the Board held that an appellant must exercise due diligence to file a constructive demotion appeal once she becomes aware of the jurisdictional facts underlying such an appeal, even where, as here, the agency did not provide any notice of appeal rights. Thus, the question is when the appellant became aware of the jurisdictional facts underlying her constructive demotion appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contended that she was informed by her supervisors, even before her November 12, 1995 reassignment, that all GS-5 Supply Clerk positions in the ISSOT would be upgraded. <span class="Italic">Ellis</span>, 76 MSPR at 105. The agency disputed this contention, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, and no further details were provided by either party regarding the nature of this alleged information. The record shows that a GS-5 Supply Technician position in the ISSOT was upgraded to GS-6 on May 10, 1996, and that the resulting noncompetitive promotion of an incumbent of that position was approved by the division head on August 28, 1996. In a September 15, 1997 affidavit, submitted in response to the AJ's timeliness show-cause notice, the appellant contended that she did not learn, until reading an e-mail message sometime in September 1996, that her former GS-5 position had been actually upgraded to GS-6. This contention was not disputed by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Information allegedly provided to the appellant, prior to her reassignment, that her position would be upgraded sometime in the future might have raised questions in her mind as to whether her position was misclassified. However, it would be unreasonable to expect the appellant to have rushed to file a constructive demotion appeal based on such vague and speculative information. A reassignment constitutes a constructive demotion only if the position in question should have been upgraded prior to the reassignment due to a classification error or a change in the classification standards, rather than due to a planned management action such as accretion of duties<span class="Italic">. See Ellis,</span> 76 MSPR at 107 &#x0026; n.3. Thus, only after learning of the actual upgrading and the surrounding circumstances could she make an informed decision on whether to pursue a constructive demotion appeal. We therefore find that under the circumstances presented here the appellant's duty to exercise due diligence to file this appeal was not triggered until she learned that her former position was actually upgraded. <span class="Italic">See Guzy</span>, 64 MSPR at 472.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant's argument on review that <span class="Italic">Sarter</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 69 MSPR 335, 338 (1996), on which the AJ relied, is distinguishable. Unlike here, in <span class="Italic">Sarter</span> the purported upgrading actually occurred prior to Sarter's reassignment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under those circumstances, the Board found that Sarter's awareness of the upgrading, even before his reassignment, triggered a duty on his part to exercise due diligence to promptly file his constructive demotion appeal after he was reassigned. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The circumstances here are more similar to those in <span class="Italic">Guzy</span>, where Guzy's former position was upgraded after his reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Guzy,</span> 64 MSPR at 471. Where the appellant promptly filed the appeal within 30 days after she learned of the upgrading, and the agency has not alleged or shown substantial prejudice due to the untimely filing, we find, under the circumstances, good cause for the delayed filing. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 472.</p>
