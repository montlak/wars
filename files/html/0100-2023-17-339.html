<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-337"><span class="space">21.</span> Contracting Out</h4>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 42 FLRA 377, 388-99 (1991), applying <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 110 S. Ct. 1623 (1990) [discussed in Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-123.html#sec6-124">Contracting Out</a>"], arbitrators could enforce provisions of OMB A-76 in the context of arbitration cases challenging contracting out procedures and decisions. The D.C. Circuit declined to enforce FLRA's 1991 decision. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 996 F.2d 1246, 1248-50 (D.C. Cir. 1993). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Carson</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 203-09 (1993), signaled acceptance of the D.C. Circuit result in the context of a proposal having more general application under OMB Circular A-76 than the application of a contractual grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA then determined that arbitrators lack authority to decide grievances protesting contracting out, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1513 and Dept. of Navy, Whidbey Island</span>, 52 FLRA 717, 719-22 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's award, in which he found that the claim of a violation of OMB Circular A-76 does not concern a grievable or arbitrable matter, is fully consistent with the Authority and judicial precedent upon which the Arbitrator relied. In <span class="Italic">Fort Carson</span> [<span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 and Dept. of Army, Ft., Carson</span>, 48 FLRA 168 (1993)], the Authority adopted the D.C. Circuit's conclusion in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> [<span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 996 F.2d 1246 (D.C. Cir. 1993)] that OMB Circular A-76, which includes the Supplemental Handbook thereto, is a Government-wide regulation that bars subjecting disputes over an agency's compliance with that Circular to arbitration. In this regard, the D.C. Circuit stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It is obvious that collective bargaining over the method for resolving disputes concerning application of the Circular and arbitration of claimed "violations" of the Circular would both be inconsistent with the terms of the Circular. The regulation sets out an exclusive method of resolving any claims regarding its implementation and forbids negotiation <span class="Italic">or</span> <span class="Italic">arbitration</span> over the process or decisions issuing from the process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 996 F.2d at 1250 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Arbitrator correctly concluded, in light of the controlling case law, that the grievance is not arbitrable because the Supplemental Handbook to OMB Circular A-76 provides an exclusive appeal procedure within the Agency to challenge the Agency's compliance with that Circular.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union correctly notes that the Authority has held that OMB Circular A-76 is an "applicable law," within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2). <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 42 FLRA 377, 399 (1991), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied on other grounds sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal <span id="page_2336"></span>Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 996 F.2d 1246 (D.C. Cir. 1993). However, the fact that OMB Circular A-76 is an "applicable law" does not necessarily mean that disputes concerning its application are arbitrable. In this regard, section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute provides that the right to contract out must be exercised in accordance with applicable laws and, as Circular A-76 constitutes an applicable law, the right must be exercised in accordance with the terms of the Circular. By its terms, the Circular "sets out an exclusive method of resolving any claims regarding its implementation and forbids...arbitration over the process or decisions issuing from the process<span class="Italic">." IRS</span>, 996 F.2d at 1250 (footnote omitted). Thus, even though determinations regarding contracting out must be made in accordance with the Circular, the Circular itself bars grievances under the negotiated grievance process. As such, the Arbitrator correctly held that the grievance is not arbitrable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the Union's claims that because the Circular is an applicable law, it is within the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure under section 7103(a)(9)(C) of the Statute and OMB cannot limit the scope of a grievance procedure by precluding grievances. In <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the court stated that the Circular itself "supplants the grievance procedures, [and to allow the Union] to add them back would...destroy the exemption from bargaining" in section 7117(a). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1252. The court held:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[I]f a [G]overnment-wide regulation under section 7117(a) is itself the only basis for a union grievance--that is, if there is no pre-existing legal right upon which the grievance can be based--and the regulation precludes bargaining over its implementation or prohibits grievances concerning alleged violations, the Authority may not require a [G]overnment agency to bargain over grievance procedures directed at implementation of the regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court specifically rejected the argument made by the Union in this case that OMB is not authorized to promulgate a Government-wide regulation that limits the scope of grievance procedures by precluding grievances concerning an agency's compliance with that same Government-wide regulation. As an initial matter, the court stated that there are "important limitations on the [G]overnment's ability to diminish the scope of collective bargaining through [G]overnment-wide regulations<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1251 (citing <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. FLRA</span>, 864 F.2d 165 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">OPM</span>)). Specifically, the court stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the [G]overnment could not gain the exemption from bargaining in section 7117(a) merely by restating with broader effect a provision in the management rights section. But...the [G]overnment could obtain the full benefit of the exemption if instead of developing new management powers not granted by the [Statute], it "directs the exercise of existing management prerogatives in a <span class="Italic">specific</span> way, so that <span class="Italic">particular</span> subjects...are identified as inappropriate topics of bargaining."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">OPM</span>, 864 F.2d at 171). The court found that Circular A-76 "meets this test" because, unlike the Government-wide regulation at issue in OPM, it sets forth substantive and procedural limitations on an agency's right to contract out under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, because "[t]he Circular does not purport to expand on management rights[,]" the court concluded that OMB may limit the scope of grievance procedures concerning an agency's compliance with the Circular's substantive requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has adopted the court's conclusion in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> that collective bargaining agreements may not contain provisions that would subject disputes over compliance with OMB Circular A-76 to the negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Fort Carson</span>, 48 FLRA at 206. Therefore, for the reasons stated by the court in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, we reject the Union's argument with respect to the facts in this case that OMB cannot limit the scope of a grievance procedure by precluding grievances.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg</span>, 52 FLRA 1348, 1351 (1997) (following <span class="Italic">Whidbey Island</span>); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs and UPTO</span>, 60 FLRA 595, 597 (2005) (although arbitrator could direct agency to fill a position under its contract, it could not preclude agency from contracting job out).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator could decide a basic issue of whether the agency's contracting out process violated the parties' labor agreement; that is, the matter was arbitrable, as in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Mobile and IFPTE</span>, 64 FLRA 508, 508-10 (2010), reviewing an award concluding there was a violation of the agreement, although the award provided no specific remedy:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator sustained a grievance alleging that the Agency violated the parties' agreement and/or Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76 (A-76) when it contracted out work without first conducting a cost comparison and negotiating with the Union. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the Agency's management's-right exception and deny the remaining exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contracted out certain work without first negotiating with the Union or comparing the cost of contracting out the work with the cost of having Agency employees perform the work.&#x2003;A grievance was filed and, when the grievance was not resolved, it was submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator framed the issues as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Does the Arbitrator have jurisdiction to hear and decide the grievance[?]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Does the collective bargaining agreement require a cost comparison before a contract...is awarded to an outside contractor?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator noted that the parties disputed whether a Supplemental Handbook (the Handbook) to A-76 precluded him from exercising jurisdiction, but he found that the Handbook was "not dispositive of this case." In this connection, he stated that the parties' agreement "contains language concerning the contracting out of work[,]" the Union "claims a violation of that language[,]" and the Arbitrator "has the jurisdiction to decide the meaning, application, and interpretation of those contractual provisions." The Arbitrator determined that the parties' agreement "requires good faith negotiations[&#8197;]" and stated that the Union has "a right to discuss" the contracting out matter in this case with the Agency. In this regard, the Arbitrator stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The parties could discuss the pros and cons of contracting out or doing the work by in-house personnel. They could review the impact on current and future employees. They could look at the cost figures. Everyone wants to see the Government "get its money's worth." But, there weren't any negotiations in this instance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Arbitrator stated that "[i]t <span class="Italic">also</span> appears to be clear that the [Agency] did not follow a couple of requirements" set forth in A-76 and, thus, "appears to have violated" A-76. (emphasis added). He then stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The totality of the evidence leads to the conclusion that the [Agency] violated the terms of the collective bargaining agreement <span class="Italic">and</span>...A-76. It did not conduct a required cost comparison. It did not bargain in good faith with the Union over this operations and maintenance contract. It did not negotiate on personnel policies and practices and other matters relating to or affecting working conditions of the employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Arbitrator sustained the grievance. He did not, however, provide a specific remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Agency's contrary-to-law exception does not provide a basis for setting aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator framed one of the pertinent issues as whether the "<span class="Italic">collective bargaining agreement</span> require[s] a cost comparison. He found that the Handbook "is not dispositive of this case[,]" and that he had "jurisdiction to decide the meaning, application[,] and interpretation of th[e] <span class="Italic">contractual provisions</span>[&#8197;]" at issue. Addressing those provisions, he determined that the parties' agreement "requires good faith negotiations[&#8197;]" and "discuss[ions]" with the Union, as well as discussions regarding "the pros and cons of contracting out[,]" including "look[ing] at the cost figures." He found that, by failing to comply with those provisions, the Agency "violated the terms of the <span class="Italic">collective bargaining agreement</span>[.]" We have denied the Agency's essence exception. Thus, as the Arbitrator's finding of a contractual violation constitutes a separate and independent basis for his award, there is no basis for setting aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency's exceptions could be construed as arguing that A-76 deprived the Arbitrator of jurisdiction over the entire grievance, including the alleged contractual violation. However, the Agency does not cite, and the record does not disclose, any authority for the proposition that A-76 precludes arbitrators from resolving claims alleging contractual violations, as opposed to claims alleging violations of A-76 itself. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Local 1513,</span> 52 FLRA 717, 718-22 (1996) (grievance alleging violation of A-76 found not arbitrable). Accordingly, to the extent that the Agency makes this argument, we reject it.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator properly enforced a contract provision requiring management to meet and confer with the union concerning impact on the unit associated with a decision to contract out work, <span class="Italic">DHHS, NIH and AFGE Local 2419</span>, 64 FLRA 266, 269 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 33, &#x00A7; 2 by "failing to meet and confer with the Union...relative to any impact on bargaining unit employees associated with the decision to contract out bargaining unit work[,]" and the Arbitrator directed the Agency to "cease and desist from similar future violations[.]" According to the Agency, this aspect of the award excessively interferes with its rights to assign work and contract out because:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Management's ability to contract out work on a temporary basis would require notice and discussion with the union on every occasion it determines a need to use contractors. This threatens the agency's mission when it is unable to act quickly and responsively to its operational needs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2337"></span>Exceptions at 11-12.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To begin, the Agency mischaracterizes the award. As set forth above, the award merely requires the Agency to "meet and confer" with the Union regarding "impact" on employees from a decision to contract out; it does not require the Agency to meet and confer in the absence of impact. Moreover, the Agency's claim that the provision, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, is not enforceable because it would prevent it from acting quickly is contrary to Authority precedent. In this regard, in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the Authority held that "proposals that simply defer the exercise of management rights pending the completion of the statutory bargaining process" are negotiable procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Antilles Consol. Educ. Ass'n,</span> 61 FLRA 327, 332 (2005). There is no argument, or basis for concluding, that the requirement in Article 33, &#x00A7; 2 to meet and confer on contracting-out decisions that affect unit employees imposes requirements other than those that already exist under the Statute. As such, <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> supports the conclusion that Article 33, &#x00A7; 2 is an enforceable procedure. As the Agency makes no other arguments that the award is inconsistent with management rights, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Despite the Agency's reference to its mission, the Agency does not cite 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) or otherwise explain how the award affects the Agency's right to determine its mission. To the extent the Agency's argument can be construed as raising a claim regarding the right to determine the Agency's mission, we reject it as a bare assertion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tuscon, Ariz.,</span> 63 FLRA 241, 244 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 68 FLRA 1027, 1034 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting), noted impact bargaining obligations, enforceable in arbitration, concerning contracting out:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the dissent's statement that we "refuse[&#8197;] to address th[e] seminal issue" of whether the Arbitrator's finding of a bargaining obligation is contrary to law. But we have addressed, above, the only contrary-to-law claims that are properly before us. We also note the dissent's assertion that the Agency's decision to contract out part of its IT functions is a management right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, and, "[t]herefore," that the Arbitrator's finding of a bargaining obligation "is contrary to law" because the Union "has no say." To the extent that the dissent is implying that the Union has absolutely no say in matters involving management rights, that is clearly not the case. Section 7106(a) of the Statute undoubtedly sets forth various rights that are reserved to management, but those rights are expressly "<span class="Italic">[s]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">ubject to</span>" &#x00A7; 7106(b).[98] Section 7106(b)(2) requires bargaining over the procedures that management will observe when it exercises a management right,[99] and &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) requires bargaining over appropriate arrangements for employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of a management right.[100] So, when an agency makes a change that involves the exercise of management rights, the union has the right to bargain over the impact and implementation of that change[101]--precisely what the Arbitrator found here. In other words, the Union does have a say, even though its say is limited to the right to bargain impact and implementation.</p>

As such, Article 31 independently imposes certain contracting-out requirements on the Agency. And, by finding that the Agency violated the parties' agreement when it contracted out work "without following A-76 rules and notice and comment procedures set forth in Article 31," the Arbitrator was enforcing the contracting-out procedures in the parties' agreement--not A-76 itself. Consequently, the award is not contrary to A-76.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Before 1993, a considerable body of law developed in the area of contracting out cases. Those cases, along with a few postdating the Supreme Court decision in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 110 S. Ct. 1623 (1990) [discussed in Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-123.html#sec6-124">Contracting Out</a>"], are noted below.</p>
<p class="noindent">A grievance could raise a failure of the agency to comply with OMB Circular A-76 restrictions on contracting out. <span class="Italic">Fitzsimons Army Med. Ctr. and AFGE Local 2214</span>, 16 FLRA 355, 356-57 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals and EEOC</span>, 10 FLRA 3 (1982), <span class="Italic">enforced</span> <span class="Italic">EEOC v. FLRA</span>, No. 82-2310 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 21, 1984)). FLRA addressed the remedial authority of an arbitrator in grievances disputing determinations of agencies to contract out agency work in <span class="Italic">Blytheville AFB and AFGE Local 2840</span>, 22 FLRA 656, 658-62 (1986). FLRA set aside arbitration rulings holding disputes over contracting out to be nonarbitrable. One ruling, based on <span class="Italic">Defense Language Inst. v. FLRA</span>, 767 F.2d 1398, 1401 (9th Cir. 1985), was set aside; FLRA noted that, even without a specific negotiated contract provision requiring an agency to comply with the provisions of OMB A-76, a grievance over whether a procurement action complied with the Circular was within the broad scope grievance procedure under the Statute unless the parties have specifically excluded the matter from the negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1513 and Naval Air Station, Whidbey Island</span>, 26 FLRA 289, 291 (1987) (arbitrator's ruling that grievance was not arbitrable was removed as a bar to further resolution of grievance; FLRA did not remand the case to arbitrator or state what the next step should be).</p>
<p class="noindent">Contracting out cases were essentially reviewed under the same strict "but for" test applied to promotion or other back pay cases. The arbitrator was to make the essential finding that a contract was awarded through failure to comply with mandatory and nondiscretionary provisions of procurement law or regulation. Speculation as to what might have occurred was insufficient. A back pay award predicated on a finding that the contract should have been canceled would not be sustained if the underlying determination concerning the contract was not sustained on exceptions to the award. <span class="Italic">Oakland Army Base and AFGE Local 1157</span>, 23 FLRA 199, 201-02 (1986). An award directing the cancelation of a procurement was set aside when the arbitrator based his decision on an obligation that the arbitrator felt Congress intended but not specifically provided for in the statute. An arbitrator could only sustain a challenge to a procurement action on the basis that the agency failed to comply with mandatory and nondiscretionary provisions of applicable procurement law or regulation. <span class="Italic">Naval Air Station, Whiting Field and AFGE Local 1954</span>, 22 FLRA 1059, 1061 (1986). An award was partially set aside and modified that found a violation based upon the "spirit and intent" of contracting regulations; only a clear violation of mandatory regulations would support an order directing reconstruction of the action. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ctr. for Toxicological Research and AFGE Local 3393</span>, 27 FLRA 40, 42 (1987). An award concerning the failure of the agency to provide the union a copy of the solicitation package relating to a decision to contract out was sustained to the extent that the agency was ordered to comply with the contract in the future; but the Authority set aside the portion of the award that canceled the procurement action. The arbitrator made no finding that the agency failed to comply with mandatory and nondiscretionary provisions of procurement law and regulation. <span class="Italic">Army Communications Command Agency, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 23 FLRA 179, 182 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Army Communications Command, Fort McClellan and AFGE Local 1941</span>, 23 FLRA 184, 187-88 (1986). In the context of contracting out, an award ordering the cancelation of a procurement action and restoring six employees to their former positions was deficient under the standards of <span class="Italic">Blytheville AFB</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. For there to be a remedy, the arbitrator was required to find that the agency's failure to comply with A-76 materially affected its final procurement decision and that the failure harmed unit employees. <span class="Italic">HCFA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 30 FLRA 1282, 1288 (1988). Once there was a finding that the agency failed to comply with mandatory and nondiscretionary provisions of OMB Circular A-76 and that the violation harmed unit employees, the arbitrator could direct reconstruction of the procurement action and take appropriate action based on the results of the reconstruction. <span class="Italic">Army Eng'r Dist., St. Louis and AFGE Local 3838</span>, 26 FLRA 398, 400 (1987). For an example of analysis of the <span class="Italic">Blytheville AFB</span> case involving cost studies conducted in contracting decisions, refer to <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Pac. Missile Test Ctr., Point Mugu and NAGE Local R12-33</span>, 43 FLRA 157, 160-63 (1991). An arbitrator could enforce, in the context of a planned reorganization, the requirements of OMB Circular A-105 (April 1974) governing agency organization. The agreement's requirement did not interfere with the exercise of management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a). A union could enforce the requirement that the exercise of rights enumerated in &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) be in accordance with applicable laws. The condition was not tied to rights defined under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). <span class="Italic">GSA and AFGE Council 236</span>, 27 FLRA 3, 7-8 (1987).</p>
