<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-388"><span class="space">a.</span> Email Notices to Employees</h5>
<p class="noindent">Directing emailing of ULP findings of violations, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FTC Oklahoma City and AFGE Local 171</span>, 67 FLRA 221, 222-26 (2014), overruled earlier decisions declaring emailing to be a nontraditional (and, in the future, routine) remedy:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC argues that we should overturn FCI Florence's holding that electronic-notice posting is a "nontraditional" remedy, and should order such posting as a "traditional" remedy. For support, the GC cites the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">J &#x0026; R Flooring, Inc</span>. (<span class="Italic">J. Picini Flooring</span>).[14]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;356 NLRB No. 9 (Oct. 22, 2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the Authority's 2003 decision in <span class="Italic">FCI Florence</span>, the administrative law judge found that the respondent violated the Statute by, among other things, removing a union flyer from a bulletin board. With regard to the remedy, the judge noted the GC's claim that the respondent used television monitors and email to "customarily communicate with...employees," and agreed with the GC's claim that posting notices on television monitors and by email was "necessary." Accordingly, the judge directed such electronic postings. The respondent filed an exception <span id="page_1660"></span>with the Authority alleging that the remedy was a nontraditional remedy that was "extraordinary and unwarranted."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Resolving the respondent's exception, the Authority stated that the posting of a notice serves the two remedial goals of demonstrating to employees that: (1) the Authority will vigorously enforce rights guaranteed under the Statute; and (2) the respondent recognizes and intends to fulfill its obligations under the Statute. The Authority determined that posting notices on television monitors and by email was not necessary to serve these two goals. The Authority also "agree[d] with the [r]espondent that posting a notice on television monitors and through the [email] system would constitute a [nontraditional] remedy." Accordingly, the Authority applied the Authority's <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren</span> test for nontraditional remedies,[23] which is discussed in greater detail below. Although the GC claimed that the respondent communicated with employees through television monitors and email, the Authority did not address that claim and, instead, found that the remedy was not warranted under the <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren</span> test.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See </span>52 FLRA at 160.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Then, in 2010, the Board issued the decision in <span class="Italic">J. Picini Flooring</span>.[26] For reasons discussed more fully below, the Board determined that it would effectuate the purposes of the National Labor Relations Act (the NLRA) to make electronic-notice posting a standard remedy for violations of the NLRA. Accordingly, the Board modified its standard notice-Posting language to require electronic-notice posting, in addition to physical posting, when respondents customarily communicate with their employees (or, in cases of union respondents, their members) by electronic means.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;356 NLRB No. 9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC's exceptions present an issue of whether we should overturn <span class="Italic">FCI Florence's</span> holding that electronic-notice posting is a "nontraditional" remedy, and, instead, follow the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">J. Picini Flooring</span> that electronic-notice posting is a traditional remedy. Resolving that issue requires considering the Authority's remedial powers, the differences between traditional and nontraditional remedies, and the relative persuasiveness of the reasoning in <span class="Italic">FCI Florence</span> and <span class="Italic">J. Picini Flooring</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well settled that the Authority has a "broad range of remedial powers."[30] Section 7105(g)(3) of the Statute[31] provides that, in addition to issuing cease-and-desist orders, the Authority "may require an agency or a labor organization...to take any remedial action [the Authority] considers appropriate to carry out the policies of this chapter."[32] Section 7118(a)(7) similarly provides that the Authority may order a ULP respondent to take "such other action as will carry out the purpose of [the Statute]."[33] And the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the D.C.

For example, the Authority may not issue remedies that violate the principle of sovereign immunity[35] or direct a respondent to perform an illegal act.[36] And remedies for ULPs may not be punitive.[37]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the "broad objectives that [a ULP] remedy should serve," the Authority has stated that "remedies for [ULPs] under the Statute should, like those under the NLRA, be 'designed to recreate the conditions and relationships that would have been had there been no [ULP].'"[38] Further, the Authority stated that remedies must "effectuate the policies of the Statute."[39] In addition, although the deterrence of future violative conduct is not the principal objective of a remedial order, it is "certainly a desirable effect of a remedy."[40] And with particular regard to notice posting, as stated previously, the Authority has held that notices serve the goals of demonstrating to bargaining-unit employees that: (1) the Authority will vigorously enforce rights guaranteed by the Statute; and (2) the respondent recognizes and intends to fulfill its obligations under the Statute.[41]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren</span>, the Authority discussed the difference between "traditional" and "nontraditional" remedies. The Authority stated that traditional remedies--including cease-and-desist orders along with notice postings--are "provided in virtually all cases where a [ULP] is found," and added that "[o]ther remedies requiring some form of affirmative action by the respondent" have "also become established, including...a retroactive bargaining order, the grant of back[p]ay, and the release of improperly withheld information."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority contrasted these remedies with "nontraditional" remedies, such as requiring a management leader to write supervisors a memorandum reminding them to notify the union before conducting formal discussions with employees The Authority stated that before a nontraditional remedy may be ordered, the following test must be met:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[A]ssuming that there exist no legal or public[-]policy objections to a proposed, nontraditional remedy, the questions are whether the remedy is reasonably necessary and would be effective to 'recreate the conditions and relationships' with which the [ULP] interfered, as well as to effectuate the policies of the Statute, including the deterrence of future violative conduct.[48]</p>

As with other factual questions, the [GC] bears the burden of persuasion, and the [j]udge is responsible for initially determining whether the remedy is warranted."</p>

Specifically, the Authority stated that traditional remedies are presumed to "meet [the] criteria" for determining whether a remedy is appropriate. However, the Authority does not presume that nontraditional remedies meet these criteria. Instead, the Authority applies the test set forth in <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren</span> before ordering such remedies. And the Authority has emphasized that nontraditional remedies are not warranted merely because they would further a "salutary objective." Rather, they are appropriate "<span class="Italic">only</span> where traditional remedies will not adequately redress the wrong incurred by the [ULP]."[56]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">By holding that electronic-notice posting is a nontraditional remedy, <span class="Italic">FCI Florence </span>effectively limited this remedy to situations where the GC specifically litigates the issue and meets its burden of persuasion under the <span class="Italic">F.E.

Instead, the Authority merely "agree[d] with the [r]espondent" that "posting a notice on television monitors and through the [email] system would constitute a [nontraditional] remedy."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By contrast, the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">J.

And it is appropriate to consider that decision in addressing the GC's exception. As the Authority has held, "[w]hen there are comparable provisions under the Statute and the NLRA, decisions of the [Board] and the courts interpreting the NLRA have a high degree of relevance to similar circumstances under the Statute."[58] The Authority has previously recognized, moreover, that "Congress intended the Authority to have remedial authority in [ULP] cases similar to that granted the [Board] under the [NLRA]."[59] Further, the D.C. Circuit has stated that the "general remedial authority of the [Authority] under &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7)," including "the power to order 'such...action as will carry out the purpose of this chapter,'" is similar to 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 160(c), which grants the Board "broad remedial discretion in effectuating the purposes of the [NLRA]."[60]</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">In J. Picini Flooring</span>, the Board noted that a standard remedy for violations of the NLRA is an order to post notices "in conspicuous places including all places where notices to employees" or members "are customarily posted," such as on "bulletin boards." However, the Board stated, the "ubiquity of paper notices and wall[-]mounted bulletin boards...has gone the way of the telephone[-]message pad and the interoffice envelope." While bulletin boards remain in use, "email, postings on internal and external websites, and other electronic[-]communication tools are overtaking, if they have not already overtaken, bulletin boards as the primary means of communicating a uniform message to employees and union members." In this connection, the Board noted that electronic communications are "now the norm in many workplaces," and that "the Board and most other government agencies routinely and sometimes exclusively rely on electronic posting or email to communicate information to their employees." Further, the Board stated, the growth of telework and decentralized workspaces "mean that an increasing number of employees will never see a paper notice posted at an employer's facility."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board stated that the "increasing reliance on electronic communication" and the "attendant decrease in the prominence of paper notices and physical bulletin boards" mean that the "continuing efficacy of the Board's remedial notice is in jeopardy." Such notices "may be inadequate to reach employees and members who are accustomed to receiving important information from their employer or union electronically and are not accustomed to looking for such information on a traditional bulletin board."This is especially true, the Board noted, for employees who telework or work in decentralized workspaces. And the Board found that if notices are not "adequately communicated" to employees and members, then the remedial goals of notices will not be achieved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board determined that "it follows," as a "matter of general policy," that "in addition to physical posting, notices should be posted electronically, on a respondent's intranet or internet site, if the respondent customarily uses such electronic posting to communicate with its employees or members." Similarly, the Board stated, "notices should be distributed by email if the respondent customarily uses email to communicate with its employees or members, and by any other electronic means of communication so used by the respondent." Because electronic-notice posting would be ordered only where electronic means of communications were "customary," the Board stated, posting notices electronically would "not entail an unreasonable burden for...respondent[s]." And the Board held that the question of whether the respondent customarily disseminates information to its employees or members by email and/or electronic posting--as well as any issues regarding "peculiarities" in a respondent's electronic-communication systems, or claims that electronic-notice posting would be "unduly burdensome" for a respondent--could be resolved at the compliance stage of ULP proceedings. Finally, the Board clarified that it did not intend to broaden the scope of the standard notice-posting remedy. Rather, the Board stated, "electronic notices will have the same scope as notices posted by traditional means; that is, distribution will be limited, to the extent practicable, to the location(s) where the [ULPs] occurred."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">J. Picini Flooring</span> is both persuasive and relevant to the question of whether the Authority should make electronic-notice posting a standard remedy for ULPs. There is no dispute that in the federal sector, as in the private sector, there has been, and will continue to be, an increase in employee reliance on electronic communications. Thus, limiting notice postings to bulletin boards creates a risk that employees will be less likely to see those postings; making electronic-notice postings a standard remedy will help ensure that employees will be able to view the notices of ULP violations. As a result, supplementing physical-notice posting with electronic-notice posting can be presumed to provide a greater deterrent effect and more effectively help "recreate the conditions and relationships that would have been had there been no [ULP], as well as to effectuate the policies of the Statute, including the deterrence of future violative conduct."[77] Moreover, the Authority can presume that distributing notices electronically will enhance the benefits provided by paper notices--distributing electronic notices by email, intranet, or internet will provide another way to inform employees that the Authority will vigorously enforce their rights under the Statute, and that the respondent recognizes and intends to fulfill its obligations under the Statute.[78]</p>

Picini Flooring</span>, 356 NLRB No. 9, slip op. at 2 (notices "inform employees of steps to be taken by the respondent to remedy its violations of the [NLRA] and provide assurances that future violations will not occur").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, by the Authority holding that electronic-notice posting is a "traditional" remedy, parties will not have to spend resources litigating whether a request for electronic&#8209;notice posting meets the test set forth in <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren</span>.[79] Moreover, because electronic-notice posting is required in instances only where electronic communications are the norm, requiring electronic-notice posting will impose little to no burden on a respondent.[80] And consistent with the Board's approach, disputes as to whether the respondent customarily uses electronic means to communicate with employees--as well as other issues regarding a remedy's implementation--can be addressed at the compliance stage of ULP proceedings.[81]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[79]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA, Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Region II, Buffalo Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Buffalo, N.Y.</span>, 58 FLRA 722, 728 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting in part); <span class="Italic">Health Care Fin.

<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent does not cite any harms that would result from making electronic-notice posting a traditional remedy. Although the Respondent argues that it uses email for communication only "when there is a need for a quick dissemination and for convenience," that it "does not have a preset email distribution list that separates" unit from non-unit employees,and that there was "limited evidence presented at hearing" to indicate that it has "chosen electronic means as its preferred mode of communication with its employees," any potential problems with electronic-notice posting in this case can be worked out in the compliance stage. In addition, the Respondent states that the "limited evidence presented at hearing regarding only" the Respondent does not warrant overturning <span class="Italic">FCI Florence</span>. To the extent that the Respondent is arguing that the Authority should not rely on the limited evidence in this case to conclude that electronic-notice posting is warranted in all cases, we find that any necessary adjustments can be made in future cases' compliance proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we overturn <span class="Italic">FCI Florence's</span> determination that electronic&#8209;notice posting is a nontraditional remedy, and hold that electronic-notice posting is a traditional remedy. Accordingly, in this case, and in future decisions where ULPs are found, we adopt the following wording, which is similar to the wording of the Board order added in <span class="Italic">J. Picini Flooring</span>: "In addition to physical posting of paper notices, notices shall be distributed electronically, such as by email, posting on an intranet or an internet site, or other electronic means, if the Respondent customarily communicates with employees by such means."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In making this change, we emphasize three points. First, this change does not alter the time-tested requirement for parties to continue the physical posting of paper notices <span class="Italic">in addition</span> to any electronic posting that may be required. Maintaining the requirement for the posting of paper notices is significant because not all employees have access to the internet and may not be comfortable relying on email communications. Second, this change will apply equally to both agencies and unions that have been found to have engaged in ULPs. And third, this change does not broaden the number of bargaining-unit employees or work units that must be notified in the event that a posting is required. Rather, electronic notices will have the same scope as notices posted by traditional means; that is, distribution will be limited, to the extent practicable, to the location(s) where the ULPs occurred. As with physical postings, electronic notices will extend beyond the location where the violation occurred only "where the violation involve[s] an issue of import to [employees] who do not work at the site where the violations occurred."[86]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[86]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">OIA</span>, 55 FLRA at 395 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC also requests that we adopt wording that the Board did not adopt in <span class="Italic">J. Picini Flooring</span>, specifically: "If the Notice is disseminated by email, the cover email from the signatory shall state: We are distributing the attached Notice to All Employees to you pursuant to an Order from the [FLRA] finding that we violated [the Statute] in Case No. [&#8197;]." But the GC provides no explanation for why we should adopt this additional wording. As such, and as the Board has not adopted such wording, we decline to grant the GC's request.</p>
