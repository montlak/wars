<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-190"><span class="space">17.</span> Department of Defense Education Activity</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees of the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA--formerly Department of Defense Dependents Schools, "DODDS") may have adverse action appeal rights, although they may lack the ability to appeal to the Board reassignments that entail reductions in pay. Through 1994, under the appointment authority of 20 USC 241, DOD school personnel lacked adverse action protection unless they were preference eligibles. <span class="Italic">Todd v. DOD</span>, 63 MSPR 4, 6-10 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Todd v. MSPB</span>, 55 F.3d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Todd</span> interpreted 20 USC 241. That statute was repealed in 1994 and replaced with a statute providing more extensive adverse action appellate protections. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. DOD</span>, 82 MSPR 649, 651-55 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-17 (1999), involving a superintendent's appeal from a 14-day suspension, reduction in pay, and reassignment that was determined to be outside the Board's appellate jurisdiction, outlined the post-1994 statutory scheme:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 20 USC &#x00A7; 241, as amended, local Federal defense installations were permitted to employ personnel whose "compensation, tenure, leave, hours of work, and other incidents of the employment relationship may be fixed without regard to the Civil Service Act and rules and the following...(4) sections 3501 to 3504...7511, 7512, and 7701...of Title 5." Congress repealed 20 USC &#x00A7; 241(a), however, in 1994. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 103-382, &#x00A7; 331(b), 108 Stat. 3965 (1994). The current statute, 10 USC &#x00A7; 2164(e)(2), provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The agency] ...may without regard to the provisions of any other law relating to the number, classification, or compensation of employees--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A) &#x2003;establish positions for civilian employees...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B) &#x2003;appoint individuals to such positions; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C) &#x2003;fix the compensation of such individuals for service in such positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It further provides, as the result of an amendment enacted in 1996, that the agency may disregard the provisions of any other law relating to the number, classification, or compensation of employees in transferring employees between DDESS and DODDS. 10 USC &#x00A7; 2164(e)(4)(A).[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;&#x00A7; 2164(e)(4)(A) provides, in relevant part that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The agency] ...may, without regard to the provisions of any law relating to the number, classification, or compensation of employees--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;transfer employees from schools established under this section to schools in the defense dependents' education system...; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;transfer employees from such system to schools established under this section....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hargrove v. Department of Defense,</span> 77 MSPR 266, 269-71 (1998), the Board found that because 20 USC &#x00A7; 241 explicitly provided that the laws governing retention preferences during reductions in force (RIFs) could be disregarded, agencies had the option under that statute to use an appointment process which did not provide employees with RIF appeal rights. It found, however, that the plain language of 10 USC &#x00A7; 2164 provides for no such option. Rather, it found that the current law only permits the disregard of laws relating to the number, classification or compensation of employees. Thus, it held that employees appointed under 10 USC &#x00A7; 2164 have Title 5 RIF appeal rights. Adopting the same analysis, we find that while 20 USC &#x00A7; 241 explicitly provided for the exclusion of Title 5 adverse action rights, 10 USC &#x00A7; 2164 does not so provide, and employees appointed under it have such rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Hargrove,</span> this appellant was initially appointed under 20 USC &#x00A7; 241. She was, however, reassigned under the authority of 10 USC &#x00A7; 2164 in 1996, and the disciplinary action was taken in 1998, long after the repeal of 20 USC &#x00A7; 241 and its replacement by 10 USC &#x00A7; 2164. The agency argues, nevertheless, that the appellant's adverse action appeal rights must be governed by the repealed law. We find no support for such contention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency relies on <span class="Italic">King v. Briggs,</span> 83 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 1996), and <span class="Italic">Todd v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 55 F.3d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1995), for the proposition that the statutory provision under which the employee is initially appointed determines whether the employee has appeal rights. Neither case relied upon supports the agency's position, and in fact, supports a contrary result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Todd,</span> the court found only that the specific exclusions of 20 USC &#x00A7; 241 could not be impliedly repealed by the more general provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) (the Civil Service Due Process Amendments) granting new appeal rights to certain excepted service employees. The appellant in <span class="Italic">Todd,</span> like the appellant here, fell within the definition of employee in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). The statute under which Todd was hired, 20 USC &#x00A7; 241(a), and which was in effect when the adverse action in that case took place, however gave the option to employ her "without regard to the Civil Service Act and rules." Thus, the court found that Ms. Todd's rights were governed by 20 USC &#x00A7; 241 reasoning that "there is no repugnancy between the general rule at section 7511(a)(1)(C) that excepted service employees with two years of continuous service have appeal rights and the specific exception to this rule at section 241(a) which permits an agency to deny the appeal rights to a narrow category of personnel." <span class="Italic">Todd,</span> 55 F.3d at 1577. If section 241(a) governs the present appeal, it is clear that the appellant would have no appeal rights before us. However, contrary to the agency's contention, the court did not make a blanket ruling that the law in effect at the time of the initial appointment governs for the duration of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The posture of this case is totally different from <span class="Italic">Todd</span>. Here, the exclusionary statute, 20 USC &#x00A7; 241, was directly and specifically repealed, and the appellant was reassigned under the authority of the new law prior to the actions being appealed. The applicable statute, 10 USC &#x00A7; 2164, was enacted after the due process amendments of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511, and there is no specific language excluding &#x00A7; 2164 employees from the coverage of Title 5. We also note that the savings provision of the <span id="Page_317"></span>new law, Section 351(c) of Pub. L. No. 103-337 provides that: "Nothing in section 2164 of title 10, United States Code, as added by subsection (a), shall be construed as affecting the rights in existence on the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 5, 1994] of an employee of any school established under such section (or any other provision of law enacted before the date of the enactment of this Act that established a similar school) to negotiate or bargain collectively with the Secretary with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment." Thus, Congress was specifically concerned with the employer-employee relationship and expressed its specific intent to exclude any change in collective bargaining rights. Congress could have likewise specifically excluded employees previously excluded under 20 USC &#x00A7; 241, but chose not to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the foregoing, the agency's reliance on the court's decision in <span class="Italic">King v. Briggs,</span> 83 F.3d 1384, is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">King</span>, the court affirmed the Board's decision that it had jurisdiction over the appeal and that the agency had improperly removed the appellant without observing the procedures of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b). The court found that the appellant fell within the definition of "employee" found at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) and that she was not otherwise excluded from the procedural protections and appeal rights provided by Chapter 75 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code. In making the latter determination, the court looked to the statute that created the appellant's position, 29 USC &#x00A7; 783(a)(1). It found that although Congress gave the agency the option of disregarding certain parts of Title 5 (those relating to appointments in the competitive service, classification, and General Schedule pay rates), it did not give it the option of disregarding those parts dealing with appeal rights in Chapters 75 and 77. <span class="Italic">King</span>, 83 F.3d at 1388. Thus, while the court looked to the still-in-force appointing statute to see whether it excluded Title 5 jurisdiction, it did not hold that employees' rights are controlled only by the initial appointing statute, even where such statute is still intact. Rather, it looked to the provisions of all of the relevant statutes in force at the time that the action was taken against the employee to determine whether the employee had appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also looked to the relevant statute in effect at the time of the agency action in making its jurisdictional determinations. Thus, it has held that "[a]bsent a statutory exception, an employee's status at the time the agency effected its action controls whether the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal of that action." <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. Veterans Administration</span>, 40 MSPR 438, 441 (1989). In <span class="Italic">Godfrey,</span> the appellant had initially been appointed to a competitive service position with Title 5 adverse action appeal rights. Subsequently, however, she was converted to a position under Title 38 which was excluded by statute from Title 5 adverse action rights. She was removed from that position several years later and the Board found that it lacked jurisdiction because of the exclusionary statute. Clearly, the original appointment did not control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, the Federal Circuit has determined Board jurisdiction based on the statute in effect at the time of the action appealed rather than that in force at the time of the appointment. In <span class="Italic">Allen v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 127 F.3d 1074 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the court found that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the removal of a Federal Aviation Administration employee who was appointed under Title 5 but removed after a statutory change which excluded him from Title 5 coverage. In holding that "under the FAA's new personnel management system, an FAA employee such as Allen no longer enjoys appeal rights to the board from adverse actions," the court clearly held that appeal rights are not governed by the law in effect at the time of the initial appointment. <span class="Italic">Allen</span> at 1077.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this precedent, we find that the appellant in the instant case has Title 5 adverse action appeal rights, limited only by the provisions of 10 USC &#x00A7; 2164.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has appealed a 14-day suspension, a reassignment, and a reduction in pay. Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant suffered a reduction in pay and that the three actions constitute a unified penalty for misconduct, the Board only has jurisdiction if at least one of the actions constitutes an appealable adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Commission</span>, 779 F.2d 663 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Suspensions of 14 days or less and reassignments are not appealable to the Board. While a reduction in pay is an appealable adverse action under Chapter 75 of Title 5, in this case, as set forth above, the provisions of 10 USC &#x00A7; 2164 specifically permit the agency to set the compensation of employees, including those transferred from DDESS to DODDS, without regard to the provisions of any other law. It is undisputed that any reduction in pay suffered by the appellant resulted solely from her transfer to a position in the DODDS and its pay scale.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge held that the exclusionary provisions of 10 USC &#x00A7; 2164 do not encompass reductions in pay resulting from transfers taken for disciplinary reasons, but we find no support for such holding. Rather, we find that the statute is very clear in providing complete discretion for transfers of employees and the setting of pay in accord with the global nature of the assignments. It makes no distinction between reassignments for disciplinary reasons and reassignments for other management reasons. To assert jurisdiction here, solely on the basis of the reduction in pay, would subject all reassignments governed by 10 USC &#x00A7; 2164 to Board review if they result in a reduction in pay. This is contrary to the clear and plain language of the statute. <span class="Italic">Hargrove v. Department of Defense,</span> 77 MSPR at 270.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant has not been subjected to any action which is appealable to the Board and her appeal must therefore be DISMISSED, for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stewart</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Olmedo v. DOD</span>, 84 MSPR 547, 550 &#x00B6; 11 (1999) (Board appeal right extended to a motor vehicle operator of DDESS appointed under 20 USC 241 and dismissed for misconduct after the repeal of that law and its replacement by 10 USC 2164); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. DOD</span>, 84 MSPR 543, 546 &#x00B6; 6 (1999) ("Applying the analysis in <span class="Italic">Stewart,</span> we find that because the agency's performance-based removal action against her occurred after 20 USC 241 was repealed and replaced by 10 USC 2164, the appellant has appeal rights under chapter 43 of title 5, limited only by the provisions of 10 USC 2164, that the statute does not limit chapter 43 appeal rights and therefore the Board has jurisdiction to hear this appeal.").</p>
