<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-216"><span class="space">6.</span> Reprisal Against Individual Involved in Union Activity</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Gustave-Schmidt v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 87 MSPR 667, 675 &#x00B6; 12 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To prevail on a claim of retaliation for union activity, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), an appellant has the burden of showing that: (1) She engaged in such activity; (2) the accused official knew of such activity; (3) the adverse action under review could have been retaliation under the circumstances; and (4) after carefully balancing the intensity of the motive to retaliate against the gravity of the misconduct, there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Haack v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 68 MSPR 275, 282 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Agnew v. USPS</span>, NY-0353-14-0337-I-1 (NP 12/22/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove his affirmative defense of retaliation for engaging in union activity, the appellant was required to show that: (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) the accused official knew of the activity; (3) the adverse action under review could have been retaliation under the circumstances; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986).[8] Although the appellant alleges that the agency treated another employee differently, generally, he has failed to present sufficient allegations or any evidence to support the claim. Accordingly, we discern no basis for disturbing the administrative judge's conclusion that, after weighing the gravity of his misconduct against the motive to retaliate, the appellant failed to prove the genuine nexus element. <span class="Italic">See Warren</span>, 804 F.2d at 658 (noting that analysis of the genuine nexus element requires weighing the intensity of the motive to retaliate against the gravity of the misconduct charges).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The statutory changes of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 significantly narrowed the scope of cases to which the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standard applies. <span class="Italic">See Alarid v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-15 &#x0026; n.7 (2015). However, because the appellant's employer was the U.S. Postal Service, the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standard still applies in this case for purposes of the appellant's allegation of retaliation for engaging in union activity. <span class="Italic">See Mack v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 617, 621-22 (1991) (finding that U.S. Postal Service employees are subject to the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standard for retaliation affirmative defenses, rather than the contributing factor standard, because the U.S. Postal Service is not an "agency" as defined under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C), and its employees may not seek corrective action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Capitol Police v. Office of Compliance</span>, 878 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2018), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Five years after the initial decision was issued, the Board issued a final decision correcting the dismissal of a union officer for union activities by directing his reinstatement in <span class="Italic">Ireland v. DHHS, SSA</span>, 34 MSPR 614, 619-24 (1987). The appellant, whose prior service as a claims representative was entirely satisfactory, became active in his union and filed some unfair labor practice charges against the office manager, accusing him of making anti-union <span id="Page_4033"></span>remarks in staff meetings. A month after the ULP charges were filed, the appellant received an unsatisfactory performance evaluation--two months early--and was placed on 100% work review. A few months later he was given a proposal for removal. He was removed in December 1981. Overruling the contrary findings of the AJ, the Board determined, almost six years following Ireland's removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find...that the evidence of record establishes a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action, and that the protected activity was a significant factor in the decision to remove the appellant. This finding is based on the temporal sequence of the chain of events preceding the appellant's removal, the fact that many of the specifications cited in support of the removal action cannot be sustained, and the determination that the agency held the appellant to an unreasonable standard which had no basis in fact and which clearly exceeded the minimum requirements of the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant had been performing in a satisfactory manner since he assumed his position with the agency in 1978 and had received a favorable performance rating in March, 1981, and a promotion in April 1981. Then, commencing in late February 1981, and continuing thereafter, the appellant became actively engaged in promoting the reestablishment of a union local, and became its president. On June 3, 1981, and July 2, 1981, he filed unfair labor practice charges against office management. And, on July 6, 1981, four days after he filed his second charge, he received an unscheduled performance evaluation rating him unsatisfactory. As a result, the appellant's supervisor reviewed 100% of his redetermination and overpayment clearances. His removal was proposed three months later. At a minimum, this sequence of events raises an inference that retaliation was a factor in the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, our review of the record demonstrates that the agency's charge of unsatisfactory performance is pretextual since many of the specifications cited in support of the removal action either were not pursued by the agency, cannot be sustained here, or were <span class="Italic">de minimus</span> in nature. Of the 81 original specifications on which the appellant's removal was based, 25 were dropped by the agency at the hearing. An additional two specifications were not sustained by the administrative judge. After a review of the record, we find that many of the remaining 54 specifications should not have been sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note...that at the hearing the agency withdrew fifteen of the twenty-two specifications of poor performance that led directly to the imposition of the 100% review of appellant's work. This fact casts doubt upon the legitimacy of that review, gives rise to our strict scrutiny of the remaining charges, and lends support to our finding that many of the allegations of deficient performance that were pursued were pretextual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that 54 of the 81 specifications relied upon by the agency to remove the appellant were not established by a preponderance of the evidence. This fact is further evidence of retaliatory motivation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we find that the agency held the appellant to an error rate that was unreasonable and inapplicable to his specialty, and this additional fact constitutes conclusive evidence of retaliation. McMullen testified that she informed the appellant that he was required to meet a regional payment goal of 96.5% accuracy or a payment error rate of 3.5%. As evidence of the standard, the agency offered a December 1980 memorandum from the Regional Commissioner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Review of that memorandum clearly establishes not only that the regional commissioner determined that the 96.5% accuracy rate was a goal or level of achievement to be strived for, rather than a minimum standard against which an employee's performance was to be measured, but also that he assumed that performance at less than that goal level would be considered satisfactory. In addition, the memorandum clearly demonstrates that the 3.5% error rate was established for initial claims payments, rather than for redetermination or overpayments, which were appellant's areas of responsibility. When the agency sought to have the appellant's performance judged against this stringent, and unrequired, goal, the agency was attempting to justify the appellant's removal based upon a claim that his work could be judged against standards that bore no relationship to his work and that exceeded the standards for his position. Since an employee may not be removed under the provisions of Chapter 75 on the basis of "performance that is governed by and meets the critical elements set forth for the employee's position," not only was the agency's use of this inapplicable standard arbitrary and indicative of its retaliatory motives, it was also inconsistent with law. <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Department of Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 842 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 MSPR 33, 40 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having concluded that the appellant demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that retaliation for his union activities was a significant factor in the removal action, we must now determine whether the agency established by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant would have been removed absent the retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span>, 9 MSPR at 276-77. The genesis of the charge of unsatisfactory performance was an unscheduled performance evaluation that occurred within four days of his filing an unfair labor practice charge against office management, and shortly after he received a promotion to the journeyman level. In that evaluation, the appellant was informed of 22 alleged performance deficiencies which gave rise to the 100% review and were later relied upon to propose his removal. As noted, most of these alleged deficiencies were not pursued by the agency at the hearing. This fact supports a conclusion that the 100% review was unwarranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, it was not until the appellant was under this strict review for six weeks that he was first informed that he had to achieve an error rate of 3.5% when no other claims representative was so informed. The 3.5% error rate was, in fact, a goal for a specialty different from appellant's specialty. The evidence of record also reveals that the overall error rate in 1980 for redetermination, appellant's specialty, was 87.4% in the Philadelphia Region. Further, the appellant's home district office in Parkersburg ranked 54th out of 72 district offices in meeting agency regional goals. The inescapable conclusion is that most of the claims representatives in appellant's office were not meeting, and were not being held to a 96.5% accuracy rate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find the record does not establish that the agency would have taken the removal action, even in the absence of a retaliatory motive. Moreover, we find that retaliation was the motivating factor for his removal....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We briefly review the appropriate legal framework for analysis of the appellant's affirmative defenses under the Civil Service Reform Act. In our initial Opinion and Order, we found that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e), the appellant was required to challenge her removal under either the negotiated grievance procedure or a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Marshall,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 478, &#x00B6; 14. Where, as here, the employee invokes binding arbitration, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(b)(1)(C)(iii), the arbitrator is to apply the same substantive standards that the Board would apply if the matter had been appealed, <span class="Italic">see Cornelius v. Nutt,</span> 472 U.S. 648, 652, 660 (1985) (stating in a case involving an allegation of "harmful error" that "Congress clearly intended that an arbitrator would apply the same substantive rules as the Board does in reviewing an agency disciplinary decision."); <span class="Italic">Newman v. Corrado,</span> 897 F.2d 1579, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1990). As stated above, the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's removal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. "In matters covered under section[] ...7512...which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure..., an arbitrator shall be governed by section 7701(c)(1)...as applicable." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(2). Section 7701(c)(1), in turn, incorporates by reference the provisions of subsection (c)(2). <span class="Italic">Nutt,</span> 472 U.S. at 652. Under subsection (c)(2), the appellant bears the burden of proving allegations of prohibited personnel practices under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b). <span class="Italic">See Dunning v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration,</span> 718 F.2d 1170, 1174 (D.C. Cir. 1983) ("Reprisal constitutes a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), for which the employee bears the burden of proof."). The appellant must prove such allegations by preponderant evidence, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(iii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(B)], which is the degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person considering the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to find that a contested fact is more likely to be true than untrue, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(q)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), to establish a claim of prohibited employment discrimination or retaliation under Title VII, the employee first must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; the burden of going forward then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action; and, finally, the employee must show that the agency's stated reason is merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination or retaliation. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973). To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation, a claimant must show that: (1) he engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) he suffered a materially adverse action by his employer; and (3) a causal connection existed between the two. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In either case, the burden is not onerous. <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</span> 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) prohibits any employee who has the authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, to take any personnel action against any employee "because of (A) the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule or regulation; [or] (B) testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any right referred to <span id="Page_4034"></span>in subparagraph (A)...." To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> violation of subsection (b)(9), the appellant must demonstrate that she engaged in an activity protected by the section; that she subsequently was treated in an adverse fashion by the employer; that the deciding official had actual or constructive knowledge of the protected activity; and that there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Wildeman v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 313, 320 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as with most appeals of adverse actions taken under 5 U.S.C., chapter 75, the agency has already articulated a non-discriminatory reason for its action, i.e., the charged misconduct. Accordingly, the agency has done everything that would be required of it if the appellant had made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, and whether she in fact did so is no longer relevant. <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens,</span> 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983). Thus, the inquiry proceeds directly to the ultimate question of whether, upon weighing all of the evidence, the appellant has met her overall burden of proving illegal retaliation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question to be resolved is whether the appellant has produced sufficient evidence to show that the agency's proffered reason was not the actual reason and that the agency intentionally discriminated or retaliated against her. <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks,</span> 509 U.S. 502, 507-08 (1993); <span class="Italic">Aikens,</span> 460 U.S. at 714-16; <span class="Italic">Brady,</span> 520 F.3d 490, 494 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The evidence to be considered at this stage may include: (1) the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; (2) any evidence the employee presents to attack the employer's proffered explanations for its actions; and (3) any further evidence of discrimination or retaliation that may be available to the employee, such as independent evidence of discriminatory statements or attitudes on the part of the employer, or any contrary evidence that may be available to the employer, such as a strong track record in equal opportunity employment. <span class="Italic">Aka v. Washington Hospital Center,</span> 156 F.3d 1284, 1289 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). If we disbelieve the agency's proffered reason, particularly if we find it to be mendacious, our rejection of that reason, in combination with the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, permits but does not require a finding of intentional discrimination. <span class="Italic">Hicks,</span> 509 U.S. at 510.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may consider circumstantial evidence in determining whether an appellant has met her burden. <span class="Italic">Wildeman,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. at 320. To show retaliation using circumstantial evidence, the appellant must show that the accused official knew of the protected activity, <span class="Italic">cf. Warren v. Department of the Army,</span> 804 F.2d 654, 656 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and provide evidence showing a "convincing mosaic" of retaliation against her, under which a number of pieces of evidence, "each of which supports a proposition only weakly can, when taken as a whole, provide strong support if all point in the same direction: 'a number of weak proofs can add up to a strong proof,'" <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 666, &#x00B6; 20 (quoting<span class="Italic"> Sylvester v. SOS Children's Villages Illinois, Inc.,</span> 453 F.3d 900, 903 (7th Cir. 2006)). As a general rule, this mosaic has been defined to include three general types of evidence: (1) evidence of suspicious timing, ambiguous oral or written statements, behavior toward or comments directed at other employees in the protected group, and other bits and pieces from which an inference of retaliatory intent might be drawn; (2) evidence that employees similarly situated to the appellant have been better treated; and (3) evidence that the employer's stated reason for its actions is pretextual. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims that her removal "was one of a series of disciplinary actions brought by the agency in an effort to silence the Grievant" in reprisal for her EEO activities, including representing employees in complaints. The parties stipulated at the hearing that "since at least 2004, the Grievant has engaged in extensive filing and litigation of grievances, ULPs, and EEO complaints while serving as the president of AFGE 2145." Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.63, the parties may stipulate to matters of fact, and the stipulation will satisfy the party's burden of proving the fact alleged. In its post-hearing brief, the agency also "concede[d] that [the appellant] has participated in protected activity and the Agency is aware of her participation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claims that the agency removed her in retaliation for the actions she took as representative in her use of the notes in question. We find that the appellant's conduct in this regard also constituted protected activity. There is no dispute that the appellant obtained the documents in the course of acting as a union representative of an employee, officer Fred Williams. Williams and the appellant testified that on May 30, 2006, the appellant accompanied Williams to a fitness for duty examination pursuant to Williams's request that she act as his union representative. After a physical examination, the agency's employee health physician informed Williams that she was going to refer him for a psychological examination. Williams and the appellant objected, and Williams asked the physician if the documents she was reviewing at her desk were his medical records. The physician answered that the documents were Williams's medical records and Williams requested copies of them. The physician consulted with the employee health clerk in the area, handed the documents to her, and left. Williams filled out a request form and with the permission of the clerk, copied the file and returned it. When Williams and the appellant returned to the union office, they read the documents and discovered that they included several pages of notes from a supervisor which concerned both Williams and another employee. The appellant had been representing Williams in an EEO discrimination claim, and faxed copies of the notes to the EEO counselor who was processing Williams's case. Thereafter, Williams's EEO complaint was amended based on the information contained in the documents. Thus, the appellant was assisting Williams in the exercise of his right to file an EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we find that the deciding official, Michael Phaup, knew that the appellant was representing Williams in an active EEO complaint and had provided copies of the documents to the EEO counselor. The appellant testified, without contradiction, that upon review of the documents she immediately sent an e-mail message to Phaup and Ted Knicely, Chief of Human Resource Management Service, among others, claiming that the documents constituted direct evidence of discrimination. Later on the same day, Knicely delivered a letter dated May 30, 2006 to the union office instructing the appellant to return the documents. By letter dated June 2, 2006, the appellant advised Phaup that "[t]hese documents have not been disseminated to another Police Officer. Officer Fred L. Williams and I have filed EEO complaints and provided these documents to the Office of Resolution Management for each of our cases." The appellant attached to her letter a June 1, 2006 signed statement from Williams indicating that "the documents inside of my medical records were faxed to the Office of Resolution Management because I have filed an EEO complaint."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record also shows that, at the time of the appellant's removal, Phaup was significantly involved in prior EEO actions concerning the appellant. He was the deciding official in FMCS Case No. 060317-54572-3 (Dec. 29, 2006), in which the appellant was disciplined for disregarding an agency directive prohibiting her from representing an employee in EEOC complaints. The union's grievance in that case accused the agency of reprisal for the appellant's protected activities. Knicely, who issued the order to return the documents and was also the recommending official in this case, was also the recommending official in FMCS Case No. 061122-51597-3 (Dec. 21, 2006), in which the appellant was disciplined for AWOL. The union notified Phaup on August 12, 2005, that it was invoking arbitration over the decision to charge the appellant with AWOL, and its grievance in that case also charged that the discipline was imposed in reprisal for the appellant's protected activities. Further, Phaup testified that he knew of the appellant's involvement in an EEO case during his tenure as director at the facility that resulted in a settlement agreement requiring a payment to the employee of $100,000-150,000, which he characterized as "one of the higher settlements" of which he was aware.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although these officials had some motive to retaliate against the appellant because her successful grievances and EEO complaints concerned actions involving them, <span class="Italic">see Redschlag v. Department of the Army,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6; 66 (2001), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 32 Fed. Appx. 543 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the appellant offered little evidence concerning the intensity of their motive to retaliate against her, <span class="Italic">cf. Warren,</span> 804 F.2d at 658 (if officials having knowledge of the protected activity "and even slight involvement in them," are in charge of advising or effectuating the action, the Board must weigh the gravity of the charged misconduct against the intensity of the agency's motive to retaliate). During the hearing, the appellant questioned the agency officials about when they became aware of her protected activities, but she did not question them regarding any motive they might have had to retaliate against her on the basis of her grievances and EEO complaints. Nonetheless, we find that the record contains circumstantial evidence from which we draw an inference of retaliatory intent. Specifically, we note that the removal at issue in this case is the fourth disciplinary action brought by the agency against the appellant in less than one year, and that each of the preceding disciplinary actions has been overturned by neutral arbitrators, two of whom sustained the union's grievance on the grounds that the discipline was imposed in reprisal for the appellant's protected activities. Thus, the fact that the discipline in this case was proximate in time to other disciplinary action imposed in reprisal for protected activity, and in which the acting officials were involved, is circumstantial evidence that the agency's action was not based upon the appellant's misconduct and that the agency would not have taken this action if the appellant had not engaged in protected activities. <span class="Italic">See Fitzgerald,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 666, &#x00B6; 20 (evidence of suspicious timing may constitute circumstantial evidence of reprisal); <span class="Italic">cf. Cardwell v. Veterans Administration,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 1, 3-4 (1986) (finding that the agency's action was based on the appellant's proven misconduct and not based on a reprisal motive). Other circumstantial evidence of reprisal is the timing of the notice of proposed removal, which was issued just four days after the appellant had advised Phaup that she and Williams had filed EEO complaints and provided the documents to the Office of Resolution Management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that Phaup's equivocal testimony concerning the gravity of the offense shows that the agency did not assign such weight to it as to outweigh the record evidence of a retaliatory motive. Thus, Phaup <span id="Page_4035"></span>appeared to characterize the nature of the offense as a failure to comply with "guidance," "direction," and "expectations." He further testified that he did not know whether the appellant had asked why she was not allowed to have the documents, but "if that question was asked, a response should be given." When asked whether the agency's response should have informed the appellant that "you can't have them because they're about some other employee, not the guy you were representing," Phaup responded: "I would not disagree that it should be part of the response." When asked "[w]ould it be appropriate to tell her, 'you have an order, you don't need to know why you don't properly have those,'" Phaup initially responded, "You can do that. Yes, sir," but when asked whether "that would be okay in your mind," he responded "perhaps not." In this case, there is no dispute that the documents did pertain to an employee in the bargaining unit, that the appellant had obtained a signed release from that employee giving her custody of the documents, that she did request a written explanation as to why she was not allowed to have the documents, and that no explanation was given, other than that the Employee Health Services was not authorized to release the document. Phaup's ambiguous testimony concerning the nature of the appellant's offense stands in marked contrast with the agency's unequivocal position on review that the appellant had committed a serious offense warranting removal by failing to follow instructions. <span class="Italic">See Fitzgerald,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 666, &#x00B6; 20 (evidence of ambiguous oral or written statements may constitute circumstantial evidence of reprisal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the agency's resort to the harsh penalty of removal, rather than some lesser form of discipline, to resolve what is essentially a disagreement between it and the union over the right to possess documents, is circumstantial evidence that the agency was motivated by reprisal. We see no apparent reason why the agency could not have pursued an order against the union from an arbitrator, agency or court with jurisdiction to obtain the copies of the documents, especially where it was unclear whether the union was entitled to the documents. ([A]rbitrator's finding that "the order may be ultimately determined to be improper, but it may also ultimately be determined to be proper."). In any event, the agency imposed the most severe penalty against the appellant for failure to return a copy of a document it was aware had already been disseminated to an EEO counselor. Although Phaup determined that removal in this case was appropriate in part because of the appellant's prior disciplinary record, as discussed above, the appellant's recent prior disciplinary record has itself been determined to be tainted by the agency's reprisal for the appellant's past protected activities, and Phaup did not testify that he would have removed the appellant in the absence of it. Although, in determining whether the appellant has met her burden of proof, the proper perspective when weighing the gravity of the misconduct against the motive to retaliate is to view the gravity of the misconduct as it appeared to the deciding official at the time he took the removal action, <span class="Italic">Redschlag,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6; 69, we find under the particular circumstances of this case that the gravity of the offense is not such that the agency would have taken the removal action in the absence of a retaliatory motive, and that retaliation was the motivating factor for her removal, (agency table of penalties for "deliberate failure or unreasonable delay in carrying out instructions" ranging from "Admonishment Reprimand" for the first offense, suspension of 3-10 days for a second offense, and suspension of 10 days to removal for a third offense); <span class="Italic">cf. Ireland v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 34 M.S.P.R. 614, 619-24 (1987) (finding a causal connection between protected activity and an adverse action based on the temporal sequence of the chain of events, the fact that many specifications were not sustained, and the agency's holding the appellant to an unreasonable standard that exceeded the requirements of the position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When all of the foregoing circumstantial evidence is taken together, a pattern of retaliation emerges. Accordingly, we find sufficient evidence in the record to establish a causal link between the appellant's protected activity and the action to remove her. We find that the appellant met her burden of proof on the affirmative defense of retaliation by preponderant evidence, and we set aside the arbitrator's decision on that issue. In light of this disposition, we have not addressed the appellant's remaining arguments in her request for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf. Walton v. Dept. of Army</span>, CH-0752-15-0550-I-1 (NP 4/27/2023) ("'convincing mosaic' merely describes one type of evidence that, either alone or in combination with other evidence, an appellant may introduce in support of his claim. <span class="Italic">See Pridgen</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6; 24.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pleasant v. DHUD</span>, 98 MSPR 602, 609-10 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (2005), reviewing an arbitrator's award, rejected an argument of union animus:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also reasserts her claim that the agency's third charge was taken in retaliation for her union activities. For an appellant to prevail on an allegation of illegal retaliation, she has the burden of showing that: (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) the accused official knew of the protected activity; (3) the adverse action under review could have been retaliation under the circumstances; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of the Army,</span> 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Campo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 418 &#x00B6; 12 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant satisfied the first two elements of a retaliation claim, we agree with the arbitrator's implicit findings that the appellant failed to prove the third and fourth elements. The arbitrator found that the agency issued the August 27, 2002 memorandum regarding the appellant's use of official time as a result of the union's reduction of her representational responsibilities from 100% to 25% of her time, and not as a result of the agency's animus toward her union activities. The agency's third charge was predicated upon the appellant's failure to follow those instructions. In these circumstances, we agree that the evidence fails to show that the agency's action constituted retaliation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in assessing whether there is a genuine nexus between prior protected activity and the agency's adverse action, both the Federal Circuit and the Board have emphasized that "in the context of reprisal issues, the inquiry covers not only whether a retaliatory motive exists, but also whether there are independent grounds for initiating an action against the employee." <span class="Italic">Warren,</span> 804 F.2d at 657; <span class="Italic">Cole v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 572 &#x00B6; 9 (2000). Here, the arbitrator not only found that the agency proved the third charge, he found that the appellant willfully failed to follow the agency's instructions that provided the basis for the charge. Based on these findings, we also conclude that the appellant failed to establish a genuine nexus between the agency's alleged retaliation and the third charge.</p>

Section 7116(a) states that it is unfair labor practice for an agency, among other things, "(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this chapter...[and] (4) to discipline or otherwise discriminate against an employee because the employee has filed a complaint, affidavit, or petition, or has given any information or testimony under this chapter." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (a)(4).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have not yet had an occasion to consider the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework, we note that two other circuit courts have applied it for Federal Labor Relation Authority (FLRA) cases. <span class="Italic">See Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. FLRA</span>, 967 F.2d 658, 666-67 (D.C.

Neither party suggests a different framework should apply here, and after considering the matter, we conclude that the OOC Board properly considered this case under the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework. If the USCP's justification for its discipline is found to be pretextual, then it is unnecessary to determine <span id="Page_4036"></span>whether it would have taken the action absent the protected activity because such actions, by definition, would not have been taken for nondiscriminatory reasons. <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, F.L.R.A. at 120; <span class="Italic">see Golden State Foods Corp</span>., 340 NLRB 382, 385 (2003).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">From the FLRA, the decision relied on by the Federal Circuit in the <span class="Italic">Capitol Police</span> case, <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot and Int'l Bhd. of Police Officers, Local 358</span>, 35 FLRA 113, 118-22 (1990), involving a claim that a promotion was unlawfully denied to a local union president, determined that in all cases of alleged discrimination, whether "pretext" or "mixed motive," the FLRA General Counsel (the moving party in a ULP complaint against an agency) must establish that the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and that activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. If the General Counsel makes the required "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span>" showing, an agency will not have violated section 7116(a)(2) if it can demonstrate, by a preponderant evidence, that there was a legitimate justification for its action and the same action would have occurred in the absence of protected activity. The General Counsel may seek to establish, as part of its <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, that the reasons asserted by a respondent for its are pretextual. The General Counsel may also, however, seek to establish as its <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, only that the respondent took action based on consideration of protected activity and, after presentation of a respondent's evidence of nondiscriminatory reasons, seek to establish that those reasons are pretextual:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before discussing the specific facts of this case, we wish to address the analytical framework to be applied in cases alleging violations of section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute. In particular, we note the Union's assertion that once the General Counsel made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of discrimination, the burden "should have shifted" to the Respondent to demonstrate that it would have reached the same decision in the absence of Mr. Webber's protected activity. In response to this assertion, we emphasize two points.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the burden of proof always rests with the General Counsel. Section 2423.18 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations provides that "[t]he General Counsel...shall have the burden of proving the allegations of the complaint by a preponderance of the evidence." This is true in all cases of alleged discrimination, including "pretext" and "mixed motive" cases. In fact, the analytical framework applied to discrimination cases under section 7116(a)(2) is the same whether the case is labelled a "pretext" or a "mixed motive" case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In all cases of alleged discrimination, whether "pretext" or "mixed motive," the General Counsel must establish that: (1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">22nd Combat Support Group (SAC), March Air Force Base, California,</span> 27 FLRA 279 (1987) (<span class="Italic">March Air Force Base</span>). If the General Counsel fails to make the required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, the case ends without further inquiry. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Veterans Administration, Washington, D.C. and Veterans Administration Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio,</span> 26 FLRA 114 (1987), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied sub nom. American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2031 v. FLRA,</span> 878 F.2d 460 (D.C. Cir. 1989); and <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah,</span> 25 FLRA 342 (1987), where the particular conduct engaged in by employees was found not to be protected under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See also Veterans Administration Medical Center, Leavenworth, Kansas,</span> 31 FLRA 1161 (1988) and <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland,</span> 18 FLRA 55 (1985), where there was no evidence of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the General Counsel makes the required "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span>" showing, an agency will not be found to have violated section 7116(a)(2) if the agency can demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for its action; and (2) the same action would have been taken even in the absence of protected activity. For example, <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> 6 FLRA at 99 where the Authority referenced the approach taken by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle,</span> 429 U.S. 274 (1977) (<span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span>). In <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy,</span> which involved conduct protected by the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court established a "test of causation" for the purpose of "protect[ing] against the invasion of [protected] rights without commanding undesirable consequences not necessary to the assurance of those rights." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 286-87. The Court held that the burden was on the moving party to show that his/her conduct was protected and that this conduct was a motivating factor in the employment decision. At that point, the employer could demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would have reached the same decision even in the absence of the protected conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is erroneous to conclude, however, that because a respondent agency has an opportunity to establish that it had legitimate justification for taking the disputed action, the ultimate burden of proof shifts to the respondent to do so. The burden of proving the allegations of the unfair labor practice complaint rests solely with the General Counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, even if the General Counsel makes the required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, it is necessary to determine whether the General Counsel has proved the allegation in the complaint by a preponderance of the evidence. In this regard, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case consists only of "sufficient evidence...to get plaintiff past...a motion to dismiss[.]" Black's Law Dictionary 1071 (5th ed. 1979) (citation omitted). Only if the respondent offers no evidence in its support does a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing alone equate to proof by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (noting that courts use the concept of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case to mean "not only that plaintiff's evidence would reasonably allow conclusion plaintiff seeks but also that plaintiff's evidence compels such a conclusion if the defendant produces no evidence to rebut it.") (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, in response to a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case established by the General Counsel, the respondent offers evidence, it is necessary to determine whether the respondent's evidence rebuts the General Counsel's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing. This determination is made on the basis of the entire record, including any evidence the General Counsel offers in rebuttal to the respondent's showing. If the respondent rebuts the General Counsel's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing by a preponderance of the evidence, thereby establishing that it would have taken the allegedly unlawful action even in the absence of protected activity, the General Counsel has not established a violation of the Statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, "pretext" and "mixed motive" cases differ in one respect only: in a "mixed motive" case, both lawful and unlawful reasons (motives) for the respondent's actions have been established. Because both lawful and unlawful motives have been established, it is necessary to determine whether the respondent would have taken the allegedly discriminatory action even without the unlawful motive. <span class="Italic">See, for example, United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service and United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service,</span> <span class="Italic">New Orleans District, New Orleans, Louisiana,</span> 30 FLRA 1013 (1988) (involving the evaluation of an employee's performance while he served as a union steward) and <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 24 FLRA 851 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Martinez v. FLRA,</span> 833 F.2d 1051 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (concerning the discharge of an employee following the filing of grievances). In each of these cases, the respondent established a lawful motive for the action that was taken and demonstrated that it would have acted in the same manner even in the absence of the protected conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a "pretext" case, on the other hand, a motive asserted by a respondent to be lawful is found to be unlawful (pretextual). Accordingly, unless the respondent establishes that there was an additional lawful (nonpretextual) motive for its allegedly discriminatory action, it is not necessary to determine whether the respondent would have taken the disputed action even without the unlawful motive. <span class="Italic">See, for example, United States Forces Korea/Eighth United States Army,</span> 11 FLRA 434 (1983) (the Authority found that the respondent's refusal to approve an extension of the local union president's overseas tour of duty was motivated by his union activity and that the reason for denying the extension was pretextual).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the General Counsel may seek to establish, as part of its <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, that the reasons asserted by a respondent for its allegedly discriminatory action are pretextual. The General Counsel may also, however, seek to establish as its <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, only that the respondent took action based on consideration of protected activity and, after presentation of a respondent's evidence of nondiscriminatory reasons, seek to establish that those reasons are pretextual. In addition, an administrative law judge, or the Authority, may conclude that a respondent's asserted reasons for taking an action are pretextual, even if those reasons were not asserted to be such during the unfair labor practice hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note also the Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">March Air Force Base,</span> where the General Counsel asserted that the respondent had lowered an employee's performance appraisal because the employee had sought union assistance and filed a grievance. The respondent asserted that the appraisal was lowered for performance-related reasons. The administrative law judge found that the General Counsel had not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Authority disagreed with the judge's finding and concluded that "the alleged reasons for the lowered appraisal were pretextual." 27 FLRA at 282. The Authority stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Judge...declined to draw an inference that the protected activity was a motivating factor in the treatment complained of by [the employee]. We find not only that such an inference is proper, but on careful consideration we conclude that the protected activity alone was the motivating factor, because the asserted performance-related reasons have not been established.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority emphasized its holding as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Since we find that the asserted reason for the [r]espondent's action was pretextual, this is not a case where both legitimate and improper motives are found which would require us to consider whether the [r]espondent would have acted as it did even absent <span id="Page_4037"></span>the improper motive. In other words, this is not a "mixed motive" case, subject to the analysis outlined in <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span>[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 285 n.2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Authority's statement in <span class="Italic">March Air Force Base</span> that it was unnecessary to determine whether the respondent would have taken the allegedly discriminatory action without the unlawful motive because no other motive was established is consistent with the analytical framework discussed above. The Authority's statement concerning the applicability of <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy,</span> however, may be misleading. As previously noted, a respondent always may seek to rebut the General Counsel's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, whether or not that case includes evidence that the respondent's asserted reasons for taking the allegedly discriminatory action were pretextual. It is erroneous to conclude, therefore, that the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> analysis does not apply in a "pretext" case. Rather, a conclusion that a respondent's asserted reasons for taking allegedly discriminatory action are pretextual is based on consideration of all the evidence presented in a case, including evidence presented by a respondent to rebut the General Counsel's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the analytical framework discussed herein is consistent with the framework applied in the private sector. The National Labor Relations Board (the Board) adopted the same test in discrimination cases arising under the National Labor Relations Act (the Act). <span class="Italic">See Wright Line,</span> 251 NLRB 1083 (1980), <span class="Italic">enforced,</span> 662 F.2d 889 (1st Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 455 U.S. 989 (1982). Under a regulatory scheme that is comparable to that of the Statute, the Board held that its General Counsel bears the burden of proving the existence of unlawful discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. An employer may attempt to rebut the General Counsel's allegations but this rebuttal is viewed by the Board as an affirmative defense. Although the Board characterized the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> test as a "shifting of burdens," the Board cautioned that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]his shifting of burdens does not undermine the established concept that the General Counsel must establish an unfair labor practice by a preponderance of the evidence. The shifting burden merely requires the employer to make out what is actually an affirmative defense...to overcome the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of wrongful motive. Such a requirement does not shift the ultimate burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">251 NLRB at 1088 n.11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's application of <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> was sustained by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp.,</span> 462 U.S. 393 (1983). There, the Court emphasized that the General Counsel bears the burden of proving the elements of an unfair labor practice and that the employer's advancement of an affirmative defense does not alter the elements of an unfair labor practice that the General Counsel must prove under the Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 401.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, we reaffirm that the General Counsel bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an unfair labor practice has been committed. In a case involving alleged discrimination under section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute, the General Counsel must establish that the respondent's allegedly discriminatory action was motivated by consideration of protected activity. The General Counsel may also seek to establish, as part of its <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, that respondent's asserted reasons for taking the allegedly discriminatory action are pretextual, or after presentation of respondent's evidence of lawful reasons, may seek to establish that those reasons are pretextual. <span class="Italic">See Wright Line,</span> 251 NLRB at 1088 n.12 ("The absence of any legitimate basis for an action, of course, may form part of the proof of the General Counsel's case.") (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the General Counsel makes the required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, a respondent may seek to rebut that showing by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, the affirmative defense that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for its action; and (2) the same action would have been taken in the absence of protected activity. The analytical framework is the same in all cases involving alleged discrimination. <span class="Italic">Compare Wright Line</span>, 251 NLRB at 1083 n.4 ("under the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> test, there is no real need to distinguish between pretext and dual motive cases.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of Analytical Framework</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Judge concluded that the General Counsel failed to establish that Mr. Webber's nonselection was motivated by his Union activities. For the following reasons, we disagree with the Judge's conclusion. We find that Mr. Webber's Union activity was the sole reason for the cancellation of the selection register and that the Respondent did not demonstrate that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected activity. We further find that had the Respondent not unlawfully cancelled the selection register, Mr. Webber would have been selected for the lead guard position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our analysis requires an in-depth review of the testimony adduced at the hearing. We begin with a look at Mr. Webber's Union activities followed by an examination of the practice of lead guard selections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record indicates, and the Judge found, that Mr. Webber was an active Union president who was involved in several incidents "which may not have pleased management." At least two of the incidents involved direct confrontations with the Director of Administration. Other incidents were elevated to higher levels of management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record also indicates that for many years, possibly as long as 20 years, the selecting official for lead guard positions was the Chief of Police, who was the second level supervisor. With regard to this practice, the Respondent's personnel staffing specialist testified that prior to October 1986, at which time the selection register at issue was voided, "it would have been [the] Chief" who made lead guard selections. Additionally, the first line supervisor, who was designated the selecting official when the register was reissued, also testified that the Chief had always made selections in the past and that the first line supervisor was surprised when he was given the task of making the selection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record also indicates that on learning of Mr. Webber's selection, the Director of Administration questioned the Chief as to why the Chief had been the selecting official. The Chief replied that he had always made the selections. The Director of Administration responded by saying "you're not going to do that any more. That's not the way I want to do it." The Director of Administration also asked the Police Captain why the Chief was the selecting official rather than the first line supervisor. The Police Captain replied "that's the way it had been done before, in the past[.]" The Director of Administration also testified that because of the size of the organization he was managing, he was unaware of who was making lead guard selections until the register at issue came to his attention. The Director of Administration testified that at that time, "I changed it."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Respondent maintained throughout this proceeding that the register was voided because the correct procedure of having the first line supervisor be the selecting official for lead guard positions was not followed. In support of its position, the Respondent argued that: (1) the Director of Administration believed that because the first line supervisor had to supervise the lead guard, the first line supervisor should be able to decide with whom he wants to work; and (2) the position description of the first line supervisor and an agency regulation require the first line supervisor to make lead guard selections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first reason asserted by the Respondent must be contrasted with the fact, noted by the Judge, that the employee selected for the lead guard position would not necessarily work under the first line supervisor. The record reveals that although applicants may know that a vacancy exists on a particular shift, a successful applicant for the position is not necessarily placed on that shift. This is so because other lead guards have an opportunity to bump into the shift. The selected employee would then be placed on the shift on which a vacancy was created by virtue of the exercise of bumping rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second reason advanced by the Respondent is that the first line supervisor is required by his/her position description and an agency regulation to be the selecting official. Neither the position description nor the regulation was introduced into evidence. In fact, the Respondent's personnel staffing specialist testified that neither of those documents specifically identified the first line supervisor as the selecting official. The specialist also stated that it was a violation of merit promotion procedures to allow the second level supervisor to make lead guard selections. When asked by the Judge how a long-standing policy of allowing the Chief to be the selecting official could exist where such a practice was claimed to be a violation of merit promotion procedures, the specialist replied "I can't give you an answer on that[.]"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record also indicates that the Director of Administration and the Police Captain expressed concern about the choice of Mr. Webber to occupy a lead guard position. The Director of Administration testified that "Mr. Webber was not a good choice" based on his conduct on the Respondent's premises. All of this conduct appears to have occurred during Mr. Webber's non-duty time with some of the conduct, though not all, involving representational activities. The Police Captain expressed his concern about the selection to the Director of Administration before the register was voided. As indicated by the Judge, the Police Captain also made statements to Mr. Webber's successor as Union president concerning Mr. Webber, and unions generally, which the Judge found to constitute "mild evidence of <span class="Italic">animus</span>." We note, additionally, the Respondent's concession that "Mr. Webber's representational activities may have contributed to a judgment as to his potential to be a [lead guard]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Respondent claimed, in its post-hearing brief to the Judge, that from the time the register was voided, "<span class="Italic">all</span> selections within the guard force have been made by the first line supervisors." However, the record contains no evidence that there were any lead guard selections following the selection action in this case. The evidence that was introduced indicated only that first line supervisors had made selections for Police Officer positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated above, the Judge concluded that although he regarded the <span id="Page_4038"></span>"course of events here as highly suspicious[,]" the General Counsel failed to establish that Mr. Webber's non-selection was motivated by his Union activities. In our view, the record clearly establishes otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that Mr. Webber was an active Union president and that he was engaged in protected activity when he was selected for the lead guard position. The selection of Mr. Webber was made in accordance with the long-standing practice of having the second level supervisor serve as the selecting official. It was only when the Director of Administration learned of Mr. Webber's selection that the Respondent insisted upon following what it claimed to be the correct procedure of having the first line supervisor make the selection. However, no evidence was presented by the Respondent to demonstrate that this was the correct procedure or that there was a policy in effect of having the first line supervisor make lead guard selections. To the contrary, the Director of Administration testified that he was changing the policy and that the second level supervisor would not be making lead guard selections in the future. Moreover, the record establishes, and the Respondent concedes, that Mr. Webber's protected activity played a part in the decision that Mr. Webber was a poor choice for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the General Counsel has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the voiding of the selection register, which resulted in Mr. Webber not being selected for the lead guard position, was motivated solely by his protected activity. Therefore, we find that the Respondent's alleged reasons for its actions were pretextual. Accordingly, we find that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute.</p>
