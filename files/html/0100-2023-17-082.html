<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-80"><span class="space">B.</span> REQUIREMENTS OF EXCEPTIONS; regulations</h3>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7122(b) renders final an unexcepted award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If no exception to an arbitrator's award is filed under subsection (a) of this section during the 30-day period beginning on the day the award is served on the party, the award shall be final and binding. An agency shall take the actions required by an arbitrator's final award. The award may include the payment of backpay (as provided in section 5596 of this title).</p>
<p class="noindent">The requirements for exceptions are, 5 CFR 2425.2-.10 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2425.2 <span class="Italic">Exceptions--who may file; time limits for filing, including determining date of service of arbitration award for the purpose of calculating time limits; procedural and other requirements for filing.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Who may file. </span>Either party to arbitration under the provisions of chapter 71 of title 5 of the United States Code may file an exception to an arbitrator's award rendered pursuant to the arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Timeliness requirements--general. </span>The time limit for filing an exception to an arbitration award is thirty (30) days after the date of service of the award. This thirty (30)-day time limit may not be extended or waived. In computing the thirty (30)-day period, the first day counted is the day after, not the day of, service of the arbitration award. Example: If an award is served on May 1, then May 2 is counted as day 1, and May 31 is day 30; an exception filed on May 31 would be timely, and an exception filed on June 1 would be untimely. In order to determine the date of service of the award, <span class="Italic">see </span>the rules set forth in subsection (c) of this section, and for additional rules regarding computing the filing date, <span class="Italic">see </span>5 CFR 2429.21 and 2429.22.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Methods of service of arbitration award; determining date of service of arbitration award for purposes of calculating time limits for exceptions.</span> If the parties have reached an agreement as to what is an appropriate method(s) of service of the arbitration award, then that agreement--whether expressed in a collective bargaining agreement or otherwise--is controlling for purposes of calculating the time limit for filing exceptions. If the parties have not reached such an agreement, then the arbitrator may use any commonly used method--including, but not limited to, electronic mail (hereinafter "e-mail"), facsimile transmission (hereinafter "fax"), regular mail, commercial delivery, or personal delivery--and the arbitrator's selected method is controlling for purposes of calculating the time limit for filing exceptions. The following rules apply to determine the date of service for purposes of calculating the time limits for filing exceptions, and assume that the method(s) of service discussed are either consistent with the parties' agreement or chosen by the arbitrator absent such an agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;If the award is served by regular mail, then the date of service is the postmark date or, if there is no legible postmark, then the date of the award; for awards served by regular mail, the excepting party will receive an additional five days for filing the exceptions under 5 CFR 2429.22.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;If the award is served by commercial delivery, then the date of service is the date on which the award was deposited with the commercial delivery service or, if that date is not indicated, then the date of the award; for awards served by commercial delivery, the excepting party will receive an additional five days for filing the exceptions under 5 CFR 2429.22.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;If the award is served by e-mail or fax, then the date of service is the date of transmission, and the excepting party will not receive an additional five days for filing the exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;If the award is served by personal delivery, then the date of personal delivery is the date of service, and the excepting party will not receive an additional five days for filing the exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;If the award is served by more than one method, then the first method of service is controlling when determining the date of service for purposes of calculating the time limits for filing exceptions. However, if the award is served by e-mail, fax, or personal delivery on one day, and by mail or commercial delivery on the same day, the excepting party will not receive an additional five days for filing the exceptions, even if the award was postmarked or deposited with the commercial delivery service before the e-mail or fax was transmitted.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;The Authority will review an arbitrator's award to which an exception has been filed to determine whether the award is deficient--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Because it is contrary to any law, rule or regulation; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;On other grounds similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;If a party argues that an award is deficient on private-sector grounds under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, then the excepting party must explain how, under standards set forth in the decisional law of the Authority or Federal courts:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;The arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;Exceeded his or her authority; or</p>

<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The award:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;Fails to draw its essence from the parties' collective bargaining agreement; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;Is based on a nonfact; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(iii) Is incomplete, ambiguous, or contradictory as to make implementation of the award impossible; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(iv)&#x2003;Is contrary to public policy; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(v)&#x2003;Is deficient on the basis of a private-sector ground not listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(2)(iv) of this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;If a party argues that the award is deficient on a private-sector ground raised under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the party must provide sufficient citation to legal authority that establishes the grounds upon which the party filed its exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;The Authority does not have jurisdiction over an award relating to:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;An action based on unacceptable performance covered under 5 U.S.C. 4303;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;A removal, suspension for more than fourteen (14) days, reduction in grade, reduction in pay, or furlough of thirty (30) days or less covered under 5 U.S.C. 7512; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Matters similar to those covered under 5 U.S.C. 4303 and 5 U.S.C. 7512 which arise under other personnel systems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;An exception may be subject to dismissal or denial if:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;The excepting party fails to raise and support a ground as required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, or otherwise fails to demonstrate a legally recognized basis for setting aside the award; or</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Where an arbitration matter before the Authority does not involve allegations of unfair labor practices under 5 U.S.C. 7116, and the excepting party wishes to receive an expedited Authority decision, the excepting party may request that the Authority issue a decision that resolves the parties' arguments without a full explanation of the background, arbitration award, parties' arguments, and analysis of those arguments. In determining whether such an abbreviated decision is appropriate, the Authority will consider all of the circumstances of the case, including, but not limited to: whether any opposition filed under &#x00A7; 2425.3 of this part objects to issuance of such a decision and, if so, the reasons for such an objection; and the case's complexity, potential for precedential value, and similarity to other, fully detailed decisions involving the same or similar issues.

<p class="noindent">To keep parties squarely attuned to its regulatory structure, FLRA publishes a "Checklist for Filing Arbitration Appeals (Exceptions)" on its website, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/arbitration_appeal_procedural_review_checklist">http://www.flra.gov/arbitration_appeal_procedural_review_checklist</a>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to be timely, an exception to an arbitration award must be filed (i.e., postmarked, deposited with a commercial delivery service that will provide a record showing the date the document was tendered to the delivery service, or delivered in person) with the Office of Case Intake and Publication, Federal Labor Relations Authority in Washington, D.C., within 30 days beginning on the date after the award is served on the filing party. 5 CFR 2424.2(b) (October 1, 2010). The exceptions must contain, at a minimum, the following listed items:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Statement of the grounds (listed in 5 CFR 2425.6 on which review is requested</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Evidence or rulings bearing on the issues before the Authority</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Arguments in support of the stated grounds</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Specific reference to the record and citations of authorities in support of those arguments</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Legible copies of any documents referenced in the arguments, with the exception of documents that are readily accessible to the Authority (such as Authority decisions, decisions of Federal courts, and current provisions of the United States Code and the Code of Federal Regulations)</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Legible copies of the arbitrator's award</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A statement regarding whether requesting an expedited, abbreviated decision under 5 CFR 2425.7, and, if so, arguments in support of such request</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Arbitrator's name, mailing address, and, if available and authorized for use by the arbitrator, the arbitrator's e-mail address or facsimile number</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A table of contents if the document exceeds 10 double-spaced pages in length</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A complete copy of the exceptions, including all attachments, must:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Be served by mail, certified mail, commercial delivery, or personal delivery</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Contain a signed and dated statement of service with the names and addresses of the parties served, date of service, nature of the document served, and method of service (e.g., mail, certified mail, commercial delivery, personal delivery)</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Contain a signed original and 4 complete and legible copies of all documents</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Be addressed to the Office of Case Intake and Publication</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reasonably expects compliance with its regulations. Denying reconsideration of an order dismissing exceptions, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3438 and DHHS, SSA, Decatur</span>, 49 FLRA 1145, 1148-49 (1994), declared that "parties dealing with the Federal Government are charged with knowledge of and are bound by statutes and lawfully promulgated regulations....&#8197;Specifically, parties are <span id="page_1816"></span>charged with knowledge of the filing requirements for exceptions." FLRA will consider submissions for what they are. If a party seeks through its submission to FLRA to modify an award, that submission relates to the validity of the award and is treated as an exception. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Miami and AFGE Local 3690</span>, 66 FLRA 1046, 1048 (2012) (dismissing union submission as untimely exception).</p>
<p class="noindent">Exceptions are to be briefed, <span class="Italic">IRS, Austin Dist. Office and NTEU Chap. 52</span>, 51 FLRA 1166, 1176 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Authority's Regulations, exceptions must "state the grounds for the exceptions[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.27(a)(3). Our Regulations also require that briefs in support of exceptions must contain "[t]he argument, presenting clearly the points of fact and law relied on in support of the position taken...with specific page reference to the transcript and the legal or other material relied on." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.28(a)(3). Stated otherwise, to satisfy the regulatory requirements, a party must both raise an exception and argue in support of that exception....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA expects parties to brief exceptions with record citation and citation to legal authority, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3627 and SSA ODAR Jacksonville</span>, 65 FLRA 1049, 1050-51 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In arguing that the Arbitrator failed to resolve the issues submitted to him in arbitration, the Union has raised a ground recognized by the Authority--that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.6(b)(1)(i). However, the Union has failed to offer any support for its contention. The Union has provided no record citations to demonstrate how it or the Agency articulated the issues presented to the Arbitrator. However, even accepting as true the Union's assertion that its grievance was filed on behalf of all of the Decision Writers and that the Arbitrator formulated the issue as only relating to the grievant, the Union has failed to establish whether the Arbitrator's formulation was outside his authority. The Union does not provide any legal standard by which to analyze its argument, nor does it cite to any case law, from the Authority or otherwise, in support of its position. Additionally, the Union has not demonstrated how the Arbitrator's decision does not resolve the issue as he framed it. The Union offers no explanation for its assertion beyond its statement that review of the various issues "will clearly show" that none of the issues were resolved by the Arbitrator in his award. In other words, the Union has failed to "explain how" the Arbitrator exceeded his authority as required by &#x00A7; 2425.6(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to 2011, although the Authority's procedural requirements concerning exceptions were to be followed, the Authority did not require great formality in the substance of the exception. The issue was whether the submission "set[s] forth the elements of the Arbitrator's awards to which it excepts with sufficient particularity to inform the Authority as well as the parties of the basis of its exceptions." <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Comm'n and MEBA Dist. 1</span>, 54 FLRA 1161, 1170-71 (1998). The Authority observed in <span class="Italic">GSA, Region 6 and AFGE Council No. 236</span>, 46 FLRA 550, 553 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Agency argues that the exception is deficient because it does not, as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.2(a), (b), and (e), respectively, set forth: a statement of the grounds on which review is requested; evidence or rulings bearing on the issues before the Authority; and the name and address of the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree that the exception is deficient in this regard.&#x2003;We find that by maintaining that the Arbitrator had the contractual authority to grant the relief it requested, the Union adequately has stated the grounds on which it seeks review of the award. Further, although the exception does not set forth any specific evidence or rulings to elucidate the issue before the Authority, we conclude that the exception is sufficiently clear for the Authority to understand the issue it presents.</p>
<p class="noindent">Exceptions should be complete, accompanied by the documentation necessary for FLRA to resolve the parties' arguments, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg</span>, 51 FLRA 1302, 1305-06 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[U]nder section 2425.2 of our Regulations, an exception must be a "self-contained document" that includes copies of "pertinent documents." The Union has failed to provide a copy of the Agency's regulations relating to penalties for employee misconduct or the pertinent portions on which it relies. Consequently, the Union has not demonstrated that the award is inconsistent with an Agency regulation relating to the penalties for employee misconduct....</p>
<p class="noindent">The party filing exceptions need only present the material supporting those exceptions, not a complete record of the arbitration hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 66 FLRA 198, 201 (2011) (on exceptions to arbitration award "However, the Agency has neither provided a legible copy of the remaining proposals, nor set forth the complete, or substantially complete, wording of those proposals, and the proposals are not set forth in the award, the Union's opposition, or elsewhere in the record. Thus, the Agency has not established an evidentiary record sufficient to prove its assertions regarding the remaining disputed proposals, and we deny the exceptions pertaining to these proposals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Nw. Div., Portland Dist., Portland, Or.</span>, 59 FLRA 86, 88 (2003) (Member Armendariz dissenting)."); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs Portland Dist. and UPTO</span>, 59 FLRA 86, 88 (2003) (agency's exceptions denied: copy of operative contract provisions were not supplied to FLRA, leaving record insufficient to overturn award); <span class="Italic">SBA and AFGE Local 2951</span>, 55 FLRA 179, 179 n.1 (1999) (declining union's request to direct agency to provide to FLRA information from arbitration that favored grievant). The Authority will adjudicate exceptions despite the objection of one party that the other party's submission contains inaccurate or false information. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3911 and EPA</span>, 58 FLRA 101, 104 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA may receive exceptions that are deficient on a matter of form. The party offering the exceptions will be informed of the problem and told to correct the deficiency by a date certain. Compliance with FLRA's instructions is mandatory: if the corrections are to be received at FLRA's national office on a certain date and arrive two days late, the exceptions may be dismissed. <span class="Italic">Johnson VA Memorial Hosp. and AFGE Local 1509</span>, 33 FLRA 819, 819-20 (1988).
