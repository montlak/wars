<p class="Body-Text">That the appellant suffered a disabling injury during military service and claims a current impact of that disability on the job is incidental to a claim of disability discrimination, but it does not establish a USERRA claim. <span class="Italic">McBride v.

DHS</span>, AT-315H-21-0601-I-1 (NP 4/22/2022) ("Regarding her possible USERRA claim, the appellant stated that she is a disabled veteran with a 30 percent service-connected disability and that the agency discriminated against her due to her service-connected disability.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 411, 415 (1998). Conversely, if the appellant is alleging the agency's actions, culminating in and including her termination, were motivated by her status as a disabled veteran, the Board may have jurisdiction over her claim. <span class="Italic">Lazard v.

An allegation of discrimination based on a disability arising from military service is not a claim cognizable under USERRA. <span class="Italic">McBride</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 415."); <span class="Italic">Bean v.

Further, the appellant expressly invoked USERRA below. Thus, we find that her allegations regarding her termination from employment, disparate treatment, and veteran's status can be reasonably viewed as raising a USERRA claim based on her status as a disabled veteran. We therefore find that the appellant's allegations should have been considered as a USERRA appeal. Thus, the administrative judge should have provided the appellant with adequate notice of what is required to establish Board jurisdiction under USERRA<span class="Italic">. See Muse v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ held that the appellant did not allege a cognizable claim under USERRA, interpreting the appellant's allegations as a claim of discrimination based on a disability arising out of military service. Relying on <span class="Italic">Morgan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 1 (1999), <span class="Italic">Jasper v.

Portions of <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> could be read as implying that a claim of discrimination based on "disabled veteran status" can proceed under USERRA, 82 M.S.P.R. 1 &#x00B6; 12 &#x0026; n.3, but later precedent makes clear that a claim of discrimination based on a disability alone--even a disability arising out of military service--is not cognizable under USERRA<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Petersen</span> decision, on the other hand, lends some support to the <span id="Page_490"></span>appellant's argument that he states a cognizable claim under USERRA. In <span class="Italic">Petersen</span>, the appellant alleged that because of his military service he was referred to as a "psycho," "baby killer," and "plate head" at his employing agency. 71 M.S.P.R. at 235. The Board stated that Congress intended an "expansive interpretation" of the scope of the USERRA anti-discrimination provision, and accordingly held that a claim of discrimination based on a hostile environment marked by anti-veteran animus and remarks could proceed under USERRA<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 239. Here, the appellant's allegation that the interview panel was skeptical and curious about his service-connected disability is not a hostile environment discrimination claim because the appellant was an applicant for employment, not an employee. Nonetheless, the remarks about the appellant "not look[ing] disabled" and having "bullets in his body" that the appellant attributes to the interview panelists, if made, could be some evidence of anti-veteran animus among the panelists. This evidence, if further developed, and if coupled with circumstantial evidence of discrimination, could permit a finding of discrimination.[5] Under an "expansive interpretation" of the USERRA anti-discrimination provision, and considering the appellant's repeated assertions in his petition for appeal and in response to the show-cause order that the agency discriminated against him because of his "veteran status" and "military status," we conclude that he has stated a claim of discrimination that can proceed under USERRA. In this connection, it must be emphasized that the relative weakness of factual allegations in support of a USERRA claim is not a ground for dismissing the claim summarily; instead, the claim should be denied on the merits if the appellant fails to develop those allegations. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Duncan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 86, 92 (1997). As yet, the appellant has not been given an opportunity to develop his allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The appellant's allegations that he "scored very well on the written examination" and that he "was highly qualified for the position by virtue of educational achievement and work related experience" might be some circumstantial evidence of discrimination if the appellant could show that non-veterans who scored lower or were not as well-qualified were selected. While the appellant has not introduced such evidence, it does not appear that he has had a full opportunity to gather evidence in discovery.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Davison v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 640, 646-47 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15, 2011 MSPB 25 (2011), the appellant could state a USERRA claim based on an assertion of adverse treatment resulting from use of leave as a disabled veteran under Executive Order 5396:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's allegation of agency retaliation for the exercise of his right as a disabled veteran to LWOP under Executive Order 5396 distinguishes this case from <span class="Italic">Bagunas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 17 (2002), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by, Garcia v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 371, 375-77 (2009), and its progeny, in which the Board held that a claim of discrimination based on a disability alone--even a disability arising out of military service--is not cognizable under USERRA, <span class="Italic">see also Daniels v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 630, &#x00B6; 8 (2001) <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 25 Fed. Appx. 970 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">McBride v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 411, 414-15 (1998). In such cases, "the appellant [does not] claim that the fact that he...performed in a uniformed service...accounted for the agency's action"; rather he "claim[s] instead that it was as a result of something that happened during [his] service that accounts for the treatment [he] received from the agency." <span class="Italic">Daniels,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 630, &#x00B6; 8. Here, the appellant alleges, not that his service-related disability accounted for the agency's action, but that its action was in reprisal for having exercised a right to LWOP granted only to those who have performed in a uniformed service. Indeed, as stated above, the appellant has indicated that, although he is a disabled veteran, the medical treatment that he received while on LWOP status was not "for treatment of a service connected condition," and he argues on review that although "[t]he Veteran needs to have a service connected condition to benefit from Executive Order 5396,...the medical treatment can be for any condition, service connected or not."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311. In so finding, we express no opinion on the merits of the appellant's USERRA claim, his interpretation of Executive Order 5396, or whether he was entitled to LWOP under that Executive Order. The strength or weakness of the assertions in support of a claim is not a basis to dismiss the USERRA claim for lack of jurisdiction; rather, if the appellant fails to develop his contentions, his USERRA claim should be denied on the merits. <span class="Italic">Tindall,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Melvin,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. at 377.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...On review, the appellant has expanded upon this claim, arguing that the agency discriminated against her on the basis of her status as a disabled veteran. She appears to allege that the agency conducted an inadequate and a procedurally defective fact-finding investigation, detailed her, and terminated her for false reasons because of her usage of disabled veteran leave for medical appointments related to her service-connected disability.[3] She further alleges that her supervisor singled her out and treated her differently than her non-veteran coworkers in the pharmacy department.</p>
