<p class="noindent">The principle statutes providing for alternative work schedules and compressed work schedules are at 5 USC 6121, 6122, 6128, 6130 and 6131:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x00A7; 6121. <span class="Italic">Definitions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of this subchapter--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;"agency" means any Executive agency, any military department, the Government Printing Office, the Library of Congress, the Architect of the Capitol, and the Botanic Garden;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;"employee" has the meaning given the term in subsection (a) of section 2105 of this title, except that such term also includes an employee described in subsection (c) of that section;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;"basic work requirement" means the number of hours, excluding overtime hours, which an employee is required to work or is required to account for by leave or otherwise;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(4)&#x2003;"credit hours" means any hours, within a flexible schedule established under section 6122 of this title, which are in excess of an employee's basic work requirement and which the employee elects to work so as to vary the length of a workweek or a workday;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(5)&#x2003;"compressed schedule" means--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;in the case of a full-time employee, an 80-hour biweekly basic work requirement which is scheduled for less than 10 workdays, and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;in the case of a part-time employee, a biweekly basic work requirement of less than 80 hours which is scheduled for less than 10 workdays;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(6)&#x2003;"overtime hours," when used with respect to flexible schedule programs under sections 6122 through 6126 of this title, means all hours in excess of 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week which are officially ordered in advance, but does not include credit hours;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(7)&#x2003;"overtime hours," when used with respect to compressed schedule programs under sections 6127 and 6128 of this title, means any hours in excess of those specified hours which constitute the compressed schedule; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(8)&#x2003;"collective bargaining," "collective bargaining agreement," and "exclusive representative" have the same meanings given such terms--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;by section 7103 (a)(12), (8), and (16) of this title, respectively, in the case of any unit covered by chapter 71 of this title; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;in the case of any other unit, by the corresponding provisions applicable under the personnel system covering this unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x00A7; 6122.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Flexible schedules; agencies authorized to use</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Notwithstanding section 6101 of this title, each agency may establish, in accordance with this subchapter, programs which allow the use of flexible schedules which include--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;designated hours and days during which an employee on such a schedule must be present for work; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;designated hours during which an employee on such a schedule may elect the time of such employee's arrival at and departure from work, solely for such purpose or, if and to the extent permitted, for the purpose of accumulating credit hours to reduce the length of the workweek or another workday.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An election by an employee referred to in paragraph (2) shall be subject to limitations generally prescribed to ensure that the duties and requirements of the employee's position are fulfilled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, but subject to the terms of any written agreement referred to in section 6130 (a) of this title, if the head of an agency determines that any organization within the agency which is participating in a program under subsection (a) is being substantially disrupted in carrying out its functions or is incurring additional costs because of such participation, such agency head may--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;restrict the employees' choice of arrival and departure time,</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R12-167 and Office of Adjutant Gen., California</span>, 27 FLRA 349, 354 (1987), explained the Work Schedules Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Work Schedules Act provides that an exclusive representative can negotiate with an agency for the establishment of flexible and compressed work schedules for bargaining unit employees. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6130(a)(1). As reflected in its legislative history, the Act is intended to include within the collective bargaining process "the institution, implementation, administration and termination of alternative work schedules[.]"... The legislative history also indicates that full negotiation is expected on these aspects of alternative work schedules....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A compressed schedule is defined, for full-time employees, as an 80-hour biweekly work requirement that is scheduled for less than 10 workdays and, in the case of part-time employees, as a biweekly basic work requirement of less than 80 hours established for less than 10 days. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6121(5). Flexible schedules, as provided in the Work Schedules Act, concern variable starting and quitting times and the earning of credit hours for varying the length of the workday or workweek. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6122. Thus, in short, what is negotiable under the Work Schedules Act is the institution, implementation, administration, and termination of these alternate work schedules for bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1982, extended in 1986, an agency may object to the negotiation of an alternative work schedule proposed by a union only if the agency establishes that the proposed schedule will have an adverse agency impact. 5 USC 6131 (a-c). The parties must then, if they need third-party assistance to resolve a dispute as to adverse agency impact, present their dispute to FSIP pursuant to 5 USC 6131I(2) and part 2472 of the Panel regulations. As a result of the statutory scheme, agency contentions over whether the proposal was negotiable as an appropriate arrangement did not raise issues adjudicated by FLRA under &#x00A7; 7117. FLRA could, however, resolve issues concerning allegations that AWS proposals were inconsistent with the AWS legislation itself or with laws superseding the 1982 Act. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1934 and Dept. of Air Force, 3415 ABG, Lowry AFB</span>, 23 FLRA 872, 874 (1986). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 24 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 333 n.2 (1995) (review of arbitration award: nothing in 5 USC &#x00A7; 5546(b), (c) barred employees on alternate work schedules from earning credit hours in lieu of premium pay for work performed on a holiday, <span class="Italic">modifying</span> <span class="Italic">Lowry AFB</span> "insofar as necessary to permit consideration of laws such as 32 USC 709(g)(2) that constitute exceptions to the broadly stated bargaining requirement of the Act."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2128 and DOD DCMA</span>, 58 FLRA 519 (2003) (reviewing arbitrator's award interrelating compressed work schedules and entitlement to holiday pay).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal is not inconsistent with the law if it sets particular hours of work or permits employees to elect their hours. 5 USC 6122 provides that employees' election of arrival and departure times under a flexible schedule is subject to the agency's authority to ensure that the duties of their positions are fulfilled. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 642 and BLM, Lakeview Dist.

<p class="noindent-1">The negotiability dispute resolution procedures under section 7117 of the Statute do not apply to this dispute insofar as it raises issues concerning whether matters pertaining to alternative work schedules interfere with management's rights or are inconsistent with the official time provisions of the Statute. In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 1934 and Department of the Air Force, 3415 ABG, Lowry AFB, Colorado</span>, 23 FLRA No. 107 (1986), we held that under the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act...the "use of alternative work schedules was intended to be fully negotiable," subject only to the provisions of the Act itself or with other laws superseding the 1982 Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an agency objects to a proposed alternate work schedule because it believes that the schedule will have an "adverse agency impact" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6131(b), it may present the issue to the Federal Service Impasses Panel for resolution as provided in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6131(c)(2). Because alternate work schedules are "fully negotiable" within the limits set by the Act, there are no issues pertaining to the negotiability of those schedules under section 7117 which relate to asserted conflicts with provisions of the Statute. For this reason, the Agency's contentions as to section 7106 and section 7131 of the Statute are not properly before us.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 52 FLRA 1265, 1293 (1997) (Article 26), stated of the negotiability of proposals limiting management's discretion in the administration of flextime and compressed work schedules:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1982 (Work Schedules Act) provides that an exclusive representative may negotiate with an agency for the establishment of flexible and compressed work schedules for bargaining unit employees. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6130(a)(1). We note two principles from the legislative history of the Work Schedules Act. First, the Work Schedules Act is intended to include within the collective bargaining process "the institution, implementation, administration and termination of alternative work schedules[.]" S. Rep. No. 365, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 14-15 (1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News at 565, 576-77. Second, Congress intended alternative work schedules to be fully negotiable, subject only to the provisions of the Work Schedules Act itself. Consistent with the legislative history, the Authority has held that alternative work schedules for bargaining unit employees are "fully negotiable" subject only to the Work Schedules Act or other laws superseding it. <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 39 FLRA at 34. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1934 and Department of the Air Force, 3415 ABG, Lowry AFB, Colorado</span>, 23 FLRA 872, 873-74 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Lowry), modified as</span> <span class="Italic">to other matters, National Treasury Employees Union Chapter 24</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 333 n.2 (1995). The Authority has consistently held since <span class="Italic">Lowry</span> that proposals seeking to negotiate alternative work schedules are within the duty to bargain and enforceable under the Statute. <span class="Italic">E.g., IRS</span>, 39 FLRA at 34; <span class="Italic">United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3347</span>, 43 FLRA 87, 92-93 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the provision establishes limitations on the use of flexitime and compressed work schedules, it concerns the implementation and <span id="page_637"></span>administration of alternative work schedules. Consequently, the provision is "fully negotiable" under the Work Schedules Act. The Agency's argument, which is limited to a claimed violation of the management rights provision of the Statute, provides no basis for finding that the provision is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., IRS</span>, 39 FLRA at 34; <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 642 and</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Land Management, Lakeview District Office, Lakeview</span>, <span class="Italic">Oregon</span>, 27 FLRA 862, 867 (1987), <span class="Italic">enforced sub nom.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 59 FLRA 131, 134-35 (2003), emphasized the scope of the negotiability of AWS provisions in the course of a decision on exceptions to an arbitration award that concluded the agency violated the contract by unilaterally implementing a software-based system to record time and attendance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 4 concerns the administration of the Agency's alternative work schedules program<span class="Italic">. See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.404 (requiring an agency that authorizes a flexible or compressed work schedule to establish a time-accounting method demonstrating employee's hours of work). The Authority has repeatedly held that the implementation and administration of alternative work schedules is fully negotiable, subject only to the Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act (Work Schedules Act) or other laws superseding the Act, and without regard to management rights under the Statute<span class="Italic">. NTEU</span>, 52 FLRA at 1293; <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 2361</span>, 57 FLRA 766, 767 (2002) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>); <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chpt. 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1934</span>, 23 FLRA 872, 873-75 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's holding that not only the establishment and termination, but also the implementation and administration, of alternative work schedules is negotiable is consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6130(a)(1) and (2).[6] As plainly worded, this section provides that flexible and alternative schedules <span class="Italic">and</span> their establishment and termination are subject to collective bargaining; nothing in the provision limits bargaining to establishment and termination of the schedules. The Authority's holding also is consistent with legislative history stating that collective bargaining over these schedules includes their "institution, implementation, administration and termination." S. Rep. No. 365, 97th Cong. 2d Sess. 14-15, <span class="Italic">reprinted in </span>1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. (96 Stat.) 576-77. Based on these provisions, the argument that the AWS Act exempts from management rights under the Statute only the establishment and termination of flexible and alternative schedules has been specifically rejected<span class="Italic">. See Bureau of Land Management, Lakeview District office, Lakeview, Oregon v. FLRA</span>, 864 F.2d 89, 92 (9th Cir. 1988). In rejecting the argument, the court held that "[i]n order for employees to have the flexibility and choice envisioned by the [AWS Act], both the overall contours of the employees' available choices...<span class="Italic">and</span> the manner in which an individual's choice is exercised within those contours, must be subjects included within the terms of the collective bargaining agreement and hence negotiable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 93 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6130(a)(1) and (2) provide:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)(1)In the case of employees in a unit represented by an exclusive representative, any flexible or compressed work schedule, and the establishment and termination of any such schedule, shall be subject to the provisions of this subchapter and the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between the agency and the exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Employees within a unit represented by an exclusive representative shall not be included within any program under this subchapter except to the extent expressly provided under a collective bargaining agreement between the agency and the exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, because alternative work schedules are fully negotiable within the limits set by the Work Schedules Act, proposals concerning an agency's alternative work schedules program are negotiable without regard to whether they are contrary to the various provisions of &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See AFGE</span>, 57 FLRA at 767; <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-109</span>, 56 FLRA 1043, 1045 (2001); <span class="Italic">Space Systems Div., L.A.

Cir. 1992), decision and order on remand as to other matters, 45 FLRA 1256 (1992). Consistent with this holding, the Authority has rejected the claim that an arbitration award requiring an agency to bargain over an alternative work schedule is inconsistent with any management right under &#x00A7; 7106, on the ground that such provisions are fully negotiable and enforceable<span class="Italic">. See United States EPA, Research Triangle Park, N.C.</span>, 43 FLRA 87, 92 (1991) (EPA); <span class="Italic">see also NTEU, Chpt. 24</span>, 50 FLRA at 333 (finding that an award enforcing an AWS provision is not inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5546 because &#x00A7; 5546 is not a law superseding the Work Schedules Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the provision at issue in this case is enforceable without regard to the management rights provisions in &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, it is not necessary to consider whether it is a permissive provision under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). Decision at 11. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's contrary to law exception based solely on the Work Schedules Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">A decision reviewing an arbitration award, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1557 and VARO, Denver, Colo.</span>, 54 FLRA 121, 121-25 (1998), provided insight into the connection between national and supplemental (local) agreements' provisions concerning compressed work schedules:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have a master agreement that provides that local supplemental agreements may "include provisions on all negotiable matters...as long as[ ] the provisions d[o] not conflict with the [m]aster agreement." Consistent with the master agreement, the Union, an AFGE Local, and the Agency, a VA Regional Office, have a local supplemental agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This supplemental agreement contains a provision permitting the implementation of flexible and compressed work schedules.&#x2003;However, in 1985, pursuant to negotiations with AFGE and a decision of the Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP), VA issued a nation-wide policy prohibiting the use of compressed work schedules (CWS). VA Personnel Policy Manual (Policy Manual), Chapter 610....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1994, the Union and the Agency entered into a partnership agreement pursuant to Executive Order 12871. Subsequently, the regional Partnership Council set up under that agreement determined that the parties would experiment with CWS. It submitted a CWS plan to VA's Under Secretary for Benefits, who denied the request, referring the parties to the earlier FSIP decision. In May, 1995, the Partnership Council again submitted a CWS plan and requested that the Under Secretary reconsider his denial. After several months, the Union was advised that the plan would not be implemented and it filed the instant grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator stated the issue as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In January, 1996, did the [Regional Office] Director and [the Union], have the authority to implement an experimental compressed work schedule, developed by the partnership council; if so, what should be the remedy?</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 3. The Arbitrator found that "Article 4, Section 4 of the Master agreement restricts bargaining at the local level [where] the Agency has met its bargaining obligations at the national level." The Arbitrator found that the VA's 1984 termination of compressed work schedules, which included bargaining with AFGE and referring the matter to the FSIP, provided such a restriction. The Arbitrator found that this policy change precluded further use of CWS within VA and overrode any supplemental agreement to the contrary. According to the Arbitrator, "[c]learly, Article 4, Section 4, of the National Agreement exercises the control over the local contract anticipated in Section 7114I(4) of the [Statute].[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Section 7114I(4) of the Statute provides that, "[a] local agreement subject to a national or other controlling agreement at a higher level shall be approved under the procedures of the controlling agreement or, if none, under regulations prescribed by the agency."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also found that there was nothing in Executive Order 12871 that required bargaining on issues that had been bargained or that permitted local unions to circumvent national agreements.&#x2003;The Arbitrator concluded, therefore, that the Agency and the Union did not have the authority to implement the CWS agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the award is contrary to the Work Schedules Act, because the Agency never reopened the supplemental agreement to cancel its provision for compressed work schedules. Where a party's exceptions involve an award's consistency with law, the Authority must review the questions of law raised by the Arbitrator's award and the parties' exceptions <span class="Italic">de novo. National Treasury Employees Union</span>, <span class="Italic">Chapter 24 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal</span> <span class="Italic">Revenue Service</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The termination of alternate work schedules provided for in a collective bargaining agreement must be effected in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6131. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6130(a)(1); <span class="Italic">U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North</span> <span class="Italic">Carolina and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 3347</span>, 43 FLRA 87, 93 (1991). An agency may terminate an alternate work schedule on finding that it has an "adverse agency impact." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6131(a). However, where the agency seeks to terminate an alternate work schedule established under a collective bargaining agreement, the agency must reopen the agreement and bargain with the exclusive representative concerning the decision. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6131(c)(3)(A). If this bargaining reaches an impasse, the parties must present the impasse to the FSIP. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6131(c)(3)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the award is not deficient as contrary to the Work Schedules Act. In 1984, VA negotiated with AFGE a national policy that barred <span id="page_638"></span>establishment of compressed work schedules, which was implemented by a decision of the FSIP. The Arbitrator's findings establish that VA "followed the procedures" for terminat[ing] or not establish[ing] compressed work schedules[ ]" as set forth in the Work Schedules Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Arbitrator found, and the Union does not dispute, that VA and AFGE have a master agreement that allows local supplemental agreements to "include provisions on all negotiable matters...as long as[ ] the provisions d[o] not conflict with the [m]aster [a]greement." As the VA properly imposed a nationwide ban on compressed work schedules pursuant to the master agreement and this agreement controls the terms of local supplemental agreements, the Union has not established that the Agency was required by the Work Schedules Act to separately reopen the local supplemental agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The return of a single employee to a normal schedule from a temporary assignment to cover another employee, who was on a compressed schedule, did not implicate the Work Schedules Act, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1633 and Debakey VAMC</span>, 70 FLRA 752, 753 (2018):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also claims that, under the Work Schedules Act, the Agency has a "duty to negotiate...a change in an employee's CWS." However, the Arbitrator determined that the Act was inapplicable here because the Agency did not "discontinu[e] a CWS"--it merely returned the grievant to her regular schedule. Moreover, while parties are obligated to bargain over certain matters related to alternative work schedules under the Work Schedules Act, there is no obligation to bargain over the application of an established alternative work schedule to a single employee.[20] Therefore, the Arbitrator was correct in concluding that the Agency's decision to return the grievant to her regular schedule did not implicate the Work Schedules Act.</p>
