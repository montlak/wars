<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-152"><span class="space">a.</span> Intent to Create Former Spouse Survivor Annuity or Other Benefit</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A general statement in a divorce decree awarding half of the employee's retirement or pension, subject to a later actuarial determination, without an express statement in the decree of the amount, was insufficient to confer either a survivor annuity or a lump sum payment to a surviving spouse, <span class="Italic">Bottrell v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 338, 340-44 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...OPM found that the divorce decree, specifying that the amount would be determined by an actuary after the execution of the divorce order, failed to comply with the statutory requirements. Additionally, OPM found that the divorce decree did not specifically award a "former spouse" annuity or survivor annuity because the fact that the decree named her as the "sole and primary beneficiary of any death benefits which her husband would receive" was not sufficient to establish that the court intended that she should receive a monthly survivor annuity as opposed to a lump-sum payment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency contends that Federal law prohibits the civil service retirement system from honoring a state court order that awards a portion of the lump-sum death benefit. The agency contends that appellant's divorce decree fails to fall into any of the exceptions to the general rule set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(a) prohibiting the assignment of retirement benefits and that appellant is therefore not entitled to any of her former husband's "retirement/pension." The agency further contends that a correct interpretation of applicable statutes and regulations would deny appellant a survivor annuity and a lump-sum payment, and that a state divorce decree may not award such payments in contravention of statutes and OPM regulations at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8346(a) and 8341(h), and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The general prohibition of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(a) against the assignment of retirement benefits in the form of annuities or lump-sum payments has certain exceptions to benefit former spouses. In order for the appellant to collect from OPM the money described in her divorce decree as "death benefits," it must be established that the provision of the decree is amenable to one of these exceptions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) relates solely to survivor annuities and entitles a former spouse to obtain such an annuity if it was "expressly provided for" in a divorce decree or by statutory election. Similarly, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1), a former spouse may also receive payments from the civil service retirement system, if it was "expressly provided for" by the divorce decree and the payments <span class="Italic">"would otherwise be made to [the]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic"> employee</span>...based upon his service." (Emphasis supplied.) Here, appellant's divorce decree, by its own terms, does not provide her with a survivor's annuity as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h). Thus, the administrative judge properly found that appellant was not entitled to a survivor's annuity. Further, appellant is not entitled to payments under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1) since, under its terms, her former spouse, because of his death, was not eligible to receive regular annuity payments, which would otherwise have been payable to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since appellant's divorce decree did not qualify her for an annuity, we turn to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342 regarding the allocation of lump-sum benefits. Under that provision, an employee is entitled to a lump-sum benefit if he is separated from the service for at least 31 days or is transferred to a position in which he is no longer subject to subchapter III (Civil Service Retirement) of Chapter 83, and he makes an application to OPM for a lump-sum benefit. Lump-sum benefits may be given to a former spouse, subject to the terms of a court order, upon being notified of the employee's application for the lump-sum benefit. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(j)(1). In this case, since a lump-sum credit could not be given to appellant's former spouse under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(a) because he died while still in the government's creditable service, appellant could not receive a lump-sum payment under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(j)(1).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342 (a) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">Subject to subsection (j) of this section, an employee or Member who--(1)(A) is separated from the service for at least thirty-one consecutive days;...(2) files an application with the Office of Personnel Management for payment of the lump-sum credit; (3) is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter..., at the time he files the application; and (4) will not become eligible to receive an annuity within thirty-one days after filing the application, is entitled to be paid the lump-sum credit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(j)(1) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">Payment of the lump-sum credit under subsection (a) of this section--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">(A)&#x2003;may be made only if any current spouse and any former spouse of the employee or Member are notified of the employee or Member's application; and</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c) authorizes lump-sum benefits to be paid to persons surviving an employee in a prescribed order of precedence. The first designated beneficiary, under this provision, is one specifically designated by the employee in a signed and witnessed writing received by OPM before his death. The provision further specifies that a designation in another document not so executed and filed will have no force or effect. Thus, unless she is so designated the beneficiary, a former spouse has no entitlement to a lump-sum benefit under this statute's order of precedence. Since appellant was not designated a beneficiary of the lump sum in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c), she could not receive a lump-sum payment. <span class="Italic">See also</span> FPM Supplement Chapter 831-1, Subchapter S17(b) (September 21, 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, a lump-sum "death benefit" is not a proper subject for a qualifying court order under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1704 and 831.1703. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704(a) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A former spouse is entitled to a portion of an employee's <span class="Italic">retirement benefits</span> only to the extent that the division of <span class="Italic">retirement benefits</span> is expressly provided for by the court order. The court order must "divide employee retirement benefits, award a payment from employee retirement benefits, or award a former spouse annuity." (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1703 specifically excludes lump-sum benefits from its definition of "employee retirement benefits." Therefore, we find that the administrative judge erred in finding that the divorce decree was a qualifying court order that awarded appellant a lump-sum benefit and conclude that it does not fit into any of the above exceptions to the non-assignability of retirement benefits under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(a).[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The final exception to the prohibition against the assignability of retirement benefits is contained in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 659 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> We agree with the agency's petition for review that these sections dealing with alimony have no applicability to this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McDannell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 716 F.2d 1063 (5th Cir. 1983), the court held that, because the former spouse's divorce decree did not conform to OPM's regulations regarding the method of payment of retirement benefits, OPM was not authorized to pay the former spouse, and that she would have to go back to court to obtain an order that conformed to the requirements of OPM's regulations. Here, appellant's divorce decree similarly fails to conform to OPM regulations regarding the method of payment. Moreover, in an analogous situation involving beneficiaries of Federally-sponsored life insurance, the United States Supreme Court held that, where there is a state divorce decree that names beneficiaries of a life insurance policy inconsistently with Federal statutes pertaining to the designation of beneficiaries, the Federal statutes will prevail. <span class="Italic">Ridgway v. Ridgway,</span> 454 U.S. 46 (1981). Similarly, we conclude that <span id="Page_4341"></span>appellant's state divorce decree specifying "death benefits" is insufficient to satisfy the previously discussed federal statutes and regulations, and that appellant may not, therefore, receive benefits from OPM pursuant to her state court decree.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The need for a specific provision for a former spouse survivor annuity was noted in <span class="Italic">Downing v. OPM</span>, 619 F.3d 1374, 1375-78 (Fed. Cir. 2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Downings were married on December 18, 1965. On July 28, 2003, Ms. Downing filed for divorce, which did not become final until October 2006. When Mr. Downing retired from the United States Department of the Army on March 3, 2004, he elected to provide a survivor annuity for Ms. Downing, his then current spouse. The instructions for the Standard Form (SF) 2801 that Mr. Downing filled out and signed stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The reduction in your annuity to provide a survivor annuity for your current spouse stops if your marriage ends because of death, divorce or annulment. However, you may elect, within 2 years after the marriage ends, to continue the reduction to provide a former spouse survivor annuity for that person....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 22, 2004, Mr. and Ms. Downing signed a separation agreement, referred to as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order ("QDRO"). Thereafter, a divorce decree in October 2006 dissolved the marriage and specifically provided that Ms. Downing would receive "[O]ne-half of the Thrift Savings Plan and [O]ne-half of the Civil Service Retirement benefits for his retirement from the United States Civil Service plus [one-half] of all accrued interest and increase awarded or earned by TSP through the date funds are transferred to [her]." It did not mention any survivor benefits for Ms. Downing after Mr. Downing's death.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the SF 2801 form that he signed at the time of his retirement, in December 2006 and 2007, Mr. Downing received the annual notice OPM sent to all CSRS annuitants that explained he must make a new survivor annuity election within two years of divorce to provide survivor annuity benefits for a former spouse. These notices contained the following provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Survivor Annuity Election for a Former Spouse</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Eligibility and Time Limits--With some exceptions, retirees are eligible to elect or reelect a reduced annuity to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse if they timely submit an election to OPM 1) within 2 years after the date the marriage ended by divorce or annulment or 2) within 2 years after the date another former spouse loses entitlement to a potential survivor annuity. Please note that a new survivor annuity election is required within 2 years after the divorce if you wish to provide a former spouse annuity, even if at retirement you elected to provide a survivor annuity for that spouse. The law provides for the continuation of a survivor reduction made at retirement after divorce if the annuitant reelects a survivor annuity for the former spouse within 2 years of the divorce. Continuing the survivor reduction, by itself, does not demonstrate an unmistakable intent to make a former spouse survivor election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Downing did not file an election to provide Ms. Downing with a survivor annuity after their divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After Mr. Downing died on March 13, 2008, Ms. Downing filed an application with OPM seeking survivor annuity benefits. OPM denied Ms. Downing's original request as well as her request for reconsideration. Ms. Downing unsuccessfully appealed the reconsideration decision to the Board. The administrative judge concluded that Mr. Downing did not expressly provide survivor annuity or post-death benefits to Ms. Downing in the divorce decree, and even if Mr. Downing intended for Ms. Downing to receive survivor benefits, it is not binding on OPM. Further, he determined that OPM adequately notified Mr. Downing of the requirement that he must file a reelection, but he did not reelect to provide his former wife with survivor benefits within two years of their divorce. Ms. Downing did not appeal this initial decision and it became the final decision of the Board. Ms. Downing timely petitions for review. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Ms. Downing contends that although the divorce decree was "admittedly poorly written," the QDRO clearly intends for her to receive former spouse survivor annuity benefits and she did not need to use "magic words" to obtain them. She also argues that Mr. Downing did not receive adequate notice because OPM failed to follow its own rules when it continued to withhold amounts from Mr. Downing's annuity payments instead of terminating them upon divorce pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A).1 We address Ms. Downing's arguments in turn. We note, however, that our scope of review is limited. We may only set aside the Board's decision if it is "(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Ms. Downing was entitled to survivor annuity benefits as a result of Mr. Downing's election at retirement, that entitlement terminated when the Downings divorced in October 2006. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5). The law provides that a former spouse of a federal employee is entitled to a survivor annuity if and to the extent a divorce decree or court order expressly provides for one, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1), or if the annuitant makes a new election to grant a survivor annuity within two years after the date on which the marriage dissolves. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8341(h)(1), 8339(j)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Ms. Downing argues that she did not need to use "magic words" in her QDRO and divorce decree, and Mr. Downing clearly intended to award her former spouse survivor annuity benefits. Section 838.804 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, provides that "[a] court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing <span class="Italic">unless it expressly awards a former spouse survivor annuity or expressly directs an employee or retiree to elect to provide a former spouse survivor annuity"</span> in that it must identify the retirement system and state that the former spouse is entitled to former spouse annuity or direct the retiree to elect to provide a former spouse survivor annuity pursuant to &#x00A7; 838.912. (Emphasis added). Section 838.912 provides that "[t]he court order must contain language such as 'survivor annuity,' 'death benefits,' 'former spouse survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341,' etc." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.912. We set forth the framework for analyzing whether a court order without any magic words provides the survivor annuity benefit under &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) in <span class="Italic">Fox v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 100 F.3d 141 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The court must first determine whether the order contains a pertinent clause regarding a survivor annuity; second, if such a clause exists, the court "must inquire whether the operative terms in that clause can fairly be read as awarding the annuity"; and third, if it does, the court must "examine any evidence introduced concerning the marriage parties' intent and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the document to interpret the clause." <span class="Italic">Hayward v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 578 F.3d 1337, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">see Fox,</span> 100 F.3d at 146. If there is only one possible meaning for the term, such that it is a CSRS survivor annuity, then it is "expressly provided for" in the court order under &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1). Neither the QDRO nor the divorce decree makes reference to or contains a pertinent clause regarding a survivor annuity for Ms. Downing. Because the court order does not expressly provide Ms. Downing with a former spouse survivor annuity, it is irrelevant that Mr. Downing may have intended otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, there is no dispute that Mr. Downing failed to file an election, providing Ms. Downing with a survivor annuity after their divorce. Ms. Downing argues that she is entitled to survivor annuity benefits because Mr. Downing, who had adult Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, did not receive adequate notice of the requirement to reelect in light of OPM's failure to terminate withholding amounts under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A), and he intended for her to receive a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A former spouse may receive survivor annuity benefits in the absence of a new election by the annuitant if (1) the annuitant did not receive the required annual notice of his election rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j), <span class="Italic">see</span> Act of July 10, 1978, &#x00A7; 3, Pub.L. No. 95-317, 92 Stat. 382, amended by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978, &#x00A7; 102, 92 Stat. 3783 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note (2006) ("Annual Notice to Annuitant of Rights of Election Under Subsecs. (j) and (k)(2) of This Section")), and (2) "there is evidence sufficient to show that the retiree indeed intended to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse." <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 450 F.3d 1332, 1334-35 (Fed. Cir. 2006) <span class="Italic">(quoting Wood v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 241 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). Under the facts of this case, the first prong is clearly not met. Mr. Downing did receive adequate notice that he was required to reelect with OPM, within two years of the divorce, to provide survivor annuity benefits through the form, SF 2801. <span class="Italic">Cf. Simpson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 347 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (holding that notice is insufficient if it does not make clear that a reelection after divorce is required to provide such an annuity for a former spouse). He filled out and signed this form at the time of his retirement. J.A. 33-34. He also received the annual notices sent to him by OPM in December 2006 and 2007 explaining that he was required to reelect within two years after the divorce to provide a former spouse annuity even though he elected to provide such a survivor annuity at retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the dissent points out, the circumstances of this case are unusual because Mr. Downing made an election for survivor annuity benefits at retirement, after Ms. Downing filed for divorce but more than two years before the divorce became final. In addition, OPM thereafter continued to make deductions from Mr. Downing's annuity even though they should have automatically terminated under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A). The clear statutory language, however, makes no exception to the requirement that a new election must be made within two years after the marriage dissolves where the employee received adequate notice. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8341(h)(1), 8339(j)(3). Because Mr. Downing received the statutorily required notice and failed to file a new election after the date of their divorce, Ms. Downing is not entitled to a survivor annuity irrespective of Mr. Downing's intent. Accordingly, Ms. Downing fails to establish that she was entitled to survivor annuity benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board's decision to deny Ms. Downing's request for former <span id="Page_4342"></span>spouse survivor annuity benefits was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion, but rather is supported by substantial evidence, we affirm.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The significance of the death of the annuitant on a subsequent court order (obtained by a former spouse) was described by <span class="Italic">Henderson v. OPM</span>, 98 MSPR 432, 438-39 &#x00B6; 19-20 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a retired federal employee dies, his annuity ends as of the date of his death. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(c). Further, when a court order or decree has apportioned an annuity, payments to the recipient of the apportioned share likewise cease, because the source of the funds no longer is eligible to receive them. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(c); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.233(d). Thus, Henderson's death on October 13, 1998, ended his disability annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Seven weeks after Henderson died, the California court issued the domestic relations order upon which the appellant relies. Although the specific language of the order seems to meet OPM's requirements, OPM can only honor court orders dividing employee annuities during the lifetime of the retiree. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.222(b); <span class="Italic">see Bottrell,</span> 36 M.S.P.R. at 342 (finding that the appellant was ineligible to receive apportioned payments under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1) because her former spouse died and became ineligible to receive payments). Thus, the order was ineffective to apportion future annuity payments because the former spouse's disability retirement annuity ceased upon his death. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(c); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.233(d). We also find that there is no authority for OPM to retroactively apportion the disability retirement payments that it had properly made to the former spouse before his death. OPM properly made these payments because it had not received a court order that was acceptable for processing before the former spouse's death, and it was statutorily required to pay that annuity upon the former spouse's satisfaction of the requirements for obtaining his disability benefits, regardless of the appellant's attempt to enjoin those payments. 5 C.F.R. 838.236(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Rafidi v. OPM</span>, 60 MSPR 337, 340-41 (1994), without a clear provision in a divorce decree, a lump sum could only be conferred through assignment under FERS; that the annuitant's contributions were made from community property did not give the appellant a property right in those contributions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant claims that OPM must nevertheless pay her a sum equivalent to the value (however computed) of Naim Rafidi's federal retirement benefits on the date of their divorce, her claim fails because the divorce decree does not identify a source from which such a sum could be paid. The decree specifies only that the appellant is entitled to receive a portion of her former husband's "retirement benefits," and as noted above, he died before retiring. The court could have awarded the appellant some or all of the FERS death benefit that was otherwise payable to Naim Rafidi's wife at the time of his death.[3] The decree's plain reference to "retirement benefits," however, cannot reasonably be interpreted to include "death benefits" or "survivor benefits."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b)(1)(A) (the widow of a deceased employee who, at the time of his death, had completed more than 18 months, but less than 10 years, of creditable service under FERS, is entitled to a death benefit equal to 50% of the employee's annual rate of basic pay plus approximately $15,000); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8445(f)(1) (the death benefit "which would otherwise be payable to a widow" under section 8442(b)(1)(A) is payable (in whole or in part) to the former spouse of the deceased federal employee, "if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation"). In this case, the benefit payable upon Naim Rafidi's death was approximately $35,000.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A divorce decree awarding death benefits to a surviving spouse was construed to include a former spouse survivor annuity in <span class="Italic">Timmers v. OPM</span>, 101 MSPR 305, 308 &#x00B6; 9, 2006 MSPB 47 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the past, the Board has held that the term "death benefits" is ambiguous because it is subject to more than one interpretation: it could refer either to survivor annuity benefits or a lump-sum payment. <span class="Italic">Thomas v.

Since the issuance of <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, however, OPM has amended its regulations to clarify that court orders awarding "death benefits" to a former spouse are sufficient to constitute an award of survivor annuity benefits. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.912(a); <span class="Italic">see also</span> "Guidelines for Interpreting State Court Orders Awarding Survivor Annuity Benefits to Former Spouses," 5 C.F.R. part 838, subpart J, Appendix B.</p>
