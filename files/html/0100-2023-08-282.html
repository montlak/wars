<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-277"><span class="space">b.</span> Waiver of Right to Appeal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 1, 5-6 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15 (1999) (modified by <span class="Italic">Landers v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 117 MSPR 109, 2011 MSPB 99 (2011), <span class="Italic">post</span>), remanded for analysis of hearing entitlement and to determine the effect of a last chance agreement on a claim that the appellant was improperly disciplined for failure to follow proper procedures to request military leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...On review, the agency has submitted a copy of a September 11, 1998 LCA between the parties. The LCA indicates that it was reached in the course of a prior Board appeal (MSPB Docket No. SF-0752-98-0583-I-1) from the appellant's removal effective June 12, 1998, for falsification of documents related to his request for military leave. It provides that the agency would return the appellant to work and further provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5.&#x2003;Appellant acknowledges and agrees that all future requests for leave, whether paid or unpaid, for military or military reserve duties, and all PS Forms 3971 submitted for said requests for leave, shall be accompanied by verification of military duty or activity from the headquarters office of the military service for which Appellant requests leave. Said verification shall be submitted with the PS Form 3971 prior to the time leave is actually used, except as permitted by the WAMB Plant Manager.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">6.&#x2003;Appellant agrees to waive his right to grieve or appeal any Agency action based upon his failure to meet the provisions of Paragraphs No. 4 and No. 5 above. "Appeal" is defined as an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Office of Special Counsel, the National Labor Relations Board, or any court of law, whether state or federal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the LCA, the appellant waived his right to file a Board appeal from any agency action based on his failure to timely submit documentation in support of his request for military leave. The instant appeal is from the agency's action charging the appellant with AWOL and suspending him for failure to submit the required documentation in support of his request for military leave. It thus appears that the appellant waived his right to file the instant appeal. The issue of Board jurisdiction is always before the Board and may be raised by either party or <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Board at any time during a Board proceeding. <span class="Italic">E.g., Engler v. Department of the Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 109, 114 (1995). Thus, although the agency does not argue on review that the LCA barred this appeal, the jurisdictional issue of whether, in the LCA, the appellant waived his right to file this appeal must be developed and adjudicated on remand. <span class="Italic">See McCall v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 666-67 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (a knowing and voluntary waiver of appeal rights in an LCA is not void as a matter of public policy).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, in <span class="Italic">Bodus v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 82 MSPR 508, 516 &#x00B6; 15 (1999), the Board stated that "pure USERRA cases [i.e., cases such as this in which the Board's jurisdiction is derived solely from USERRA and not from any other source] are not <span class="Italic">appeals</span> of personnel actions" but are "petitions for remedial action like Special Counsel petitions for corrective action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214 and individual right of action (IRA) cases under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221." (Original emphasis.) Here, the LCA included language waiving the right to file an "appeal," which was "defined as an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC], the Office of Special Counsel [OSC], the National Labor Relations Board, or any court of law, whether state or federal." Based on this definition, we find that the term "appeal," as used in <span id="Page_461"></span>the LCA, was not intended to be narrowly or technically construed since it includes different types of filings before various fora. For instance, it includes a "petition for corrective action" before OSC and a "civil action" before a U.S. district court. 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), 7702(e), 7703(b)(2). We therefore find that the term encompasses the appellant's USERRA claim before the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Noting the result in <span class="Italic">Johnson, supra,</span> the Board determined that a USERRA claim for military leave benefits was waived through a settlement agreement with a broad-scope release, <span class="Italic">Landers v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 117 MSPR 109, 110-16 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-15, 2011 MSPB 99 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a request for corrective action under USERRA, asserting that between 1980 and 2001 the agency improperly charged him with military leave on nonwork days. In response, the agency filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that, in an August 8, 2006 settlement agreement between the appellant and the agency, the appellant released any and all claims, known or unknown, against the agency based on any cause of action occurring up to and including the date of the agreement.[1] The agency submitted the August 8, 2006 settlement agreement into the record, and asserted that the appellant voluntarily and knowingly waived his right to file the instant appeal because the agency's allegedly improper actions in charging him with military leave predated the August 8, 2006 settlement agreement. In reply, the appellant asserted that the claims and issues involved in the settlement agreement were unrelated to those in the instant appeal filed pursuant to USERRA and that, regardless, he did not have the ability to waive his substantive USERRA rights in a contractual agreement in accordance with 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The August 8, 2006 settlement agreement was entered into the record in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in resolution of an action between the appellant and the agency, in which the appellant alleged that the agency retaliated against him and discriminated against him based on his gender.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed the appellant's request for corrective action under USERRA. The administrative judge rejected the appellant's assertion that his waiver of appeal rights was unenforceable pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, finding that the legislative history of the statute indicated that Congress only sought to prohibit the limiting of USERRA's substantive rights by union contracts and collective bargaining agreements and that the Board has previously held that an appellant may waive his right to appeal from an alleged violation of USERRA. Initial Decision at 2 (citing <span class="Italic">Garrett v. Circuit City Stores, Inc.</span>, 449 F.3d 672, 680 (5th Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 1, 6-7 (1999)). The administrative judge thus found that, because the settlement agreement meets all the legal requirements necessary for enforcement and, in light of the fact that the appellant did not otherwise argue that the agreement was unenforceable for any reason, the appellant's waiver of his right to appeal from an alleged violation of USERRA was enforceable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will consider a settlement agreement reached outside of a Board proceeding to determine its effect on an action before the Board and any waiver of Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Swidecki v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 7, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 182 Fed. Appx. 992 (Fed. Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 81, 84 (1998). The appellant may challenge the validity of the settlement agreement if he believes that the agreement was unlawful, involuntary, or resulted from fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 13. He may also challenge the enforceability of any waiver of Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant renews his assertion that pursuant to the terms of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, he could not waive his rights under USERRA by way of the August 8, 2006 settlement agreement because the statute supersedes any contract or agreement that reduces, limits, or eliminates any right provided by USERRA. The appellant is correct that USERRA has a specific provision dealing with its relation to other laws, plans, and agreements. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302. Section 4302(b) states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This chapter supersedes any State law (including any local law or ordinance), contract, agreement, policy, plan, practice or other matter that reduces, limits, or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided by this chapter, including the establishment of additional prerequisites to the exercise of any such right or the receipt of any such benefit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b). The appellant essentially argues that the August 8, 2006 settlement agreement is a contract or agreement that eliminates his rights and benefits under USERRA, and, therefore, that it is automatically superseded by the language of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The extent to which and the means by which an appellant may waive his rights under USERRA has not been extensively analyzed or considered by the Board or the Federal Circuit, particularly with respect to the applicability of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302. On this matter, we find the recent treatment of the question by the federal appeals courts instructive. <span class="Italic">See Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39 (although decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit are controlling authority for the Board, the decisions of the other circuit courts are persuasive, but not controlling, authority), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Garrett</span>, cited by the appellant, Mr. Garrett entered into an arbitration agreement with his employer, which provided that employment-related disputes would be settled by final and binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). <span class="Italic">Garrett</span>, 449 F.3d at 674. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that Mr. Garrett's subsequent USERRA claims against his employer were subject to arbitration under the agreement, even in light of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, because his waiver of a judicial forum did not constitute a reduction in the substantive rights and benefits afforded under USERRA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 676-79. The court also analyzed the legislative history of the statute and found that it did not show that Congress intended for &#x00A7; 4302(b) to exclude arbitration agreements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 679-80. Rather, the court found, the legislative history "strongly suggests that Congress intended &#x00A7; 4302(b) only to prohibit the limiting of USERRA's substantive rights by union contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and that Congress did not refer to arbitration agreements between an employer and an individual employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 679-80 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 103-65 (1993), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2453). The court concluded that USERRA claims are subject to arbitration under the FAA, notwithstanding &#x00A7; 4302. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 681.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Wysocki v. International Business Machine Corporation</span>, 607 F.3d 1102, 1107 (6th Cir. 2010), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 131 S. Ct. 945 (2011), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit distinguished <span class="Italic">Garrett</span> from cases, like <span class="Italic">Wysocki</span>, involving a wholesale contractual elimination of all methods to enforce USERRA's rights and benefits. The Sixth Circuit recognized that in <span class="Italic">Garrett</span> the arbitration agreement at issue between Mr. Garrett and his employer was found not to implicate &#x00A7; 4302 because it did not extend to substantive rights and still allowed for a fair opportunity to advance those rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see Garrett</span>, 449 F.3d at 678-81. However, the court found that the contractual agreement at issue in <span class="Italic">Wysocki</span>, which is similar in many ways to the settlement agreement at issue in the instant Board appeal, "squarely implicates &#x00A7; 4302" because it effectively eliminated his substantive rights under USERRA. <span class="Italic">Wysocki</span>, 607 F.3d at 1107.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the date of his termination by IBM, following his return from military service in Afghanistan, Mr. Wysocki signed a Release as part of an Individual Separation Allowance Plan he negotiated with IBM. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1104. The Release provided that Mr. Wysocki waived "all claims, demands, actions or liabilities [h]e m[ight] have against IBM of whatever kind," and included within its scope "any other federal, state or local law dealing with discrimination in employment including, but not limited to, discrimination based on...veteran status...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In exchange for his waiver, Mr. Wysocki received $6,023.65 as a gross severance payment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> While the court found that the Release, which effectively eliminated all of Mr. Wysocki's procedural and substantive rights under USERRA, implicated &#x00A7; 4302, it also found that it was not automatically superseded by &#x00A7; 4302. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1107.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, the Sixth Circuit found that the critical inquiry was whether the Release was exempt from the operation of &#x00A7; 4302(b) by &#x00A7; 4302(a) because the rights provided to Mr. Wysocki in the Release were more beneficial than those he waived under USERRA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Section 4302(a) provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Nothing in this chapter shall supersede, nullify or diminish any Federal or State law (including any local law or ordinance), contract, agreement, policy, plan, practice, or other matter that establishes a right or benefit that is more beneficial to, or is in addition to, a right or benefit provided for such person in this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Wysocki</span>, the court noted that, while USERRA's provisions are to be liberally construed in favor of veterans, the statute's legislative history "clearly envisioned that veterans would be able to waive their individual USERRA rights by clear and unambiguous action." <span class="Italic">Wysocki</span>, 607 F.3d at 1108 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 103-65, at 20 (1993), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2453 ("The Committee wishes to stress that rights under chapter 43 belong to the claimant, and he or she may waive those rights, either explicitly or impliedly, through conduct."); S. Rep. 103-158, at 41, <span class="Italic">available at</span> 1993 WL 432576, at *36 (Oct. 18, 1993) ("The rights under chapter 43 belong to the employee and, as such, can only be waived through unambiguous and voluntary action by the employee."). The court found that the Release "used clear and unambiguous language and involved a valuable amount of consideration." <span class="Italic">Wysocki</span>, 607 F.3d at 1108. It further found that Mr. Wysocki understood that the Release eliminated his USERRA rights because it covered claims based on "veteran status" and that it appeared that Mr. Wysocki signed the Release "because he believed that the rights provided in the Release were more beneficial than his USERRA rights...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court emphasized that there was no evidence of mistake, incapacity, fraud, misrepresentation, unconscionability, or duress in the negotiation of the Release, and that, therefore, it was exempted from the operation of &#x00A7; 4302(b) by &#x00A7; 4302(a). <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(a)-(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_462"></span>In the instant case, the administrative judge did not reach the question of whether &#x00A7; 4302(a) exempts the August 8, 2006 settlement agreement from the operation of &#x00A7; 4302(b). Instead, the administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Garrett</span> for the proposition that the legislative history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 "strongly suggests that Congress only intended to prohibit the limiting of USERRA's substantive rights by union contracts and collective bargaining agreements rather than by settlement agreements between an employer and an employee."[2] This was a misstatement of the holding of <span class="Italic">Garrett</span>. As discussed above, the Fifth Circuit's analysis of &#x00A7; 4302(b) did not turn on the distinction between union contracts and collective bargaining agreements on the one hand, and individual agreements on the other, but rather on the distinction between substantive and procedural rights under USERRA. The court in <span class="Italic">Garrett</span> thus did not consider the question of whether a waiver of both procedural and substantive rights under USERRA may be waived by a contractual agreement between an employee and an employer. Because enforcement of the settlement agreement at issue here would provide the appellant with no opportunity to present or prevail on a USERRA claim stemming from any agency action prior to August 8, 2006, we find, contrary to the initial decision, that the agreement implicates &#x00A7; 4302(b). <span class="Italic">See Wysocki</span>, 607 F.3d at 1107.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The administrative judge also found that the Board previously held that an appellant may waive his right to appeal from an alleged violation of USERRA in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 1. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> assumed, without finding, that an appellant necessarily may waive his right to file a request for corrective action under USERRA in a contractual agreement, it is hereby modified in accordance with our analysis and holding in the instant case. <span class="Italic">See Johnson</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, as in <span class="Italic">Wysocki</span>, we find that the settlement agreement is exempted from the operation of &#x00A7; 4302(b) by &#x00A7; 4302(a). <span class="Italic">See Wysocki</span>, 607 F.3d at 1108. The settlement agreement stated that the appellant "hereby releases, remises, and forever discharges [the agency] ...from <span class="Italic">any and all</span> claims, causes of action, suits, damages, attorney fees, right to monetary or equitable relief, known or unknown, for anything or any matter occurring up to and including the date of this Agreement...." It further stated that the appellant agreed "not to initiate any complaint, appeal, grievance or litigation in any manner against the agency...under any state, local, or federal law or regulation as regards any issue arising from his employment with the agency...." The agreement also stated that the appellant agreed "not to bring and to forever waive his rights to raise claims which include, but are not limited to, discrimination claims or demands [he] may have based on his employment with the agency, including any rights or claims he may have under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act, and any other federal, state, or local laws or regulations prohibiting employment discrimination."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the settlement agreement did not explicitly state that it covered claims under USERRA or claims based on "veteran status," we find that the above-quoted language is clear and unambiguous and informed the appellant that he was waiving "all claims" arising under any federal law for any agency action occurring up to and including the date of the agreement. Further, the settlement agreement involved valuable consideration in the form of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a within-grade increase, restoration of 931 hours of annual leave, payment of $25,000, and the allowance of liberal use of leave until the appellant's scheduled May 1, 2007 retirement date. While the appellant apparently proceeded <span class="Italic">pro se</span> in his suit against the agency in federal court, from which the settlement agreement resulted, the appellant worked as a GS-15 Attorney (Contract) for the agency. Moreover, the settlement agreement provided the appellant with 21 days to review and consider the agreement, and the agreement stated that both parties were provided with time to consult with counsel prior to signing. Under these circumstances, there is enough evidence in the record to find that the appellant signed the settlement agreement with the belief that the consideration provided by the agreement was more beneficial than the preservation of his rights to bring additional claims against the agency, which necessarily included his right to file a request for corrective action under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Wysocki</span>, 607 F.3d at 1108. Moreover, as the administrative judge recognized, the appellant did not otherwise argue that the terms of the settlement agreement were unenforceable. Additionally, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the agreement was the product of misrepresentation, fraud, mistake, or duress. Accordingly, we find that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 does not invalidate the August 8, 2006 settlement agreement and that the appellant waived his right to request corrective action for any alleged violation of USERRA by the agency that occurred up to and including the date of the settlement agreement. We therefore DISMISS the appellant's request for corrective action under USERRA.</p>
