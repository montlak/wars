<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-44"><span class="space">6.</span> Employees Affiliated With Organizations Representing Others Engaged in Administration of Labor Relations Laws; 5 USC 7112(c)(2)</h4>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7112 provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;Any employee who is engaged in administering any provisions of law relating to labor-management relations may not be represented by a labor organization--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;which is affiliated directly or indirectly with an organization which represents other individuals to whom such provision applies.</p>
<p class="noindent">At issue in <span class="Italic">Nat'l Mediation Bd. and AFGE</span>, 54 FLRA 1474, 1478-81 (1998) (<span class="Italic">NMB</span>), was the regional director's decision dismissing a petition for a representation election because the petitioning union was affiliated with the AFL-CIO and, in turn, AFL-CIO affiliates represented employees covered by the Railway Labor Act, a statute administered by the Mediation Board. The regulators would be affiliated with the beneficiaries of the statute administered by the regulators. FLRA affirmed the portion of the regional decision dismissing the election petition for a unit of mediators:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Union Is Indirectly Affiliated With Labor</span> <span class="Italic">Organizations that Represent Employees To Whom</span> <span class="Italic">the RLA Applies</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, section 7112(c) of the Statute prohibits employees who "administer a labor relations statute" from being represented by a labor organization that is "directly or indirectly" affiliated with a labor organization that represents individuals to whom the labor relations statute applies....&#8197;There is no dispute that mediators in the proposed unit "administer" the RLA. There is also no dispute that the Union is an affiliate of the AFL-CIO and that there are unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO who "represent other individuals" under the RLA. The question presented is whether the Union is "directly or indirectly" affiliated with these other unions by virtue of their separate affiliation with the AFL-CIO.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no definition of the phrase "affiliated directly or indirectly" in the Statute and...the Authority has not previously construed this phrase. On its face, the phrase appears to include all affiliation relationships between unions, since there is no apparent category of affiliation that is not subsumed within the universe of "direct" or "indirect." Consistent with this construction, the phrase "affiliated directly or indirectly" includes the relationship between unions that are linked to each other through their separate affiliation with the AFL-CIO. This is the meaning that the Assistant Secretary adopted in construing virtually identical language under Executive Order 11491 in <span class="Italic">National Mediation Board</span> [Case No. 22-09118 (RO) (1978].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Construing the phrase 'affiliated directly or indirectly" as including the relationship between two affiliates of the AFL-CIO is consistent with the legislative history of section 7112(c), which indicates that the purpose of the provision is to "help prevent conflicts of interest and appearances of conflict of interest." 124 Cong. Rec. H9634 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> Subcommittee on Postal Personnel and Modernization of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., <span class="Italic">Legislative History of the</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, Title VII</span> <span class="Italic">of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</span> at 925 (Committee Print 96-7) (<span class="Italic">Legislative History</span>).[5] The goal of preventing even "appearances" of conflict of interest is furthered by construing the phrase as including the relationship between two affiliates of the AFL-CIO. In addition, the legislative history provides no indication that Congress intended to narrow the interpretation of the phrase that had been applied by the Assistant Secretary.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Construing the phrase "affiliated directly or indirectly" as including the relationship between two affiliates of the AFL-CIO is also supported by the construction of a similar phrase in section 9(b)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC &#x00A7; 159(b)(3). In this regard, "[w]here there are comparable provisions under the Statute and the NLRA [National Labor Relations Act], decisions of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the courts interpreting the NLRA have a 'high degree of relevance' to similar circumstances under the Statute." <span class="Italic">U.S. Geological Survey and Caribbean District</span> <span class="Italic">Office, San Juan, Puerto Rico</span>, 50 FLRA 548, 550 (1995), quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs, Navajo Area Office, Gallup New Mexico</span>, 45 FLRA 646, 652 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 9(b)(3) of the NLRA prohibits the representation of "guards" by a labor organization that "admits to membership, or is <span class="Italic">affiliated directly or indirectly</span> with an organization which admits to membership, employees other than guards." 29 USC &#x00A7; 159(b)(3) (emphasis added). This provision was enacted to "assure employers a core of faithful employees that would not be subject to a possible conflict of loyalties during a dispute...." <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Brinks, Inc. of</span> <span class="Italic">Florida</span>, 843 F.2d 448, 451 (11th Cir. 1988). <span class="Italic">See Brinks</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc</span>, 274 NLRB 970, 971 (1985) (overlapping officers create indirect affiliation under section 9(b)(3) even if no "formal affiliation" of unions). In applying section 9(b)(3), the NLRB has reasoned that a union's affiliation with the AFL creates a disqualifying relationship under this section:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It is inescapable...that the Petitioner, because of its affiliation with the AFL, is "indirectly" affiliated not only with other AFL federal labor unions but also with the national and international labor organizations constituting the AFL that admit employees other than guards to membership.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Schenley Distilleries, Inc., Old Quaker Division</span>, 77 NLRB 468, 469-70 (1948).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Concluding that the phrase "affiliated directly or indirectly" includes two affiliates of the AFL-CIO is thus consistent with the reasoning of the NLRB construing similar language with a similar purpose. Although two unions who are both affiliates of the AFL-CIO may not be in a "formal affiliation" with each other, <span class="Italic">see Brinks, supra</span>, the two organizations may nevertheless have a relationship that constitutes "indirect affiliation," within the meaning of section 7112(c) of the Statute, as they do under section 9(b)(3) of the NLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that its relationship to the AFL-CIO cannot fall within section 7112(c)(2) because that organization does not, itself, represent individuals. However, whether the AFL-CIO represents employees does not determine whether the Union is disqualified under section 7112(c). It is the representation of employees by other union affiliates of the AFL-CIO that is at issue. The other union affiliates represent employees to whom the RLA applies, and the Union's relationship with these other unions constitutes "indirect affiliation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the relationship between the Union and other union affiliates of the AFL-CIO that represent employees covered by the RLA falls within the phrase "indirect affiliation" under section 7112(c)(2) of the Statute. Because the union is indirectly affiliated with other unions that represent employees covered by the RLA, it may not represent employees who administer the RLA.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">NMB</span> litigation continued, following a remand to the region for determination of whether nonprofessional NMB employees were excluded from a unit because of any responsibility they may have had to administer the Railway Labor Act. The nonprofessionals could properly form a unit, <span class="Italic">Nat'l Mediation Bd. and AFGE</span>, 56 FLRA 1, 5-7 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The RD's Decision Raises an Issue on Which There is an Absence of Precedent</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The application for review in this case raises an issue concerning the proper interpretation of section 7112(c) of the Statute. More specifically, the application and the RD's decision raise questions concerning the meaning of the term "administer" as it is used in section 7112(c). Because of an absence of precedent regarding this issue, we grant review of the RD's decision under section 2422.31 (c)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Authority has never interpreted the term "administer" within the meaning of section 7112(c), the Authority has construed this term within the meaning of section 7112(b)(4). That provision precludes employees engaged in administering the provisions of the Statute from inclusion in an appropriate unit. Thus, in <span class="Italic">FMCS, San Francisco</span>, 3 FLRA at 139, the Authority concluded that FMCS mediators "implement and carry out" the mission of the agency and, accordingly, are engaged in "administering" the provisions of the Statute pursuant to section 7112(b)(4). Thereafter, in <span class="Italic">DOL, Solicitor, </span>8 FLRA 286, the Authority applied <span class="Italic">FMCS, San Francisco. </span>In that case, the Authority concluded that employees who enforce sections 7120(a)-(e) of the Statute are engaged in administering its provisions pursuant to section 7112(b)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_51"></span>The Authority applied both of the foregoing cases in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, D.C.</span>, 35 FLRA 1249 (1990), in determining whether section 7112(b)(4) precluded a particular employee from being included in a unit. In so doing, the Authority examined the employee's duties and responsibilities to determine whether the record supported the agency's allegations that the employee was engaged in administering the Statute, within the meaning of section 7112(b)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the RD construed the term "administer," within the meaning of section 7112(c) as it has previously been construed by the Authority under section 7112(b)(4). As each of these provisions was enacted for the same purpose--to protect against a conflict of interest between administering employees and the employees covered by the labor relations statute being administered--there appears to be no practical difference in the manner in which the word "administer," as used in each of these provisions, is construed. Moreover, it is "a normal rule of statutory construction" that "identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning." <span class="Italic">Phoenix</span> <span class="Italic">Area Indian Health Service, Sacaton Service Unit, HU</span> <span class="Italic">HU Kam Hospital, Sacaton, Arizona, </span>53 FLRA 1200, 1210 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Keystone Consolidated Industries, Inc.</span>, 508 U.S. 152, 159 (1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the Authority's previous construction of the term "administer" was accomplished in connection with assessing the duties and responsibilities of professional employees. In the petition currently before us, the Union seeks to represent a unit of non-professional employees who encumber various Agency positions. Consequently, we are presented with the opportunity to further define the meaning of this term.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to <span class="Italic">Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary </span>(1984), the word "administer" means to "to have charge of: MANAGE[.]" <span class="Italic">Roget's II Thesaurus</span> (1988), includes this definition and also states that the word "administer" means to "oversee the provision or execution of[.]" When these definitions are added to the Authority's previous construction of this term, a more comprehensive and meaningful framework is provided. Pursuant to this more expansive definition, section 7112(b)(4) and section 7112(c) would be construed as permitting employees who are not responsible for managing, implementing, carrying-out, or otherwise executing a provision of law relating to labor-management relations to be included in an appropriate unit.[6] In our view, this more comprehensive definition will assist the Authority in assessing future representation cases involving this issue. We will, therefore, adopt and apply it to this and future cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;In further defining the meaning of the term "administer," it is not our intent to create a blanket exclusion for non-professional employees. Indeed, such employees would be prohibited from inclusion in a petitioned-for unit if they are found to manage, implement, carry-out or otherwise oversee the execution of a provision of law relating to labor-management relations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing definition of the term "administer" to the duties and responsibilities of the seventeen, non-mediator employees at issue in this case, we find that the RD did not err in including them in the petitioned-for unit. In particular, we find, in agreement with the RD, that the record fails to support the Agency's claim that these employees "administer" the RLA within the meaning of section 7112(c). Accordingly, we conclude that the RD did not err in granting the Union's petition for an election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The RD Did Not Fail to Apply Established Law or Commit a Prejudicial Procedural Error</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also alleges that review of the RD's decision is warranted because the RD "misstated the legal issue...and failed to apply the established law of [section] 7112(c)." In support of this allegation, the Agency submits that the RD erred when he stated the issue as "whether the seventeen non-professional employees in question 'administer' any provisions of the Railway Labor Act." According to the Agency, the language of section 7112(c) applies to any employee "engaged in administering any provision of law relating to labor-management relations." The Agency further contends that the "complete" legislative history of section 7112(c) "establishes a <span class="Italic">per se </span>prohibition against representation of all [Agency] employees..." We find no merit in the Agency's contentions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we note that in enacting the Statute, Congress expressly identified those agencies that were to be provided a blanket exclusion from its coverage. These agencies, which are listed in section 7103(a)(3), include the Federal Labor Relations Authority, as well as the Federal Service Impasses Panel. The Statute does not exclude the National Mediation Board. Moreover, section 7112(c) is an exclusion that is set forth in a provision concerning the determination of an appropriate unit. Therefore, the very existence of section 7112(c) implies that <span class="Italic">some </span>unit can exist at those agencies that administer a labor-management relations statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, by its plain wording, section 7112(c) of the Statute prohibits any employee who (1) "administers a labor relations statute" from being represented by a (2) "labor organization which represents other individuals" under the statute, or (3) a "direct or indirect" affiliate of such an organization." This language does not, by its terms, provide for a blanket or <span class="Italic">per se </span>exclusion of every individual employed by an agency that administers a statute relating to labor-management relations. Rather, the language prohibits union representation only if the employee is engaged in administering a law relating to labor-management relations. The Supreme Court has recognized, in this regard, that "the statute...is the authoritative expression of the law" and although Committee Reports are authoritative legislative history, they cannot trump a statute's plain meaning. <span class="Italic">City of Chicago</span> <span class="Italic">v. Environmental Defense Fund, </span>114 S. Ct. 1588, 1593 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's claim that the legislative history of section 7112(c) provides support for a blanket or <span class="Italic">per se </span>exclusion of all employees who administer a labor-management relations law, we note that this interpretation of the legislative history is plausible only without reference to the history's complete text. A review of the complete text of the legislative history, however, fails to disclose any intent by Congress to establish such an exclusion. <span class="Italic">See </span>124 Cong. Rec. H9634 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> Subcommittee on Postal Personnel and Modernization of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. Legislative History of the Federal Labor Relations Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 at 925. Instead, it shows that the example of an NLRB employee, cited in support of a blanket exclusion, has been taken out of context. Contrary to the Agency, when the legislative history is read in its entirety, the history clearly shows that it was the intent of Congress that section 7112(c) apply to <span class="Italic">"any employee who is engaged in administering</span> <span class="Italic">any provision of law relating to labor-management</span> <span class="Italic">relations" Id. </span>(emphasis added). Thus, the legislative history does not support the Agency's view that all employees of the NLRB are prohibited from representation under section 7112(c). Rather, the history indicates that <span class="Italic">any employee </span>of the NLRB <span class="Italic">who is engaged in</span> <span class="Italic">administering the National Labor Relations Act </span>is prohibited from union representation under this provision. As such, we find that the Agency's contentions regarding a blanket or <span class="Italic">per se </span>exclusion for Agency employees must be rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency submits that in analyzing the responsibilities of the employees at issue, the RD applied varying legal standards. According to the Agency, the RD stated that the term "administer" means that employees "enforce, implement, or carry out...provisions of the Railway Labor Act[.]" Nevertheless, the Agency contends that the RD "changed this definition with each functional organizational component[.]" There is no merit, however, to the Agency's contention.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency correctly asserts, the RD concluded that as used in section 7112(c), the word "administer" should be interpreted to mean to "enforce, implement, or carry out" a provision of the RLA. Moreover, a review of the RD's decision shows that he consistently applied this definition to each disputed employee. In so doing, the RD specifically examined the duties and responsibilities of each employee in relation to the mission of the pertinent organizational component. We note that the examples the Agency cites as constituting varying legal standards are simply descriptive phrases taken from the RD's assessment of whether a particular employee's job responsibilities require that employee to enforce, implement or carry out a provision of the RLA. Contrary to the Agency, these descriptions do not constitute various legal standards on which the RD relied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency has not established grounds warranting review of the RD's decision under section 2422.3 1 (c)3(i) and (ii) of the Authority's Regulations. We, therefore, deny this portion of the application.</p>
