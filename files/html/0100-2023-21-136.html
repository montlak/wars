<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-135"><span class="space">3.</span> Substantive Criteria for LEO Determination</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">After some years and many decisions involving LEO appeals, the Board fashioned an approach that relied primarily but not exclusively on the reason for the creation of a law enforcement position to determine its character for purposes of the LEO enhanced annuity entitlement: whether the position's "primary duties [are] maintaining law and order, protecting life and property, and guarding against potential violations of law." <span class="Italic">Watson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 86 MSPR 318, 320-30 &#x00B6; 2-29 (2000) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Watson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 262 F.3d 1292 (Fed. Cir. 2001, <span class="Italic">post</span>)), provided the Board's effort to establish a grand unifying theory:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants occupy or had occupied the position of GS-083 Police Officer, grade level GS-05, at the Norfolk, Virginia, Naval Base (NNB or Base). The appellants in the <span class="Italic">Watson</span> consolidation are covered under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), while the appellants in the <span class="Italic">Jefferson</span> consolidation are covered under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). The appellants requested LEO retirement credit for some or all of the time spent in the position. After the agency denied the requests, the appellants filed the instant appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge held a single hearing for both groups of appellants and based his initial decisions on a common evidentiary record. He found that the appellants are entitled to LEO status. On petition for review, the agency argues that the primary duties of the position are not ones entitling the incumbents to special LEO retirement credit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellants are entitled to LEO service credit, the administrative judge followed the approach set forth in <span class="Italic">Bremby v. Department of the Navy</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 450 (1999). Under that approach, even if the incumbent of a Police Officer position spends the majority of his time patrolling and the evidence shows that his primary duties involve maintaining law and order and protecting life and property, he still is entitled to special LEO retirement credit if he can show that his primary duties "<span class="Italic">involve</span> the investigation, apprehension and/or detention of criminals and/or suspected criminals." <span class="Italic">Bremby</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. &#x00B6; 15. That statement suggests that even if the primary duties of the GS-083 Police Officer position consist of non-LEO duties, namely, maintaining law and order and protecting life and property, the incumbents of the position are nonetheless entitled to LEO credit if their primary duties "involve," to some unspecified degree, LEO duties. Moreover, the <span class="Italic">Bremby</span> approach requires the fact-finder to focus on the incidents and events encountered by the incumbent of the position for certain periods of time to see if he, as an individual, is entitled to LEO service credit, either for that period of time or for his entire period of service in the position (the "incumbent-oriented" approach). <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed in Member Marshall's dissent in <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 409, 412 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Hamilton</span> Dissent), a case which also involved GS-05-083 Police Officers at the NNB, the approach set forth in <span class="Italic">Bremby</span> for determining LEO entitlement placed too much emphasis on the day-to-day duties of a particular incumbent over a limited period of time. <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span> Dissent, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11. For the reasons stated below, the Board now adopts an approach that more affirmatively takes into account the basic reasons for the existence of the position (the "position-oriented" approach). <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8. Under this approach, if the position was not created for the purpose of investigation, apprehension, or detention, then the incumbents of the position would not be entitled to LEO credit. This is not to say that the Board will not consider evidence of what duties the appellants performed from day-to-day in the GS-083 Police Officer position. Rather, the Board will consider that evidence, along with all of the other evidence of record, to ascertain whether the appellant is entitled to LEO retirement coverage. <span class="Italic">Accord Ferrier v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 342, 345 (1994) (in determining whether a position is an LEO position, the Board must examine all relevant evidence, including the position description), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 241 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proper approach to adjudicating claims for LEO service credit may not have been obvious in earlier cases, such as <span class="Italic">Bremby</span>, in part because the evidentiary records in those cases may not have been fully developed. Indeed, the agency here argued that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Bremby</span> was "grossly inaccurate" in describing the conditions at the NNB and the primary duties of the GS-083 Police Officer position. However, the voluminous evidence presented in these appeals covers the creation of the Police Officer position and its classification in the GS-083 series, the way security is handled at the NNB, the division of the Base into patrol areas, and the types of positions created by the Navy to deal with criminal, investigative, security, and police matters. Thus, we find it appropriate in these cases to adopt a more position-oriented approach to the adjudication of claims for LEO retirement credit.</p>

Because the evidence shows that the duties of the GS-083 Police Officer position are not primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of persons convicted or suspected of federal offenses, the Board need not consider whether the "sufficiently rigorous" requirement is met for the Watson appellants, who are under FERS. Thus, the CSRS and FERS statutes are the same for purposes of this analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the FERS and the CSRS statutes give OPM the authority to "prescribe regulations to carry out the provisions of [the statute] administered by [OPM]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8347(a) and 8461(b). OPM's interpretation of statutes which Congress charges it to administer, such as the retirement statute here, is normally entitled to great deference. <span class="Italic">Newman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's FERS regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802 defines "primary duties" for purposes of LEO retirement credit as--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the regulations, "duties that are of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature cannot be considered 'primary' even if they meet the substantial portion of time criterion." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. Further, the regulations state that the definition of law enforcement officer "does not include an employee whose primary duties involve maintaining order, protecting life and property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or investigating persons other than those who are suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM's CSRS regulations contain the same requirements. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear from the language of the statute that it is the "duties of [the] position" that must be examined to determine whether an employee meets the definition of a "law enforcement officer." Thus, under the statute, an employee may receive LEO credit only if the position he occupies is a LEO position, that is, a position whose primary duties are the "investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States." OPM's regulations thus comply with the legislative mandate for a position-oriented approach in cases of requests for LEO credit by requiring that the "basic reasons" for the existence of the position must be the performance of LEO duties. In these appeals, the parties submitted extensive argument and evidence regarding certain on-the-job situations encountered by the appellants during discrete time periods, and the administrative judge spent a great deal of effort reviewing that evidence. However, because the administrative judge followed <span class="Italic">Bremby</span>, he did not look to see why the agency created the GS-083 Police Officer position, but instead examined whether the appellants' experiences showed that their duties "involved" some LEO work. This approach gave no weight to subsection (a) of the regulation quoted above. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802 (defining "primary duties" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)).[3]</p>

Dec. 13, 1999) (Table), <span class="Italic">Bremby</span>, <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, and these cases illustrate, appeals involving GS-083 Police Officers in the Department of Defense reach the Board at different times, in different legal postures, and with different evidentiary records. Moreover, in many ways it is happenstance which appeals involving a position in the same classification series in the same agency reach the Board first; for instance, the agency may issue final decisions on the LEO requests of some employees sooner than it does for others or one administrative judge may adjudicate a case involving <span id="Page_4295"></span>the same position quicker than another administrative judge might. Consequently, the Board could issue serial opinions which can, as illustrated by <span class="Italic">Bremby</span> and these cases, lead to potentially inconsistent results.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board has a procedure for adjudicating an appeal as a "class appeal" if the appellants file as representatives of a class of employees, and the administrative judge finds that "a class appeal is the fairest and most efficient way to adjudicate the appeal and that the representative of the parties will adequately protect the interests of all parties." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.27(a). Use of the class-appeal procedure might be the fairest and most efficient way of deciding the LEO status of a single position, e.g., the GS-083 Police Officer position in the Department of the Navy at the NNB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The classification standards</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency stated, and the appellants have never disputed, that the Police Officer position at issue was classified in the GS-083 occupational series using standards promulgated by OPM. The agency, again without dispute, quoted the OPM standard for the GS-083 series as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">The primary mission</span> of police officers in the Federal service is to <span class="Italic">maintain law and order</span>. In carrying out this mission, police officers <span class="Italic">protect life and property</span>, and the civil rights of individuals. They prevent, detect, and investigate violations of laws, rules, and regulations involving accidents, crimes, and misconduct involving misdemeanors and felonies. They arrest violators, assist in the prosecution of criminals, and serve as a source of assistance to persons in emergency situations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Most police officers are engaged in patrol duties and/or traffic control.</span> In performing patrol duties, they serve as a deterrent to crime and other violations of laws, rules, and regulations. Crime prevention is enhanced by the presence of uniformed officers in an area and by his [sic] being continually alert in observing, inspecting, and investigating circumstances or individuals which appear unusual and suspicious. Police officers regulate pedestrian and vehicular traffic; prevent accidents, congestion, and parking problems; give warnings; issue citations for traffic violations; and make arrests if necessary. They conduct preliminary investigations of crimes, investigate accidents, dispose of complaints, recover stolen property, counsel adults and juveniles, and assist persons needing help. Typically, investigations that remain incomplete at the end of an assigned shift are turned over for completion by detectives or criminal investigators.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added), citing OPM Classification Standards for the GS-083 Occupation Series, Occupational Information at 2-4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A December 1997 "Grade Evaluation Guide for Police and Security Guard Positions GS-0083/GS-0085" (the Guide) published by OPM states that the "<span class="Italic">primary</span> mission and purpose" of the Police Officer series, GS-083, is "to enforce law, maintain law and order, preserve the peace, and protect the life and civil rights of persons. The Guide reiterates at least once that "[t]he <span class="Italic">primary</span> mission of police officers in the Federal service is to <span class="Italic">maintain law and order</span>." It also says that "[i]n some instances, the distinction between police and guard work may not be an easy one to make, because of the similarities between the two kinds of work." OPM's Guide explains to classifiers that positions in the GS-083 Police Officer series are distinguished from positions in the GS-1811 Criminal Investigator series in that the latter series consists of "[p]ositions primarily responsible for investigating alleged or suspected major offenses or violations of specialized laws of the United States." This clarification sets forth OPM's view that, unlike positions in the GS-1811 series, the primary duties of positions in the GS-083 Police Officer series are not the investigation or apprehension of persons suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The classification standards and OPM's Guide for evaluating a GS-083 Police Officer position show that the basic reason for the existence of this position is to maintain order, protect life and property, and guard against or inspect for violations of law. OPM's classification materials thus support a finding that the GS-083 Police Officer position does not meet either the statutory or regulatory definition of a "law enforcement officer." The agency's denial of LEO status to the appellants is therefore consistent with OPM's classification guidance. It is also consistent with <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 1 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 99-3001 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 13, 1999) (Table), a case in which the Board sustained the agency's decision to deny LEO credit to Police Officers in the Department of the Navy who also were in the GS-083 classification series.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The position descriptions</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Position description (PD) No. 6374A covers the GS-083 Police Officer position, grade level 5, and is the one under which the appellants in the <span class="Italic">Watson</span> and <span class="Italic">Jefferson</span> consolidations worked. The Introduction to PD No. 6374A states that the position is in the Community Policing Division, Security Department, at the NNB, and that the Division "provides community policing, law enforcement, and security for the investigation of crimes, protection of life and property." It also states that this mission "includes arrest, apprehension, and detainment of those person(s) suspected of violations of United States Code, and applicable state statutes. The section of the PD entitled "Major Duties and Responsibilities" begins by saying that "[t]he incumbent serves as a Police Officer assigned to a community policing area." It then states that the "position requires the incumbent to perform police duties that involve the investigation, arrest, apprehension or detention of criminals and/or suspected criminals." That section of the PD goes on to say that the incumbent "provides police escorts and directs traffic," "reports unsafe conditions existing in street or other public facilities," responds to emergency situations, and "conducts preliminary investigations."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The PD shows that while incumbents in the GS-083 Police Officer position were expected to investigate, apprehend, or detain criminals or suspected criminals as the need arose, the position was created for the primary purpose of maintaining law and order and protecting persons and property by means of community policing and traffic control. The PD is therefore consistent with OPM's classification guidance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The duties of GS-083 Police Officers at the NNB</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The witnesses, including the appellants who testified, described the duties of a GS-083 Police Officer at the NNB. Commander Hemmingsen said that GS-083 Police Officers can investigate misdemeanors committed in their presence, traffic violations, and violations of Navy rules or regulations. Other criminal or suspected criminal activity is investigated by NCIS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant Watson stated that he patrols for an 8-hour shift, either in a car or on foot, "looking for criminal activity" and traffic violations. Appellant Acres said that when he is patrolling, he is looking for "[a]nything that happens," but he declined to say whether he was looking for any particular criminal or suspected criminal. Commander Hemmingsen averred, without rebuttal, that the majority of patrols are generalized, that is, done for the purpose of being visible and responding to crimes in progress, and that they are not specialized patrols done with the intent of focusing on a particular problem, criminal, or suspect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant Pennington said that GS-083 Police Officers act as "first responders" to crime scenes, that is, they render first-aid or assistance to anyone who is injured, check to see if any suspects are still in the immediate area, secure the scene, and gather preliminary information. Commander Hemmingsen stated that the officers patrol up to the perimeter of the Base. In addition to patrolling and responding to emergencies or reports of criminal activity, the appellants also guard the gates through which traffic enters the Base.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant Pennington acknowledged that he stood guard duty at the gates 24 hours (3 working days) per week. Appellant Streat stated that he stands gate duty 2 to 3 times per week. In his view, gate duty is LEO work because each individual who comes through the gate is a potential suspect. Commander Hemmingsen declared that, at the time of the hearing, four GS-083 Police Officers were assigned to gate duty as their sole duty. Hemmingsen said that the Police Officers check decals on vehicles entering the NNB and ask visitors for identification in order to protect the property and persons on the NNB. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1463. GS-083 Police Officers also check locks and doors on "hot buildings," that is, buildings which hold money or classified materials and which are unoccupied at night.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an attempt to prove their entitlement to LEO coverage, the appellants who testified offered examples of incidents in which they were involved. Appellant Pennington testified that he once was shot at by an individual who had been drinking and was under the influence of marijuana as he (Pennington) drove by in a marked patrol car. He described talking a sailor out of committing suicide, assisting persons from a vehicle that had caught fire, tackling a person who had pulled a gun on him, and writing 600 traffic tickets in 1997. Appellant Watson stated that he used his gun when he saw an individual brandishing a weapon in front of a restaurant close to one of the Base gates. He also discussed finding a gun in a vehicle that he had stopped and detaining a juvenile who had violated curfew. To show that the appellants were not primarily engaged in LEO duties, the agency presented statistics based on Incident Complaint Reports (ICRs).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ICRs are forms that officers complete on "non-routine" incidents. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1367. They include data such as the date, time, and type of incident, as well as witness statements, advisement-of-rights forms, and information on whether drugs or alcohol were involved. In preparing for these appeals, Commander Hemmingsen located the ICRs still in existence for the relevant time periods, tried to "get a feel" for how much time was spent on each incident, looked at computer-aided dispatch records to help him determine how much time an officer spent on an incident, and estimated how much time each task involved in an incident may have taken, e.g., 15 minutes for serving a summons or issuing a speeding ticket. He explained that such estimates were necessary because ICRs do not show the time actually spent on an activity or incident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4296"></span>Commander Hemmingsen also looked for information on the ICRs that might indicate if another officer assisted and, if so, how much time that officer spent on the matter. However, if the person writing the ICR did not include the name of any assisting officer, then the assisting officer was not credited with "LEO work."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Commander Hemmingsen stated that older ICRs, particularly those filed more than 2 years before the hearing, were not available because they had been destroyed under recordkeeping disposal schedules or because the statute of limitations for the alleged crime had expired. He averred that if an officer did not record a task on an ICR, the officer was not given credit for performing that task.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Commander Hemmingsen excluded from his calculations periods of time when some of the appellants were not performing their regular duties at the NNB, for instance, time when appellant Rowland was on light-duty assignment and when appellant Carney was detailed to Oceana. He also declared that some of the ICRs contained, in his opinion, tasks that were outside of the scope of employment, for example, taking photographs of a crime scene with a private camera, searching for a missing child at an off-site supermarket, questioning civilian desk clerks off Base, and breaking up a fight at a bar that was not on the Base. He therefore did not consider those activities to be "LEO work."<span class="Italic"></span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Discussion of the evidence and findings</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's classification standards and guidance show that the GS-083 Police Officer position is not one whose duties are primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of criminals or suspected criminals. The PD for the GS-083 Police Officer position, which follows OPM's classification standards and guidance, is in accord. Weighed together with the evidence showing that the GS-083 Police Officer position at the NNB was not created as an LEO position is testimony that persons encumbering that position at the NNB were on the lookout for potential violations of law, conducted generalized patrols, guarded the gates, checked buildings at night to ensure that they were secure, enforced traffic laws, and acted as "first responders" to emergencies or potential crimes. None of these duties individually or collectively show that the GS-083 Police Officer position was created for the basic reason of investigating, apprehending, or detaining known criminals or suspects. While an incumbent's actual duties are relevant under subsections (b) &#x0026; (c) of OPM's regulation defining "primary duties" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17), <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802, the evidence of the actual duties performed in these cases does not persuade us that--contrary to the official documentation of the position--"the basic reasons for the existence of the position" was actually investigation, apprehension, or detention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency representative said that "no one is arguing that the GS-083 police officers are not real police officers." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1610. Rather, she stated that the "question is one of whether or not their primary duties consist of investigation, apprehension or detention of [criminals] or people suspected of crimes, or whether or not they are primarily responsible for maintaining law and order, for which specifically LEO status is not authorized." Along those same lines, the Board wishes to make clear that by denying the appellants LEO status, it is in no way implying that they do not face danger, do not perform police duties, and do not make an important contribution to the security of the NNB. Rather, their requests must be denied because their primary duties of maintaining law and order, protecting life and property, and guarding against potential violations of law do not meet the statutory definition of "law enforcement officer." <span class="Italic">See Ryan v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 779 F.2d 669, 672 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (definition of "law enforcement officer" is to be "strictly construed" by the Board); <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 773 F.2d 282, 286-87 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (statutory term "law enforcement officer" should not be given expansive application). We therefore sustain the agency's decision that the appellants are not entitled to LEO service credit for any period of time that they occupied the GS-083 Police Officer position at the NNB.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Although not argued by the parties, we note that the approach we adopt today is not precluded by precedent of the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In <span class="Italic">Bingaman v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 127 F.3d 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the evidence showed that OPM at first informed Mr. Bingaman that, in view of a Board decision in favor of an employee in <span class="Italic">Peek v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 430 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 59 F.3d 181 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table), he would be given LEO credit to the date he ceased to encumber his position. 127 F.3d at 1438. This would be consistent with the position-oriented approach. OPM subsequently sent Mr. Bingaman a revised letter stating that if he wished LEO credit for the future, he would have to make annual requests for as long as he remained in his position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Regarding the revised letter, the court noted an administrative judge's finding that OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906(e) required Bingaman to make an annual application for LEO retirement credit covering the immediately preceding year. 127 F.3d at 1438.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There is no explanation, other than the reference to the regulation, as to why OPM changed its mind and required Mr. Bingaman to submit yearly requests for LEO credit. The regulation cited by the administrative judge does not require annual requests for LEO service credit; rather, it states that a CSRS employee can receive no more than 1 year's retroactive LEO service credit if he files a late request for such credit, absent a finding by the agency under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906(f) that he was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from making a timely request. The regulation does not require employees in LEO positions to file yearly "accountings" with OPM. The fact that an administrative judge apparently misconstrued a regulation and the court did not need to reach the issue because it denied Mr. Bingaman's request for LEO credit on the merits, provides no basis to reject a position-oriented approach, which is firmly grounded in the language of the statute and OPM's regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.902 and 842.802.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we find that the appellants are not entitled to LEO service credit because the GS-05-083 Police Officer position they occupied at the NNB was not created primarily to perform LEO duties as defined by statute. The initial decisions are REVERSED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although law enforcement experience may be desirable in an incumbent, when it was not a basic qualification for the job, the service was not creditable law enforcement retirement for the particular job. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">D'Urso v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 82 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cited in <span class="Italic">Watson</span> was <span class="Italic">Bingaman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 127 F.3d 1431, 1433-36, 1439-43 (Fed. Cir. 1997), presenting a comprehensive review of the substantive criteria leading to CSRS and FERS LEO enhanced retirement status for particular positions. While affirming the Board's treatment of the untimeliness of some petitioners' requests for LEO status, in a determination of broader application, the court affirmed the Board's consideration of one or more of six factors to be considered for determining whether an individual qualifies for LEO entitlement under either CSRS or FERS. In particular, without holding any single factor to be essential or dispositive, whether he or she: (1) has frequent direct contact with criminal suspects; (2) is authorized to carry a firearm; (3) interrogates witnesses and suspects, giving <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warnings when appropriate; (4) works for long periods without a break; (5) is on call 24 hours a day; and (6) is required to maintain a level of physical fitness:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners in all four cases work as either Detection Systems Specialists (Airborne) (DSSAs) or Supervisory DSSAs for the Customs Service. DSSAs spend a major portion of their working time aboard aircraft, using on-board surveillance equipment to identify suspected drug smugglers. From their airborne posts, the DSSAs identify particular aircraft or boats as likely smuggling vessels and relay their findings to ground crews that apprehend the suspected smugglers. The DSSAs do not conduct the apprehension of the suspected smugglers on the ground and do not have direct personal contact with suspects.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two of the petitioners, Gary T. Bingaman and Eldon H. Kern, are covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and are therefore seeking LEO benefits under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c)(1) and the regulations pertinent to that statute. The rest of the petitioners are covered by the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) and are therefore seeking LEO credit under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412(d)(2) and the regulations promulgated under that statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under both the CSRS and the FERS, an employee who qualifies for LEO retirement credit is eligible to retire upon attaining age 50 and completing 20 years of LEO service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8336(c), 8412(d)(2). By contrast, most civil service employees are eligible to retire at age 60 with 20 years of service or age 55 with 30 years of service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(a), (b); <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 8412(a), (b). An employee who qualifies for LEO retirement receives a larger annuity than ordinary civil service employees, but is subject to larger deductions from salary during the employee's period of service. In addition, an LEO employee is subject to mandatory early retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8334(c), 8425. An employee can qualify for LEO retirement credit either by serving in a position that has been approved as an LEO position or by applying for LEO credit and satisfying the employing agency that he is entitled to LEO retirement status. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.903-.906, 831.910(a), 842.803-.804, 842.807(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The standards for LEO eligibility differ somewhat between the CSRS and the FERS. The statutory standard for LEO eligibility under the CSRS requires that the duties of the employee's position be "primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of [federal] offenses." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20). The statutory standard for LEO eligibility under the FERS is similar in pertinent part, but additionally requires that the duties of the employee's position be "sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities are required to be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to statutory authorization, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8347(a), 8461(g), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has promulgated regulations that explicate the statutory standards under both systems. Both sets of regulations specify that the definition of law enforcement officer "does not include an employee whose primary duties involve maintaining law <span id="Page_4297"></span>and order, protecting life and property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or investigating persons other than persons who are suspected or convicted of [federal] offenses." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.902, 842.802. In addition, the FERS regulation specifies that a "rigorous position," within the meaning of the statute, is "a position the duties of which are so rigorous that employment opportunities should, as soon as reasonably possible, be limited...to young and physically vigorous individuals." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">A.&#x2003;Bingaman</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Bingaman received LEO retirement credit under the CSRS for his services as a DSSA from February 28, 1989, through July 15, 1993. Bingaman subsequently filed a timely request for LEO credit for the period July 15, 1993, through July 13, 1994. The Department of the Treasury denied Bingaman's request for LEO credit for that period. On Bingaman's appeal, the Merit Systems Protection Board upheld the agency's decision.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the evidence showed that DSSAs such as Bingaman play an important role in the Customs Service's drug interdiction effort, the administrative judge found that Bingaman did not satisfy the Board's test for LEO eligibility. The administrative judge noted that Bingaman does not carry a weapon in the performance of his job, does not question or interview suspects, does not have personal contact with suspects, is not on call 24 hours a day, and has no direct participation in the apprehension of suspects. In sum, the administrative judge concluded that Bingaman's position "does not present unusual physical hazards due to frequent and/or direct contacts with criminals or suspected criminals" and that his duties do not "place him in the frontline of law enforcement work, in that he has no interaction by direct contact with criminals or suspects." The administrative law judge therefore concluded that the evidence was insufficient to show that Bingaman performs the requisite duties of a "law enforcement officer," as that term is used in the statute and regulations governing LEO eligibility under the CSRS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bingaman asserts that his work leads directly to the apprehension and prosecution of suspects and that he is therefore entitled to LEO retirement credit. The administrative judge, he contends, improperly required that he have "frequent direct contact" with criminal suspects in order to qualify as a law enforcement officer. Pointing to the statutory and regulators definition of "law enforcement officer," Bingaman argues that the "frequent direct contact" standard applies to employees who seek LEO credit based on their detention duties, but not to those employees seeking LEO credit because of the criminal investigation duties of their positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20) (referring to law enforcement officers engaged in "detention" as employees "whose duties in connection with individuals in detention suspected or convicted of [federal] offenses...require frequent...direct contact with these individuals"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902 (defining "detention duties" as "duties that require frequent direct contact in the detention...of individuals suspected or convicted of [federal] offenses").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is true that DSSAs play an important role in the Customs Service's drug interdiction program, the importance of a particular employee's contribution to a law enforcement mission is not enough to render that employee a "law enforcement officer" within the meaning of the LEO retirement statutes. Because the early retirement program "is more costly to the government than more traditional retirement plans and often results in the retirement of important people at a time when they would otherwise have continued to work for a number of years,"<span class="Italic">Morgan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 773 F.2d 282, 286-87 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the statutory term "law enforcement officer" has not been given expansive application. To the contrary, as this court has explained, the definition of law enforcement officer in section 8331(20) has been "strictly construed."<span class="Italic">Ryan v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.,</span> 779 F.2d 669, 672 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The LEO retirement credit statutes and the accompanying regulations provide only the most general guidance with respect to the intended scope of the term "law enforcement officer." The legislative history of the statutes, however, is somewhat more helpful. The Senate report on the 1974 legislation that created the general LEO retirement provision explained that the statute was intended to ensure that the covered positions "should be composed, insofar as possible, of young men and women physically capable of meeting the vigorous demands of occupations which are far more taxing physically than most in the Federal Service." S. Rep. No. 93-948 at 2 (1974), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3698, 3699.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Senate report on the subsequent legislation that created the LEO retirement provision for the FERS reiterated the point. The report stated that "law enforcement officer" was defined "to mean an employee with rigorous law enforcement duties that require young and vigorous individuals." S. Rep. No. 96-166, at 41 (1985), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1405, 1446. The definitions of "firefighter" and "law enforcement officer," according to the report, were meant to "include only positions with duties requiring young and physically able employees," and were designed to "exclude other positions associated with firefighting and/or law enforcement which are not necessarily physically demanding."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 6, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1405, 1411. The report further stated that "[t]he limitations in the usage of [the definition of law enforcement officer] are similar to those for the firefighter definition," which the report stated would be limited to employees who "will actually and directly participate in firefighting activities." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 40, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1405, 1445. The mere fact of "frequent contact with criminals," the report added, "is an insufficient reason for a position to be defined as a law enforcement position." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 41, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1405, 1446. The reference to "frequent contact with criminals" indicates that such contact, standing alone, is not sufficient to qualify an employee as a "law enforcement officer," but it does not suggest, as Bingaman argues, that "frequent contact with criminals" should not be considered an important factor in determining whether an employee qualifies for LEO credit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Merit Systems Protection Board has extrapolated from the statutory and regulatory language, in light of the legislative history, to fashion the standard it has applied in this case and others. The Board has thus construed the statutory reference to persons engaged in the "investigation" and "apprehension" of persons suspected of committing federal crimes to be limited to those law enforcement personnel who are most immediately involved in the process of criminal investigation and arrest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without holding any single factor to be essential or dispositive, the Board has identified several considerations that bear on the question whether a particular employee qualifies as a "law enforcement officer" for purposes of entitlement to LEO retirement credit. According to the Board, a "law enforcement officer" within the statutory contemplation commonly (1) has frequent direct contact with criminal suspects; (2) is authorized to carry a firearm; (3) interrogates witnesses and suspects, giving Miranda warnings when appropriate; (4) works for long periods without a break; (5) is on call 24 hours a day; and (6) is required to maintain a level of physical fitness. <span class="Italic">See Hobbs v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. 628 (1993); <span class="Italic">Sauser v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 489 (1993); <span class="Italic">Peek v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. 430 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 59 F.3d 181 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (table); <span class="Italic">Ferrier v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 241 (1995).] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the scope of the statutory category of "law enforcement officer" cannot be crisply defined with a single phrase, the set of factors the Board has developed captures the essence of what Congress intended. Applying those standards, the administrative judge properly found that Bingaman failed to establish that he is eligible for LEO retirement credit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bingaman points out that the pilots flying the airplanes investigating drug-smuggling activities receive LEO credit, but the DSSAs who perform their services in the same airplanes do not. Although the government notes that the pilots have somewhat different duties, it does not defend on the merits the award of LEO credit to pilots, but characterizes the credit given to pilots as attributable to the different role played by Customs Service pilots in drug interdiction programs in the past. In any event, the eligibility of pilots for LEO credit is not before us, and Bingaman is not entitled to LEO credit simply because pilots enjoy that status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">B.&#x2003;Arps</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the <span class="Italic">Arps</span> case the Board affirmed the agency's decision that 14 petitioners (collectively the Arps petitioners), who are covered by the FERS, failed to establish their entitlement to LEO credit. With the exception of petitioner Edmund Price, a Supervisory DSSA, the Arps petitioners are all DSSAs. Price contends that his duties "did not undergo a significant change" when his status changed from a DSSA to a Supervisory DSSA. Because Price does not argue that his Supervisory DSSA position gives him any better claim to LEO retirement credit than is enjoyed by the other Arps petitioners, our discussion applies equally to him and his 13 co-petitioners.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After hearing a number of witnesses testify about the DSSAs' duties, the administrative judge concluded that the petitioners "search for, identify, and <span class="Italic">assist</span> in 'catching' drug smugglers," but they "have no <span class="Italic">direct</span> face to face contact with the criminals or suspected criminals and do not participate in ground apprehensions. Moreover, it is undisputed that they do not carry weapons, or give Miranda warnings, nor are they required to maintain a particular level of physical fitness." While acknowledging that DSSAs have played "an integral part in the success of the agency's mission to thwart drug smugglers," the administrative judge concluded that the evidence failed to show that the petitioners' duties "are primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of [federal] offenses." In addition, finding that the DSSAs' duties do not involve "frontline law enforcement work" entailing unusual physical demands and hazards, the administrative judge concluded <span id="Page_4298"></span>that the duties of the position of DSSA "are not sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in Bingaman's case, we disagree with the petitioners that the administrative judge used the wrong legal standard to determine the petitioners' eligibility for LEO credit. Like the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Bingaman,</span> the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Arps</span> properly declined to extend LEO coverage based on the importance of a particular employee's role in the criminal investigative process, but instead focused on whether the employee's duties were of the physically demanding sort that Congress had in mind when it enacted the LEO retirement statute for FERS employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Arps petitioners also take issue with the administrative judge's finding that the DSSA position is not a rigorous one, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> that it is not a position limited to "young and physically vigorous individuals" pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A)(ii). The petitioners claim that the DSSA position meets the requirements of section 8401(17) because it exposes them to a variety of potential dangers and sometimes requires long working hours. We disagree. The administrative judge assessed the testimony about the rigors and stress associated with the DSSA position and concluded that the position is not so rigorous that it involves duties that only young and physically vigorous persons can perform. The evidence showed that DSSAs are not required to meet any age or fitness requirements, and the administrative judge found that they spend as long as 20 hours airborne only "on occasion." The Board's decision on that issue was therefore supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">C.&#x2003;Adair</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the <span class="Italic">Adair</span> case, the Board found that nine employees (collectively the Adair petitioners), who are covered by the FERS, failed to establish that they were entitled to have the Board order the Department of the Treasury to grant them LEO credit. The Board noted that an employee covered by the FERS who wishes to request LEO credit and preserve the LEO credit claim for review by the Board must make a timely request to his agency pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 842.804(c) provides that an employee who is in a position that has not been designated for LEO credit must, "within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position, formally and in writing seek a determination from the employing agency" that the position is subject to the higher withholding rate applicable to law enforcement officers. If the employee does not do so, the agency's determination that the position is not entitled to LEO credit will be presumed to be correct. That presumption can be rebutted, the regulation provides, if the employee shows "by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c). The agency's decision denying an individual's request for approval of a position as entitled to LEO credit may be appealed to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.807(a). The effect of those two regulatory provisions is that if the employee does not request LEO credit within the six-month period specified in section 842.804(c) or show good cause for the failure to do so the agency's determination will be deemed conclusive and the MSPB will not review the merits of that determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Adair petitioners argued to the Board that a December 6, 1990, memorandum from petitioner Price, a Supervisory DSSA, satisfied the formal written request requirement of the six-month rule. The December 6, 1990, memorandum did not identify any specific employees, but rather referenced an August 15, 1989, memorandum signed by 40 individuals. The Board noted that none of the nine Adair petitioners had signed the August 15 memorandum. In fact, the Board observed, none of the nine Adair petitioners even occupied DSSA positions on August 15, 1989. Concluding that the petitioners had failed to comply with section 842.804(c), the Board dismissed their appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this court, the Adair petitioners assert that a timely request complying with the six-month rule "was made on their behalf," apparently referring to the December 6, 1990, memorandum, which in turn referred to the August 15, 1989, memorandum. The petitioners also contend that "the Agency has been aware for years" that all of the LEO credit requests made after 1989 covered any petitioner "who did not sign the August 1989 letter."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that the petitioners failed to comply with the notification requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c). The regulation requires employees to seek LEO credit through a formal, written request; it does not permit them to satisfy that requirement either by proxy or by reliance on the agency's alleged awareness that all members of a particular group of employees would like to be accorded LEO credit. The Board therefore correctly concluded that under the terms of section 842.804(c) the petitioners failed to rebut the presumption that the agency's decision was correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the Adair petitioners, Wendell Ruegsegger, was not employed as a DSSA at the time of the December 6, 1990, memorandum, but he argues that a December 23, 1992, letter by W. Craig James, a lawyer, constituted the formal, written request required by section 842.804(c). As the government notes, however, the James letter did not identify any specific employees, nor did it specifically request LEO credit or represent that Ruegsegger had retained James in an effort to obtain LEO credit. Instead, the James letter merely followed up on a previous request for LEO credit. We therefore agree with the Board that Ruegsegger failed to submit the formal written request required by section 842.804(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners' arguments are unavailing. While the agency may have been less responsive to the inquiries concerning LEO credit than it should have been, the petitioners have not pointed to any acts of deceit or malfeasance by the agency that would justify invoking equitable estoppel in this case. In particular, the agency had no affirmative duty to advise the petitioners on how to go about requesting LEO credit, and there was therefore no breach of duty on which a claim of equitable estoppel can be based.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners contend that the agency provided information about LEO credit to other employees, but did not provide information to the DSSAs about how to request such credit, and that the differing treatment given to the DSSAs supports their estoppel argument. We find no impropriety in the agency's providing information about LEO eligibility to those employees it deemed entitled to LEO retirement credit, but not to employees the agency has always regarded as ineligible. The petitioners have thus failed to establish that equitable estoppel entitles them to a waiver of the requirement of section 842.804(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, the six-month rule of section 842.804(c) does not apply if an employee proves that he was unaware of his status or that some cause beyond his control prevented him from making a request. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c). The petitioners, however, do not contend that the six-month rule is inapplicable for either of those reasons. We therefore agree with the Board that the Adair petitioners failed to file timely requests for reclassification with the agency and thus did not preserve their right to obtain MSPB review of the Treasury Department's denial of LEO retirement credit for DSSA employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, petitioner Edmond Smith, a Supervisory DSSA, also sought LEO credit for his service, both as a DSSA and as a Supervisory DSSA. The Board found that Smith's promotion to the position of Supervisory DSSA constituted a "significant change in position" and that he failed to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 834.804(c) by making a request for LEO credit after he was promoted from DSSA to Supervisory DSSA. The Board therefore limited its ruling in Smith's case to the period that he served as a DSSA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this court, Smith insists that his promotion to the position of Supervisory DSSA did not entail a "significant change in position," and that the Board erred in limiting its consideration of his claim to the period that he served as a DSSA. We find it unnecessary to determine whether Smith's promotion to the position of Supervisory DSSA constituted a "significant change in position." The Board ruled that Smith was not entitled to LEO retirement credit for his work as a DSSA, and we have upheld that determination. Smith does not contend that his work as a Supervisory DSSA involved different responsibilities that gave him a stronger basis for claiming entitlement to LEO credit; in fact, his entire argument on this point is that his promotion to Supervisory DSSA did not entail a significant change in his duties. Accordingly, even if the Board had addressed the period of Smith's service as a Supervisory DSSA, it would not have reached a different result in his case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">D.&#x2003;Kern</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner Eldon Kern is a Supervisory DSSA who is covered by the CSRS. Kern was one of the employees who signed the August 15, 1989, memorandum requesting that the DSSA position be considered for LEO retirement credit. At that time, however, Kern had already become a Supervisory DSSA, and the memorandum did not request that the Supervisory DSSA position be considered for LEO credit. Kern argued that the August 15, 1989, memorandum was sufficient to put the agency on notice that he wanted LEO credit for his Supervisory DSSA position, even though the memorandum referred only to the DSSA position. The Board, however, held that Kern had never encumbered the position that was the subject of the August 15, 1989, memorandum and that the memorandum therefore was not effective as a request for LEO credit for his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kern asks us to hold that the August 15, 1989, memorandum was sufficient to constitute a request for LEO credit on his behalf. He contends that the memorandum should not be construed as limited to DSSAs, but instead should be construed to extend to Supervisory DSSAs such as himself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It may well be that by adding his name to the list of those signing the August 15, 1989, memorandum Kern intended to seek LEO credit for <span id="Page_4299"></span>his own position and not merely to support the efforts of the DSSAs to obtain LEO credit for themselves. Nonetheless, the memorandum does not request consideration of LEO credit for any position but the DSSA position, and the ultimate OPM ruling in response to that request addressed only the DSSA position. The administrative judge was therefore correct to hold that the August 15, 1989, memorandum did not request LEO credit for any employee in Kern's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Kern contends that it was a grave injustice for the Board to dismiss his case on the procedural ground urged by the government, Kern does not suggest that the merits of his underlying claim to LEO credit differ in any material way from the claims raised by Bingaman or, in the FERS context, by the Arps petitioners. Those co-appellants, represented by the same counsel, lost on the merits of their claims. For the same reasons that applied in their cases, it seems inescapable that Kern would have lost on the merits of his claim even if the administrative judge had ruled in his favor on the procedural issue. Accordingly, this is not a case in which a procedural defect has been invoked to deprive an employee of benefits to which he otherwise would have been entitled. For that reason, even if we regarded the Board's procedural ruling in Kern's case as flawed, we would treat the error as harmless. We therefore uphold the Board's determination that Kern failed to satisfy the procedural prerequisite to review of the merits of his claim to LEO credit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> was reaffirmed by <span class="Italic">Watson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 262 F.3d 1292, 1295-1305 (Fed. Cir. 2001)) (Judge Friedman, dissenting in part) (aff'g, <span class="Italic">Watson v. Dept. of Navy,</span> 86 MSPR 318 (2000), <span class="Italic">supra</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">James A. Watson <span class="Italic">et al.</span> petition for review of the July 17, 2000 final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board"), sustaining the Department of the Navy's ("Navy" or "agency") determination that petitioners did not satisfy the statutory and regulatory criteria for early retirement coverage as law enforcement officers ("LEO") under the Civil Service Retirement System ("CSRS"), 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) (1994), or the Federal Employees' Retirement System ("FERS"), 5 U.S.C. 8412(d) (1994). <span class="Italic">Watson v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 318 (2000). The petitioners are thirteen current or former police officers employed by the Navy at the Norfolk Naval Base in Norfolk, Virginia. In upholding the Navy's denial of the officers' applications for LEO retirement credit, the Board employed a new approach that more affirmatively considered the reasons for the creation and existence of the positions than it had used in its prior LEO decisions, which emphasized the officers' actual, even if incidental or occasional, duties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 321. In this case, after reviewing the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") classification standards for the GS-083 Occupation Series to which the officers belonged, a December 1997 "Grade Evaluation Guide for Police and Security Guard Positions GS-0083/GS-0085" ("the Guide") published by OPM, the Position Description for the officers' positions, and the duties actually performed by the officers on a regular and recurring basis, the Board concluded that the officers' positions did not exist primarily for the purpose of investigating, apprehending, or detaining individuals suspected or convicted of federal offenses. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 328; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. 8331(20), 8401(17) (1994). We hold that the approach used by the Board is consistent with the statutes and regulations of the LEO retirement coverage program, and that it does not conflict with our decision in <span class="Italic">Bingaman v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 127 F.3d 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1997), or with its own decision in the same case. We also hold that under this approach, the Board's determination that these Norfolk Naval Base police officers did not satisfy the definition of a LEO was free of legal error and supported by at least substantial evidence. Therefore, we affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Background</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress established a special retirement system in order for federal employees in certain positions to retire at an unusually early age. Either of two statutes governs entitlement to such special retirement coverage. Under both the CSRS and FERS, an employee who qualifies for LEO retirement credit is eligible to retire upon attaining the age of 50 and after completing 20 years of eligible LEO service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 8336(c), 8412(d)(2). Additionally, under the FERS, a LEO can retire at any age after completing 25 years of service. 5 U.S.C. 8412(d)(1). This is far earlier than the age at which most civil service employees are eligible to retire, and is based on shorter service. 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) (1994). An employee qualifying for LEO retirement receives a larger annuity than ordinary civil service employees, but is subject to larger salary deductions during his or her employment. A LEO may also be subject to mandatory early retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 8335, 8425 (1994). An employee can qualify for LEO retirement credit either by serving in a position that has been approved as such, or by applying for LEO credit and satisfying the employing agency that he or she is entitled to LEO retirement credit because his or her actual duties primarily involve pursuing or detaining criminals. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. 831.903-.906, 831.910(a), 842.803-804, 842.807(a) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRS and the FERS prescribe somewhat different standards for determining whether an employee may be eligible for LEO retirement credit. In order to be eligible under the CSRS, the duties of the employee's position must be "primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of [federal] offenses." 5 U.S.C. 8331(20), 8401(17)(A)(ii). The standard for LEO eligibility under the FERS adds the further requirement that the duties of the position be "sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities are required to be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals." 5 U.S.C. 8401(17).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All petitioners, with the exception of Mr. Rowland, were assigned to the patrol division; Mr. Rowland was assigned to the traffic division. The parties had stipulated that the officers were authorized to carry firearms, had arrest authority, were required to maintain a level of physical fitness by passing an annual physical fitness test if hired after March 1991, had interrogated witnesses and suspects, and had given <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warnings, and in the case of military suspects, warnings under Article 31 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Navy denied the officers LEO early retirement credit. The officers filed two separate appeals to the Board, since two of the officers were covered under the CSRS, and the remaining eleven officers were covered under the FERS. On July 12-16, and August 2-3, 1999, the Administrative Judge ("AJ") conducted a consolidated hearing. In initial decisions dated September 3 and 17, 1999, the AJ reversed the final decision of the Navy, and held that the officers were entitled to LEO retirement credit. <span class="Italic">See Watson v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> DC-0842-99-0483-I-1 (Sept. 3, 1999) (discussing FERS); <span class="Italic">Jefferson v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> DC-0831-99-0482-I-1 (Sept. 17, 1999) (discussing CSRS). The full Board consolidated the Watson and Jefferson appeals, and granted the agency's petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 17, 2000, the Board reversed the AJ's initial decisions, and held that the officers were not entitled to LEO retirement credit. The Board noted that in its prior cases, it had placed too much emphasis on the duties performed by a particular applicant over a limited period of time, with too little emphasis on the purpose of the applicant's position. <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. at 320-21. Using that approach, the Board previously held that Norfolk Naval Base police officers in the same series as petitioners here (the 083 series) were entitled to LEO retirement credit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Bremby v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 450 (1999); <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Dep't of Defense,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 409 (2000)).[1] In order to be more faithful to the language of the statutes and the regulations, the Board expressly adopted a new "position-oriented approach" that would "more affirmatively" assess the "basic reasons for the existence of the position," as required by OPM regulations, 5 C.F.R. 831.902, 842.802 (1994).[2] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 321. Under this new approach, the Board stated that "if the position was not created for the purpose of investigation, apprehension, or detention, then the incumbents of the position would not be entitled to LEO credit." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In determining the reasons for the existence of the position, the Board considered all available evidence, including OPM classification standards, the OPM Guide, the Position Description, and the duties actually performed by the officers on a near daily basis. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 328. After reviewing that evidence, the Board concluded that the petitioners' positions did not exist primarily for the purpose of investigating, apprehending, or detaining those suspected or convicted of federal offenses. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. Requirements for LEO Retirement Credit</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal police officers are only eligible for early retirement credit under the CSRS or FERS if they meet the statutory definition of a LEO. Both statutes define an LEO as one who holds a position, the "primary duties" of which involve the "investigation, apprehension, or detention" of those suspected or convicted of federal offenses. 5 U.S.C. 8331(20), 8401(17). By regulation, OPM has defined "primary duties" in a three-part test. "Primary duties" are those duties that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4300"></span>i.&#x2003;Are paramount in influence or weight, that is constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">ii.&#x2003;Occupy a substantial portion of the individual's working time over a typical work cycle; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">iii.&#x2003;Are assigned on a regular and recurring basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. 831.902, 842.802 (emphasis added). In general, if an employee spends at least fifty percent of his or her time performing certain duties, those duties are his or her primary duties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under the regulations, "[d]uties that are of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature cannot be considered 'primary' even if they meet the substantial portion of time criterion." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, the regulations state that the definition of a LEO "does not include an employee whose primary duties involve maintaining order, protecting life and property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or investigating persons other than those who are suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). The police officers seeking LEO retirement coverage bear the burden of proving entitlement by preponderant evidence. 5 C.F.R. 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)] . Eligibility for LEO retirement coverage must be "strictly construed," because the LEO retirement program is "'more costly to the government than more traditional retirement plans and often results in the retirement of important people at a time when they would otherwise have continued to work for a number of years.'" <span class="Italic">Bingaman,</span> 127 F.3d at 1435 (quoting <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 773 F.2d 282, 286-87 (Fed. Cir. 1985)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;The Board's Approach</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners and <span class="Italic">amicus</span> argue that the approach used by the Board places too much reliance on the reason why the position was initially created. In its prior cases, petitioners note, the Board and this court in <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> had undertaken a fact-specific inquiry into the daily or frequent duties actually performed by the officer seeking LEO coverage, even if those duties were not listed in the Position Description as primary duties. Petitioners argue that the new "position-oriented" approach relies excessively on broad and unclear OPM classification standards and the Position Description in order to determine why the position was originally created many years ago, without sufficient examination of the regular duties actually performed by the particular employee. This approach, petitioners contend, is contrary to the plain language of the statutes creating the LEO retirement program, and conflicts with our decision in <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that the approach used by the Board is permissible, and is more faithful to the statutes and the regulations than its earlier approach. As noted by the Board in this case, the approach formerly used by the Board in cases such as <span class="Italic">Bremby</span> permitted an employee to be deemed eligible for LEO retirement credit so long as he or she could show that to some unspecified degree his or her primary duties "involve" the investigation, apprehension, or detention of those suspected or convicted of federal offenses, even if the employee's primary duties consist of non-LEO duties, such as maintaining law and order or protecting life and property. The <span class="Italic">Bremby</span> approach, the government argues, ignored the first criterion of 5 C.F.R. 831.902, 842.802, which defined the term "primary duties" to require an assessment of the "basic reasons for the existence of the position." 5 C.F.R. 831.902, 842.802.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;Consistency with Statutes and Regulations</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that the approach used by the Board in this case is indeed consistent with the statutory and regulatory criteria for LEO retirement credit. The express language of the regulations promulgated under the CSRS and FERS statutes provides support for considering the reason for the position's "existence" as part of the LEO-eligibility analysis. A LEO is defined in both the CSRS and the FERS statutes as one "the duties of whose position" are "primarily" the "investigation, apprehension, or detention" of those suspected or convicted of federal offenses. 5 U.S.C. 8331(20), 8401(17) (emphasis added). Thus, under the statutes, an employee may only receive LEO retirement credit if the position he or she occupies primarily involves certain specified duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Board's approach is consistent with OPM regulations. The inclusion of the conjunctive "and" in sections 831.902 and 842.802 clearly indicates that all three criteria must be demonstrated in order for a position to be LEO-eligible. The 6-factor <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> test only considered prongs (ii) and (iii) to determine whether the officers' duties occupied a "substantial portion" of their working time (prong (ii)), and were assigned on a "regular and recurring basis (prong (iii))."[3] The approach used by the Board here affirmatively involves consideration of prong (i) of sections 831.902 and 842.802 so as to ensure that in addition to consisting of duties that occupy a substantial portion, if not 50 percent or more, of the officer's working time and that occurred on a regular and recurring basis, the position exists currently as a LEO position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Under the six <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> factors, an LEO "commonly 1) has frequent direct contact with criminal suspects; 2) is authorized to carry a firearm; 3) interrogates witnesses and suspects, giving Miranda warnings when appropriate; 4) works for long periods without a break; 5) is on call 24 hours a day; and 6) is required to maintain a level of physical fitness." <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span>, 127 F.3d at 1436 (citing <span class="Italic">Hobbs v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. 628 (1993)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Placing emphasis on why the position exists is also consistent with the legislative intent in providing for the LEO retirement program: to limit LEO-eligibility to rigorous positions that retirement at an unusually early age is appropriate. A Senate Report stated that LEO positions should be "composed, insofar as possible of young men and women physically capable of meeting the vigorous demands of occupations which are far more taxing physically than most in the federal service." S. Rep. No. 93-948, at 2 (1974), reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3698, 3699. Accordingly, Congress established maximum retirement ages for LEO employees such as FBI Special Agents and for employees serving in other positions which are statutorily entitled to LEO retirement coverage. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 8335, 8425. LEO employees, for instance, are often required to retire no later than between 55 and 57 years of age, or when they have accrued twenty years of creditable service if they are beyond those ages when they completed the twenty years. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Congress further has authorized an agency head to determine and fix minimum and maximum limits of age within which an original appointment may be made to a LEO position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 3307(e) (1994). For instance, all Department of Justice LEO positions have a maximum entry age of 37, which may be waived for applicants up to 40 years of age. In assessing why the position exists, factors such as an early mandatory retirement age and a maximum entry age should be considered in determining whether the "basic reasons for the existence of the position" consists of duties that will make the employee LEO-eligible. Examination of such factors will be quite probative in determining whether the position really exists as a LEO position, that is, its job description and actual duties consist of tasks that only a young and physically fit individual could perform.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent concludes that the Board improperly "treated the purpose of the 'existence' of the position...as turning on the basic reasons for the position's 'creation.'"[4] Although in several places, including the concluding paragraph, the Board's opinion misstates the law as requiring that the position be "created" primarily for the performance of LEO duties, the Board's examination of the duties actually performed by the officers demonstrates that it knew it had to determine the reasons why the position existed at the time of application for LEO credit, not merely when it was originally created. As noted by the dissent, early in its opinion, the Board stated that under its new, position-oriented approach, "if the position was not created for the purpose of investigation, apprehension, or detention, then the incumbents of the position would not be entitled to LEO credit." <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. at 321. Significantly, however, the Board did not stop there. It went on to state in the very next sentence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This is not to say that the Board will not consider evidence of what duties the appellants performed from day-to-day in the GS-083 Police Officer position. Rather, the Board will consider that evidence, along with all of the other evidence of record, to ascertain whether the appellant is entitled to LEO retirement coverage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The dissent believes that the Board looked exclusively at why the position was created. The dissent states, "the reasons for the existence of the position cannot be based solely upon the historical reasons for the creation." This premise is crucial to the dissent's conclusion that the Board applied the wrong legal standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. This statement indicates that the Board knew that even if the official documentation of the position's creation did not support an applicant's LEO eligibility, the Board still needed to inquire into the applicant's actual duties as alleged. Moreover, in describing why it was departing from the Bremby approach, the Board specifically noted that its new approach would "more affirmatively take into account the basic reasons for the existence of the position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's approach included consideration of both the position documentation and actual duties. First, the Board determined the purpose for the creation of the officers' position in the GS-083 series. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This is an altogether logical and proper place to begin. In doing so, it considered the OPM Classification Standards, the OPM Guide, and the Position Description. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 323-26. It found that, as created, the position was not LEO-eligible. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 326. The Board next determined whether the purpose for the position changed, i.e., whether the purpose for the position's existence was different than the purpose for its creation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 321. In doing so, it considered--in equivalent detail and at an equivalent length of its treatment of position documents--the testimony regarding the officers' actual, day-to-day duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> It found that the basic reasons for the position's existence were not different from those for its creation, and thus, that the officers were not LEO-eligible. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 328. This second step was also proper and necessary, as the Board clearly understood. In concluding its analysis, the Board stated: "While an incumbent's actual duties are relevant...the evidence of the actual duties performed in these <span id="Page_4301"></span>cases does not persuade us that--contrary to the official documentation of the position--'the basic reasons for the existence of the position' was [sic] actually investigation, apprehension, or detention." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the Board believed that eligibility for LEO retirement credit is determined solely by the reasons for the position's creation, it would not need to consider, much less devote equivalent treatment to, the testimony regarding the officers' day-to-day duties. Nor did it consider actual duties only as an alternative ground for decision. Indeed, the Board specifically noted that its new position-oriented approach did not foreclose other officers in the GS-083 series from showing that the basic reasons for the existence of their positions had shifted from peace-keeping to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of criminals or suspects. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 330 n.7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that footnote 7 of the Board's opinion, like the concluding paragraph, incorrectly states the law as requiring that applicants "must show that the position was created as an LEO-position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, the portion of the Board's opinion explaining its analysis reflects that it correctly understood that the reasons for the position's existence, not merely its creation, are determinative. Such reasons could be shown by proof that the duties an employee performs day-to-day differ from those of the OPM classification standards, the OPM Guide, or the Position Description. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 321; <span class="Italic">see also Ellis v. United States,</span> 610 F.2d 760 (Ct. Cl. 1979) (finding that the duties actually performed by the officer were not properly set forth in their position description, and thus granting a retirement annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8331(21)). By providing this alternative way to show entitlement to LEO credit, the Board necessarily concluded that the reasons for the existence of the position can be established not only by the position papers but also by actual duties performed. Thus, contrary to the dissent's suggestion, we conclude that the Board applied the correct legal standard. The Board's analysis properly included the reasons for the position's existence, and not merely its creation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;Consistency with <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's approach is also wholly consistent with the approach taken by this court in <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span>. Petitioners seem to read <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> to require a rigid, bright-line test based on the six factors of the Board's decision. Petitioners also argue that other factors--such as whether the officers' duties are commensurate with Norfolk City police officers--should be considered as well. This court, however, has never adopted the Bingaman factors; nor has the court held that federal employees are always entitled to LEO coverage so long as they satisfy the Bingaman factors. Indeed, as noted in <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> and <span class="Italic">Hannon v. Department of Justice,</span> 234 F.3d 674 (Fed. Cir. 2000), the <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> factors were developed by the Board, not by this court as "captur[ing] the essence of what Congress intended." <span class="Italic">Bingaman,</span> 127 F.3d at 1436; <span class="Italic">Hannon,</span> 234 F.3d at 677-78 (noting that in Bingaman, this court "merely recognized and applied the [<span class="Italic">Bingaman</span>] factors," factors which had been "developed" by "the Board, not this court"). In examining the duties performed by these petitioners, the Bingaman court only addressed prongs (ii) and (iii) of 5 C.F.R. 831.902, 842.802. <span class="Italic">Bingaman,</span> 127 F.3d at 1436 ("Applying [the Bingaman factors], the [AJ] properly found that <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> failed to establish that he is eligible for LEO retirement credit."). The court did not need to consider prong (i) of the test--examining the "basic reasons for the existence of the position--because the court found that the petitioners had failed to meet their burden of proof regarding the second and third prongs of 5 C.F.R. 831.902, 842.802.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, some of the most probative factors are not even a part of the six-factor <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> test. <span class="Italic">Hannon,</span> 234 F.3d at 678. For instance, in Hannon, this court held that the Board should consider hazard as a probative factor in assessing LEO retirement coverage. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 679 ("The Board has recognized...that hazard is a significant element of law enforcement work."). Moreover, in light of evident legislative intent to grant LEO credit only to those who have jobs requiring physically demanding work, other factors, such as whether the officer must retire at an early age or whether there is an early maximum entry age, would also be highly probative in determining whether the officer is entitled to LEO retirement credit. Indeed, while all of the Bingaman factors may always be considered, some are more probative than others. For example, whether the job requires an annual physical fitness test may be probative in assessing whether the position is designed to be limited to young and physically fit individuals who would be forced to retire at an unusually early age, depending on the stringency of the test. Other <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> factors, however, are normally less probative because they do not always distinguish between officers who do LEO work and those who do not. For example, guards mainly protecting life and property and police officers whose jobs primarily involve pursuing or detaining criminals all might carry a firearm, be on call 24 hours a day, or have to work long periods without taking a break. The regulations, however, specifically exclude guards who mainly protect life and property from LEO retirement coverage. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. 831.902, 842.802. Other factors, proposed by petitioners, have little relevance. For instance, that petitioners' positions are equivalent to those of Norfolk City police officers has little probative value because not all Norfolk City police officers would be entitled to LEO credit if they were federal employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Determining LEO Eligibility for these Norfolk Naval Base Police Officers</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board held that petitioners' applications for LEO retirement credit were properly denied, because the relevant evidence of record (including OPM classification standards, the OPM Guide, the Position Description, and the testimony detailing the officers' daily or frequent duties) did not show that the GS-083 police officer position was "created for the basic reason" of conducting LEO activities.5 <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. at 328-29. The Board's review of the "primary duties" of the officers as detailed in official documentation and in their testimony before the AJ, and the fact that the officers' positions were neither limited by an early mandatory retirement age nor a youthful maximum entry age all support the Board's conclusion that these Norfolk Naval Base police officers are not entitled to LEO retirement credit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to determine that an officer is entitled to LEO retirement credit, the officer must show that the primary duties of his or her position, as defined by 5 C.F.R. 831.902, 842.802, are the investigation, apprehension, and detention of criminals or suspects. The most probative factors, we hold, are: 1) whether the officers are merely guarding life and property or whether the officers are instead more frequently pursuing or detaining criminals; 2) whether there is an early mandatory retirement age; 3) whether there is a youthful maximum entry age; 4) whether the job is physically demanding so as to require a youthful workforce; and 5) whether the officer is exposed to hazard or danger. The six <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> factors may also be considered as necessary and appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Evaluation of those factors in this case supports the Board's conclusion that the petitioners' positions as Norfolk Naval Base police officers did not exist primarily for the purpose of investigating, apprehending, or detaining criminals or suspects. Individuals applying for a position as a Norfolk Naval Base police officer, unlike LEO appointments in many other departments, are not required to retire at an early age; nor are officers required to satisfy certain maximum entry age requirements. An officer could conceivably enter the Norfolk Naval Base police force at age 50, and retire at age 70. This hardly seems to be consistent with awarding LEO retirement credit only for those positions which are so physically taxing as to warrant retirement after 20 years of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The official documentation of the officers' position provides further support that the position was not designed to be LEO-eligible. The OPM classification standards for GS-083 officers supports the Board's conclusion that the Norfolk Naval Base police officers do not satisfy the definition of an LEO. The standards state that the "primary mission and purpose of police organizations is to enforce law, maintain law and order, preserve the peace, and protect the life and civil rights of persons." OPM Classification Standards for the GS-083 Occupation Series, Occupational Information at 2-4. The OPM classification standards also state that "[m]ost police officers are engaged in patrol duties and/or traffic control." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Those duties are specifically designated by the OPM regulations to be non-LEO duties. 5 C.F.R. 831.902, 842.802. The OPM Guide reiterates the point made by the OPM Classification Standards that "[t]he primary mission of police officers in the Federal service is to maintain law and order." Although noting that the "distinction between police and guard work may not be an easy one to make," the Guide differentiates between police officers who are eligible for LEO credit and guards who are not. For instance, the Guide notes that Criminal Investigators in the GS-1811 series are eligible for LEO credit because the series consists of "[p]ositions primarily responsible for investigating alleged or suspected major offenses or violations of specialized laws of the United States." As noted by the Board, "[t]his clarification sets forth OPM's view that, unlike positions in the GS-1811 series, the primary duties of positions in the GS-083 Police Officer series are not the investigation or apprehension of persons suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States." <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. at 325 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Position Description also supports the Board's conclusion that these Norfolk Naval Base police officers are not entitled to LEO retirement coverage. The introduction to the Position Description states that the police officers "provide[&#8197;] community policing, law enforcement, and security for the investigation of crimes, [and] protection of life and property." The section of the Position Description entitled "Major Duties and Responsibilities" states that "[t]he incumbent serves as a Police Officer assigned to a community policing area." It then states, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the "position requires an incumbent to perform duties that involve the investigation, arrest, apprehension or detention of criminals and/or suspected criminals" (emphasis added); significantly, however, the Position Description does not state that the duties are primarily the investigation, apprehension or detention of criminals and/or suspected criminals. Other major duties listed in the Position Description include: 1) providing police escorts and directing traffic; 2) serving warrants and issuing summons; 3) making arrests; 4) testifying in court; 5) reporting unsafe conditions existing in the streets and/or public facilities; 6) responding to emergency situations; and 7) conducting preliminary <span id="Page_4302"></span>investigations, such as by interviewing witnesses or collecting and preserving evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also properly concluded that the testimony of the officers describing their daily or frequent duties did not show that the officers were entitled to LEO retirement coverage. While the officers testified to some instances involving great danger, the Board concluded that the testimony as a whole showed that the police officers' duties mostly involved being "on the lookout for potential violations of law, conduct[ing] generalized patrols, guard[ing] the gates, check[ing] buildings at night to ensure that they were secure, enforc[ing] traffic laws, and act[ing] as 'first responders' to emergencies or potential crimes." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 328. The Board also considered conflicting evidence as to whether at least 50 percent of the officers' duties consisted of LEO-type work. The Board opinion credited the testimony of Police Commander Hemmingsen, who reviewed the Incident Complaint Reports to determine whether the officers performed LEO duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 326. Commander Hemmingsen also testified before the AJ that the Norfolk Naval Base police officers did not perform LEO-type work at least 50 percent of the time, as required by sections 831.902 and 842.802. This contradicted the testimony of petitioners' witnesses who testified that their duties were over 50 percent. Substantial evidence thus supports the Board's conclusion that the officers' primary duties were not LEO duties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 328-29.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the official documentation of the GS-083 series indicates that all officers in that series in all departments of the federal government are presumptively not entitled to LEO credit. Thus, officers in that series would only be eligible for LEO credit if they could persuade the agency or Board that "contrary to the official documentation of the position," the duties actually performed by the officers on a regular and recurring basis clearly indicate that the "basic reasons for the existence of the position" was the investigation, apprehension, or detention of criminals or suspects.<span class="Italic"> Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under a legally correct construction of the statutes and regulations, a federal police officer seeking LEO early retirement credit must prove that he or she occupied a position that primarily required the investigation, apprehension, or detention of criminals or suspects, rather than merely the protection of life or property, and that their duties were so physically demanding as to necessitate his or her retirement at an unusually early age. The Board held that these Norfolk Naval Base police officers have not proven that their primary duties nor those of their position involved the investigation, apprehension, or detention of criminals or suspects. The Board's finding is supported by substantial evidence. Further, the Board's method of analysis was consistent with the statutes, the regulations, and the case law. Therefore, the Board's decision is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Watson</span> was followed, <span class="Italic">Lowder v. DHS</span>, 504 F.3d 1378, 1380-83 (Fed. Cir. 2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question is whether the appellant James A. Lowder's service with the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division ("Uniformed Division") qualifies as "law enforcement officer" service. If so, he would be entitled to the higher retirement benefits that such officers receive. The Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board") determined, however, that Mr. Lowder's service did not so qualify, and we affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal "law enforcement officers" may receive more favorable retirement benefits than most federal employees. They may retire earlier, at age 50, after 25 years of such service, rather than at age 55 and after 30 years of service. They also receive a higher annuity. In return for these benefits, they are required to contribute a slightly higher portion of their pay toward those benefits. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8334(c), 8336(a), 8336(c)(1), 8412(a), 8412(d), 8422(a)(2) (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Law enforcement officer" positions may be either "primary" or "secondary." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.902, 842.802. Primary positions are those where the employee directly performs law enforcement officer duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Secondary positions are generally supervisory or administrative law enforcement positions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> To qualify for law enforcement officer retirement, an employee must have a specified period of primary service. He may combine that service with secondary service to attain law enforcement officer status by transferring directly from a primary to a secondary service position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.904(a), 842.803(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Lowder worked in the Uniformed Division from 1970 until September 1978, when he voluntarily transferred to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center ("Training Center"). While at the Division, he was assigned to both the White House and the Foreign Mission Division. At the White House, his regular duties involved protecting the President of the United States, his family and the White House grounds. At the Foreign Mission Division, he patrolled areas of Washington, DC, functioning, in essence, as a regular Washington, DC police officer. Members of the Uniformed Division are authorized to make arrests and are required to carry a firearm. The maximum entry age for the Division was 28, and retirement was mandatory at age 59. Employees of the Division were required to have an annual physical examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of Lowder's service with the Uniformed Division, the Division members' retirement benefits were provided under the District of Columbia Police and Firefighters' Retirement System ("District of Columbia System"). That system had superior benefits to the Civil Service Retirement System. When Lowder transferred to the Training Center in 1978, however, he became subject to the Civil Service Retirement System ("Civil Service System") and received retroactive service credit under that system for his service with the Uniformed Division.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government recognizes that Lowder's work at the Training Center constituted secondary law enforcement officer service. Whether Lowder qualifies for law enforcement officer retirement benefits thus depends on whether his Uniformed Division service was primary law enforcement officer service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2004, the Treasury Department (of which the Secret Service was a part), overruling a prior determination, ruled that Lowder's service with the Uniformed Division did not constitute "law enforcement officer" service and that he, therefore, did not qualify for law enforcement officer retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lowder appealed that ruling to the Board, which affirmed. In his initial decision, which became final when the Board denied review of it, the Board's administrative judge found that Lowder's "duties as an officer with the [Uniformed Division] largely involved the protection of life and property, with particular focus on the president and his family, and included patrolling, enforcing traffic laws, acting as a first responder with regard to public disturbances or other incidents, and conducting preliminary investigations." The administrative judge held that Lowder's service in the Uniformed Division "was not in a position which existed for the purpose of investigating, apprehending, or detaining individuals suspected or convicted of violating the criminal laws of the United States" and, therefore, did not constitute law enforcement officer service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The governing statute defines a "law enforcement officer" as "an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(20), 8401(17). An OPM implementing regulation states that "law enforcement officer" "does not include an employee whose primary duties involve maintaining order, protecting life and property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or investigating persons other than those who are suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902. Under the Federal Employees' Retirement System, one of two federal retirement systems (the other being the Civil Service Retirement System, see Part III, below), to qualify as a "law enforcement officer" the duties of the position must be "sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities are required to be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether a particular employee is a "law enforcement officer," we use a "position-oriented approach" that emphasizes "the official documentation of the position" in evaluating whether "the `basic reasons for the existence of the position' was the investigation, apprehension, or detention of criminals or suspects." <span class="Italic">Watson v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, <span class="blue">262 F.3d 1292</span>, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Thus, "a federal police officer seeking [law enforcement officer] credit must prove that he or she occupied a position that primarily required the investigation, apprehension, or detention of criminals or suspects, rather than merely the protection of life or property...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these standards, we have no basis for rejecting the Board's conclusion that, while employed in the Uniformed Division, Lowder was not a "law enforcement officer." The Board determined that Lowder's duties there "largely involved the protection of life and property, with particular focus on the president and his family, and included patrolling, enforcing traffic laws, acting as a first responder with regard to public disturbances or other incidents, and conducting preliminary investigations." Based on this finding, the Board justifiably concluded that Lowder's service was not in a "position which existed for the purpose of investigating, apprehending, or detaining individuals suspected or convicted of violating the criminal laws of the United States."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record supports those findings. Lowder testified that when assigned to the White House his "primary duty was protecting the President of the United States, his family, and the grounds," and that when he was assigned to the Foreign Missions Division, his "primary duty was walking on foot patrol or driving a scout car and enforcing laws in Washington, DC." These are not the duties that, under the statutory definition, the OPM regulations and our decisions, qualify an employee for "law enforcement officer" status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The classification of Lowder's position with the Uniformed Division further supports the Board's decision. During the time he so served, his position was classified under the federal government's general classification system in the 083 Police Series. OPM's classification guide describes the "primary duties" of those positions as "the performance or supervision of law enforcement work in the preservation of peace; <span id="Page_4303"></span>the prevention, detection, and investigation of crimes; the arrest or apprehension of violators; and the provision of assistance to citizens in emergency situations, including the protection of civil rights." Grade Evaluation Guide for Police and Security Guard Positions in Series, GS-0083/GS-0085 at 2, April 1988. The Guide further explains that "[t]he primary mission of police officers in the Federal service is to maintain law and order. In carrying out this mission, police officers protect life, property, and the civil rights of individuals." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> we stated that "the official documentation of the GS-083 series indicates that all officers in that series in all departments of the federal government are presumptively not entitled to [law enforcement officer] credit. Thus, officers in that series would only be eligible for such credit if they could persuade the agency or Board that `contrary to the official documentation of the position,' the duties actually performed by the officers on a regular and recurring basis clearly indicate that the `basic reasons for the existence of the position' was the investigation, apprehension, or detention of criminal suspects." <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16339994865102084948&q=">262 F.3d at 1304</a>. Lowder has not so shown.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board stated, the "classic police functions" as described in the Classification Guide, "dedicated to `maintaining order, protecting life and property, and guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, while unquestionably critical to the functioning of civil society itself, and involving both the exercise of sensitive judgment, and potential exposure to diverse personal hazards, are nonetheless specifically excluded from the legal definition of [law enforcement officer] under the CSRS regulations.'"</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Watson</span> and <span class="Italic">Bingham</span> were not mentioned in <span class="Italic">Klipp v. DHS</span>, 34 F.4th 1326, 1329-30, 1331-33 (Fed.

United States</span>, 398 F.3d 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Klipp explained, as the court remanded the appeal to the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Employees' Retirement System Act provides early retirement benefits to federal LEOs. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412(d). LEOs are eligible to receive early retirement benefits after completing either 25 years of service as a law enforcement officer or 20 years of service after reaching 50 years of age ("LEO credit"). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. An employee requesting credit for past service "must submit a request for a determination" to the employing agency. Off. of Pers.

If credit is denied, the employee may seek review at the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.807(a). LEO credit may be awarded for time served in either a primary or secondary law enforcement position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Primary law enforcement positions earning credit are those in which an employee's duties are primarily "the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, or [ ] the protection of officials of the United States against threats to personal safety," and the duties are "sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A)(i), (ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Credit may also be awarded for time served in a secondary, "supervisory or administrative position" if an employee is "transferred directly" to that position after serving in a primary position "for at least three years." &#x00A7; 8401(17)(C); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.803(b). A direct transfer from a primary to a secondary role is one that occurs "without a break in service exceeding 3 days." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.803(b)(1)(I).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Klipp does not contend that the official position description (AFSD-LE) entitles him to primary LEO credit. Instead, he argues that LEO credit can be awarded if the applicant's actual duties were primarily LEO duties, even if the position description denotes a secondary position....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations under the statute describe what is required to establish the right to primary LEO credit. To show that Mr. Klipp is entitled to primary LEO credit for the relevant period, he had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(2)(ii), that he occupied a "rigorous position whose primary duties [were] the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, or the protection of officials of the United States against threats to personal safety," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. Employees "whose primary duties involve maintaining order, protecting life and property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or investigating persons other than those who are suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States" are not entitled to primary LEO credit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Primary duties are those that: "(a) [a]re paramount in influence or weight; that is, constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position; (b) [o]ccupy a substantial portion of the individual's working time over a typical work cycle; and (c) [a]re assigned on a regular and recurring basis." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "In general, if an employee spends an average of at least 50 percent of his or her time performing a duty or group of duties, they are his or her primary duties."[1] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The regulations also require that the position be "so rigorous that employment opportunities should, as soon as reasonably possible, be limited (through establishment of a maximum entry age and physical qualifications) to young and physically vigorous individuals." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;"[E]mergency, incidental, or temporary" duties, "even if they meet the substantial portion of time criterion," "cannot be considered 'primary.'" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This entitlement inquiry requires consideration of both the position description and the employee's actual duties. In the first instance, the Board must base its determination on the "official documentation of the position" promulgated by the government. <span class="Italic">Crowley</span>, 398 F.3d at 1340. If the position "fails to qualify for LEO status" based on those official description documents, the Board "must afford the employee the opportunity to show that" the actual duties of their position are sufficient to establish LEO status, given that "agencies will not always keep job descriptions current to match the actual activities of the individuals who occupy described positions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Mr. Klipp's request for LEO credit is based solely on the actual duties of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Crowley</span>, we held that "two major factors [ ] should be considered in determining whether a position should be conferred LEO status" based on its actual duties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1339. These two factors are "physical vigorousness" and "hazardousness." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "Physical vigorousness," the first and most important factor, is assessed by evaluating (in order of importance): whether the position has "(1) strenuous physical fitness requirements; (2) age requirements (such as a mandatory retirement age or a maximum entry age); [and] (3) a requirement that an employee be on call twenty-four hours a day." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the court concludes that the position is sufficiently vigorous, "then the second major factor necessary to establish LEO status--hazardousness--must be considered." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A finding that a position is hazardous depends on whether it (again, in order of importance): (1) "requires frequent and consistent contact with criminal suspects on the part of the employee (including interrogation of suspects and pursuit or detention of criminals)"; and (2) "authorizes the employee to carry a firearm." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, it is undisputed that Mr. Klipp was authorized to carry a firearm, so the focus is on the first hazardousness factor. In this respect, the record must show that "fifty percent or more of [the employee's] actual duties" involved "frequent and consistent contact with criminal suspects." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1339-40.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the record here would support a finding that Mr. Klipp does not qualify for primary LEO credit, the "agenc[y] ha[d] a duty to provide" the court "with a sufficient explanation for [its] decision[ ] so that [the] decision[ ] may be judged against the relevant statutory standards." <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 50 F.3d 990, 992 (Fed. Cir. 1995). We agree with Mr. Klipp that the Board's decision failed to adequately address his actual duties in a way that would enable court of appeals review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the Board failed to separately discuss the question of vigorousness in addition to assessing hazardousness, as was required under <span class="Italic">Crowley</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second error in the Board's decision lies in its reliance on position descriptions as evidence of Mr. Klipp's actual duties for purposes of addressing hazardousness and its failure to separately address his actual duties. After correctly identifying the need to review Mr. Klipp's "actual duties...to determine whether he is entitled to LEO retirement credit in a [primary] position," the Board continued to consider evidence of both the position description and actual duties in a single step, and it reached its final conclusion--that Mr. Klipp failed to "establish[ ] by preponderant evidence [that] <span class="Italic">his position was created for</span> the purpose of the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, or the protection of officials of the United States against threats to personal safety"--"<span class="Italic">[b]ased on all the evidence</span>."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But our precedent is clear that the Board must make two independent findings: the first must be based on the position description evidence alone, and if that finding is adverse to the employee, the second must be based solely on evidence of his or her actual duties. Concluding that Mr. Klipp failed to establish that "his position <span class="Italic">was created</span>" for a primary law enforcement purpose did not address whether, in light of his actual duties, he established that fifty percent or more of those duties were primary LEO duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, in assessing hazardousness, the Board made seemingly contradictory findings as to Mr. Klipp's actual duties. The Board's decision explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Even if the appellant frequently and regularly performed the duties of a primary covered position, these situations were of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature. Such situations, even if the appellant spent a substantial portion of time on such duties, <span id="Page_4304"></span>cannot be the basis for primary coverage, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is contradictory to conclude that Mr. Klipp's primary LEO duties were merely "emergency, incidental, or temporary" while also concluding that he "frequently and regularly performed the duties of a primary covered position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Moreover, the Board observed that one of Mr. Klipp's coworkers, who began working with him in August 2008, testified that Mr. Klipp "spent at least 50 percent of his time pursuing criminal investigations." And under our precedent, if those regularly performed primary duties constituted fifty percent or more of Mr. Klipp's actual duties, he would likely have satisfied the hazardousness test, since he was authorized to carry a firearm.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Crowley v. United States</span>, 398 F.3d 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2005), relied on in <span class="Italic">Klipp</span>, involved a Tucker Act suit for a pay adjustment under the Federal Law Enforcement Pay Reform Act of 1990, an adjustment that required a positive determination of LEO status. <span class="Italic">Crowley</span> discussed that status under the <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> and <span class="Italic">Watson</span> decisions, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, as they related to Claims Court authority to determine LEO status as a component of a FLEPRA claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Klipp, supra,</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">MacMullin v. DHS</span>, PH-0842-21-0140-I-2 (NP 12/6/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412(d), an employee covered under FERS may retire at age 50 after completing 20 years of LEO service, or at any age after completing 25 years of LEO service. For purposes of FERS retirement coverage, there are two types of LEO positions--rigorous and secondary. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.803(a)-(b). Apart from details and temporary promotions, all service in a rigorous LEO position is covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412(d). 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.803(a)(1)-(2). Service in a secondary LEO position is covered if the employee moves directly from a rigorous position to a secondary position, the employee has completed 3 years of service in a rigorous position, and the employee has been continuously employed in a secondary position without a break in service exceeding 3 days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.803(b). The issue in this appeal is whether the appellant met the conditions for coverage in a rigorous LEO position during her employment as a Supervisory Physical Security Specialist from January 8, 2006, through September 27, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee can qualify for LEO retirement credit in a rigorous position either by serving in a position that has been approved as such, or by applying for LEO credit and satisfying the employing agency that she is entitled to LEO retirement credit because her actual duties primarily involve pursuing or detaining criminals. <span class="Italic">Watson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 262 F.3d 1292, 1296 (2001); <span class="Italic">Bingaman v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 127 F.3d 1431, 1434 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.803(a), .804. To prove entitlement to service credit for the relevant period, the appellant must establish that she occupied a "rigorous position whose primary duties [were] the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, or the protection of officials of the United States against threats to personal safety." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. Employees "whose primary duties involve maintaining order, protecting life and property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or investigating persons other than those who are suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States" are not entitled to rigorous LEO credit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the pendency of the petition for review, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a precedential decision directly addressing the issues in this appeal. <span class="Italic">Klipp v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 34 F.4th 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2022). In particular, the court emphasized that "the Board must make two independent findings: the first must be based on the position description evidence alone, and if that finding is adverse to the employee, the second must be based solely on evidence of his or her actual duties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1333. In this case, the administrative judge did not make these two independent findings. Instead, she essentially weighed the appellant's position description against her day-to-day job duties, and concluded that the Supervisory Physical Security Specialist position was not created for the purpose of law enforcement. This analysis is not consistent with the court's holding in <span class="Italic">Klipp</span>. Nevertheless, because that the record is fully developed on the relevant issues, the Board will apply the two-part analysis on review. <span class="Italic">See Vitale v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 16 (2007) (addressing the jurisdictional issue for the first time on petition for review where the record on jurisdiction was fully developed).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the position description itself, we find that it does not denote that Supervisory Physical Security Specialist is a rigorous LEO position. The summary description of the position indicates that the incumbent is responsible "for the planning, operation and leadership of assigned security and enforcement activities," and "serves as primary advisor to the District Director regarding physical security, crime prevention and law enforcement operations for an assigned geographic area." It does not mention investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals or the protection of officials of the United States. The long list of "major duties" that follows covers duties associated with advising the Director, monitoring the effectiveness of personnel, conducting security assessments, acting as a liaison between the agency and various third parties, data collection and analysis, and work planning. The last category of "major duties" concerns "duties as a law enforcement official," performed "[o]n a recurring basis." The position description provides that the incumbent is authorized to carry a firearm and make arrests, but it goes on to say that this law enforcement work concerns the protection of life, property, and the rights of individual citizens, as well as enforcement of compliance with laws and regulations. This type of work does not qualify as LEO work under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. The position description ends by stating that the incumbent "arrests offenders and provides police assistance during emergency and/or life threatening situations," which does qualify as rigorous LEO work, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802, but in the context of the position description as a whole, such work does not appear to constitute a Supervisory Physical Security Specialist's primary duties. Furthermore, although the position description refers to "medical testing requirements," these requirements are not specified, and there are no provisions for maximum entry or minimum retirement ages. For these reasons, we find that the position description does not describe a LEO position as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17). Rather, we find that the position description is akin to the one at issue in <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, 262 F.3d at 1303-04, which the court found did not primarily consist of the investigation, apprehension or detention of criminals or suspected criminals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the second inquiry, we find that evidence of the appellant's actual job duties is sufficient to establish that her service as a Supervisory Physical Security Specialist was creditable as service in a rigorous LEO position. Physical vigorousness and hazardousness are the major factors to be considered in determining a Federal employee's LEO status based on actual duties. <span class="Italic">Klipp</span>, 34 F.4th at 1332; <span class="Italic">Crowley v. United States</span>, 398 F.3d 1329, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2005). "Physical vigorousness," is the first and predominate factor. <span class="Italic">Crowley</span>, 398 F.3d at 1339. "The relevant considerations in any vigorousness determination are whether or not the position brings with it (in order of importance): 1) strenuous physical fitness requirements; 2) age requirements (such as a mandatory retirement age or a maximum entry age); or 3) a requirement that an employee be on call twenty four hours a day." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As to the first subfactor, the record in this case shows that the appellant's position had strenuous physical fitness requirements. Prior to her appointment, the appellant was required to take and pass a demanding physical fitness examination that included a 1.5 mile run, agility, bench press, body composition, and flexibility requirements. Furthermore, during her entire tenure in this position, the appellant was required to participate quarterly in a rigorous defensive tactics course that included handcuffing and ground fighting, and she employed these skills frequently in the execution of her job duties. The agency also afforded the appellant 3 hours every week of on-duty "fitness time" during which she was encouraged to go to the gym and maintain her physical conditioning. Regarding the second subfactor, it is undisputed that there was no maximum entry or minimum retirement age for Supervisory Physical Security Specialists. Regarding the third subfactor, it is also undisputed that the appellant was on call 24 hours per day. Considering these three subfactors together and assigning them weight in accordance with their importance, we find that the physical vigorousness factor is satisfied. We therefore move on to the hazardousness factor. <span class="Italic">See Crowley</span>, 398 F.3d at 1339.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine hazardousness, the Board will "consider whether the position (in order of importance): requires frequent and consistent contact with criminal suspects on the part of the employee (including interrogation of suspects and pursuit or detention of criminals); or authorizes the employee to carry a firearm." <span class="Italic">Crowley</span>, 398 F.3d at 1339. The record in this appeal shows that both of these subfactors are satisfied. First, the appellant estimated that, during the 33 months that she served as a Supervisory Physical Security Specialist, she made on average 1 or 2 arrests per month, for a total of approximately 40 or 50 arrests. She also testified that, apart from individuals whom she actually arrested, she had contact with criminal suspects multiple times per week, and that this was a "constant" part of her job. The appellant's testimony in this regard is not in dispute. Nor is it disputed that the appellant was authorized to carry a firearm. In fact, firearms qualification was a part of the quarterly defensive tactics course discussed above. In any event, the administrative judge credited the appellant's testimony that she spent at least half of her working time, about 60%, pursuing criminal investigations. We therefore find that the appellant's job duties satisfy the hazardousness factor as well. <span class="Italic">See Klipp</span>, 34 F.4th at 1333 (explaining that, under Federal Circuit precedent, an individual who is authorized to carry a firearm and spends 50% or more of her time pursuing criminal investigations likely satisfies the hazardousness requirement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge acknowledged that the appellant regularly performed rigorous LEO duties during the course of her employment as a Supervisory Physical Security Specialist. However, she found that this was not a function of the appellant's position as set forth in the position description and was instead an unintended consequence attributable to <span id="Page_4305"></span>the unavailability of Special Agents to perform rigorous LEO work in her area. However, this situation, where the employee's actual experience of the job differs substantially from the official position description, is exactly what the two-part inquiry was meant to address. <span class="Italic">See Klipp</span>, 34 F. 4th at 1332; <span class="Italic">Crowley</span>, 398 F.3d at 1340. By considering evidence of the position description and the appellant's actual job duties together rather than separately, the administrative judge did not reach the central issue of whether, in the real world, the service that the appellant actually rendered as a Supervisory Physical Security Specialist consisted primarily of rigorous LEO duties. For the reasons explained above, in our application of the two-step analysis, we conclude that it did.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">MSPB considered LEO retirement status in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0842-15-0046-I-1 (NP 1/20/2016), involving a GS-9 Game Conservation Enforcement Officer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be eligible for LEO retirement credit under FERS, the employee's duties must be primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of Federal offenses and must be sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A)(i), (ii). An employee whose primary duties involve maintaining order, protecting life and property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or investigating persons other than those who are suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States are not considered law enforcement officers. "Primary duties" are those that are paramount in influence or weight; that is, constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position, occupy a substantial portion of the individual's working time over a typical work cycle, and are assigned on a regular and recurring basis. In general, if any employee spends an average of at least 50% of his time performing a duty or group of duties, they are his primary duties. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802; <span class="Italic">see Watson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 262 F.3d 1292, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (approving the Board's position-oriented approach to determining entitlement to LEO special retirement coverage).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that his duties are rigorous in that they include "a lot of walking" and apprehending violators who commit misdemeanors and felonies and that these duties involve more than 50% of his time. He also challenges the contrary testimony of his former second-line supervisor, arguing that he lacked firsthand knowledge of the appellant's duties. And, the appellant points to his own testimony that 65% of his duties are investigatory in nature because he is required to notice irregularities in the area, such as tracks in the dirt, and follow them to see if a crime is occurring, has occurred, or might occur.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In affirming the agency's decision to deny the appellant LEO retirement, the administrative judge considered both his position documentation and its actual duties. The administrative judge carefully examined the position description, which states that 60% of the incumbent's duties include: proactive patrol duties on Redstone Arsenal encompassing the enforcement of laws, the protection of life and property, and the management of resources and related practices and programs; citing offenders; monitoring and surveying the security of sites and reporting disturbances; checking the perimeter for unauthorized access and damage; conducting routine security checks; monitoring traffic movements; conducting compliance inspections; providing nuisance wildlife and predator control; and assisting in search and rescue efforts for unaccounted-for recreationists. These duties, which constitute the appellant's primary duties, are in the nature of maintaining law and order, protecting life and property, and guarding against and inspecting for violations of law, which are not those of an LEO officer. <span class="Italic">See Fagergren v. Department of the Interior</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 649, &#x00B6; 14 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 166 F. App'x 483 (Fed. Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Street v. Department of the Navy</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 652, &#x00B6; 17, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 53 F. App'x 90 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">and aff'd sub nom. Satterfield v. Department of the Navy</span>, 53 F. App'x 88 (Fed. Cir. 2002). They do not reflect that the position exists or is designated as an LEO position. <span class="Italic">Street</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 652, &#x00B6; 11. Nor does the position description include a maximum age for entry into the position, <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, 262 F.3d at 1302; <span class="Italic">Street</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 652, &#x00B6; 14, evidence highly probative of the fact that the position is not sufficiently rigorous so as to limit employment opportunities to young and physically rigorous individuals,[4] <span class="Italic">Street</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 652, &#x00B6; 31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;This is so notwithstanding the fact that, as a condition of employment, the incumbent must be able to pass physical and mental examinations prior to hiring, and undergo an annual physical examination to ensure fitness for duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge duly considered the appellant's hearing testimony regarding his view of his primary duties and his perception that 65% of his duties are investigative in nature. The administrative judge also considered the testimony of the appellant's former second-line supervisor to the effect that 30% of the appellant's duties involve the investigation of criminal offenses. The administrative judge found that, even if the appellant conducted four investigations over a 3-year period, as he described, and even if, in connection therewith, he apprehended suspects, he did not show that these investigations occupied a substantial portion of his working time over a typical work cycle on a regular or recurring basis, or that they otherwise constituted his primary duties. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown error in the administrative judge's findings that, while the appellant's position involves the investigation of suspected crimes, the primary duties of his position are not the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of violating the criminal laws, but rather maintaining order, protecting life and property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or investigating persons other than those who are suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. The administrative judge properly found, therefore, that the agency correctly determined that the appellant is not entitled to LEO special retirement coverage.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another decision, involving Federal Protective Officers, is <span class="Italic">Slater v. DHS</span>, SF-3443-15-0322-I-1 (NP 1/21/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To qualify for LEO retirement coverage under FERS, an employee must show that the duties of his position are primarily: "(I) the investigation, apprehension or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, or (II) the protection of officials of the United States against threats to their personal safety." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A)(i). In addition, the employee must show that the duties of the position are: "sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and vigorous individuals." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A)(ii). Thus, an employee seeking FERS LEO retirement credit must satisfy a two-prong test that the duties of his position are: (1) primarily those described under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A)(i)(I) or (II), and (2) so rigorous as to be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">Slater</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 378, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his 1998 appeal, the Board found that the appellant was not entitled to FERS LEO retirement credit because, regardless of whether his duties as a Federal Protective Service (FPS) Police Officer were so rigorous as to be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals, they were not primarily LEO in nature, i.e., duties covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A)(i)(I) or (II). <span class="Italic">Slater v. General Services Administration</span>, MSPB Docket No. SF-0842-98-0670-I-2, Initial Decision (Apr. 1, 1999), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied sub nom. Goldsmith v. General Services Administration</span>, MSPB Docket No. SF-0842-98-0650-I-2, Final Order (Nov. 5, 1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd, Slater v. General Services Administration</span>, 250 F.3d 762 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table). In his 2001 appeal, the Board again affirmed the agency's denial of FERS LEO retirement credit, finding that the appellant was collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of whether the duties of his FPS Police Officer position were primarily LEO in nature. <span class="Italic">Slater</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 378, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the prior Board decisions are no longer relevant because the duties of his FPS Police Officer position have since been changed as a result of the following statutes and directives: (1) the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004 (LEOSA), as amended by the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act Improvements Act of 2010; (2) the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA), specifically, the portion codified at 40 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1315; and (3) Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7), issued on December 17, 2003. However, the appellant has not shown that the duties of his position have been altered by these provisions. The LEOSA, as amended, includes a definition of the term "qualified law enforcement officer" for purposes of determining eligibility to carry a concealed firearm, <span class="Italic">see</span> 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 926B, but the definition applies only to that section, and does not pertain to the question of whether the appellant's duties are primarily duties covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A)(i)(I) or (II). As for the HSA, 40 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1315 provides the Secretary of Homeland Security with the authority to designate FPS employees as officers and agents to protect Federal property and persons on that property, but the appellant has not offered any evidence that his duties as an FPS Police Officer have been expanded pursuant to that authority. Similarly, the appellant has not shown that his primary duties were altered pursuant to HSPD-7, which set out a national policy for Federal departments and agencies to protect critical infrastructures and key resources from terrorist attacks. Because the appellant has failed to show that the duties of his FPS Police Officer position are now covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17), we affirm the agency's denial of LEO retirement credit.</p>
