<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-214"><span class="space">4.</span> Severity of Charged Misconduct</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The inference of causal connection drawn from protected activity close in time to adverse action may be rebutted by the serious nature of the charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">Ramirez-Toro v. USDA</span>, 19 MSPR 647 (1984) (Table); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lockridge v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 613, 624-25 (1996) (insubordinate conduct toward individuals who were not involved in the appellant's EEO complaints warranted discipline); <span class="Italic">Wynne v. Dept. of Army</span>, 46 MSPR 320, 326 (1990) (reprisal alleged for filing grievances) [discussed under "<a href="0100-2023-19-040.html#sec12-40">Supervisory Practices; Remarks</a>" in Chapter 12]. Analysis of the severity of the charged and sustained misconduct occurred in an appeal from removal of an SES employee, <span class="Italic">Cooney v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 240 (1988), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. In <span class="Italic">Berube v. GSA</span>, 30 MSPR 581 (1986), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded</span>, 820 F.2d 396 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">rev'g removal on remand</span>, 37 MSPR 448 (1988), one issue was whether the threat by the employee to speak to the press motivated his removal. The Board determined that this was not the motivating factor. The agency began to consider removal proceedings before the threat to seek press attention was made. In passing, the Board commented on the significance of the charges against the appellant in its first <span class="Italic">Berube</span> decision, 30 MSPR at 601-02:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We have previously held that an action should be reversed if we determine that protected activity "was the 'motivating factor' or 'real reason' for the agency action." <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. FTC</span>, 8 MSPB 599, 603, 9 MSPR 268, 274 (1981). Here, the sustained charges were exceptionally serious and involved conduct which had been engaged in over a substantial period of time [insubordination, interference in or failure to perform agency work]. The unsustained charge was minor and related to a single incident [the threat to seek out the press]. Moreover, given the nature of the sustained charges, the penalty imposed was reasonable. Therefore, the evidence preponderates in favor of a finding that the agency would have removed the appellant even if it had not considered Charge 2. As we noted in <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span>, a major purpose of a dual causation analysis is to insure "that an employee who may have engaged in protected activity is not thereby granted immunity from the ordinary consequences of misconduct...." In addition, the evidence did not establish that the unsustained charge was a substantial factor in the agency's removal decision.... [T]he record reveals that, even before Charge 2 was considered, the Administrator, who was the proposing and deciding official, had directed that a removal action be worked upon solely on the charges relating to "the disruptive manner in which [appellant] was conducting himself."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand from the Federal Circuit (the decision did not disturb the Board's analysis of the reprisal issue but discerned problems with the Board's analysis of the case), the Board reconsidered its earlier weighing of the evidence and came to the opposite conclusion--Berube should not have been removed. <span class="Italic">Berube v. GSA</span>, 37 MSPR 448, 455 (1988). The Board again engaged in extensive analysis of the severity (or lack of severity) of the sustained charges in comparison with the evidence of the improper motivation of the deciding official.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if an appellant was subjected to hostile treatment after the successful exercise of an appeal right, a subsequent removal was not a prohibited personnel practice if the agency had a legitimate basis for that action. <span class="Italic">Hawes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 14 MSPR 591, 595 (1983) (citing <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. FTC</span>, 9 MSPR 268 (1981)). Under <span class="Italic">Cooney v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 183, 185 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a claim of reprisal for filing grievances, appellant must show that she in fact filed grievances, that she was later treated in an adverse fashion by the agency, that the deciding official had actual or constructive knowledge that she engaged in the protected activity, and that there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Osokow v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 25 MSPR 319, 324 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, appellant has established that she filed numerous grievances against a particular supervisor, and that this very supervisor was both the proposing and deciding official in the removal action against her. Thus, appellant has met the first three elements discussed above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, however, has failed to establish a causal connection between her protected activity and the adverse action. Appellant had a history of filing grievances yet the agency did not propose any actions against her until she began engaging in the misconduct that formed the basis for the charges sustained in this proceeding. Further, the sustained misconduct, wholly unrelated and entirely independent of appellant's grievance filing, establishes that the agency had a legitimate reason for taking the action against appellant. Thus, appellant has failed to establish her allegation of reprisal. <span class="Italic">See Osokow</span> at 325.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chandler v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 13 MSPR 90, 95 (1982), involving a charge that the appellant inappropriately displayed his credentials and service weapon during an off-duty argument, concluded that an affirmative defense of reprisal was deflected by the apparent reasonableness of the agency's response to the appellant's conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record on appeal discloses that appellant's thirty-day suspension constitutes the second disciplinary action taken against him for conduct involving poor judgment in the use of his government credentials. In this <span id="Page_4032"></span>action, appellant's conduct is far more serious because it also involves the use of his service revolver in an unnecessary situation. The agency had a legitimate motive in disciplining appellant, namely, to impress upon him the agency's need to have its employees who carry official credentials and weapons exercise good judgement in their use. If the agency had decided to take no action against appellant under these circumstances, the agency's inaction would have been suspect. We conclude that the agency has met its burden of showing that it would have taken this action even absent appellant's protected activities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Nordell v. DHHS</span>, 15 MSPR 37, 42 (1983) (discrimination and reprisal: causal connection will be found lacking, the Board has said, if the appellant's misconduct is proved, the misconduct is within her control, the conduct has a clear relationship to the efficiency of the service, and the treatment is not disparate).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DOJ</span>, 66 MSPR 287, 297-98 (1995), the Board declined to find reprisal despite an intense motivation on the part of the responsible agency official and a weak charge that the Board would not sustain. Instead of preponderant evidence, the Board demanded "compelling evidence of an improper retaliatory motive," possibly an admission by the deciding official that indeed he had taken the action to punish the appellant for protected activities:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contended that the agency removed him in retaliation for his prior protected activity in filing EEO complaints, Board appeals, and grievances. For an appellant to prevail on a contention of illegal retaliation, he has the burden of showing that: (1) A protected disclosure was made; (2) the accused official knew of the disclosure; (3) the adverse action under review could have been retaliation under the circumstances; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The parties stipulated as to the first three <span class="Italic">Warren</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that Warden True had an "intense" motive to retaliate against the appellant, and that this intent was exhibited in the first removal notice, later rescinded, in which the warden accused the appellant of "coercing" employees to call in sick. She also noted that the appellant had been successful in prior Board appeals. In one appeal, a 30-day suspension was mitigated to a 14-day suspension.... In an appeal of a removal action,...which we addressed today <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the appellant was successful at the regional office level in getting his removal reversed. The administrative judge also noted that the agency's charge against the appellant in this appeal was "weak," that no sick-out occurred, there was never any serious threat of a sick-out, and the agency singled the appellant out for investigation. She therefore found that the appellant proved that there was a genuine nexus between the agency's alleged retaliation and the removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to determine whether the appellant proved a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action, the Board must weigh the intensity of the motive to retaliate against the gravity of the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, 804 F.2d at 658. We agree with the administrative judge that the agency's motive to retaliate against the appellant was intense. However, the decision to charge the appellant with misconduct is a close call. The idea of employees discussing a sick-out in a prison is a matter to be taken very seriously by the Warden. In sum, based on the closeness of the decision to charge the appellant with misconduct and the lack of compelling evidence of an improper retaliatory motive, we find that the agency would have taken action against the appellant in the absence of his protected activity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Marable v. Department of the Army</span>, 52 MSPR 622, 632 (1992). Therefore, the appellant has failed to prove his affirmative defense of retaliation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A decision finding reprisal against individuals involved in grievance hearings compared the magnitude of the penalty with the stature of the offense, <span class="Italic">Monczewski v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 12 MSPR 362, 367 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In each case, appellants, with at least seven years of satisfactory service with the agency, failed to respond immediately to their supervisor's order to return to their duty stations after completion of their testimonies in the grievance hearing. There was an approximate delay of three minutes before each appellant returned to his duty station, and all arrived before their supervisor returned. The delay in their response was because the employee representative in the grievance had asked to speak to them. Each appellant stated that he had never been involved in a grievance hearing before and that they thought they should speak with the representative (as they were his witnesses) prior to returning to work. However, as noted earlier in this opinion, each appellant returned to his duty station in less than five minutes and was at his respective station when the supervisor returned. The presiding official found under these circumstances that appellants' conduct was <span class="Italic">de minimus</span>. We agree with this evaluation. The agency, in its petition for review, stresses its dependence on command and control on a military base, and therefore argues that appellants' failure to respond to the supervisor's order was especially serious. Although we recognize that appellants' actions as perceived by management is a legitimate concern, we also are cognizant that in the present cases appellants did respond to management's order, although not as expeditiously as management might have desired. Thus, management's concern, although genuine and reasonable in other situations, is overstated in the present cases and not serious enough under the circumstances to override the presiding official's finding that appellants' conduct was <span class="Italic">de minimus</span>.</p>
