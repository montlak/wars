<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-140"><span class="space">f.</span> Evidence of Compliance; Statement of Intent; Representative's Statement; Reargument of Merits</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Proof in enforcement cases is through the same type of evidentiary submissions offered and received in other facets of Board practice. In an enforcement proceeding, all available proof of compliance should first be filed with the AJ. [Refer below to "<a href="0100-2023-23-149.html#sec16-147">MSPB Review of Initial Decision on Enforcement Petition</a>" for other cases explaining how and at what level the Board considers proof concerning compliance issues.] "An agency's intent to comply with a Board order is not sufficient to show actual compliance." <span class="Italic">Seibert v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 236, 238 &#x00B6; 3 (2003). The Board looks for evidence of actual compliance, not promises of future compliance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Welber v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 1, 3 (1994) (remanding for a further compliance determination: "Although the agency has indicated that it is willing to take all recommended actions, it has submitted no evidence that such actions have actually been taken. However, based on the record before the Board, it is unclear whether the failure to comply with the Board's decision lies with the appellant, the agency, or both."); <span class="Italic">Ciulla v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 111, 114 (1989) (agency is not in compliance if it can state only that it has requested its payment center to issue a check). When records necessary to back pay calculations are unavailable, the agency must use the most relevant available records to determine the extent of the appellant's entitlement. <span class="Italic">Welber v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 601, 604 (1997) (agency allegation that it could not calculate premium pay because its policy was not to retain those records for more than three years).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vincent v. DOJ</span>, 32 MSPR 263, 268-69 (1987), reminded parties that in enforcement proceedings, as in other aspects of litigation before the Board, statements by representatives in pleadings (the response to the enforcement petition) are not a substitute for evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Singletary v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 76, 79 (1998) ("[The] agency's statement regarding the calculations was not in affidavit form and therefore does not constitute evidence."); <span class="Italic">Williams v. DHHS</span>, 32 MSPR 259, 262 (1987) ("[A]dministrative judge simply repeated these assertions, made in the agency's response to the appellant's petition for enforcement, in finding that the agency's reasons for not reinstating the appellant were valid. Statements made in such a response, however, are not evidence."); <span class="Italic">Vidal v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 395, 402 &#x00B6; 17 (1999) (agency's burden to prove compliance with a Board final order required agency to submit evidence clearly proving its compliance; "[s]tatements by the agency's representative, in contrast to, for example, affidavits from agency managers with knowledge of personnel needs, are not evidence"); <span class="Italic">Joos v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 79 MSPR 342, 348 (1998) ("It is well-settled that statements in responses by the agency's representative are not themselves evidence."); <span class="Italic">Hull v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 291, 294 (1995) ("In this submission the agency representatives denies that instructions were given that the performance evaluation should not be done. This statement is not evidence."); <span class="Italic">Saal v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 MSPR 670, 674 (1988) (enforcement proceeding: "the agency has submitted no evidence or affidavits to support its contentions, and its arguments are not evidence"); <span class="Italic">Vincent v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rickels v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 42 MSPR 596, 603 (1989), commented that "it is well established that statements in an agency's response are not evidence." It has been noted that "the Board routinely relies on the statements of the parties when a compliance matter is before it," <span class="Italic">Moore v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 106, 107 n.1 (1988), but the reference was to an affidavit of a representative, not to an unsworn statement of fact made in a brief. <span class="Italic">Wayne v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 322, 327 (1992), declined to credit, as evidence supporting the appellant's protest that he had not been restored to the proper position, statements of the appellant "not contained in an affidavit or statement signed under penalty of perjury, [or supported] by documentary evidence":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's unverified petition for enforcement is insufficient to prove the truth of the assertions contained therein. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 61, 62 (1992) (although the agency representative "swears" that the agency has complied with the interim relief order, her statement is not evidence of compliance because it is not in affidavit form or made under penalty of perjury); <span class="Italic">Allen v. Department of Interior</span>, 54 MSPR 116, 118 (1992) (the agency's "certification" of compliance with the interim relief order is merely an allegation of compliance and does not constitute sufficient evidence of compliance); <span class="Italic">Caney v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">As'Salaam v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 480, 482 &#x00B6; 5 (1998) (unsworn statement of an agency official was admissible in an enforcement proceeding; the question was how much weight it should be given); <span class="Italic">Scott v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board may resolve differences in accounts concerning compliance efforts through reference to written submissions, and the Board may then essentially make credibility determinations based on its analysis of written submissions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Turner v. DHS</span>, 102 MSPR 330, 333 &#x00B6; 9, 2006 MSPB 175 (2006) ("the appellant's version of events is imprecise and seems designed to confuse"); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Crook v.

<p class="Body-Text">Enforcement proceedings do not furnish reason to relitigate issues determined in the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coffey v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3034) ("[a]n enforcement action is designed to enforce an earlier Board order, not to relitigate whether the earlier order was correct."). An agency may not refuse to comply on the basis that the initial decision is incorrect. The compliance decision is an addendum to the decision on the merits, not a reconsideration of the evidence in a new light. <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 129, 130-31 (1988), reviewed an enforcement order involving the Board's decision that appellant receive a disability annuity. OPM's defense was that appellant's annuity application was not filed within the time permitted by statute. After the AJ rejected the OPM argument and issued an initial decision favoring the appellant, OPM filed an untimely PFR. The Board rejected the PFR and the initial decision became final as a result. Then OPM advised the AJ that it would not abide by the Board's decision because, in the view of OPM, appellant had no statutory entitlement to an annuity. The Board enforced its decision on the merits, paying no mind to OPM's statutory argument:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is before the Board on the issue of compliance. By Order dated December 23, 1987, the Board dismissed the agency's petition for review as untimely filed and determined that the initial decision remained the Board's final decision on the merits in this appeal, 36 MSPR 37. In the initial decision, the administrative judge reversed the agency's reconsideration decision denying the appellant disability retirement benefits. The administrative judge also found that the appellant was carried on the rolls of his employing agency at the time his application for disability retirement was filed, and that his application was not time-barred under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(b) (application for disability retirement must be made before an employee is separated from the service or within one year thereafter).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the Board declined to reopen the case on its own motion "since the agency did not exercise due diligence in either prosecuting its appeal to the Board or in obtaining the information it now seeks to present to the Board." The agency was ordered to grant the appellant's application for disability retirement within twenty days of the date of the Board's decision. The agency did not seek judicial review of the Board's final order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 20, 1988, the appellant filed a petition for enforcement asserting that the agency had indicated that it would not comply with the Board's order. Subsequently, the agency responded that, based on the official employment records which it had belatedly brought to the Board's attention, it was barred by 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(b) from allowing the application and paying the appellant his benefits because his application was untimely filed. In his Addendum-Enforcement Recommendation issued on February 25, 1988, the administrative judge recommended that the agency be found in noncompliance essentially because the Board had found that the appellant's application was timely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency continues now to rely upon an argument that the appellant's application is time-barred by 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(b). However, this argument is based upon evidence which the Board either found unpersuasive or refused to consider. The Board, not the agency, has the authority to make a final determination in a retirement matter, subject only to judicial review. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board determined not only that the agency's petition for review of the initial decision was untimely filed, but also that it would not consider the information the agency sought to present to the Board because it had not acted with due diligence in obtaining the information. The Board affirmatively determined that the initial decision, which found the appellant's retirement application timely filed and directed the agency to grant the appellant's application for disability retirement, remained the Board's final decision in this appeal. Because the agency did not seek judicial review of the decision, the finding that the appellant's application was timely filed is final. <span class="Italic">See Detherage v. Department of Air Force,</span> 30 MSPR 411 (1986) (Agency cannot raise same argument in petition for review in remand proceeding which it raised in its original <span id="Page_4984"></span>petition for review which was rejected by the Board as untimely filed.) <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also Ferry v. Department of Navy,</span> 32 MSPR 63 (1986) (In petition for enforcement, the agency is estopped from relitigating an issue which was resolved by the administrative judge and which became the final decision of the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, to the extent that the agency seeks reconsideration of the evidence in the context of this compliance proceeding, the decision here is an addendum to the decision on the merits and not a reconsideration of the evidence in a new light. <span class="Italic">Cf. Yorkshire v.</span> <span class="Italic">Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 746 F.2d 1454, 1458 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (The evidence in the decision on the merits should not be reconsidered in the context of an attorney fee motion.) Accordingly, because the Board's decision holds that the application was timely filed, there is no statutory bar to the granting of the appellant's retirement application.</p>
