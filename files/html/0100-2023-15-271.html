<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Coughlan v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 88-3332), affirmed removal of a civilian classification specialist working in a personnel office for the employee's unofficial use of the agency computer system to enhance his credentials, affecting promotability, in the agency computer data bank. Substantial personal use of an agency computer by a supervisor with knowledge of prohibition of its use warranted a 28-day suspension. The misuse of the computer was not akin to personal use of agency telephones engaged in by other employees. An absolute prohibition on telephone use would be a serious inconvenience to employees and an absolute prohibition on computer use would result in no similar inconvenience. <span class="Italic">Lemmon v. USDA</span>, 23 MSPR 506, 513 n.6 (1984). Of use of computers for personal correspondence, the court said in <span class="Italic">Stanek v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 805 F.2d 1572, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1986), coupled with discussion of other charges leading to removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The board's finding that Stanek used government equipment and material to prepare his private papers is supported by substantial evidence and largely uncontested. Stanek's use of government property might not sustain a removal action by itself and, as a practical matter, may be widely permitted in government offices. Yet, a word processor is property as valuable as an automobile, and use of a government car for personal purposes is most severely frowned upon. Such acts do violate federal regulations....</p>

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 394 Fed. Appx. 688 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Morrison v. NASA</span>, 65 MSPR 348, 357-58 (1994), sustained suspension of an employee charged with maintaining and occasionally displaying sexually explicit materials on a government computer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The misuse of government resources is a serious charge. The Board has upheld suspensions of 30 days or more for sustained charges similar to the charge here of misuse of government resources. In <span class="Italic">Barcia v. Department of the Army,</span> 47 MSPR 423, 430-31 (1991), the Board found that a 30-day suspension was the maximum reasonable penalty for the appellant's use of a government computer to maintain private business records and contact computer firms by modem. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of the Army,</span> 32 MSPR 277, 279 (1987), the Board held that a 60-day suspension was the maximum reasonable penalty for the misuse of an agency photocopier to make 11 copies. The Board held in <span class="Italic">Perrotti v.

Inadvertent access of an agency payroll file was not sufficient to sustain adverse action under an agency regulation that specified deliberate misuse of government equipment as a basis for discipline. Access of the data file was unintended. The program could be readily executed. There was no plausible explanation, e.g., personal gain, of why the appellant would deliberately execute the payroll program. The Board noted that although improper inadvertent use of government equipment may be sanctionable, the more restrictive agency rule allegedly violated required deliberate, improper access. <span class="Italic">Wolak v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's third specification in support of its first charge--misuse of government office equipment--stated, "Despite receiving a direct order in April 2002 to cease and desist from any misuse of Government property, you have continued to use the Government office equipment to support your private commercial business." The AJ found it undisputed that Roger Kodat, Deputy Assistant Secretary in the agency's Office of Governmental Financial Policy, had issued the appellant an April 2, 2002 memorandum advising him that, if he was engaging in the misuse of government property or was using his public office for private gain, he was to cease and desist from that type of behavior immediately. The AJ found that the agency produced records that allegedly showed on-duty computer activity related to the appellant's comic book business from April 2002 through July 24, 2002. However, the AJ accepted the appellant's testimony that the agency's evidence only showed that he had copied his commercial business computer files from one floppy disk to another floppy disk using his government computer during that time period. The AJ found that this use of government equipment was insufficient to support the agency's third specification because the agency permitted limited personal use of government property when such use involved minimal additional expense to the government and did not overburden any of the agency's information resources.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not agree with this finding regarding the appellant's admitted misuse of his government computer in support of his commercial business following the agency's April 2, 2002 directive that he immediately cease and desist his alleged misuse of government property and use of public office for private gain. Treasury Directive 87-04, upon which the AJ relied in finding that the appellant's admitted use constituted authorized "[l]imited personal use," provides, in part, that "[e]mployees are specifically prohibited from the pursuit of private commercial business activities or profit-making ventures using the government's office equipment." Moreover, regardless of Treasury Directive 87-04, the appellant was directed in the agency's April 2, 2002 memorandum immediately to cease and desist his misuse of government property and use of public office for private gain. We find that the agency's evidence, when coupled with the appellant's admitted use of his government computer in support of his commercial business following the agency's April 2002 memorandum, was sufficient to sustain the agency's third specification in support of its first charge and that the AJ erred in finding to the contrary. Therefore, we sustain the agency's third specification in support of its first charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency's removal penalty is within the tolerable limits of reasonableness</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, all of the agency's charges and specifications are sustained, the Board will review the agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within the tolerable limits of reasonableness<span class="Italic">. Singletary v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 553 &#x00B6; 9 (2003); <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981). In making this determination, the Board must give due weight to the agency's primary discretion in maintaining employee discipline and efficiency, recognizing that the Board's function is not to displace management's responsibility, but to ensure that managerial judgment has been properly exercised<span class="Italic">. Singletary,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 553 &#x00B6; 9;<span class="Italic"> Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 306. The Board will modify or mitigate an agency-imposed penalty only where it finds the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors or the penalty clearly exceeds the bounds of reasonableness<span class="Italic">. Singletary</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 553 &#x00B6; 9. We agree with the agency that the AJ erred in mitigating its removal penalty to a 90-day suspension because the agency proved all of its charges and specifications by preponderant evidence and it properly weighed all of the relevant factors in imposing the penalty of removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In evaluating the penalty, the Board will consider, first and foremost, the nature and seriousness of the misconduct and its relationship to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or was frequently repeated<span class="Italic">. Singletary</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 553 &#x00B6; 12. The appellant's own admissions during his OIG interview established the seriousness of the charged misconduct, the fact that the misconduct was knowing and intentional, and the fact that the misconduct was on-going for an extended period of time. The appellant admitted that he knew that using his government computer for the purpose of viewing pornography on government time was prohibited, but he did it anyway. He admitted to using government provided internet, e-mail, and telephone service inappropriately for non-work related purposes, and he admitted to knowingly falsifying his timesheets as a result of his running his private business interest during work hours, such that he stole an estimated $63,106.77 in salary. Further, the appellant's hearing testimony established that, even after the agency's April 2, 2002 memorandum ordering him immediately to cease and desist his alleged misuse of government property and use of public office for private gain, he continued to use his government computer to copy his commercial business files. We find that the appellant's admissions and the circumstances of this case show that the appellant's misconduct was serious, intentional, repeated, and directly related to his duties, position, and responsibilities as a Computer Specialist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to erroneously finding that the agency had not proven its third specification in support of its first charge and had improperly relied on that specification in making its penalty determination, the AJ also found that there were mitigating circumstances that warranted a lesser penalty than removal. The AJ found that the appellant had no prior disciplinary actions on his record. We find this fact to be of little weight here, however, because the notice of proposed removal indicates that the appellant had been previously counseled regarding his personal use of government office equipment and the deciding official considered the clarity with which the appellant was on notice of the impropriety of such conduct, as well as his lack of a prior disciplinary record. The AJ noted the appellant's superior or outstanding performance ratings during his ten years of service with the agency and the fact that he would assist others in troubleshooting problems. The AJ found that the fact that the appellant cooperated with the OIG investigation and stopped his improper use of his government computer following the agency's April 2002 memorandum ordering him to cease and desist such activity showed that he had potential for rehabilitation. However, we find that the evidence fails to show that the appellant has potential for rehabilitation. As noted above, the record reflects that the appellant had been previously counseled regarding his improper use of government equipment for his personal use. Following the appellant's admission of his serious on-going misconduct during the OIG investigation, the agency issued him an April 2, 2002 memorandum ordering him immediately to cease and desist from his misuse of his government equipment and use of public office for personal gain. Nonetheless, the <span id="Page_2802"></span>appellant admitted to using his government computer subsequently to copy his private business computer files. Further, as the AJ found, the appellant attempted unpersuasively to recant his March 14, 2002 sworn admissions to the OIG during his hearing testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the agency properly weighed the appellant's serious, on-going misconduct and properly exercised its managerial judgment in determining that removal was the appropriate penalty under the circumstances of this case<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Biniak v. Social Security Administration</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 682 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 11-12, 15 (2002) (Computer Specialist's removal was reasonable for his use of his government computer, telephone, envelopes, and e-mail to conduct his personal business while at work over an extended period of time, despite his satisfactory performance ratings during his 16 years of service with the agency and a lack of a prior disciplinary record).</p>
