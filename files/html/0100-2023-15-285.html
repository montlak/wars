<p class="Body-Text">"The Board has consistently upheld removals as promoting the efficiency of the service for both the purchase and use of illegal drugs at work, especially where the work performed under the influence of such substances could endanger the safety of others." <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 96 MSPR 179, 187 &#x00B6; 18 (2004) (collecting decisions; removal of expediter who was responsible for moving heaving equipment around a busy shop floor). Possession of marijuana on duty is sufficiently egregious conduct to warrant removal. <span class="Italic">Rivera v. VA</span>, 28 MSPR 313, 313 n.* (1985) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Swann v. TVA</span>, 18 MSPR 290, 293 (1983) (removal for possession was too harsh because the appellant expressed a willingness to abide by agency work rules in the future and there was an indication of disparate treatment in the selection of the penalty by the agency)). Removal was appropriate for possession of marijuana at an explosive ordnance facility. There was prior discipline for the same charge, and employees were repeatedly warned (one week before) of the drug abuse policy and the possibility of removal for any violation of the policy. <span class="Italic">Robertson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 466, 471 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 6, 9 (1995) (removal of an ordnance equipment mechanic sustained following a drug test reflecting marijuana use; the appellant was aware of the agency's "zero tolerance" policy; removal was appropriate given the nature of the employee's position, involving maintenance and repair of expensive, sophisticated, and dangerous weapons systems; the potential existed for the appellant's misconduct to cause severe harm and damage to life and property, and even the failure of a military mission).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Use of marijuana at the workplace by a maintenance mechanic warranted the removal imposed by the agency rather than the suspension selected in mitigation by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Arena v. USPS</span>, 121 MSPR 125, 130-31 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 13, 2014 MSPB 34 (2014) (noting the deciding official's concern about "appellant's responsibility for maintenance and repair of heavy machinery and the potential danger posed by the appellant if he were impaired while on duty"; "[t]he Board has frequently upheld removals for the use of illegal drugs at work, especially where the work performed under the influence of such substances could endanger the safety of others."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Batara v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 123 MSPR 278, 283 &#x00B6; 8, 2016 MSPB 15 (2016) ("In his position, the appellant's work directly supported and enhanced the welfare of warfighters using submarines in military operations. Therefore, the agency reasonably concluded that the appellant's frequent use of an illegal drug presented a substantial risk to safety and demonstrated a reckless disregard for Shipyard policy. We find, as did the administrative judge, that the appellant's repeated misconduct was serious and directly related to the duties and responsibilities of his position. <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 557, 563-64 (explaining that removal is a reasonable penalty for drug use when the employee performs work that, if he were impaired, could result in substantial danger to the safety and lives of others), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 168 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table)"; rejecting as a mitigating factor that the agency did not re-inspect work performed by the appellant); <span class="Italic">Saiz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 122 MSPR 521, 526-27 &#x00B6; 11, 2015 MSPB 40 (2015) ("Here, the agency found, and the appellant did not deny, that he was in possession, and visibly under the influence, of illegal drugs while on duty at the military installation. The appellant's position description emphasizes its considerable physical demands, including working from ladders, scaffolds, and on top of equipment at heights up to 18 feet and underneath vehicles. The position description also identifies workplace hazards caused by acids, fluids, and lubricants and states that employees must follow proscribed safety practices and use safety equipment. Thus, we agree with the deciding official's concern about the potential for injury to the appellant and others if he performed his duties while impaired.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schulmeister v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 13, 15 (1990), sustained removal for possession and use of controlled substances, rather than the mitigation directed by the AJ, of an individual whose "defective work could cause a catastrophic nuclear radiological accident." The necessity for "absolute trust and confidence" in the appellant outweighed his excellent work record, his potential for rehabilitation, and the high regard for the appellant by his supervisors. This result was affirmed in <span class="Italic">Schulmeister v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1991 NP No. 90-3495): a single incident of drug use could justify, despite mitigating circumstances, dismissal of an employee in a position involving the inspection and repair of tooling used in handling ordnance and in the refueling of nuclear-powered warships. The Board properly weighed the sensitivity of the petitioner's job. Another removal was sustained for possession of drugs on agency premises. The facility was engaged in the printing of securities and stamps and used machinery that could be dangerous if handled by someone under the influence of a narcotic. <span class="Italic">Jackson v.

Removal was sustained for the first offense <span id="Page_2825"></span>of possession of marijuana on government property.

<p class="Body-Text">There does not appear to be a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> amount of drug that an appellant may possess and avoid a penalty; the Board may look to the state criminal code to determine if the law prescribes a minimum amount of the drug, e.g., marijuana, necessary for prosecution of its possession. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ingram v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency need not show an adverse effect on specific duties to show the required nexus between an employee's misconduct and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robertson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 466, 470, n.4 (1985)...&#8197;Rather, it is sufficient for the agency to show that a risk exists because of the employee's conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Averill v. Department of the Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 327, 331 (1986). By using marijuana before coming to work and during his lunch breaks, we find that the appellant here clearly raised the risk that his intoxication might affect his ability to repair the guidance systems of the Minuteman missiles on which he worked.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the lack of demonstrated harm caused by the appellant's drug use does not weigh against the reasonableness of the agency's penalty determination....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching its decision to remove the appellant, the agency considered the following factors: (1) the highly important and sensitive nature of the appellant's work...(2) the fact that the appellant's drug use significantly compromised the efficiency of the agency's maintenance operations and destroyed the agency's confidence in the appellant's ability to correctly perform his duties; (3) the fact that the appellant's work required access to classified defense materials, and the appellant lost his security clearance as a result of his misconduct; and (4) the fact that the appellant's drug use constituted an intentional violation of the agency's clearly articulated policy against drug abuse. Given the exacting, sensitive nature of the appellant's work, the extreme hazards to which the public at large could be exposed should his work be inaccurate, the high standard of confidence and trust required by the agency, the serious nature of the appellant's misconduct, and his admitted use of a controlled substance in a manner intended to affect him during work hours, we can discern no basis for mitigating the agency's selected penalty and find that removal lies within the tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Schulmeister v. Department of the Navy,</span> 46 MSPR 13, 15 (1990) (Board reversed administrative judge's mitigation of penalty and reinstated agency's selected penalty of removal for first offense of drug possession because employee's position involved inspection, modification, and repair of specialized tooling used in refueling of nuclear warships, work that necessarily involved great deal of potential hazard to public's health and safety, and his defective work could cause catastrophic radiological accident); <span class="Italic">Olson v.

<p class="Body-Text">Off-duty possession of marijuana resulted in removal of a Bureau of Prisons recreational specialist, <span class="Italic">Thompson v. DOJ</span>, 51 MSPR 43, 49-50 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant's DWI conviction and possession of an illegal drug (marijuana) renders him "disqualified" for accommodation because these offenses strike at the core of his job and the agency's mission. As a Recreation Specialist, employed by the Federal Prison System, the appellant is considered a law enforcement officer, has frequent and direct contact with prison inmates, and supervises their recreation and leisure time programs. These responsibilities for the security of the prisoners while assisting their rehabilitation necessitates that persons in such a position not violate laws against drunken driving or possession of illegal drugs. The essential integrity of the personnel in the Federal Prison System is flatly compromised whenever an employee violates Federal and state laws. We, therefore, conclude that the agency was not required to offer the appellant accommodation in the form of drug or alcohol rehabilitation before proposing his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the penalty of removal is within the bounds of reasonableness for the sustained charges in light of the relevant factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 305-06 (1981). In reaching this conclusion, we find that, because the appellant is a law enforcement officer, it is appropriate to hold him to a higher standard of conduct than other employees<span class="Italic">. See Hartigan v. Veterans Administration</span>, 39 MSPR 613, 619 (1989). Moreover, the appellant's involvement with illegal drugs is antithetical to the duties of his position and the mission of the agency. The decision of the local police not to charge appellant with the criminal offense of possession of marijuana does not lessen the seriousness of the appellant's misconduct, or its impact upon both the agency's mission and the appellant's ability to perform his duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the administrative judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">Kruger v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 MSPR 71, 77 (1987), to support his decision to mitigate the penalty, is misplaced because <span class="Italic">Kruger</span> is distinguishable from the present case. In <span class="Italic">Kruger</span>, there was no police involvement--a factor which impacts upon the agency's relationship with local law enforcement authorities. Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Kruger</span>, there was no evidence showing that the appellants' offense was publicized or a matter of notoriety within the community or the correctional institution, including the inmate population. This is not true here. Finally, the appellant in the present case, unlike the appellants in <span class="Italic">Kruger</span>, had been put on clear notice that involvement with illegal drugs would result in removal unless a user came forward prior to detection.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/THOMPSON_REUBEN_SF_0752_11_0551_I_2_FINAL_ORDER_831337.pdf">SF-0752-11-0551-I-2</a> (NP 6/12/2013), declined to accept the appellant's medical prescriptions as a defense to possession of controlled substances in a GOV:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant alleges, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that he has legal prescription cards for use of medicinal marijuana issued by the states of Arizona and California, and that the administrative judge's "ruling enforces federal law beyond extended [sic] beyond his jurisdiction conflicting with the enforcement of the U.S. Attorney General." It is undisputed that the appellant was in possession of the controlled substances, marijuana and hashish, as charged. The record shows however that the appellant had a State of California Medical Marijuana Identification Card at the time of his arrest by Federal law enforcement officials in Arizona on February 26, 2011, and that he subsequently obtained, on February 28, 2011, a Physician Statement and Recommendation, which authorized him to possess marijuana for medical purposes under Arizona law. Nevertheless, the appellant apparently did not obtain an Arizona Medical Marijuana ID Card until sometime after his arrest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge first noted that marijuana and hashish are controlled substances under Schedule I, as defined by section 802(6) of title 21, United States Code and that the appellant had failed to show that state law superseded Federal law in this regard. We agree. The U.S. Supreme Court has found that the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 801 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, was a valid exercise of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause and that the State of California's Medical Marijuana law does not preclude or supersede the CSA's enforcement by federal law enforcement against local cultivation of marijuana in California. <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Raich</span>, 545 U.S. 1, 22-33 (2005). Thus, the administrative judge properly concluded that the appellant's conduct violated Federal law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge further noted that it was undisputed that, during the relevant time, the appellant lived and worked in Arizona, and was <span id="Page_2826"></span>stopped in Arizona in possession of marijuana and hashish in a GOV. The appellant acknowledged at hearing that he did not have a prescription for the medical use of marijuana under the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (AMMA) at the time of his arrest on February 26, 2011. The fact that the appellant obtained an Arizona medical marijuana recommendation a few days after his arrest does not excuse his earlier illegal possession of marijuana and hashish under state law. In addition, the appellant's possession of a California Medical Marijuana Card did not excuse his illegal possession of controlled substances under Arizona law. <span class="Italic">See</span> Ariz. Rev. Stat. &#x00A7; 36-2802(17) (AMMA limits "visiting qualified patients" as individuals with an authorization from another state to possess marijuana who have been resident in the Arizona less than 30 days); <span class="Italic">State v. Okun</span>, 296 P.3d 998 (Ct. App. Ariz. 2013) (interpreting AMMA's "visiting qualified patients" provision). The record shows that the appellant had been resident in Arizona for more than 30 days on February 26, 2011. Therefore, the appellant has failed to show a legal entitlement to possess marijuana and hashish under Arizona or California law at the time of his arrest.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reversed the award of an arbitrator who sustained removal for illegal drug use when the employee did not know that his trainer (for an apparent athletic contest) had injected him with a controlled steroid rather than cortisone. The charge was "use of an illegal substance," and the court implied a condition to the charge of knowing use by the employee. <span class="Italic">Torres v. DOJ</span>, 343 Fed. Appx. 610 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP). But the circuit sustained discharge of an employee who asserted his random drug test was positive because the employee, while attending a party, ate some brownies without knowing they contained marijuana. The Board determined, and the court agreed, that the appellant did not provide enough evidence that he unknowingly ingested the marijuana. The credibility finding was against the appellant, <span class="Italic">Hansen v. DHS</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/17-2584.Opinion.12-28-2018.pdf">911 F.3d 1362</a>, 1367-69 (Fed. Cir. 2018):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Hansen's undisputedly positive test result sufficed to prove the charge of "positive test for illegal drug use--marijuana." Under agency policy, a positive drug test suffices to find illegal drug use and constitutes misconduct. As the Board found, under that policy, the government need only show a positive drug test to sustain a "positive test" charge. Though Mr. Hansen might prefer that the agency adopt a different policy, he does not challenge (and we do not decide), the existing policy's permissibility. <span class="Italic">See also Baird v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 517 F.3d 1345, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (noting without deciding that an agency "may be free to adopt and enforce...[a] policy pursuant to which any [testing designated position] employee who refuses to submit to or fails a drug test, will be removed"). We thus decline his invitation to "inject[&#8197;] an intent requirement" into the charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">See King v. Frazier</span>, 77 F.3d 1361, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 1996).[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We emphasize, however, that, unlike here, where intent is an element of the misconduct charged, the government must prove intent. <span class="Italic">See Chauvin v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 38 F.3d 563, 565-66 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (sustaining "unauthorized possession" charge but finding government failed to prove "attempted removal" charge because it failed to show intent, "an important element of proof in an 'attempt' charge"); <span class="Italic">King v. Nazelrod</span>, 43 F.3d 663, 665-66 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (explaining government must prove intent for theft charge because "one of the elements of theft is the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the government did not need to prove intent to establish that Mr. Hansen's misconduct impacted the efficiency of the service or that it reasonably removed him. Mr. Hansen agrees that "illegal drug use by a [Customs and Border Protection] employee is <span class="Italic">in direct conflict with the principles of law enforcement, the mission of the agency and the public's trust</span>." And though the Board must consider any evidence of inadvertence in its reasonableness inquiry as part of the analysis mandated by <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.B. 313 (1981), it does not follow that it is the government's burden to introduce evidence of intent to prove reasonableness. "We have not required that each and every factor of the twelve <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors be considered. We have only required that the penalty selected be reasonable when considered against the relevant factors." <span class="Italic">Brennan v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 787 F.2d 1559, 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also Jones v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 502 Fed. Appx. 930, 933 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (affirming penalty and noting "the absence of malicious intent does not make the penalty unreasonable"); <span class="Italic">Balouris v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., No. 2008-3147, 2009 WL 405827, at *2 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 19, 2009) (affirming penalty where "[r]egardless of his intent, [employee] struck [co-worker] on a public street").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The absence of intent may be relevant to rebut the government's assertion of nexus or reasonableness in some circumstances. In <span class="Italic">Torres v. Department of Justice</span>, 343 Fed. Appx. 610 (Fed. Cir. 2009), the Board credited a removed employee's evidence showing that he did not know that injections provided by his trainer contained illegal steroids. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 613. We held that the government failed to carry its ultimate burden to prove nexus, explaining "[i]t does not promote the efficiency of the service for an agency to remove an employee...[who] did not know the substance...[he used] was a controlled substance." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, in cases in which the Board has found that an employee inadvertently ingested a controlled substance, it has reversed agency penalties, holding that "the penalty of removal is unreasonable and that the maximum reasonable penalty is no penalty at all." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McNeil v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 533, 539-40 (M.S.P.B. 2012). But, as we have previously explained, the burden of introducing evidence showing that, in the circumstances of a particular case, the charged conduct would not impact the efficiency of the service or the proposed penalty is unreasonable rests with the employee. <span class="Italic">See Schapansky</span>, 735 F.2d at 482; <span class="Italic">cf. Frey v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 359 F.3d 1355, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (applying same two-step framework to analysis of removal for failure to accept reassignment). Contrary to Mr. Hansen's argument, this "requirement for coming forward with evidence does not shift the overall burden of proof." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Anderson v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 827 F.2d 1564, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We read the Board's opinion as properly applying this framework in the context of this case. Having found that the government had introduced sufficient proof to establish that Mr. Hansen committed the conduct with which he was charged, the Board considered whether his evidence of inadvertent ingestion rebutted the government's assertion of a nexus between the charged conduct and the efficiency of the service, or otherwise undermined the reasonableness of the penalty. The Board concluded that Mr. Hansen's evidence of inadvertent use was weak and, thus, inadequate to undermine the government's showing of nexus or the reasonableness of the penalty imposed. We find no arbitrariness, abuse, or other error in the Board's conclusion that Mr. Hansen failed to persuasively rebut the government's showing of nexus or its choice of penalty.[2] Mr. Hansen supported his theory of inadvertent ingestion only with "third-hand hearsay"--his longtime friend's statement that the barbeque host had stated that an unnamed attendee had brought unmarked marijuana-laced brownies to the barbeque. Besides Mr. Hansen, no one testified that they had even seen the brownies. And though Mr. Hansen later reported some symptoms consistent with marijuana ingestion, he did so only after the deciding official explained that she had discredited his version of events, in part, because she found it "highly questionable" that he did not report any "behavioral or physiological effects" from eating marijuana-laced brownies. Further, an expert testified that the symptoms Mr. Hansen reported were not necessarily caused by marijuana--inadvertently ingested or otherwise. We therefore affirm the Board's ruling that on the entire record, the government bore its burden of establishing not only that the charged conduct occurred, but that nexus existed and that the penalty was a reasonable one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Board suggested that Mr. Hansen needed to prove his <span id="Page_2827"></span>theory of inadvertent ingestion by preponderant evidence. The quantum of rebuttal evidence necessary may depend on the quality of the government's case--"[i]t may be that little countering evidence would be required, where, for example, the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case was minimally supported." <span class="Italic">Schapansky</span>, 735 F.2d at 482. We do not decide in this case precisely how much more evidence Mr. Hansen needed to provide, however, because the Board correctly found the minimal evidence he adduced insufficient.</p>
