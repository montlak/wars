<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-177"><span class="space">h.</span> Problem With Settlement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If, after an appeal is settled, evidence develops that the settlement is void for fraud, mutual mistake, or another qualifying reason such as mental incapacity, a PFR may be promptly lodged to set the agreement aside and reinstate the appeal. But a belated PFR challenging a decision closed out by settlement will not be accepted because the appellant is unhappy with the settlement or knew or should have known of a reason for setting the settlement aside before the finality date of the initial decision. The appellant has enforcement procedures if the agreement is valid but not properly implemented by the agency, and under those procedures it is possible that the settlement will be <span id="Page_1765"></span>set aside, at the option of a nonbreaching party. [Refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-035.html#sec16-36">Setting Aside a Settlement</a>," for attempts to set aside settlement agreements.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Dissatisfaction with a settlement agreement does not provide a basis for excusing a late PFR. <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. USPS</span>, 96 MSPR 189, 191 &#x00B6; 8 (2004); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bell v. DHS</span>, 112 MSPR 33, 36-37 &#x00B6; 7, 2009 MSPB 130 (2009) ("It is well-settled that an appellant's belated dissatisfaction with the terms of a settlement agreement does not constitute good cause for his filing delay. <span class="Italic">McPherson v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6; 12 (2007)."). <span class="Italic">Wong v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 69 MSPR 66, 68-69 (1995), rejected financial problems, among others, as excuses for a belated PFR challenging a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his sworn response to the show cause notice, the appellant asserts that he was not fully aware of the time limit, that he had hoped to find another position but has been unsuccessful, that he wanted to take advantage of early retirement like 85% of his co-workers among the debt collection staff, that he disagrees with the administrative judge's decision on the settlement agreement, that he was pressured into signing the settlement agreement, and that he could not afford the hearing costs. None of the appellant's assertions constitute good cause to waive the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant alleges that he was not fully aware of the time limit, the initial decision clearly informed him that December 13, 1994, was the last date for filing a petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled that belated dissatisfaction with the terms of a settlement agreement does not excuse the late filing of a petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Nease v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 68 MSPR 365, 367-68 (1995); <span class="Italic">Chapman v. TVA</span>, 67 MSPR 246, 249-50 (1995). The fact that the appellant has been unable to find a job after he resigned under the terms of the settlement agreement does not provide good cause. Likewise, his desire now to take an early optional retirement does not show why his petition for review was filed after the time limit for filing had passed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's allegations of financial inability to continue with his appeal and pressure to sign the agreement may be interpreted as arguing that he involuntarily accepted the terms of the agreement. These arguments also address the merits rather than the timeliness of his petition for review.... The appellant has not shown how the circumstances surrounding the settlement agreement interfered with his ability to file a timely petition for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Difficulties with the implementation of a settlement agreement will not ordinarily result in an excused deadline for a PFR, although an untimely PFR may result in a remand to the regions for adjudication under Board enforcement proceedings that could have the effect of setting an agreement aside for a material breach. A delayed PFR is not justified because an appellant belatedly discovered that a settlement agreement was not in her best interest, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. DHHS</span>, 51 MSPR 502, 505 (1991), <span class="Italic">Malfitano v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 260, 262 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Malfitano v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3488), <span class="Italic">Nease v.

<p class="Body-Text">An untimely PFR from an initial decision approving a settlement was not excused by allegations that the settlement was induced by the agency's fraudulent intention to avoid fulfilling the obligations it undertook in the settlement. The appellant earlier filed a compliance petition alleging that the agency was dilatory in complying with its obligations. The PFR was not filed for approximately two months after the compliance petition was filed. <span class="Italic">See Amos v.

An agency's untimely PFR seeking to "modify the settlement due to mutual mistake of fact or fraud by the appellant" was not excused when the asserted basis for the fraud (the appellant's alleged misrepresentation of his pay grade) could have been discovered by the agency with due diligence during settlement negotiations. <span class="Italic">Zieff v.

If an appellant challenging a settlement seeks to justify a late PFR based on a medical condition, the appellant must provide evidence showing how the medical condition precluded filing the PFR during the period of the delay. <span class="Italic">Ferguson v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit looked with disfavor on acceptance of the benefits of a settlement followed by a belated PFR seeking to set the agreement aside as involuntary, <span class="Italic">Brasel v. MSPB</span>, 97 Fed. Appx. 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Brasel's argument that he did not wish to jeopardize the job and pay that he received with a private contractor in connection with the settlement agreement also lacks merit. Mr. Brasel accepted the benefits of the settlement agreement and then, once those benefits expired, he sought to have the agreement invalidated. If Mr. Brasel, who was represented by counsel when he entered into the agreement, believed the settlement to be unfair or coerced, it was his burden to assert that claim in a timely fashion, not after collecting all the benefits of the settlement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant asserts that a settlement agreement is invalid because of misrepresentation of the agency material to the settlement, the Board considers whether the appellant filed his PFR promptly after discovery of the misrepresentation. In <span class="Italic">Hazelton v. VA</span>, 112 MSPR 357, 360-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12, 2009 MSPB 187 (2009), the PFR was deemed timely filed after the appellant found he could not retire despite, according to his allegations, the settlement of his removal case was based upon representations by agency personnel concerning his retirement eligibility:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will waive the time limit for the filing of a petition for review only upon a showing of good cause for the delay in filing. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.12, 1201.114(f). To establish good cause for the untimely filing of a petition for review, the appellant must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See Armstrong</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 11. Here, the appellant has shown that he acted with due diligence once he learned that he was ineligible for retirement and, therefore, believed that the settlement was invalid. Specifically, the appellant claims that he learned that he was ineligible for retirement in early March 2009, and has submitted evidence showing that he filed his challenge to the settlement's validity on March 11, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1766"></span>As discussed above, the appellant asserts that the agency misled him regarding his eligibility for retirement to induce him into entering into the settlement agreement, and that he did not discover this misrepresentation until he attempted to retire after entering into the settlement. Events transpiring after a purported settlement agreement can cast doubt on its validity. <span class="Italic">See DeLoach v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 485, &#x00B6; 11 (2008). Further, a settlement agreement may be invalid if a party to the agreement subsequently shows that the agreement was based on fraud or misrepresentation by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Armstrong,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 467, &#x00B6; 19 (2002). A showing that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency's statements is sufficient to show misrepresentation. <span class="Italic">Armstrong</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 467, &#x00B6; 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's petition constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation of facts that, if proven, could establish that the agency misrepresented his eligibility for retirement, thereby misleading him into entering the settlement. Specifically, the appellant has alleged that he discussed the issue of his retirement eligibility with an agency human resource specialist and with the agency representative, that they told him that he was eligible to retire before he entered into the settlement, that he entered into the settlement based upon that understanding, and that he was later denied the retirement he sought. These claims are more than bare allegations that would be insufficient to set aside a settlement. <span class="Italic">See Lasker v. Department of Justice</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 189, 191 (1997); <span class="Italic">Jardine v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 544, 547 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). We also note that the agency has not disputed the appellant's account of the discussions at issue, and argues only that the terms of the settlement do not address the appellant's retirement and that it carried out its obligations under the settlement. We find that these circumstances warrant findings that good cause exists for waiving the petition for review filing time limit, and that further adjudication is required to determine whether the settlement is invalid and should be set aside.[2] <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Department of the Army</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 90, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2008); <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 467, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;To the extent that <span class="Italic">Armstrong</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 11, suggests that, to establish good cause for the untimely filing of a petition for review of an initial decision dismissing an appeal as settled, the appellant must provide actual proof that the settlement agreement is invalid, we hereby clarify our holding in that case and find that an appellant may establish good cause for the untimely filing of a petition for review of an initial decision dismissing an appeal as settled by raising a nonfrivolous allegation that the settlement agreement is invalid.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sixeas v. VA</span>, DC-4324-15-0385-I-1 (NP 9/9/2016) (on a PFR from an initial decision accepting a settlement, the Board reinstated the underlying appeal when it developed during enforcement proceedings that the settlement materially violated OPM regulations governing quality step increases; the PFR was promptly filed after the compliance initial decision denied enforcement); <span class="Italic">Whitlow v. Dept. of Army</span>, CH-3330-12-0422-I-1 (NP 9/11/2013) ("Nevertheless, considering the appellant's assertion that he did not even begin working for the agency until after the initial decision became final, and the fact that, as noted above, the appellant filed his petition for review challenging the validity less than 30 days after the agency terminated him, we find that the appellant's prompt reaction to evidence tending to show that the settlement agreement may have been procured through fraud was sufficiently diligent to show good cause for his delay in filing, <span class="Italic">see, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 591 F.3d 1358, 1362-63 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <span class="Italic">Armstrong</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 5. Therefore, the appellant established good cause to waive the time limit for filing his petition for review.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant may believe that a settlement was entered under mental disability, but if the PFR challenging the validity of the settlement is late it will not be excused unless there is a showing that the mental disability caused the delay in filing the PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cameron v.
