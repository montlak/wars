<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-111"><span class="space">a.</span> Termination by Unauthorized Official</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A challenge arose concerning the authority of an individual to terminate a probationer. The theory was that the probationer continued on in her appointment and became a tenured employee if the official who issued the termination was without authority to do so. After examining the agency delegations of authority, <span class="Italic">Vandewall v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 52 MSPR 150, 155-56 (1991), determined that more evidence was required to determine if the probationary termination was defective:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the agency may not retroactively ratify the regional manager's decision to terminate the appellant. A principal may ratify by affirmance a prior act which did not bind him but which was done, or professedly done, on his account. In such a situation, the act is given effect as if originally authorized by the principal...and is effective on the date of the original act....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, if an act depriving a person of a right must be performed before a specific time, an affirmance of the act is not effective unless it is made within that time limit.... A contrary result would deprive the appellant of her appeal rights as a non-probationary employee and would conflict with the rule that ratification may not be used to deprive a person of time-limited rights. Therefore, since the agency did not affirm the notice of termination before the end of the probationary period, we find that an effective ratification did not occur.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vandewall</span> remanded to the AJ the issue of whether a properly designated agency official authorized the appellant's termination. On return to the Board following remand, the termination was sustained, <span class="Italic">Vandewall v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 55 MSPR 561, 563-64 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Vandewall v. Department of Transportation</span>, 52 MSPR at 157, remanded the appeal to allow evidence and argument on the agency procedures used to effect the appellant's separation and on the authorities of those involved in the action. Specifically, the <span class="Italic">Vandewall</span> decision stated that remand was necessary to determine "whether the deciding official, Michael Goldstein, a Regional Manager, had the authority to discharge the appellant." 52 MSPR at 155. The appellant contends that the issue of approval was beyond the scope of the remand, and that, once the agency conceded that the deciding official who signed the terminating letter did not have the authority to take all personnel actions, the Board's inquiry on remand was determined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we find that the administrative judge correctly addressed the issue of "approval," as the issue was contemplated by our remand decision. As we specifically stated in that decision, "a subsequent approval by the personnel office does not affect the effective date of the action taken as long as the action is requested and <span class="Italic">approved</span> by an individual with the proper authority." <span class="Italic">Vandewall v. Department of Transportation</span>, 52 MSPR 150, 155 (1991) (emphasis added). Based on this, we found, as stated above, that remand was necessary to determine "whether the deciding official, Michael Goldstein, a Regional Manager, had the <span class="Italic">authority to</span> discharge the appellant." <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (emphasis added). Further, even though we instructed the administrative judge that, if he "finds that Mr. Goldstein had the authority to take all personnel actions, his signature on the termination letter would be sufficient authorization to terminate the appellant," this instruction did not preclude the administrative judge from finding that Goldstein had the authority to terminate the appellant despite having been granted more limited authority than to take "all" personnel actions. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly found, Mr. Goldstein had the authority to terminate the appellant based on his finding that Goldstein's action had the prior approval of Mr. Robinson, an official with general termination authority. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan</span> (NTEU), 663 F.2d 239, 247 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (the power to remove is inherent in the power to appoint). We find the following principles, generally used to determine if an appointment has taken place, also to be applicable in termination situations. As recognized in NTEU, approval of the SF-52 or SF-50 is not always necessary for a personnel action to take place. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 243. Nor does its absence signal with certainty that a personnel action has not transpired. <span class="Italic">See Scott v. Department of the Navy</span>, 7 MSPB 741, 8 MSPR 282, 287 (1981). Moreover, for an appointment to be effective, the notification letter to the appointee need not be signed by an official with appointing authority, so long as it was approved by such an official before it was sent. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 246 n.9. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687, 693 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (NTEU is not inconsistent with cases requiring a formal writing for appointment because, although no SF-50 or SF-52 was used there, an unequivocal selection letter was sent with knowledge of official appointing authority).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, an unequivocal termination letter was issued to the appellant on October 6, 1989, with the knowledge and approval of an official with termination authority. Applying the above-stated principles, we find that, in this instance, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant's termination was effected on October 6, 1989. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's termination occurred during her probationary period, and thus that the Board has no jurisdiction over her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the administrative judge allowed evidence on whether the agency "affirmed" the notice of termination prior to the end of the appellant's probationary period, we find that this review was not clearly within the scope of the remand order. Nevertheless, this error is non-prejudicial, as only the issue of approval, which was correctly addressed by the administrative judge, is determinative in this case....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Vandewall v. Dept. of Transp.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3099):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may terminate a probationary employee by providing her with a written explanation of the reason for the separation and the effective date of the action. 5 CFR 315.804 (1993). The only issue in this appeal is whether the termination letter issued to Ms. Vandewall was defective because the official with the authority to terminate Ms. Vandewall did not sign the letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1981, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that selection letters written by officials lacking appointment authority were valid so long as the appointing official had exercised her discretion by approving the issuance of each selecting letter. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan</span>, 663 F.2d 239, 246 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1981) <span class="Italic">(NTEU)</span>. This court approvingly referred to this rationale in <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687 (Fed. Cir. 1986), noting that <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> is not inconsistent with cases requiring a formal writing for appointment when the selectees received an unequivocal selection letter sent with the knowledge of an official having appointive authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 693. We fail to find a viable reason to distinguish between the procedural requirements necessary to issue an effective letter offering a person employment with the federal government and those necessary to issue a letter effectively removing a probationary employee from such employment. The record in this appeal contains substantial evidence that Mr. Robinson was an official with authority to remove employees and that he drafted and approved the issuance of the October 6, 1989, letter given to Ms. Vandewall terminating her employment. In so doing, Mr. Robinson exercised the agency's discretion to remove Ms. Vandewall and rendered effective the October 6, 1989 termination letter signed by Mr. Goldstein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, even if we were to hold that an approving official must sign and issue a termination notice to a probationary employee, we would hold Ms. Vandewall's letter effective because ministerial functions not entailing the exercise of discretion may be delegated from one official to another. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement (Second) of Agency 78 (1958). Here, Mr. Goldstein's signature was a ministerial act executed after Mr. Robinson exercised his termination authority by drafting Ms. Vandewall's termination letter and approving its issuance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons we agree that the agency terminated Ms. Vandewall's employment during her probationary period and we affirm the Board's dismissal of her appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Collins v. MSPB</span>, 978 F.2d 675 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (limiting <span class="Italic">Vandewall</span> to an examination of whether, when the SF-50 documenting the termination was signed, an earlier written decision by an agency official to terminate the employee was invalid for lack of authority of that official).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hardy v. MSPB</span>, 13 F.3d 1571, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1994), considered and sustained the authority of an individual to demote a supervisory probationer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if his probationary period ended at 5:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on May 4, Hardy argues that his removal was not effective until after that time and date. He points to two factors in support--that his Notification of Personnel Action, Standard Form (SF) 50, was not signed by the personnel officer until June 4, 1992, and that he continued to be paid at the rate of the chief position for a period of time after May 4. Neither of these arguments carries.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To remove a probationary employee from an initial supervisory position, an agency official with the proper authority must notify the employee in writing that he or she is being demoted from a supervisory position for reasons of supervisory performance. 5 CFR 315.907(c) (1993). Hardy's notice of termination was signed by McKinley on May 4, 1992, and informed him that he would be demoted as of 4:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> that day for reasons of supervisory performance. Hardy contends that this did not become effective until it was "ratified" by the SF-50, which was signed by the personnel officer and approved on June 4. Because McKinley had the authority to remove Hardy, however, the SF-50 was not required to render the removal effective.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_168"></span>Authority to demote a probationary supervisory employee was delegated by the agency to that employee's immediate supervisor with concurrence by the next highest official in the organizational structure. Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) Directive No. 64-00.A, &#x00A7; 7.d, (February 18, 1981); FPM Ch. 315 &#x00A7; 9-6(c) (1993). McKinley was Hardy's immediate supervisor and the removal letter stated that the Deputy Director, FLETC, concurred in the action. By this writing, the agency, through McKinley, its authorized official, did all it had to do to remove Hardy effective May 4, 1992, at 4:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> No provision of the relevant statutes or regulations required the issuance of an SF-50 to render the removal effective. The ensuing SF-50 added nothing; it is merely an administrative record of the accomplished action. <span class="Italic">See NTEU v. Reagan</span>, 663 F.2d 239, 243 (D.C. Cir. 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That Hardy continued to be paid at the higher salary is irrelevant. In any large organization, a personnel action triggers many administrative chores, ranging from processing the paperwork to alter an employee's salary, to making appropriate changes to a phone list. These chores likely involve many people and administrative levels. It defies common sense to expect that all such steps will be carried out simultaneously with the personnel action. As with the SF-50, the relevant question is whether the agency has taken all steps required by law to complete a personnel action, not whether every subsequent administrative detail has been fulfilled.</p>
