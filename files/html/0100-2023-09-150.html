<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-148"><span class="space">b.</span> Pending Criminal Proceeding; Indefinite Suspension</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The DWOP should conform with other Board policies, e.g., the policy that the Board will continue cases pending the outcome of criminal proceedings. Chapter 4, section 10 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> provides guidance concerning DWOPs entered pending criminal proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">b. <span class="Italic">Pending Criminal Prosecution</span>. The processing of an appeal is not automatically terminated (and is never suspended indefinitely) because the appellant is involved in a criminal prosecution. However, such appeals may be dismissed without prejudice pending resolution of the criminal matter under the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;At the request of the prosecuting authority or when it appears that going forward with the appeal would hinder the prosecution;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;At the request of the appellant or the agency when the trial verdict could have a material effect on the appeal;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;When the appellant reasonably asserts that the defense in the criminal action could be jeopardized by the Board proceeding;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;When relevant information concerning the appeal is not available or cannot be obtained because of the pending prosecution; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;For other sufficient reasons, such as conserving Board resources (e.g., when the parties agree to be bound by the results of a court case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Defoggi v. DHHS,</span> DC-0752-14-0307-I-3 (NP 6/23/2015) ("incarceration may represent good cause for dismissing an appeal without prejudice--i.e., for allowing an appellant to pursue his appeal at a later time, in this case following the exhaustion of his criminal appeals.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ should ensure that it is clear when the appellant should refile if a case is dismissed without prejudice pending disposition of criminal proceedings. In <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 89 MSPR 402, 405-07 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2001), the AJ determined the appeal was untimely when it was refiled after the appellant completed an accelerated rehabilitative disposition program. The Board disagreed. It was the completion, not the initiation, of the rehabilitation program that constituted disposition of the charges. In <span class="Italic">Medina v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 194 (1995), an AJ approved a DWOP to refile within 45 days after a trial court decision in a criminal case, or if the decision was not forthcoming within six months, to refile within 20 days after the expiration of six months from the initial decision. The appellant apparently refiled after he thought the criminal investigation was completed, well after the six months allowed by the MSPB AJ's order. The Board affirmed the AJ's ruling rejecting the appeal as untimely. The result, however, was a poor one. The better approach was suggested by Chairman Erdreich's dissent in <span class="Italic">Medina</span>, 66 MSPR at 199:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I respectfully dissent. The Board's policy is to grant a continuance or allow withdrawal of an appeal if the appellant is in the process of being criminally prosecuted for the misconduct that underlies the agency's action that is on appeal. Therefore, once an appellant establishes that he is the target of criminal proceedings, the Board's policy takes effect and the proceedings are stayed in some fashion until the criminal matter is resolved. In such situations, it is redundant and unnecessary for the appellant to continue to have to prove to the Board the continuing nature of those proceedings so long as the appellant can show the time the proceedings terminated in relationship to his eventual refiling of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted by both parties in the joint motion for a dismissal without prejudice, the Board's policy of staying its proceedings in these situations is intended to be for the benefit of the appellant. If Mr. Medina continues to be the target of an on-going criminal investigation, then he still needs the benefit of our policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's order that Mr. Medina refile within six months was unnecessary and should not be a bar to a later refiling if it is true that the criminal proceedings involving Mr. Medina continued until his May refiling. Since the record is incomplete as to whether there actually was an on-going criminal proceeding involving Mr. Medina at the time he refiled his petition, I would remand this case to allow him to submit proof as to this issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Staples v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 36, 39 (1995) (discussing an untimely refiling as a result of the failure to follow provisions of the dismissal order concerning the processing of a related criminal proceeding).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Lack of clarity concerning the refiling date for an appeal on DWOP pending the disposition of criminal proceedings led the Board to reinstate the appeal in <span class="Italic">Sherman v. USPS</span>, 118 MSPR 265, 267-28 &#x00B6; 4-6, 13, 2012 MSPB 78 (2012), providing some guidance as to what constitutes disposition of a criminal proceeding, but emphasizing the need for precision in orders establishing refiling dates:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge directed the appellant to refile his appeal "within 30 days of a disposition of the criminal matter (by acquittal, guilty plea, guilty verdict, plea bargain, diversion program, etc.)[3] or under no circumstances later than <span class="Italic">January 4, 2010</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2 (emphasis in original) (footnote added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that, under Board precedent, some of the actions the administrative judge cited in her October 21, 2009 initial decision do not constitute a "disposition of the criminal matter" so as to trigger a refiling deadline. For example, the Board has held that a guilty plea is not a conviction or judgment that signals the disposition of a criminal charge. <span class="Italic">See Nelson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 644, &#x00B6; 6 (2010) <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">sub nom. Nelson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 414 Fed. Appx. 292 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">see also Taylor v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 402, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2001) (finding that the appellant's entry into a pre-trial probationary program did not constitute the "disposition of criminal charges" for purposes of determining the refiling date because the court did not enter judgment or obtain a conviction and the appellant remained subject to prosecution and sentencing subject to successfully completing the program).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In the fourth initial decision, dated September 30, 2010, the administrative judge ordered the appellant to refile his appeal "<span class="Italic">within 30 days of a disposition of the criminal matter</span> or no later than <span class="Italic">March 1, 2011</span>, even if the criminal matter is unresolved."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant refiled his appeal on February 25, 2011. In his appeal, the appellant stated that the criminal matter had been heard and he was currently "in the appeal process." During a March 30, 2011 status conference, the agency's representative raised the issue of timeliness, stating that the jury in the criminal matter had issued a guilty verdict on November 5, 2010....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another factor weighing heavily in the appellant's favor is confusion surrounding the refiling deadline. In the initial decision, the administrative judge identified two possible deadlines for refiling the appeal: (1) within 30 days of the disposition of the criminal matter; or (2) March 1, 2011, even if the criminal matter was not resolved. As this case illustrates, however, the disposition of the criminal matter is not necessarily synonymous with the resolution of the criminal matter. The guilty verdict in the criminal trial constituted a disposition of the criminal matter pursuant to the definition of that term set forth in the administrative judge's October 21, 2009 initial decision. Because the appellant was appealing his conviction, however, the criminal matter had not necessarily been "resolved." In light of the wording of the refiling instructions, we understand how the appellant may have believed that, because he had appealed his conviction, the criminal matter was unresolved and, therefore, the March 1, 2011 deadline applied. Consequently, we find that the filing deadline should be waived.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appeal involving concurrent criminal proceedings is DWOP'd, it is the appellant's burden to refile within the time limit set by the AJ. If that limit is not met, the appeal will not be considered without a showing of good cause for the belated refiling. The appellant needs to understand and follow the AJ's instructions, a point made clear in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. VA</span>, 66 MSPR 610, 613-15 (1995), involving an appellant whose case was not heard because he failed to refile his appeal following the termination of judicial proceedings. Garcia was "granted leave to refile his appeal no later than twenty days after the entrance of the judgment by the relevant Court disposing of all criminal charges against the appellant." Instead, he filed it after he completed his incarceration; his appeal was untimely:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not once, but twice, the administrative judge stated in his April 8 initial decision that he was dismissing the appeal to allow for the disposition of the pending criminal charges against the appellant which arose out of the same transactions that resulted in his removal. In explaining the rationale for the dismissal, the administrative judge based his entire analysis on precedent that focused on the resolution of the pending criminal charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge relied heavily on <span class="Italic">Polcover v. Secretary of the <span id="Page_1105"></span>Treasury</span>, 477 F.2d 1223 (D.C. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 414 U.S. 1001, 94 S. Ct. 356, 38 L. Ed.2d 237 (1973), a case in which the court found that due process is not observed if an accused individual is subjected, without his consent, to an administrative hearing on a serious criminal charge that is pending against him. According to the excerpt from <span class="Italic">Polcover</span> quoted by the administrative judge, the justification for dismissing administrative proceedings pending resolution of criminal charges is to relieve the accused from "disclos[ing] his evidence long in advance of the criminal trial," thereby prejudicing his defense in that trial....&#8197;Another case from which the administrative judge quotes--<span class="Italic">Peden v. United States</span>, 512 F.2d 1099, 206 Ct. Cl. 329 (1975)--is to the same effect. The portions of <span class="Italic">Polcover</span> and <span class="Italic">Peden</span> quoted in the initial decision do not in any way indicate that an administrative proceeding should be suspended pending a parole decision or the release of an appellant from prison.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear from the April 8, 1993, initial decision that the administrative judge dismissed the appeal pending entrance of the judgment by the relevant court disposing of the pending criminal charges against the appellant; the administrative judge did not dismiss the appeal pending a decision by a parole board in the event of a conviction and sentencing. This conclusion is further supported by the case progress notes of the appellant's representative for March 23, 1993, which mention an alleged reference by the administrative judge to the "resol[ution of the appellant's] situation (legal criminal charges)." Such a reference suggests that the administrative judge was contemplating a refiling date based on the appellant's conviction or sentencing, rather than one based on release from prison, since it is conviction and sentencing that ordinarily resolve criminal charges even though action by a parole board may be needed to determine the length of time the individual actually remains incarcerated. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Santiago Soto</span>, 825 F.2d 616, 619-20 (1st Cir. 1987) (in a case arising in Puerto Rico, the court stated that it is the entry of judgment and the sentence that carry with them an "expectation of finality" as to the criminal charges).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not dispute that a "Judgement" was rendered against him on April 2, 1993, when the relevant court sentenced him to five years in prison for attempted robbery, concurrent with a three-year term of imprisonment for forgery of documents, a three-year term of imprisonment for possession and conveyance of forged documents, and a six-month term of imprisonment for unlawful appropriation. Once the April 2, 1993, judgment was rendered, the reason set forth in the initial decision for suspending the Board proceedings ceased to exist, and the twenty-day time period for refiling commenced. The appellant, however, delayed in refiling his appeal until after he was released from prison.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent notes that the April 8, 1993, initial decision does not mention incarceration, even though the administrative judge granted the parties' motion to dismiss the appeal based on the appellant's incarceration. As discussed above, however, even a quick reading of the initial decision should have made the appellant or his representative aware of the difference between the deadline apparently requested in the motion and the one ultimately set by the administrative judge. Thus, the appellant failed to exercise due diligence or ordinary prudence under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Turner v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 59 MSPR 37, 38-39 (1993) (the appellant's failure to follow the clear directions in the initial decision constituted a failure to exercise due diligence or ordinary prudence); <span class="Italic">see also Kolb v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 100, 103 (1990) (the appellant, who ignored or overlooked the notice of the filing deadline, did not act prudently or diligently in pursuing his appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In analyzing whether the appellant has established good cause for waiver of the filing deadline, the dissent declares that the agency has made no showing of substantial prejudice flowing from the refiling of the appeal after the appellant's release from prison. An agency's failure to show that it was prejudiced by an appellant's filing delay is irrelevant to a good-cause determination. Rather, only after an appellant has shown good cause for an untimely filing is the issue of prejudice to the agency relevant....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an appeal was DWOP'd pending completion of a criminal investigation, and the appellant had 20 days to refile after an unequivocal statement concerning an intent not to prosecute, delay of just a few days beyond the period for refiling caused the Board to reject the appeal. <span class="Italic">Littleton v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3213).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ should not dismiss without prejudice an appeal from an indefinite suspension pending resolution of criminal proceedings, <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 362, 362-64 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency indefinitely suspended the appellant from his Tax Examining Clerk position based upon his Federal criminal indictment for unlawfully disclosing tax return information. Before filing his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appeal of this action, the appellant was incarcerated for evaluation of his mental competency and for threatening a public official. Because the appellant refused to participate in either a hearing held at the prison in which he was confined or a telephonic hearing, the administrative judge informed him on numerous occasions that it would be in his best interests to request a dismissal without prejudice pending resolution of the criminal charges against him. The appellant did not elect this course of action, however, and his relocation within the Federal prison system rendered him temporarily inaccessible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these circumstances, the administrative judge issued an initial decision that dismissed the appellant's appeal without prejudice, finding as follows: (1) It is appropriate to suspend administrative proceedings pending resolution of concurrent criminal proceedings; and (2) the appellant is unable to attend or otherwise participate in a hearing because of his incarceration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review and related documents, the appellant explains the problems he has had in pursuing his appeal while incarcerated, and states that he does not want his appeal dismissed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing the instant appeal without prejudice, the administrative judge relied upon the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Wallington v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Treasury,</span> 42 MSPR 462, 464-65 (1989). <span class="Italic">Wallington</span> is distinguishable from the present indefinite suspension appeal, however, because it pertains to a removal action. In fact, the <span class="Italic">Wallington</span> decision relies upon the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Green</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 16 MSPR 203, 205 (1983), where the Board specifically noted the distinction between removal actions and indefinite suspensions, where concurrent criminal proceedings exist. Citing <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 10 MSPB 568, 12 MSPR 12 (1982), <span class="Italic">rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Justice,</span> 715 F.2d 662 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the Board stated that indefinite suspensions based upon reasonable cause to believe the employee is guilty of a crime, and pending examination into criminal charges, have been approved by courts because of the dangers of subjecting an employee to an administrative hearing on the merits of alleged criminal misconduct while criminal charges are pending.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Brown,</span> the court stated that the interests of both the employee and the public are served by allowing a suspension based upon the fact of a criminal indictment. 715 F.2d at 668.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge therefore erred in dismissing the appeal on this basis, and we find that a remand for a determination on the merits of the agency action is required. On remand, the administrative judge should again explore the possibility of conducting a hearing, including informing the appellant of the various ways that hearings can be adjusted to accommodate the parties. <span class="Italic">See Oribio</span> <span class="Italic">v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 47 MSPR 588, 591-92 (1991). The administrative judge should also inform the appellant that unreasonable objection to the various ways the Board can accommodate a hearing request may be deemed an implied waiver of the appellant's right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Sincero v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management,</span> 41 MSPR 239, 243 (1989). Further, depending upon the appellant's circumstances at the time the administrative judge receives this case on remand, the administrative judge may also consider continuing the case in lieu of dismissal<span class="Italic">. See Thomas v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 51 MSPR 218 (1991).</p>
