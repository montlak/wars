<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-63"><span class="space">1.</span> Supporting Records; Mitigation Analysis; Comparable Offenses; Privacy Concerns</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although there is some change at the MSPB, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. VA</span>, 113 MSPR 657, 660-66 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-18, 2010 MSPB 98 (2010), and <span class="Italic">Villada v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 232, 2010 MSPB 232 (2010), traditionally the MSPB and EEOC define comparable offenses so narrowly, for purposes of a disciplinary or disparate treatment analysis, that an appellant or complainant will often have a small universe of offenses and penalties to compare with his own. Arbitrators have a more expansive view of the evidence they consider as to comparable discipline, and FLRA does not limit information requests by unions to information that could be obtained in MSPB or EEOC discovery, <span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 171</span>, 55 FLRA 1250, 1253 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Evidentiary Standards of the MSPB and EEOC Are Not Dispositive of "Necessity" Under Section 7114(b)(4)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We first reject Respondents' reliance on the precedent of the MSPB and the EEOC to support their contention that regionwide and nationwide comparative data are not necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. The Authority has previously addressed the relevancy of MSPB evidentiary standards to determinations concerning "necessity" under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, most recently in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Austin District Office, Austin, Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 1166, 1179-80 (1996). There the Authority held that rules of other forums on the admissibility of evidence do not govern the "necessity" of information under the Statute. In that regard, the Authority has held that arbitrators are not obliged to follow MSPB practices and procedures.[4] <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Phoenix District and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 33</span>, 43 FLRA 686, 689-90 (1991). Indeed, as discussed below, in a previous arbitration between the Bureau and the Council, evidence of disciplinary action taken at an institution other than the one imposing discipline was admitted into evidence by the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> subsection 2.b., below.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Although not specifically addressed in previous Authority decisions, the same reasoning responds to the Respondent's argument concerning the applicability of EEOC precedent. EEOC hearings, like those before the MSPB, typically involve individual employee rights and do not implicate nationwide collective bargaining provisions and concerns like those at issue here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we decline, in this circumstance, to apply the evidentiary standards of the MSPB and EEOC when determining whether information is necessary under section 7114(b)(4)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">IRS, Austin Dist. Office and NTEU Chap. 52</span>, 51 FLRA 1166, 1177-1181 (1996), made plain that MSPB law governing information disclosure would not control FLRA's determination of whether information was necessary, that is, supported by a particularized need, for a union seeking to analyze an agency's treatment of employees involved in comparable offenses in a disciplinary case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The framework for deciding whether information is necessary under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute was established in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and Internal Revenue Service, Kansas City Service Center, Kansas City, Missouri</span>, 50 FLRA 661 (1995) (Member Talkin concurring) <span class="Italic">(IRS, Kansas City</span>). The Authority held that a union requesting information under that section must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs that information, including the uses to which the information will be put, and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute. The Authority also stated that a union's need will not be satisfied merely by showing that requested information is or would be relevant or useful, but that the union must demonstrate that the information is "'required in order for the union adequately to represent its members.'" 50 FLRA at 670 (quoting <span class="Italic">Department of Justice </span>v. <span class="Italic">FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d 285, 290 (5th Cir. 1993)). The union's responsibility for articulating and explaining its interests extends to more than a conclusory or bare assertion; among other things, the request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether the information must be disclosed under the Statute. As for the agency's responsibilities, the Authority stated that when it denies an information request, the agency must assert and establish any countervailing anti-disclosure interests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the parties are unable to agree on whether, or to what extent, requested information must be provided, we will find an unfair labor practice if a union has established a particularized need for the information and either: (1) the agency has not established a countervailing interest; or (2) the agency has established such an interest but it does not outweigh the union's demonstration of particularized need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the analytical framework of <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, we find that the Union has established a particularized need for the requested information. The Union has explained why it needs the information (to ascertain whether there was disparate treatment of an employee), the uses to which the information will be put (to determine the appropriateness of the proposed penalty); and the connection between the uses and the Union's representational responsibilities under the Statute (to represent an employee against whom an adverse action was proposed). Thus, the Union has established that the information is required in order for it to represent its members adequately.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so finding, we have considered the Respondent's claims that the information in this case is not needed by the Union and that the Judge made various factual errors in finding that the information is necessary. First, we reject the Respondent's claim that, because information on bargaining unit employees was already furnished to the Union under the parties' agreement, the Respondent should not be required to furnish the information again. The Respondent did not except to the Judge's finding that there was no waiver, under the parties' agreement, of the Union's right to receive the information under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. Further, the Respondent has not established that the Judge's findings with respect to the Union's difficulty in obtaining information from other sources--namely, NTEU chapters nationwide--was in error.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, we disagree that the Judge erred in finding that the Union requested the information for use in "pending" grievances. The Judge stated that, although no grievances had been filed at the time of the information requests, "in both cases the potential for such a filing was present." Thus, contrary to the Respondent's assertion, the Judge found that the Union needed the information for "potential" grievances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the Respondent maintains that the Judge's finding that the information was more than useful conflicts with Union testimony, which, in the Respondent's view, suggests that even the Union did not consider all the information it requested to be necessary. We reject the argument. As we found above, the Union has established that the information is necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fourth, we reject the Respondent's contention that the Union's request for information involving claimed falsifications of vouchers was overly broad in that the request covered all falsification cases. Smith was charged with a violation of a standard of conduct that appears in the chapter entitled "Rules Concerning Employee Conduct" and addresses the intentional making of "false or misleading verbal or written statements in matters of official interest." Standard of Conduct 214.4. The Union explained that it requested the information involving employees who were alleged to have violated that standard of conduct because the standard applies to all IRS employees, regardless of unit status. The Union also explained that it had not received any information concerning non-unit employees and, further, that it had not received any information with respect to unit employees that addressed the same or similar alleged misconduct. Because the information already provided to the Union did not address the type of infraction that Smith was accused <span id="Page_317"></span>of committing, the Union's ability to ascertain whether Smith had been treated in a disparate manner and to assess the appropriateness of the proposed penalty would be seriously impaired if the Union could not examine the information it requested. Accordingly, we find that the Union has established a sufficient reason for seeking information relating to all claimed violations of Standard of Conduct 214.4. We also find that this situation is distinguishable from that presented in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Washington</span>, <span class="Italic">D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 462 (1995), in which a union requested name-identified disciplinary and suspension records covering a 5-year period. In that case, we found that the union's request was based on its view that the agency maintained information for that length of time. We concluded that the availability of information did not establish its necessity and that the union had not articulated or established with the requisite specificity that it needed information covering that extended period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fifth, we reject the Respondent's claim that information pertaining to employees outside the Austin District cannot be necessary under the Statute because it is not relevant under MSPB law and not discoverable under MSPB rules. We find, contrary to the Respondent's assertion, that judicial decisions imposing a particularized need standard on information requests under the Statute do not warrant application of MSPB law and rules in this case. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Phoenix District and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 33</span>, 43 FLRA 686, 689-90 (1991) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>), the Authority found that arguments regarding the admissibility of information as evidence in other proceedings do not relieve an agency of its obligation to furnish information under the Statute. Therefore, MSPB's position on admissibility of evidence does not govern the necessity of the information in this case. Moreover, at the time the Union made its information request, the Union was seeking to assist employee Smith at the oral reply stage of the proposed adverse action.[14] Even assuming the admissibility of evidence before the MSPB were relevant, there was no proceeding before the MSPB when the Union sought the information. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and Internal Revenue Service, Salt Lake City, Utah</span>, 40 FLRA 303, 310-11 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14] We find no merit to the Respondent's contention that the information with respect to the Smith case is no longer needed as the MSPB has issued a decision on his appeal. Whether a respondent has committed a violation of the Statute by unlawfully refusing to furnish information is predicated on the respondent's obligation to furnish the information at the time of the union's request--not at some later point in time<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs</span>, 45 FLRA 1022, 1025 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find that the Respondent has not asserted any countervailing anti-disclosure interests. <span class="Italic">Cf. IRS, Kansas</span> <span class="Italic">City</span>, 50 FLRA at 672. Instead, the Respondent argues that the Authority should consider the amount of time that has elapsed since the dispute in this case arose and the Union's "diminished need, if any, for this information." These matters do not constitute countervailing anti-disclosure interests as that term has been employed by the Authority and the courts. <span class="Italic">E.g., Scott Air Force Base</span>, 51 FLRA at 684-89 (countervailing anti-disclosure interests included management's interest in confidentiality, supervisor's interest in privacy, and grievability of matter for which information was requested); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 988 F.2d 1267, 1271 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (possibility of union misuse of information). We interpret the Respondent's argument as an assertion that the information is not necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. As explained above, we have already rejected this argument.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Phoenix Dist. and NTEU, Chap. 33</span>, 43 FLRA 686, 689-90 (1991) (in disciplinary or adverse action cases handled under grievance procedures, FLRA avoids superimposing on information requests discovery limitations of MSPB procedures or case law).</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency should have honored a request made for information concerning possibly comparable discipline, when the information was to be used in an oral reply to a proposal for adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and Nat'l Border Patrol Council, AFGE</span>, 52 FLRA 1323, 1332 (1997) ("Nothing in the <span class="Italic">Scott Air Force Base</span> decision even suggests that a union is not entitled to information that is necessary to prepare for an oral reply to a proposed removal."), <span class="Italic">pet. for review denied</span>, <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 144 F.3d 90, 93 (D.C. Cir. 1998) ("representing an employee at an oral reply falls comfortably within an exclusive representative's broad section 7114(a)(1) power to 'act for...all employees in the unit'"). Under decisions predating the particularized need analysis, the type of information deemed relevant to a charge of vehicle misuse and an associated proposed 30-day suspension included files on similar adverse actions during the past three years and also investigation files compiled during the past three years involving employees who were investigated but not issued disciplinary or adverse action proposals. <span class="Italic">IRS, W. Region, San Francisco and NTEU</span>, 9 FLRA 480, 493-98 (1982) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Border Patrol, Tucson Sector and Nat'l Border Patrol Council, AFGE Local 2544</span>, 47 FLRA 684, 686-90 (1993) (ULP case directing employer to provide the proposal as well as decision letter concerning unit employee whose case the union sought to compare to grievant's in arbitration), <span class="Italic">reconsideration granted and remanded for further processing</span>, 48 FLRA 391 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and Nat'l Border Patrol Council, AFGE</span>, 51 FLRA 1467, 1477-78 (1996), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 52 FLRA 1323 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 144 F.3d 90 (D.C. Cir. 1998), <span class="Italic">post</span>, also concluded that MSPB decisions do not govern information requests for materials to be used in defending unit employees facing disciplinary charges. Nor are information requests contingent on the union's duty of fair representation, i.e., the scope of the union's mandatory representational responsibilities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority has consistently held that MSPB rules concerning the admissibility of evidence do not govern determinations of necessity under section 7114(b)(4). <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Austin District Office, Austin</span>, <span class="Italic">Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 1166, 1179-80 (1996) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Austin District</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and Internal Revenue Service, Salt Lake City, Utah</span>, 40 FLRA 303, 310-11 (1991). Moreover, the Union requested the disciplinary and adverse action letters to prepare for an oral reply to Wood's proposed adverse action. Even assuming the relevance in some circumstances of MSPB rules governing the admissibility of evidence, such rules are not appropriate to consider here because there was no proceeding before the MSPB when the Union sought the information<span class="Italic">. See IRS, Austin District</span>, 51 FLRA at 1179-80. We note, in this regard, that unless a removal action is excluded from the scope of a negotiated grievance procedure, a union may elect to arbitrate a removal in lieu of appealing the removal to the MSPB. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1). If arbitration is elected, an arbitrator is not bound by MSPB rules concerning the admissibility of evidence. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Phoenix</span> <span class="Italic">District and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 33</span>, 43 FLRA 686, 689-90 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Local 2578, American Federation of Government Employees v. GSA</span>, 711 F.2d 261, 264 (D.C. Cir. 1983) ("nothing in the Civil Service Reform Act requires that arbitration and MSPB actions always adhere to the same standards and procedures, or produce the same results in like cases").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's second argument blurs the distinction between a union's duty of fair representation and a union's rights as an exclusive representative. In this regard, the Respondent correctly asserts that, under the Statute, an exclusive representative is not required to represent unit employees in an oral reply to a proposed adverse action<span class="Italic">. Cf. National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 800 F.2d 1165, 1168 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (union not required to represent unit employee in appeal to the MSPB). However, that a union lawfully could refuse representation does not mean that, if the union undertakes representation, the union is not acting as the exclusive representative and, as such, may not avail itself of its rights under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Antilles Consolidated Education Association, (OEA/NEA), San Juan, Puerto Rico</span>, 36 FLRA 776, 789-96 (1990) (union activities to administer certain insurance plans were undertaken in capacity as exclusive representative). Indeed, a union is entitled to information regarding removals of unit employees even in situations where the union does not represent those employees<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1345 v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 1360, 1364-65 (D.C. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Wood sought the Union's assistance in connection with preparing an oral reply to a proposed adverse action, and the Union agreed to provide assistance. The matter for which representation was sought was directly related to Wood's conditions of employment and, ultimately, ripened into a matter that is grievable and arbitrable. We find no basis to conclude, in these circumstances, that in undertaking representation of Wood, the Union was not permitted to invoke its rights under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find the Respondent's second argument unpersuasive because it draws a false line between preparation for an oral reply and preparation for grievance proceedings. The Respondent does not dispute that its action could be (and was) challenged in a grievance on the ground of alleged disparate treatment. No authority is provided, or apparent, the argument that information establishing such disparate treatment would not also be relevant in an oral reply....</p>
<p class="noindent">On appeal, the D.C. Circuit confirmed FLRA's analysis in the <span class="Italic">Border Patrol</span> information dispute and readily decided that a particularized need was demonstrated for mitigation information at the oral reply stage, <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 144 F.3d 90, 91-96 (D.C. Cir. 1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following an investigation into allegations of theft, falsification, and conduct unbecoming an officer, the Immigration and Naturalization Service notified employee Jason Wood of its intent to remove him from his position as a Border Patrol agent. Wood asked the National Border Patrol Council of the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, to help him prepare his response to the notice. Invoking its rights as exclusive representative under section 7114(b)(4), the Union asked the INS for the entire investigative file, all proposal and decision notices for disciplinary and/or adverse action cases similar to Wood's within INS's Northern Region in the past five years, and several other related documents. The Union said it needed the disciplinary records <span id="Page_318"></span>to "properly respond to the allegations" against Wood. Responding that the Union was entitled only to information relied upon in preparing the proposed disciplinary action and that the Union's reference to section 7114(b)(4) was "not appropriate," the INS gave the Union a copy of the investigatory report, but nothing more. When the Union reiterated its request for the disciplinary records, saying that it needed them to determine whether Wood's proposed discipline was consistent with the discipline meted out to other employees for similar offenses, the INS again declined, stating that disclosure would violate the privacy rights of employees whose records were sought. The Union offered to take the records in sanitized form, but the INS still refused to release them. After Wood's oral reply, the INS reduced the proposed removal to a five-day suspension. The Union then filed a grievance and invoked arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initiating the proceedings now before us, the Union filed unfair labor practice charges against the INS. Following a hearing, the administrative law judge concluded that the disciplinary records satisfied the requirements of section 7114(b)(4)--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, they were "normally maintained," "reasonably available," "necessary," and not otherwise barred from disclosure. The Federal Labor Relations Authority agreed, finding that the Union had a "clear, articulated need" for the requested disciplinary records--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, to assist Wood in responding to the proposed removal action. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Wash., D.C., and U.S. INS, N. Region, Twin Cities, Minn., and Office of Inspector Gen., Wash., D.C., and Office of Prof'l Responsibility, Wash., D.C. ("Twin Cities I")</span>, 46 F.L.R.A. 1526, 1536 (1993). Because the INS refused to provide the requested information, the Authority ruled that the agency committed an unfair labor practice by failing to comply with section 7114(b)(4). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1536-38.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reversing and remanding, this court concluded that the Authority failed to frame its analysis in terms of the "particularized need" test of <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523 (D.C. Cir. 1992), directing the agency to "analyze anew the union's document request under the principles" of that case. <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 39 F.3d at 369-70. On remand, the Authority noted that it had since directly addressed <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span> in <span class="Italic">IRS, Washington, D.C., and IRS, Kansas City Service Center, Kansas City, Missouri</span>, 50 F.L.R.A. 661 (1995), where it held that "'a union requesting information under [section 7114(b)(4)] must establish particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which the union will put the information, and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute.'" <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, INS, N. Region, Twin Cities, Minn.</span> ("<span class="Italic">Twin Cities II</span>"), 51 F.L.R.A. 1467, 1472 (1996) (quoting <span class="Italic">INS, Kansas City</span>, 50 F.L.R.A. at 669). Applying that standard, the Authority found that the Union had met its burden of establishing particularized need for the disciplinary records. The union, the Authority pointed out, had "explicitly connected its request with the adverse action the [INS] proposed to take against Wood by stating that the requested information was needed to 'properly respond to the allegations' set forth in the notice," and asserted "that it needed the records in order to compare the discipline the [INS] had proposed for Wood with that given to other employees who had committed similar offenses<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 1473-74. The Authority also found that the INS failed to demonstrate any countervailing anti-disclosure interests and questioned whether any such interests even existed since the Union agreed to take the disciplinary records in sanitized form. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1479 n.11. Although conceding that the Union was not required to represent Wood, the Authority rejected the INS's argument that the Union had not requested the information in its capacity as "exclusive representative," as well as its argument that even if it had requested the documents in that capacity, the disciplinary records were not relevant to preparing for an oral reply because they concerned defenses that should be raised later in a grievance. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1478. For all of these reasons, the Authority again ruled that the INS committed an unfair labor practice. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1479.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of its argument that it had no duty to provide the disciplinary records, the INS claims that a union does not act in its capacity as "exclusive representative" when it represents an employee facing proposed disciplinary action because, at that stage of the disciplinary process, the employee can choose not to be represented by the union. The INS also points out that since a mere proposal to discipline an employee is not grievable, a union can decline an employee's request for representation at the oral reply stage. According to the INS, therefore, as Wood's representative of choice at the oral reply stage, the Union had not requested the records in its capacity as "exclusive representative."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although neither party addresses the appropriate standard of review, the issue in this case--whether the Union acted as "exclusive representative" under the Federal Service Labor-Management Statute--presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation subject to the familiar two-step test of <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). <span class="Italic">See Fort Stewart Schs. v. FLRA</span>, 495 U.S. 641, 644-45 (1990) (applying <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> analysis to the Authority's interpretation of the FSLMRS). If Congress has spoken directly to the "precise question at issue," we must give effect to its "unambiguously expressed intent." <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 842-43. 104 S. Ct. at 2781-82. If, however, the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, we defer to the Authority's interpretation, so long as that interpretation is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 843-44. 104 S. Ct. at 2781-83.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin with the language of the statute.&#x2003;Section 7103(a)(16) defines "exclusive representative" as any labor organization which:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;is certified as the exclusive representative of employees in an appropriate unit pursuant to section 7111 of this title; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;was recognized by an agency immediately before the effective date of this chapter as the exclusive representative of employees in an appropriate unit--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;on the basis of an election, or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;on any basis other than an election,</p>
<p class="noindent-1">and continues to be so recognized in accordance with the provisions of this chapter[.] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(16). Nothing in this definition, section 7114(b)(4), or any other part of the statute strips a union of exclusive representative status, once so designated, when it chooses to represent an employee at the oral reply stage. In fact, representing an employee at an oral reply falls comfortably within an exclusive representative's broad section 7114(a)(1) power to "act for...all employees in the unit," <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1). Applying <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>'s first step, then, we think the statute entitled the Union in this case to take advantage of section 7114(b)(4)'s informational rights when it represented Wood at his oral reply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if the statute's language were ambiguous, we would find the Authority's holding in this case to be a perfectly reasonable interpretation of the statute. <span class="Italic">See Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843-44, 104 S. Ct. at 2781-83. Once an employee asks a union for representation at the oral reply stage and the union agrees, we cannot imagine what would be gained by then denying the union the information it needs to perform its statutory duty. To be sure, exclusive representatives may decline employees' requests for representation at the oral reply stage. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1857, AFL-CIO</span>, 46 F.L.R.A. 904, 911-13 (1992). Employees may even retain non-union counsel and exclude the exclusive representative from oral reply proceedings. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Fed Correctional Inst. (Ray Brook, NY)</span>, 29 F.L.R.A. 584, 592-93 (1987). But as the Authority points out, these possibilities have nothing at all to do with the authority unions possess when they do in fact represent employees at oral replies. <span class="Italic">See Twin Cities II</span>, 51 F.L.R.A. at 1478. Indeed, even if the Union had not represented Wood at the oral reply, it could have obtained the disciplinary records by articulating a particularized need for the information in terms of fulfilling its representational duties and overseeing the administration of the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1345 v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 1360, 1364-65 (D.C. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the INS, the Authority's interpretation prejudices employees who choose non-union representation. That may well be true, but we think the imbalance between union and non-union representation is not necessarily suspect. Employees might choose union representation over outside counsel at oral replies precisely because unions can obtain information under section 7114(b)(4). This result makes sense in view of the unique and central role unions play in ensuring an efficient and peaceful federal workforce. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1) (recognizing that the right of workers to select "labor organizations of their own choosing...contributes to the effective conduct of public business, and...facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes"). Moreover, as exclusive representatives charged with acting for unit members and negotiating collective bargaining agreements, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1), unions seek to vindicate not just employees' individual interests at the oral reply, as the INS contends, but also the bargaining unit's broader interest in the proper administration of the collective bargaining agreement. By obtaining related disciplinary records at the oral reply stage, for example, the union might convince the agency to reduce the proposed punishment, thus possibly avoiding a grievance and promoting the bargaining unit's interest in expeditious resolution of labor disputes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 104 F.3d 1396 (D.C. Cir. 1997), nor <span class="Italic">Department of Defense Office of Dependent Schools</span>, 36 F.L.R.A. 871 (1990), requires a different result. In <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, we considered whether a disciplinary letter that a union requested from the Air Force base involved a grievable <span class="Italic">subject</span> within the scope of the collective bargaining agreement, not whether the union could actually bring a grievance at that point in the proceedings. Here, the INS makes no claim that the Union's need for the disciplinary records--to make a disparate treatment argument--fell outside the scope of the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Office of Dependent Schools</span> is equally irrelevant. There, the Authority concluded that the employer's refusal to disclose the addresses of tentatively hired teachers did not violate section 7114(b)(4), stating: "Based on the remoteness and uncertainty of the recruits' prospective employment in the bargaining unit, we find that the record does not support a finding that the Union needed the recruits' home addresses in order to carry out its representational responsibilities." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 874. This "remoteness" rationale has no applicability here. There is no question that Wood was a member <span id="Page_319"></span>of the bargaining unit, that the agency notified him of his proposed removal, that the information requested related to the terms of his employment, and that the Union agreed to serve as his representative. The Union's need for the documents was therefore imminent and definite, not "remote[,] and uncertain[,]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having determined that the Union may invoke its informational rights under section 7114(b)(4), we turn to the second issue in this case: Were the disciplinary records the Union requested "necessary" at the oral reply stage? In <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, we distinguished section 7114(b)(4)'s "necessary" standard from the concept of "relevance," holding that the section entitles unions to "something less than what full 'discovery' might require." 952 F.2d at 531.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The INS argues that the Authority failed to apply <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>'s "necessity" standard, claiming that it merely found that the documents were relevant at the oral reply stage. We read the Authority's decision differently. Clearly focusing on "necessity" rather than relevance, the Authority found that after originally requesting the documents "to 'properly respond to the allegations' set forth in the notice," <span class="Italic">Twin Cities II</span>, 51 F.L.R.A. at 1473 (quoting <span class="Italic">Twin Cities I</span>, 46 F.L.R.A. at 1556), the Union later said it needed the documents "in order to compare the discipline the [INS] had proposed for Wood with that given to other employees who had committed similar offenses," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1473-74. Further focusing on "necessity," the Authority credited the Union's statement that it requested records spanning five years and covering an entire geographic region because the number of disciplinary actions was small. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1474. To be sure, the Authority said that "information establishing...disparate treatment [is] relevant in an oral reply." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1478. But this statement came in response to the INS's assertion that the disciplinary records were irrelevant at the oral reply stage and only after the Authority had already concluded that "the Union satisfied its burden to articulate and establish a particularized need for the requested disciplinary and adverse action letters." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1476.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Claiming that information regarding disparate treatment is unnecessary until the grievance stage, the INS argues that the only information the Union needed to prepare for Wood's oral reply was the investigatory report upon which the INS had based its proposed discipline and which it had already given the Union. The Authority labeled this effort to distinguish between preparing for an oral reply and preparing for grievance proceedings a "false line<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 1478. We agree. The oral reply is not limited to whether the employee committed the alleged offense. As this case demonstrates--after Wood's presentation, the agency reduced the proposed termination to a five-day suspension--the oral reply also encompasses the appropriate punishment. In fact, for employees who admit they committed the alleged offense but believe the proposed punishment does not fit the crime, evidence of disparate treatment constitutes their only available defense. Information about how an agency disciplines other employees is thus "necessary" at the oral reply stage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The INS points to an Authority regulation stating that "[t]he notice of [proposed action] shall inform the employee of his or her right to review the material which is relied on to support the reasons for action given in the notice." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b)(1) (1997). Nothing in that regulation, however, supports the INS's argument that employees have no need for disparate treatment information at the oral reply stage. The regulation says no more than that employees have a right to review information forming the basis of proposed charges and discipline, information that the parties agree is "necessary" for oral reply purposes. As counsel for the Authority explained at oral argument, the regulation places a floor under, not a ceiling on, the types of information that might be necessary to respond to proposed disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, by arguing that the Authority found that the Union satisfied the particularized need test not because it needed the disciplinary records at the oral reply stage, but because it might need the records once the agency disciplined Wood, the INS misconstrues the Authority's decision. In saying that "[t]he matter for which representation was sought was directly related to Wood's conditions of employment and, ultimately, ripened into a matter that is grievable and arbitrable," <span class="Italic">Twin Cities II</span>, 51 F.L.R.A. at 1478, the Authority was merely explaining the Union's "exclusive representative" capacity, not determining that the documents were unnecessary until the grievance stage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asks us to sanction the INS for pursuing this appeal because in its petition for reconsideration before the Authority, the agency revealed that it no longer had the requested documents. Even though the Authority presumed the INS had destroyed some of the documents, <span class="Italic">Twin Cities III</span>, 52 F.L.R.A. at 1337, we decline the Union's request. For one thing, whether the agency committed an unfair labor practice by refusing the Union's request for the disciplinary records--the only issue before us--is unaffected by whether the agency might have later destroyed them. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1941, AFL-CIO v. FLRA</span>, 837 F.2d 495, 497 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (unfair labor practice not mooted by employee's death); <span class="Italic">see also Department of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d 285, 289 (5th Cir. 1993) ("[Unfair labor practice] cases...generally do not become moot when the individual parties resolve the specific matter that gave rise to the dispute because the 'Board is entitled to have the resumption of the unfair practice barred by an enforcement decree.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Raytheon Co.</span>, 398 U.S. 25, 27 (1970)). Moreover, recognizing its power to punish the INS for destroying documents, the Authority left the issue for the compliance stage, saying "the assertion concerning destruction of the documents is unsubstantiated and unclear." <span class="Italic">Twin Cities III</span>, 52 F.L.R.A. at 1337. Under these circumstances, we think consideration of sanctions is premature.</p>
<p class="noindent">Privacy concerns--a topic discussed later in this section--barred release to a union of unredacted information about investigations involving other employees based on allegations of patient abuse. Although the information was pertinent to a defense of disparity in penalties, the information could have been provided in a useful form without employees' names. As a result, the information containing names of employees was not "necessary," <span class="Italic">VAMC, Dallas and AFGE Local 2437</span>, 51 FLRA 945, 954-59 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, issued after the Judge's decision, we set forth the analytic approach we will follow in assessing an agency's claims that disclosure of information requested under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of FOIA Exemption 6 and, therefore, is prohibited by the Privacy Act. In <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, which involved the disclosure of performance appraisals of bargaining unit employees, we stated that an agency asserting that the Privacy Act bars disclosure is required to demonstrate: (1) that the information sought is contained in a "system of records" within the meaning of the Privacy Act, as discussed above; (2) that disclosure would implicate employee privacy interests; and (3) the nature and significance of those privacy interests. If the agency makes the requisite showings, the burden shifts to the General Counsel to: (1) identify a public interest cognizable under the FOIA; and (2) demonstrate how disclosure of the requested information will serve that public interest. Although the parties bear these burdens, we will, where appropriate, consider matters that are otherwise apparent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We held in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, for reasons more fully explained there, that the only relevant public interest to be considered in this context is the extent to which the requested disclosure would shed light on the agency's performance of its statutory duties, or otherwise inform citizens concerning the activities of the Government. More particularly, we held that the public interest in collective bargaining that is embodied in the Statute, or specific to a union in fulfilling its obligations under the Statute and in expediting grievances, will no longer be considered in our analysis under Exemption 6 of the FOIA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the relevant interests are established, we will balance the privacy interests of employees against the public interest in disclosure. Where this balance leads us to conclude that the privacy interests are greater than the public interest at stake, we will find that the requested disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under Exemption 6 and, therefore, that disclosure is prohibited by law under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute; accordingly, the agency is not required to furnish the information, unless disclosure is permitted under another exception to the Privacy Act. In contrast, where the balance tips the other way, because the public interest is greater than the privacy interests, we will conclude that disclosure would be required under the FOIA and, therefore, is not prohibited by the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that both the Respondent and the General Counsel have met their burdens of demonstrating, respectively, that disclosure of information pertaining to administratively investigated cases of patient abuse would implicate employee privacy interests and that disclosure of the information would serve a public interest cognizable under the FOIA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the privacy interests, the Authority has previously found that employees have significant privacy interests in disciplinary information because the release of that information can be embarrassing and stigmatizing to the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 462, 470-71 (1995) (<span class="Italic">DOL</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice and Immigration and Naturalization Service</span>, 37 FLRA 1346, 1361-64 (1990), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, 38 FLRA 946 (1990). This finding is consistent with the conclusions reached by courts reviewing claims under Exemption 6 of the FOIA<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force v. Rose</span>, 425 U.S. 352, 377 (1976); <span class="Italic">Chamberlain v. Kurtz</span>, 589 F.2d 827, 841-42 (5th Cir. 1979), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 444 U.S. 842 (1979). Employees also have a significant privacy interest in information concerning investigations of alleged patient abuse that do not lead to disciplinary actions because such information may have an embarrassing and stigmatizing effect despite the fact that the employee is found to be innocent of the matter for which he or she is being investigated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the public interest in disclosure, we find, in agreement with the General Counsel, that the release of the requested information would shed light on whether the Respondent's operations ensure the proper care and treatment of members of the public who are patients of <span id="Page_320"></span>the medical facility. Release of the requested information would also shed light on the treatment of the Respondent's employees involved in the same or similar incidents of alleged patient abuse and, thereby, reveal the extent to which such employees receive equal and impartial treatment in accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Therefore, disclosure of the requested information would serve the public interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, there is no indication that disclosure of the requested information in a form that reveals employees' names would enhance the foregoing public interests. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, 51 FLRA at 471. <span class="Italic">See also Federal Aviation Administration</span>,<span class="Italic"> New York Tracon, Westbury, New York</span>, 51 FLRA 115, 122-23 (1995) (disclosure of EEO settlement agreement with personally identifying information did not enhance the extent to which the public interest in monitoring agency actions is served). Although disclosure of the requested information, sanitized to remove only patients' names, but not the names of employees, may well enhance the Union's ability to represent an employee in connection with a proposed suspension for verbal patient abuse, this interest is specific to the Union as the requesting party and, as such, may not be considered in balancing interests under FOIA Exemption 6<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 348 and cases cited therein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the weight of judicial and Authority precedent supports a conclusion that the public interest that would be served by disclosure of information concerning administratively investigated cases of patient abuse by the Respondent's employees in a form that includes employees' names is outweighed by the invasion of privacy that would result therefrom. Accordingly, we find that disclosure of the requested information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, within the meaning of FOIA Exemption 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained above, the information requested in this case is contained in the OPM/GOVT-1 and OPM/GOVT-3 systems of records and 32VA00, the Respondent's system of records. With respect to OPM's systems of records, OPM's routine use statements governing OPM/GOVT-1 and OPM/GOVT-3, identified as routine use "j" applicable to OPM/GOVT-1 (encompassing Official Personnel Folders), and "a" applicable to OPM/GOVT-3 (encompassing adverse action files), provide that records may be disclosed "to officials of labor organizations recognized under 5 U.S.C. chapter 71 when relevant and necessary to their duties of exclusive representation...." 57 Fed. Reg. 35698, 35706, 35712 (1992). Accordingly, to determine whether the routine use exception applies to the requested information contained in OPM/GOVT-1 and OPM/GOVT-3 systems of records, we must decide whether the requested information is "relevant and necessary" within the meaning of routine use statements "a" and "j."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM issued "guidance to agencies" for interpreting these terms in FPM Letter 711-164, which was published on September 17, 1992. When the FPM was abolished on December 31, 1993, the Letter, along with certain other parts of the FPM, was provisionally retained through December 31, 1994. For the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Little Rock</span>, <span class="Italic">Arkansas</span>, 51 FLRA 216, 223-26 (1995), we apply the FPM Letter's guidance in deciding this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FPM Letter contains two requirements that a union must satisfy in order to establish that requested information is consistent with routine uses "a" and "j": (1) the information is "relevant" to the express purpose for which it is sought, meaning that the nature of the information must bear a traceable, logical, and significant connection to the purpose to be served; and (2) the information is "necessary," meaning that there are no adequate alternative means or sources for satisfying the union's informational needs. In clarifying this second requirement, the FPM Letter explains that it is to be determined on a case-by-case basis; the union "must show that it has a particularized need for the information in a form that identifies specific individuals, and that its information needs cannot be satisfied through less intrusive means, such as by releasing records with personally-identifying information deleted."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Addressing first the standard of "relevance," and looking at the ordinary meaning of the terms "traceable," "logical," and "significant," we have examined the record to assess whether the Union has established that the requested administrative investigations, identified by employees' names, can reasonably be attributed to and are likely to influence or affect the purpose for which the records were sought. We find that employee name-identified records bear a traceable, logical, and significant connection to the purpose for which the information was sought. Furnishing the records would clearly assist the Union's stated purpose of uncovering possible disparate treatment of a unit employee. It would also enable the Union to make comparisons among employees in order to ascertain whether the Respondent administered discipline to the employee in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we are not persuaded that the record before us supports a finding that the information is "necessary," within the meaning of the FPM Letter. Although the General Counsel maintains that the Union needs the requested information to determine whether there was disparate treatment of an aggrieved employee, the General Counsel has failed to establish that this need cannot be satisfied through less intrusive means than by using name-identified records of administrative investigations of patient abuse. For example, a less intrusive means of disclosure would be to code the information as to Union membership but delete personally-identifying information about employees and patients. The FPM Letter specifically identifies release of records in this manner as a less intrusive means of disclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">No argument is offered why sanitized (with patients' and employees' names and personal identifiers deleted) and correlated records would not satisfy the Union's needs. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Union has failed to show that the information is necessary, within the meaning of routine use statements "a" and "j." Therefore, the Union has not established, as it must under FPM Letter 711-164, both the relevance and necessity of unsanitized copies of all requested administrative investigations. Consequently, the information is not disclosable in the unsanitized form sought by the Union as a routine use under section 552a(b)(3) of the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, USP Marion and AFGE Local 2343</span>, 66 FLRA 669, 673-75 (2012),
sustained the agency's refusal to disclose unsanitized information about misconduct investigations of employees other than the grievant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding that the Respondent violated the Statute when it failed to furnish the SIS, OIA, and FBI reports, the Judge assessed whether, "at or near the time of the Union's request," the Respondent had adequately met its burdens under <span class="Italic">FAA,</span> 50 FLRA at 345. He did not resolve whether the Privacy Act prohibited disclosure of the disputed reports or whether furnishing the reports was "prohibited by law" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Respondent's statements in its reply to the Union's request were adequate to require the Judge to resolve that issue. In this connection, the Authority has addressed the merits of a "prohibited by law" claim when a respondent's reply to a union summarily cited the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See IRS, Austin</span>, 51 FLRA at 1168, 1176-77; <span class="Italic">cf. U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Acad., Colo. Springs, Colo.,</span> 59 FLRA 888, 893 (2004) (then-Member Pope dissenting on another matter) (Authority addressed the merits of a "prohibited by law" claim when a respondent's reply to a union summarily cited an agency regulation). Similarly, the Authority has addressed and resolved Privacy Act allegations based on a respondent's claim in its answer to the complaint that the information "may not be available in accordance with the Privacy Act," and when "throughout the proceeding [it] invoked the Privacy Act as a basis for not disclosing the requested information in an unsanitized form."[9] <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Dallas, Tex., </span>51 FLRA 945, 952, 961 (1996) (<span class="Italic">VAMC</span>). The Authority also has addressed and resolved Privacy Act allegations based on a respondent's invoking "prior to the [j]udge's decision...Privacy Act concerns" and presenting testimony at the hearing connecting the requested information and the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See Army &#x0026; Air Force Exch. Serv., Waco Distrib. Ctr., Waco, Tex., </span>53 FLRA 749, 756-57 (1997). The <span class="Italic">FAA </span>framework does not establish the burdens that a respondent must meet in its reply to a union's information request; it is about the burdens that an agency must meet before the <span class="Italic">Authority</span>, as evidenced by the fact that it discusses shifting the burden to the GC. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 345.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;We note that, in this case, the Union did not request sanitized reports and there is no claim that, at or near the time of its request, the Union informed the Respondent that it would accept sanitized reports.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is not disputed that the Judge found that the Respondent claimed in its reply to the information request that the Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of the specified reports. In addition, unlike <span class="Italic">Fed Det. Ctr.</span>, where the respondent raised the Privacy Act for the first time in its post-hearing brief to the Judge, the Respondent referenced its reply in its answer to the complaint and invoked the Privacy Act throughout the proceedings before the Judge. The Respondent also presented testimony at the hearing invoking the Privacy Act, and the GC acknowledged and disputed the Privacy Act claim. And in its arguments and presentation of testimony, the Respondent made clear its position that the Privacy Act prohibited disclosure of the reports because disclosure would reveal the names of the correctional officers who, in addition to the grievant, were investigated for misconduct. It also is clear that, in the ULP proceedings before the Judge, the Union and the GC understood that the Respondent's position regarding the Privacy Act was based on a claim that the reports named those other employees who were investigated for misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These unexcepted facts, the record before the Authority, and the above-cited precedent support a conclusion that the Respondent adequately raised the Privacy Act and presented for decision by the Judge whether the Privacy Act prohibited disclosure of the disputed reports, with employees' names included. <span class="Italic">See AAFES, </span>53 FLRA at 757.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Judge was required to address whether the Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of the specified reports, with employees' names included. The Judge did not do so. As the record is sufficient, we resolve that issue here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_321"></span>As noted by the Judge, <span class="Italic">FAA</span> sets forth the analytical approach the Authority follows when a respondent argues that the Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of requested information because it would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of FOIA exemption 6. In particular, such respondent is required to demonstrate: (1) that the information is contained in a system of records; (2) that disclosure would implicate employee privacy interests; and (3) the nature and significance of those privacy interests. <span class="Italic">FAA, </span>50 FLRA at 345. If the respondent makes the requisite showings, then the burden shifts to the GC to: (1) identify a public interest cognizable under the FOIA; and (2) demonstrate how disclosure would serve that public interest. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>And the only public interests that the Authority considers are the extent to which disclosure would shed light on the respondent's performance of its statutory duties or would inform citizens about the activities of the Federal Government. As relevant here, the Authority does not consider the public interests in collective bargaining and in expediting grievances that are embodied in the Statute, and does not consider the public interest specific to a union in fulfilling its obligations under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 343. In this regard, Supreme Court precedent holds that all FOIA requestors have an equal right to information and that the identity of the requesting party has no bearing on the merits of the request. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">U.S. DOD v.

<p class="noindent-1">Once the relevant interests are established, the Authority balances the privacy interests of employees against the public interest in disclosure. When the privacy interests outweigh the public interest, the Authority finds that disclosure of the requested information would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under FOIA exemption 6. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 346. And unless disclosure is permitted under another exception to the Privacy Act, the Authority concludes that the Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of the information and furnishing the information is prohibited by law within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4). <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that the Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of documents relating to an administrative investigation of employees for misconduct when such disclosure would have revealed the names of the investigated employees.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">VAMC, </span>51 FLRA at 955-56. Specifically, the Authority determined that disclosure of the documents would have resulted in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of FOIA exemption 6. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Although the Authority found that the public interest would be served by disclosing the names, the Authority determined that the personal privacy interests outweighed the service to the public interest. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is not disputed that the SIS, OIA, and FBI reports would disclose the names of employees other than the grievant who were investigated for misconduct. Further, it is not disputed that the GC has not identified any cognizable public interests to be served by disclosure of these employees' names, e.g., the extent to which disclosure would shed light on the Respondent's performance of its statutory duties or would inform citizens about the activities of the Federal Government. <span class="Italic">FAA, </span>50 FLRA at 345-46. Balancing the privacy interests of the other investigated employees against the unarticulated public interest in disclosure of their names, we find that the privacy interests outweigh the public interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that disclosure of the SIS, OIA, and FBI reports, with employees' names included, would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of FOIA exemption 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the Privacy Act to prohibit disclosure of the reports, the reports must also be contained in a system of records. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 345. The Judge did not decide that issue. But the Respondent asserted to the Judge that the SIS, OIA, and FBI reports requested by the Union are contained in a system of records within the meaning of the Privacy Act. The GC did not dispute before the Judge, and does not dispute before the Authority, that the reports are contained in a system of records. Accordingly, we conclude that the requested information is contained in a system of records within the meaning of the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In accordance with these conclusions, we further conclude that the Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of the SIS, OIA, and FBI reports, with names included, and that, as a result, furnishing these reports is "prohibited by law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4). Thus, we find that the Respondent did not violate the Statute when it failed to furnish these reports. As such, it is unnecessary to resolve the Respondent's argument that &#x00A7; 552a(k)(2) and exemption 7 to FOIA support the refusal to furnish the reports, and it also is unnecessary to resolve whether &#x00A7; 2429.5 bars that argument. In addition, it is unnecessary to resolve the Respondent's claim that it did not maintain the requested FBI reports in the regular course of business and that they were not reasonably available.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, Wash., DC and Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, AFGE</span>, 39 FLRA 531, 538, 543 (1991), reiterated earlier holdings: (1) an agency is required to furnish information concerning nonunit positions when the information is necessary for the union to effectively fulfill its representational responsibilities; and (2) information is disclosable concerning discipline of other employees, including management officials and supervisors, if requested for the purpose of making comparisons in potential grievance situations. However, on review following a court remand through a memorandum opinion, FLRA concluded, on the basis of more recent decisions, that the union was not entitled to unsanitized disciplinary records. FLRA's ruling against the union was based on analysis of the Privacy Act as well as FLRA precedent requiring a demonstration of a particularized need for what FLRA apparently considered internal management guidance or recommendations encompassed by the union's request for disciplinary records, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, Wash., DC and Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, AFGE</span>, 51 FLRA 462, 464, 469-77 (1995):</p>

As we explained in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, an agency asserting that the Privacy Act bars disclosure is required to demonstrate: (1) that the requested information is contained in a "system of records," within the meaning of the Privacy Act; (2) that disclosure would implicate employee privacy interests; and (3) the nature and significance of those privacy interests. If the agency makes the requisite showings, the burden shifts to the General Counsel to: (1) identify a public interest cognizable under the FOIA; and (2) demonstrate how such disclosure will serve that public interest.

Ray</span>, 502 U.S. 164, 178 (1991) (public interest in knowing whether the agency was performing its responsibilities was "adequately served by disclosure of the redacted interview summaries" and that the "addition of the redacted identifying information would not shed any additional light on the Government's conduct of its obligation."); <span class="Italic">Chamberlain</span>, 589 F.2d at 842 (disclosure of redacted disciplinary reports served the public interest in understanding the conduct of the agency's operations and that "knowing the identities of the persons discussed in the reports add[ed] nothing to the equation."); <span class="Italic">Cotton v. Adams</span>, 798 F. Supp. 22, 27-28 (D.D.C. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Cotton</span>) (release of an Inspector General's investigative report concerning the conduct of low-level employees would not allow the public to evaluate the agency's discharge of its duties).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that there may be circumstances where the public does have an interest in the identity of particular Federal employees.&#x2003;For example, "the level of responsibility held by a federal employee, as well as the activity for which such an employee has been censured, are appropriate considerations for determining the extent of the public's interest in knowing the identity of that censured employee." <span class="Italic">Stern v. Federal Bureau of Investigation</span>, 737 F.2d 84, 92 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Stern</span>). In this connection, courts have held that there is no strong public interest in the alleged misconduct, particularly when such misconduct is, for example, unintentional, of Federal employees who do not occupy high-ranking positions. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 92-93 (names of two lower-level employees, censured for negligence, were protected from disclosure "where the public interest in their identity [was] grounded only in a general notion of public servant accountability"); <span class="Italic">Cotton</span>, 798 F. Supp. at 27 (identities of lower-level employees named in an Inspector General's report were protected from disclosure because the "generalized public interest in good management [did] not override the [employees'] privacy interests"). On the other hand, the "public has a great interest in being enlightened" about serious misconduct by a "high-level officer...." <span class="Italic">Stern</span>, 737 F.2d at 94 (court ordered disclosure of letter of censure of high-level agency official for participating "deliberately and knowingly in the withholding of damaging information in an important inquiry[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, however, there is no contention that the Union's request pertains to high-level public officials involved in serious wrongdoing. Indeed, the Union requested all relevant disciplinary suspension records covering a particular time period--for unit and nonunit employees--without regard to either the position held by the affected employees, or the nature of the wrongdoing involved. In this situation, we conclude that the General Counsel has not established that the disclosure of employees' names, the precise part of the requested information that implicates employee privacy interests, serves the public interest that is cognizable under Exemption 6. Although disclosure of unsanitized disciplinary records might assist the Union in discharging its representational responsibilities, this interest is specific to the Union as the requesting party and, as such, may not be considered in balancing interests under FOIA Exemption 6<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 349. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for</span> <span class="Italic">Freedom of the Press</span>, 489 U.S. 749, 771 (1989) ("[T]he identity of the requesting party has no bearing on the merits of his or her FOIA request."); <span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span>, 114 S. Ct. at 1014 ("[A]ll FOIA requesters have an equal, and equally qualified, right to information[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, and in view of judicial precedent holding that similar documents are not disclosable, we conclude that, on balance, the public interest that would be served by disclosing the requested unsanitized disciplinary information in this case is outweighed by the substantial invasion of employee privacy that would result. Accordingly, we find that disclosure of the requested information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, within the meaning of Exemption 6 of the FOIA, and, thus, is not authorized by the FOIA exception to the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Disclosure of the Requested Information Is Not</span> <span class="Italic">Authorized Under the Routine Use Exception to</span> <span class="Italic">the Privacy Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The information requested in this case is contained in the OPM/GOVT-1 and OPM/GOVT-3 systems of records. OPM's routine use statements governing those systems of records, identified as routine use "j" applicable to OPM/GOVT-1 (encompassing OPFs), and "a" applicable to OPM/GOVT-3 (encompassing adverse action files), provides that records may be disclosed "to officials of labor organizations recognized under 5 U.S.C. chapter 71 when relevant and necessary to their duties of exclusive representation...." 57 Fed. Reg. 35698, 35706, 35712 (1992). Accordingly, to determine whether the routine use exception applies to the requested information, we must decide whether the requested information is "relevant and necessary" within the meaning of routine use statements "a" and "j."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM issued "guidance to agencies" for interpreting these terms in FPM Letter 711-164, which was published on September 17, 1992. When the FPM was abolished on December 31, 1993, the Letter, along with certain other parts of the FPM, was provisionally retained through December 31, 1994. For the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Little Rock</span>, <span class="Italic">Arkansas</span>, 51 FLRA No. 24 (1995), we apply the FPM Letter's guidance in deciding this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FPM Letter contains two requirements that a union must satisfy in order to establish that requested information is consistent with routine uses "a" and "j": (1) the information must be "relevant" to the express purpose for which it is sought, meaning that the nature of the information must bear a traceable, logical, and significant connection to the purpose to be served; and (2) the information must be "necessary," meaning that there are no adequate alternative means or sources for satisfying the union's informational needs. In clarifying this second requirement, the FPM Letter explains that it is to be determined on a case-by-case basis: the union "must show that it has a particularized need for the information in a form that identifies specific individuals, and that its information needs cannot be satisfied through less intrusive means, such as by releasing records with personally-identifying information deleted."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the Union has failed to demonstrate that the requested information is both "relevant and necessary" within the meaning of FPM Letter 711-164. Addressing first the standard of "relevance," and looking at the ordinary meaning of the terms "traceable," "logical," and "significant," [9] we have examined the record to assess whether the Union has established that the requested name-identified disciplinary suspension records can reasonably be attributed to and are likely to influence or affect the purpose for which the records were sought. We find that the name-identified records bear a traceable, logical, and significant connection to the purpose for which the information was sought. Furnishing the records would clearly assist the Union's stated purpose of uncovering possible disparate treatment of unit employees. It would also enable the Union to make comparisons among employees in order to ascertain whether the Respondent administers discipline to employees in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;According to Webster's Third New International Dictionary (unabridged) (1986), traceable is defined as "suitable or of a kind to be attributed: Due, Ascribable"; logical means "that [which] is in accordance with inferences reasonably drawn from preceding or surrounding or predictable facts or events or circumstances"; and significant refers to "having or likely to have influence or effect." The Authority occasionally refers to dictionary definitions of terms to supply meaning where none has otherwise been provided. <span class="Italic">For example, American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, Local 31 and U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Wade Park Unit</span>, <span class="Italic">Cleveland, Ohio</span>, 49 FLRA 957, 958 n.2 (1994). <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Department of the Army, Red River Depot, Texarkana, Texas v. FLRA</span>, 977 F.2d 1490, 1492 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (court found that Authority's adoption of dictionary definition of statutory term was permissible).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we are not persuaded that the record before us supports a finding that the information is "necessary," within the meaning of the FPM Letter. Although the General Counsel maintains that the Union needs the requested information to determine whether there was disparate treatment of the grievants, the General Counsel has failed to establish that this need cannot be satisfied through less intrusive means than by using name-identified disciplinary records. The FPM Letter contains an example of a less intrusive means: release of records with personally-identifying information deleted. In this case, it is clear that this less intrusive means exists: the Judge ordered the records disclosed in a sanitized and correlated form.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the General Counsel contends that the Judge erred by refusing to order the disclosure of unsanitized disciplinary suspension records, no argument is offered why sanitized and correlated records would not satisfy the Union's needs. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Union has failed to show that the information is necessary, within the meaning of routine use statements "a" and "j." Therefore, the Union has not established, as it must under FPM Letter 711-164, both the relevance and necessity of unsanitized copies of all the requested disciplinary records. Consequently, the information is not disclosable in the unsanitized form sought by the Union as a routine use under section 552a(b)(3) of the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As disclosure of the unsanitized disciplinary information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, within the meaning of Exemption 6 of the FOIA, and release of the unsanitized information is not authorized as a routine use under section 552a(b)(3) of the Privacy Act, such disclosure is prohibited by law within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. Accordingly, the Respondent's failure to provide the Union with the requested information did not violate section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_323"></span>c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Disclosure of the Requested Information Is Not</span> <span class="Italic">Necessary Within the Meaning of Section</span> <span class="Italic">7114(b)(4</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span> to the facts in this case, we find that the Union has not satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the requested information is required for it to adequately represent its members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time of its information request, the Union stated that it needed the information to prepare for arbitration proceedings involving suspensions of five unit employees. In addition, the Union explained that it needed the information to ensure that the Respondent had been "consistent in its disciplinary actions of all employees." These statements articulate the Union's reasons for requesting the disciplinary suspension records in general, and establish a need for <span class="Italic">some</span> disciplinary suspension records to compare with the suspensions given the grievants. They do not, however, explain why the Union needs the information it has requested, and the particular uses to which it would put the information if it were disclosed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The information requested by the Union in this case encompasses: (1) disciplinary suspension records; (2) covering a 5-year period; and (3) that are name-identified. The Union has not established with the requisite specificity a need for these records. In this regard, testimony established that the Union requested 5 years of disciplinary suspension records because it believed that the Agency maintained such records for that time period. However, that disciplinary suspension records covering a period of 5 years are available does not establish that those records are necessary. No basis has been presented in this case to find that the Union articulated or established with the requisite specificity that it needs records covering this extended length of time.</p>
<p class="noindent">A request was appropriate for the names of employees who could provide the union with information that could be used to defend an employee charged with poor performance. <span class="Italic">EEOC and AFGE Local 3230</span>, 18 FLRA 173, 187 (1985) (ALJ Decision).</p>
