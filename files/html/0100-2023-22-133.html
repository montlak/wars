<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-133"><span class="space">b.</span> Mitigation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Driscoll v. USPS</span>, 116 MSPR 662, 673-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-29, 2011 MSPB 80 (2011), explaining and applying <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, determined that reductions are made for unsuccessful claims if the appellant makes multiple, distinct requests for relief in a single appeal and each of those could be raised as a separate Board appeal; if the claims are interrelated and not distinct, reductions may be made if success is less than complete, e.g., a penalty is mitigated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the question of what adjustment, if any, should be made to the lodestar in light of the appellant's failure to obtain all of the relief she requested. Where, as here, a party is entitled to an award of attorney fees but did not succeed on every issue, the most important factor to be considered is the results that were obtained. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434. In this situation, two questions must be addressed: first, whether the appellant failed to prevail on claims that were unrelated to the claims on which he succeeded; and second, whether the appellant achieved a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making the fee award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the party seeking fees presented unrelated claims for relief, based on different facts and legal theories, then work on an unsuccessful claim will not be compensated, even if the hours were reasonably spent. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434-35. In this scenario, unrelated and unsuccessful claims will be treated "as if they had been raised in separate lawsuits." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, if an appellant makes multiple, distinct requests for relief in a single Board appeal, each of which could form the basis of a separate appeal, the Board will deduct the hours spent on unsuccessful claims. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of Justice</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 299, 305 (1996); <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Roman v. Department of the Army</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 409, 419-20 (1996) (an appellant was not entitled to fees incurred in connection with his unsuccessful claim for consequential damages, which was based on a different statutory provision than his successful claim for costs), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 129 F.3d 134 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table); <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 643, 648-49 (1987) (appellants who prevailed on one of two back-pay claims were not entitled to fees in connection with the unsuccessful claim, where there was "no common core of facts" underlying the claims).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other cases, such as an ordinary appeal of a single adverse action, the party entitled to a fee award will have raised a single claim or related claims for relief that could not have been appealed separately. <span class="Italic">See Smit v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 612, 617 (1994). If the party in such a case has obtained "excellent results" in spite of not succeeding on every issue, she should recover a fully compensatory fee, encompassing all hours reasonably spent on the litigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In these circumstances, the fee award should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit. Litigants in good faith may raise alternative legal grounds for a desired outcome, and the court's rejection of or failure to reach certain grounds is not a sufficient reason for reducing a fee. The result is what matters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 435 (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Heath v. Department of Transportation</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 101, 105-06 (1995). This approach may be appropriate even where the party does not obtain all the relief she requested, provided the relief obtained was "substantial." <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>. 461 U.S. at 426-28, 436 (where plaintiffs involuntarily confined to a maximum-security unit of a state hospital prevailed on five out of six claims that conditions at the unit violated their constitutional right to minimally adequate treatment, a fee award including time spent on the unsuccessful claim may have been reasonable "in light of the substantial relief obtained"); <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 884 F.2d 1378, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (a fractional division of the attorney fee award was not appropriate where an appellant who succeeded on four of six compliance issues "prevailed in the main, achieving more than 'partial or limited success,' although he did not receive all the relief he requested").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, on the other hand, a prevailing party who has raised one or more related claims has achieved only "partial or limited success," an award based on the hours spent reasonably on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount, even where the claims were interrelated, nonfrivolous, and raised in good faith. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 436. In this scenario, the tribunal awarding fees has discretion to make an equitable judgment as to what reduction is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 436-37. It may adjust the lodestar downward by identifying specific hours that should be eliminated or, in the alternative, reducing the overall award to account for the limited degree of success. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Smit</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 619.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, where an appellant is entitled to an award of attorney fees but does not succeed on every claim or issue, the case will fall into one of three distinct categories, each requiring a different approach for determining which fees are compensable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Where the plaintiff has failed to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee. Where a lawsuit consists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney's fee reduced simply because the...court did not adopt each contention raised. But where the plaintiff achieved only limited success, the...court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 440.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Del Prete v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 429 (2007), the Board suggested that the first approach should be followed where an appellant prevails only on the issue of penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 15. In such a case, the Board held, the award of fees is limited to legal fees attributed to the change in penalty, and any other argument pursued by the appellant, such as an unsuccessful challenge to the charge, should be treated as an unrelated claim for which the appellant may not receive compensation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. That holding was incorrect, and we hereby overrule it. In a typical removal appeal, such as the one before us, the appellant asserts a single claim for relief under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(d) and 7701, and seeks a single desired outcome, namely, that the Board set aside the removal action. The appellant may raise alternative arguments in support of that effort--for example, as the appellant did here, by challenging the charges, the reasonableness of the penalty, and raising an affirmative defense of discrimination. These, however, are not distinct claims for relief that could be treated "as if they had been raised in separate lawsuits." <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434-35. Thus, such a case does not fall into the first <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> category, and the Board should not automatically disallow compensation for fees relating to other issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board should instead consider whether the degree of success warrants an award based on all hours reasonably spent on the litigation and, if not, what adjustment is appropriate. In doing so, the Board will weigh the significance of the relief obtained against the relief sought. <span class="Italic">Smit</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 617. As the Court emphasized in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, there is no "precise rule or formula" for making such a determination. 461 U.S. at 436. In some cases, the Board has found that an appellant who obtained mitigation of a penalty is entitled to compensation for attorney time devoted to unsuccessful alternative arguments. <span class="Italic">See Freeman</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 128-29, 133-34 (where the appellant obtained mitigation of the removal penalty to a 90-day suspension, based on a finding of whistleblowing reprisal, hours reasonably spent on unsuccessful discrimination and retaliation claims and a challenge to the sustained charge were compensable); <span class="Italic">Nickerson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 92, 96-97 (1992) (awarding all hours claimed where the charge was sustained but the appellant obtained mitigation of the penalty from removal to a 120-day suspension). In other cases, the appellant's incomplete success may warrant an adjustment to the lodestar. <span class="Italic">See Boese</span>, 784 F.2d at 391 (remanding for determination of the appropriate reduction of the fee award).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant in this case obtained some measure of success by prevailing on the second charge and having her removal mitigated to a demotion, she nonetheless suffered a severe penalty. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant obtained only "partial or limited" relief in the underlying appeal, and that a downward adjustment to the lodestar is warranted. <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 436, 440. The administrative judge found it appropriate to adjust the lodestar by imposing a global reduction, and we defer to her judgment on that point. <span class="Italic">See Sprenger v. Department of the Interior</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 664, 669 (1987) (the administrative judge who decided the case on the merits is in the best position to determine whether the amount requested is reasonable). Prior to applying the reduction, however, the administrative judge also docked specific hours relating to the sustained charge and the appellant's unsuccessful discrimination and retaliation claims. We agree with the appellant that it would be inequitable to penalize her twice for her lack of success on those issues, and we will therefore apply a global reduction only.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the amount of the reduction, the appellant contends that, because her current pay is only 10 percent less than she received in her former position, the lodestar should be reduced by no more than 10 percent. There are, however, other factors to be considered in determining her degree of success in the underlying appeal. In addition to the loss in pay, the appellant has also suffered a change in rank to a non-supervisory position, and she does not have the clean disciplinary record she would have obtained had the removal been reversed altogether. Considering the significance of both the relief awarded and the relief sought and not obtained, we discern no basis to disturb the administrative judge's finding that a 25 percent reduction of the lodestar would fairly reflect the appellant's limited success. <span class="Italic">Cf. Lizut,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. at 9. Applying that reduction and rounding to the nearest cent, we arrive at an award of $54,890.63 for fees incurred during the underlying appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boo v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-13-3302-A-1 (NP 10/29/2015), mitigating removal to a 30-day suspension, reduced claimed fees by 15%:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Driscoll</span>, the Board explained that where, as here, a party is entitled to an award of attorney fees, but did not succeed on every issue, the most important factor to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of a fee award under the lodestar calculation is the results that were obtained. <span class="Italic">See Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 21 (citing <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 434 (1983)); <span class="Italic">see also Ferebee v. Department of the Navy</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 447, 450 (1987) (discussing that the lodestar calculation is the billing rate times the number of hours expended). Thus, where an appellant is entitled to an award of attorney fees, but does not succeed on every claim or issue, the case will fall into one of three distinct categories, each requiring a different approach for determining which fees are compensable. <span class="Italic">Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 25. The Board has found that in cases such as this one, where the employee achieved only limited success, the Board should consider whether the degree of success warrants an award based on all hours reasonably spent on the litigation, and, if not, what adjustment is appropriate.[4] <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The other categories identified in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> cover: (1) when an employee fails to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claim, in which case the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded; and (2) when an employee raises several related arguments, all of which are not adopted, an employee should not have his fee award reduced provided he has secured substantial relief. <span class="Italic">See Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 25 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 440). These two categories are inapplicable to the facts of this case where one of the agency's charges was not sustained and the appellant's removal was mitigated to a 30-day suspension based on the remaining sustained charge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 28 (finding that the appellant obtained partial relief by prevailing on one charge and having a removal mitigated to a demotion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying <span class="Italic">Driscoll,</span> we find that the appellant obtained only partial or limited success in the merits phase of this appeal because only one of the two original charges was sustained, and the removal action was mitigated to a 30-day suspension, thus leaving the appellant with a disciplinary record. <span class="Italic">See Driscoll,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 28; <span class="Italic">see also Guy v. Department of the Army,</span> 118 M.S.P.R. 45, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 19 (2012) (adjusting the lodestar calculation in an individual right of action (IRA) appeal where an appellant only successfully challenged one of three personnel actions).[5] Thus, because the appellant only obtained partial or limited success in the prior proceeding, the Board has the discretion to make an equitable adjustment to the lodestar calculation to account for the appellant's limited degree of success.[6] <span class="Italic">See Driscoll,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 24; <span class="Italic">see also Guy,</span> 118 M.S.P.R. 45, &#x00B6; 20. Based on the nature of the relief ultimately ordered by the Board--reinstatement to employment and the imposition of a 30-day suspension in lieu of removal--we find that the appellant was partially successful in his appeal but that a full award of attorney fees would be excessive and unreasonable. <span class="Italic">See Driscoll,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 29. We find that a 15 percent reduction of the lodestar calculation is appropriate, and that such a reduction sufficiently accounts <span id="Page_4670"></span>for the severity of the mitigated penalty, the existence of the appellant's consequential disciplinary history, and the fact that one of the agency's charges was sustained on petition for review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We therefore find that a 15 percent global reduction of the lodestar calculation, or a reduction of $7,951.50, is warranted. The addendum initial decision awarding the appellant attorney fees is accordingly modified, and the appellant is awarded $45,058.50 in attorney fees.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Although an award of attorney fees in an IRA appeal is governed by a different statutory section than the instant fee petition, <span class="Italic">see Auker v. Department of Defense</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12 (2000) (comparing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g) and 7701(g)), these provisions are similar in many respects, and the Board has found that the lodestar adjustment principles discussed above generally are applicable to most attorney fee petitions involving a prevailing party determination); <span class="Italic">see Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 10 n.3 (citing <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 433 n.7).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Alternatively, the Board could adjust the lodestar calculation by excluding specific hours that were expended on the unsuccessful claims. <span class="Italic">E.g., Guy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 45, &#x00B6; 20. We exercise our equitable discretion under the facts and procedural history of this case and find that a global percentage reduction is more appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7] The decision to equitably adjust the lodestar calculation based on the appellant's partial success is not inconsistent with a finding that the appellant is substantially innocent of the primary charges against him under the interest of justice standard. The Federal Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">Sterner v. Department of the Army</span>, 711 F.2d 1563, 1567 (Fed. Cir. 1983) that an employee's eligibility for an attorney fees award as a prevailing party is the threshold issue the Board should consider in a petition for attorney fees and that his entitlement under the interest of justice standard in section 7701(g)(1) is a separate, subsequent consideration. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. ("Eligibility [for an attorney fees award as a prevailing party] is broad, but the entitlement standard operates to limit it."). We similarly find that whether an employee was substantially innocent of the primary charges against him is separate from the question of whether he was successful on all, or only some, of the issues in the Board appeal for purposes of calculating the lodestar under <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>. We see no reason to conclude that a finding that an employee is substantially innocent of the agency's primary charges under the interest of justice standard precludes the Board from adjusting the lodestar calculation downward to account for an employee's limited or partial success.</p>
