<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-314"><span class="space">h.</span> Proof of AWOL; Justification for Leave</h5>
<p class="noindent">FLRA borrowed case law from the MSPB distinguishing the proof required to sustain an AWOL charge from a charge that an employee failed to follow procedures required to obtain leave. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 41 FLRA 635, 637-40 (1991), involving a challenge to a suspension, explained some government-wide regulations concerning documentation and grants of sick leave:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the award is contrary to 5 C.F.R. part 630, subpart D, pertaining to sick leave, because it sustains management's suspension of the grievant for AWOL based solely on the grievant's failure to follow established sick leave procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.401, entitled "Grant of sick leave," provides, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An agency shall grant sick leave to an employee when the employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;Receives medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;Is incapacitated for the performance of duties by sickness, injury, or pregnancy and confinement;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(c)&#x2003;Is required to give care and attendance to a member of his immediate family who is afflicted with a contagious disease; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(d)&#x2003;Would jeopardize the health of others by his presence at his post of duty because of exposure to a contagious disease.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 630.401, an agency is required to grant sick leave to an employee when any of the events listed in (a)-(d) occur. <span class="Italic">Wade</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Dept. of Navy</span>], 829 F.2d [1160] at 1109 [(Fed. Cir. 1987)]; <span class="Italic">Miller v. Bond</span>, 641 F.2d 997, 1003 (D.C. Cir. 1981)....&#8197;As the court in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> explained, the use of the phrase "shall grant" emphasizes the fact that an agency must grant sick leave when requested to do so by an employee in the instances set forth by section 630.401(a)-(d). Accordingly, the court ruled that "[n]o agency has the discretion to refuse to grant sick leave to a qualified applicant." 641 F.2d at 1003.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.403 provides that an agency may grant a request for sick leave only when such a request is supported by "administratively acceptable" evidence. As noted by the court in <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 641 F.2d at 1003, section 630.403 provides some general guidelines on what evidence will support an applicant's entitlement to be granted sick leave. Section 630.403 provides that "[r]egardless of the duration of the absence, an agency may consider an employee's certification as to the reason for [the employee's] absence as evidence administratively acceptable." However, for an absence in excess of 3 workdays, and for a lesser period when determined necessary by an agency, "the agency may also require a medical certificate, or other administratively acceptable evidence as to the reason for the absence." In short, "[t]he agency's discretion is limited only by the requirement of 'reasonableness.'" <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 641 F.2d at 1003.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.402 requires that the employee must request sick leave within the time limits prescribed by the agency. However, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), in interpreting and applying 5 CFR Part 630, subpart D, holds that an employee's duty to comply with the agency's sick leave procedures "is not...a condition precedent to the agency's duty to grant sick leave when presented with proper evidence of illness or injury." <span class="Italic">Atchley v. Department of the Army</span>, 46 MSPR 297, 301 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Atchley</span>). In MSPB's view, "[i]f an employee has provided administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity, prior to the agency's decision to remove him on AWOL charges, the agency must grant sick leave, regardless of the employee's failure to timely comply with the agency's sick leave procedures." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Nash v. US Postal Service</span>, 8 MSPR 307, 310 &#x0026; n.10 (1981) (<span class="Italic">Nash</span>)). The MSPB advises that if an agency wants to discipline an employee for failing to comply with established sick leave procedures, the proper action is to propose discipline on that basis and not on the basis that the employee was AWOL on dates that the employee was incapacitated for duty by sickness or injury. <span class="Italic">Atchley</span>, 46 MSPR at 301; <span class="Italic">Nash</span>, 8 MSPR at 310 n.10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Atchley</span>, the employee contended that he was incapacitated during the period for which he was charged with AWOL. The MSPB administrative judge sustained the removal based on the AWOL charge, finding that it was unnecessary to determine whether the employee was incapacitated because the employee had failed to follow the agency's sick leave procedures. Before the MSPB, the employee contended that reliance on his failure to follow sick leave procedures was erroneous because he was charged with AWOL and not with the failure to follow procedures. The MSPB agreed and held that the administrative judge erred in sustaining the AWOL charge solely on the basis of a failure to follow sick leave procedures without deciding whether the employee had provided administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity. The MSPB ruled that a failure to follow established agency sick leave procedures "cannot serve as a basis to sustain an AWOL charge." <span class="Italic">Atchley</span>, 46 MSPR at 302. The MSPB explained that the dispositive issue in these types of cases is whether, prior to disciplinary action, the employee provided the agency with administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity during the period for which the employee was charged with AWOL.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the MSPB's interpretation and application of 5 C.F.R. part 630, subpart D, and we will apply the MSPB's approach to disciplinary actions based on AWOL when resolving exceptions to arbitration awards under the Statute. Similar to the MSPB's holding in <span class="Italic">Atchley</span>, we hold in this case that the Arbitrator erred in sustaining the discipline of the grievant for AWOL solely on the basis of a failure to follow sick leave procedures without deciding whether the grievant had provided administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity for duty on April 3-5, 1989. The dispositive issue in this case is whether the grievant's statement of incapacity due to injury, the two doctor's certificates covering the period April 4-7, and the Agency's doctor's placement of the grievant on limited duty constituted administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity on April 3-5 within the meaning of section 630.403. However, this issue was not addressed or resolved by the Arbitrator in his award sustaining the suspension and denying the grievance. Instead, the Arbitrator relied on the grievant's failure to follow the procedure for requesting sick leave under Article 24, Section 24.01 of the parties' agreement, which procedure does not pertain to supporting evidence for sick leave requests. As decided by the MSPB, the issue of whether an employee followed established sick leave procedures, such as those set forth in the parties' agreement, is separate from the issue of whether an employee was entitled to have been granted sick leave under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.401.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, absent settlement, the Agency must consider whether the grievant provided administratively acceptable evidence that he was incapacitated for duty by injury. If the Agency's determination does not satisfactorily settle this matter, the parties may submit the issue to an arbitrator of their choice for resolution.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">LIUNA Local 1396 and DHHS, Indian Health Serv.</span>, 61 FLRA 715, 716-17 (2006), relied on the MSPB decision in <span class="Italic">Goode v. DLA,</span> 45 MSPR 671 (1990), to determine that "in the absence of a regulatory or contractual requirement that an employee be granted leave, a failure to follow leave request procedures can be the basis for an AWOL charge." In <span class="Italic">LIUNA</span>, the grievant left the jobsite, without informing her supervisor, to meet with a manager about a reprimand she received. She was charged an hour of AWOL. The award denying the grievance was affirmed, FLRA distinguishing <span class="Italic">Robins AFB, supra</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's exception contends that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to law, in particular, <span class="Italic">Robins AFB</span> and related precedent. The Authority reviews questions of law raised by exceptions to an arbitrator's award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24,</span> 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995). In applying a standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority determines whether the award is consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437,</span> 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making this determination, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union misinterprets <span class="Italic">Robins AFB.</span> In that decision, the Authority held that the award was "contrary to 5 C.F.R. part 630, subpart D, pertaining to sick leave, because it sustained] management's suspension of the grievant for AWOL based solely on the grievant's failure to follow established sick leave procedures." <span class="Italic">Robins AFB,</span> 41 FLRA at 637. The Authority noted that, "[u]nder section 630.401, an agency is required to grant sick leave" in the instances set forth in the regulation, including instances when such a request is supported by '"administratively acceptable' evidence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 638. According to the Authority, "a failure to follow established agency sick leave procedures 'cannot serve as a basis to sustain an AWOL charge'" where an employee has presented administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity during the period for which the employee was charged AWOL. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 639 (quoting<span class="Italic"> Atchley v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 46 MSPR at 297, 302 (1990)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Robins AFB</span> is based on application of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.403, which requires the agency to grant an employee sick leave in certain circumstances. This case does not involve sick leave and the Union points to no regulatory requirement that would require the Agency to grant leave in the circumstances of this case. Similarly, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Brown</span> is misplaced. In that case, the MSPB noted that an adverse action against an employee on the ground that he was AWOL would not be sustained if it was shown that the employee was entitled to workman's compensation as a result of a work-related injury for the entire time period covered by the AWOL charge. <span class="Italic">See also Stith v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Development,</span> 21 MSPR 328 (1984) (determination that employee entitled to workman's compensation warranted retroactive application to the employee's leave status and negation of the agency's charge of AWOL). No such circumstances are present here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Local 405</span> also is misplaced. There, the Authority found negotiable a proposal that required the agency to convert AWOL to an appropriate form of leave if it was determined that the employee's <span id="page_2291"></span>absence was excusable. Here, however, the Union also points to no contractual provision that would require the Agency to grant leave to the grievant in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, contrary to the Union's argument, in the absence of a regulatory or contractual requirement that an employee be granted leave, a failure to follow leave request procedures can be the basis for an AWOL charge. <span class="Italic">See Goode v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 45 MSPR 671 (1990) (where agency charged employee with failure to follow established leave procedures and AWOL for the same period, proof that the employee did not properly request leave supported finding that the agency properly denied leave and employee was AWOL as charged).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has not demonstrated that the Agency improperly denied the grievant leave for the period of her visit with the Deputy Director.&#x2003;The Union has therefore failed to demonstrate that the Arbitrator's award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of the discretion of an agency to determine when sick leave will be granted, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 and Dept. of Air Force, Tinker AFB</span>, 68 FLRA 457, 458-59 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 630.401(a) provides, in pertinent part, that "an agency must grant sick leave to an employee when he or she...[r]eceives [a] medical...examination." In his award, the Arbitrator concluded that &#x00A7; 630.401 did not require the Agency to grant sick leave for a "non-emergency medical examination[&#8197;]" such as the grievant's insurance examination. In particular, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's staffing requirements necessitated the grievant's presence at work that day, and that the Agency's denial of the grievant's sick-leave request fell within the Agency's discretion under &#x00A7; 630.401.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although &#x00A7; 630.401 identifies a "medical...examination" as a purpose for which sick leave must be granted, that regulation does not provide that--regardless of circumstances--an agency must grant sick leave for a medical examination on the <span class="Italic">particular day</span> that an employee chooses. In this regard, taken to its logical extreme, the Union's interpretation of &#x00A7; 630.401 would create an absolute, unlimited entitlement to sick leave for any non-emergency medical, dental, or optical examination, at the day and time of the employee's choosing, without regard for the employing agency's staffing needs. Like the Arbitrator, we do not read &#x00A7; 630.401 as sweeping so broadly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Warner Robins</span> does not support a contrary conclusion. In <span class="Italic">Warner Robins</span>, the Authority interpreted &#x00A7; 630.401 and related regulations to find that an agency could not charge an employee as AWOL if the employee had provided administratively acceptable evidence of <span class="Italic">incapacity</span> for duty.[16] But where, as here, there is no claim that an employee was incapacitated, nothing in the Authority's analysis in <span class="Italic">Warner Robins</span> prohibits an agency from charging an employee with AWOL for failing to report to work as directed when: the agency previously denied a request for annual leave for the day at issue; the agency had staffing needs that required the employee to work that day; the agency communicated those needs to the employee; the agency denied the employee's sick-leave request for that day; and the employee ignored that denial and failed to report for work as directed. Accordingly, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Warner Robins</span> is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;41 FLRA at 639-40.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the award is not contrary to law. We note that the Union also claims that a provision of the parties' collective-bargaining agreement "mirrors" &#x00A7; 630.401(a), so that "even in the absence of...&#x00A7; 630.401, the [agreement] mandates the grant of sick leave for medical examinations." The Union's claim is premised on the notion that the award conflicts with the requirements in &#x00A7; 630.401(a). Because we have found to the contrary, the Union's claim provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 2382 and VAMC Phoenix</span>, 64 FLRA 1163, 1166 (2010) ("an agency has broad discretion under this provision regarding what documentation constitutes administratively acceptable evidence of incapacitation; such discretion is subject only to the rule of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, </span>41 FLRA at 638 (citing <span class="Italic">Miller v.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator failed to evaluate the leave request in the manner required by &#x00A7; 630.402. Section 630.402 requires an employee to: (1) "file an application...for sick leave"; and (2) "request advance approval for sick leave for...examination or treatment[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.402 (2010); <span class="Italic">see </span>full text <span class="Italic">supra </span>note 5. In this regard, &#x00A7; 630.402 does not require, as the Agency asserts, that the grievant "<span class="Italic">secure </span>advance approval" in order to use sick leave for examination or treatment. The Arbitrator found, and the Agency does not dispute, that the grievant filed his leave request form (i.e., his "application...for sick leave") "<span class="Italic">before </span>he left for his dental appointment[.]" The Arbitrator's factual finding, to which we defer, <span class="Italic">see Nat'l Guard</span>, 55 FLRA at 40, establishes that the grievant "file[d] an application" <span class="Italic">requesting approval in advance </span>of the appointment, as &#x00A7; 630.402 requires. Therefore, the Agency has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 630.402, and we deny this exception.</p>
