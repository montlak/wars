<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-50"><span class="space">B.</span> ARBITRABILITY, NEGOTIABILITY DISPUTES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The arbitrator may not undertake resolution of a negotiability dispute, that is, if the arbitrator is faced with determining an issue relating to the scope of bargaining as to a proposal, the arbitrator may not decide the case. Resolution of negotiability issues is ordinarily for FLRA. But given a contract, the arbitrator is to determine if a grievance is properly presented within the terms of the contract, that is, whether the grievance is arbitrable. The Statute does not provide for determination of grievability or arbitrability by FLRA. <span class="Italic">VA Hosp., Danville and AFGE Local 1963</span>, 4 FLRA 432, 445 (1980). But when an arbitrator's substantive arbitrability determination is based on law, FLRA reviews that determination <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">SPORT ATC Org. and Dept. of Air Force, Edwards AFB.</span>, 64 <span id="page_1766"></span>FLRA 606, 609 n.7 (2010), <span class="Italic">reconsid. den.,</span> <span class="Italic">SPORT and Dept. of Air Force, Edwards AFB</span>, 64 FLRA 1142 (2010). [Refer to Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-12-098.html#sec4-98">Role of Grievance Arbitration</a>," concerning the role of arbitrators faced with negotiability issues in grievance and interest arbitration.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Construction of a provision in an agreement is not the same as a determination of the negotiability of a proposal. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region, Colorado River Storage Project, Power Operations Office, Dept. of Interior and IBEW Local 2159</span>, 21 FLRA 421, 423-24 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">USIA and AFGE Local 1812</span>, 32 FLRA 739, 748 (1988) ("We conclude that the award is not contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute. This argument fails to distinguish between an arbitrator's decision as to the arbitrability of a grievance and an arbitrator's decision resolving the substantive issue presented by a grievance.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Of the distinction between negotiability determinations, within the province of FLRA, and interpretation of contract or statutory requirements involving bargaining obligations within the review authority of an arbitrator, <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE Council 238,</span> 64 FLRA 227, 229 (2009), determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the Arbitrator's remedy for its incorrect interpretation of Article 45 of the CBA--directing the Agency to resume negotiations with the Union--is contrary to &#x00A7; 2424.30 of the Authority's regulations because it "usurp[s]" the role of the Authority provided under this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2424.30 prescribes the conditions under which "the Authority" will resolve both negotiability and bargaining obligation disputes in a negotiability case.[6] 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.30. In particular, &#x00A7; 2424.30 "makes it clear that the bargaining obligation disputes that the Authority will resolve in a negotiability proceeding are those that otherwise would be resolved pursuant to an unfair labor practice charge or a grievance alleging an unfair labor practice[,]" that is, statutory bargaining obligation disputes. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529,</span> 57 FLRA 172, 176 (2001). Thus, &#x00A7; 2424.30 of the Authority's Regulations addresses only Authority procedures for processing negotiability cases. Section 2424.30 does not address, and thus does not limit, an arbitrator's authority to resolve either a statutory or a contractual duty to bargain issue. As &#x00A7; 2424.30 does not limit an arbitrator's authority to resolve either a statutory or a contractual duty to bargain issue, the Agency has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 2424.30. Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;A bargaining obligation dispute arises when the parties disagree on whether there is a duty to bargain over an otherwise negotiable proposal in light of the specific circumstances in that case. A negotiability dispute arises where the parties disagree on the legality of a proposal or provision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2424.2 of the Authority's Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 66 FLRA 186, 191-92 (2011), partially affirmed an arbitrator's determination that an agency did not improperly unilaterally change working conditions when the arbitrator determined that the union's proposal in response to a management-initiated change was nonnegotiable as an inappropriate arrangement. The arbitrator essentially resolved the negotiability issue in the context of what amounted to a ULP-style failure to bargain. FLRA resolved the exceptions based on application of its negotiability law and affirmed the arbitrator's conclusion that the agency's actions were appropriate because the union's proposal was nonnegotiable.

<p class="noindent-1">Substantive arbitrability involves questions as to whether the dispute's subject matter is arbitrable.[27] When an arbitrator's substantive-arbitrability determination is based on law, the Authority reviews that determination <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.[28] In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law.[29] In making this assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings.[30] When an arbitrator's substantive-arbitrability determination is based on an interpretation of the parties' agreement, the Authority reviews that determination under the deferential "essence" standard.[31]</p>

<p class="noindent">Once the arbitrator makes a grievability determination, if that is the only issue, the determination is reviewable on exceptions. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">DOJ, FCI, El Reno and AFGE Local 171</span>, 38 FLRA 22, 26-27 (1990). <span class="Italic">DOD, DLA and AFGE Local 2004</span>, 58 FLRA 750, 755 (2003), summed matters up:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7105(a)(2)(E) of the Statute authorizes the Authority to "resolve issues relating to duty to bargain in good faith." Under that section, the Authority is authorized to determine whether a matter proposed for bargaining is inconsistent with law and Government-wide regulation under section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. United States Dep't of the Interior, BIA, Wapato Irrigation Project</span>, 55 FLRA 152, 157 (1999); <span class="Italic">see also </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(c). The Authority has held that, consistent with &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2), negotiability disputes that arise under &#x00A7; 7117(c) may be resolved only by the Authority under &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(E)<span class="Italic">. GSA</span>, 54 FLRA 1582, 1588 (1988) (quoting <span class="Italic">Louis A. Johnson Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Clarksburg, W.Va.</span>, 15 FLRA 347 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Veterans</span>)). It is well settled, however, that "disputes relating to the meaning and application of provisions of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, including provisions therein dealing with the obligation to bargain, are subject to resolution under the negotiated grievance procedure and a negotiability appeal is not the proper forum in which to resolve such disputes." <span class="Italic">Veterans</span>, 15 FLRA at 350. Accordingly, grievance arbitrators may consider "the collateral issue of the obligation to bargain" in the course of resolving a grievance as long as their conclusions are "consistent with the Statute and relevant decisions of the Authority[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 351.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union alleged, and the Arbitrator found, that the Agency was obligated to bargain over &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) matters relating to the Agency's decision to hire temporary employees and to staff the New Active Items Area. In resolving those issues, the Arbitrator did not make a determination that any specific proposals or proposed contract language was within the Agency's duty to bargain. In this regard, nothing in the award addresses a negotiability dispute that would otherwise arise under &#x00A7; 7117(c) of the Statute. In addition, we note, unlike here, the cases relied on by the Agency in support of its exception--<span class="Italic">FCI, Texarcana, Tx., Fed. Prison Sys.</span>, 19 FLRA 238 (1985); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio</span>, 18 FLRA 710 (1985)--involved interest arbitration awards where the arbitrator directed the parties to include certain provisions in their agreements despite the agencies' claims that the provisions were not negotiable. Accordingly, we conclude that the award is not contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(e).</p>
<p class="noindent">Statutory management rights do not preclude an arbitrator from making an arbitrability decision or a merits decision concerning the effect of management rights on application of a contract provision, <span class="Italic">USIA and AFGE Local 1812</span>, 32 FLRA 739, 748-49 (1988), <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the award is not contrary to section 7016(a) of the Statute. This argument fails to distinguish between an arbitrator's decision as to the arbitrability of a grievance and an arbitrator's decision resolving the substantive issue presented by a grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station</span>, 30 FLRA at 634, we held:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The proper phase of the arbitration proceeding in which to determine the impact or application of section 7106 is not at the outset so as to preclude by law an arbitrator from having jurisdiction over the matter. Rather, the determination as to the impact or application of section 7106 is to be made in connection with the arbitrator's consideration of the substantive issue presented by the grievance and any possible remedy. [Citation omitted.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See also Marine Corps Logistics Support Base, Pacific, Barstow, California and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1482,</span> 3 FLRA 397 (1980) (nothing in section 7106 precludes an arbitrator from reaching the merits of a grievance alleging violations of provisions of the collective bargaining agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's determination that the grievance in this case is grievable and arbitrable is not in any way inconsistent with section 7106 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station</span>, 30 FLRA at 634. There is no effect on the rights reserved to management as a result of a decision permitting an arbitrator to reach the merits of the grievance alleging that management has violated specified laws, rules, and regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA Dallas</span>, 56 FLRA 733, 735 n.3 (2000), noted that an
arbitrator's determination as to substantive arbitrability is subject
to review, but his determination as to procedural arbitrability is subject to challenge only on grounds other than those that challenge determination of procedural arbitrability itself. [The latter point is developed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-17-427.html#sec9-425">Procedures</a>."] The arbitrator's decision that a matter is arbitrable will be made on the basis of the contract and any statutory exceptions to a broad scope grievance procedure. Management rights defenses do not undercut the arbitrability of a dispute, as <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1843 and VAMC Northport</span>, 51 FLRA 444, 447-48 (1995), indirectly explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator's arbitrability determination is contrary to section 7106(a). Accordingly, we must decide whether the grievance filed by the grievant was precluded by that provision. As acknowledged by the Agency, the grievance filed in this case claimed a violation of Article 10, Section 1-A of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. The Authority has found that contract provisions similar to Article 10, Section 1-A constituted provisions negotiated under section <span id="page_1767"></span>7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 174 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Customs Service, Region IV</span>, 45 FLRA 1051, 1058-59 (1992); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Robins Air force Base, Georgia and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 987</span>, 45 FLRA 489, 493 (1992). By seeking to enforce the provisions of Article 10, Section 1-A in the grievance, the Union was seeking to enforce a provision that we construe to have been negotiated under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. The Agency has not established, and it is not otherwise apparent, that the alleged violation of Article 10, Section 1-A was not arbitrable. Accordingly, we conclude that the grievance was arbitrable, and the Arbitrator's conclusion to that effect is not contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute. That the Arbitrator did not rely on Article 10, Section 1-A in determining arbitrability does not affect our conclusion. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2250 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Muskogee, Oklahoma</span>, 51 FLRA 52, 54 (1995) (arbitrator correctly determined that the grievance was arbitrable even though the arbitrator relied on the wrong statutory basis in doing so). Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">The importance of the arbitrator's role in determining claims and defenses as a matter of jurisdiction without being hampered by management rights defenses at the initial level of receiving the grievance and evaluating those claims and those defenses was emphasized in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1929 and DHS, C&#x0026;BP,</span> 63 FLRA 465, 466-67 (2009). The agency investigated an off-duty fight involving some unit employees, but no action was taken as to them. The union filed a grievance asserting that the off-duty conduct had no nexus to the employees' official duties and should not have been investigated. The agency filed a prehearing motion arguing that the grievance was not arbitrable because it interfered with management's right to determine internal security practices and did not involve an issue within the agency's duty to bargain. The arbitrator concluded that the grievance was not substantively arbitrable because it interfered with management's right to determine internal security practices and because the subject matter of the grievance was not within the agency's duty to bargain. FLRA set the award aside because the arbitrator should not have dismissed the grievance on a preliminary arbitrability determination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union disputes the Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievance was not substantively arbitrable because it conflicts with management's right to determine its internal security practices. The Authority has consistently held that the management rights provisions of &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute do not provide a basis for finding grievances non-arbitrable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DHS,</span> 61 FLRA at 75; <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station,</span> 30 FLRA 616, 631-35 (1987) <span class="Italic">(Newark).</span> An arbitrator may not rely on &#x00A7; 7106 at the outset of a hearing in order to determine whether he or she has jurisdiction over a grievance. <span class="Italic">See Newark,</span> 30 FLRA at 634. An arbitrator may only rely on &#x00A7; 7106 to consider the substantive issue presented by the grievance and any possible remedy. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Consistent with the foregoing precedent, the Arbitrator's conclusion that &#x00A7; 7106 rendered the Union's grievance non-arbitrable because it conflicted with management's right to determine its internal security practices was erroneous. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also disputes the Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievance was not substantively arbitrable because the grievance did not involve an issue that was within the Agency's duty to bargain. The Authority has stated that an issue concerning the scope of bargaining is not dispositive of an issue concerning the arbitrability of a grievance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU, Chapter 15,</span> 33 FLRA 229, 238 (1988) (citation omitted) <span class="Italic">(NTEU, Chapter 15); see also GSA,</span> 54 FLRA 1582, 1588 (1998) (stating that negotiability disputes which arise between an agency and a union under the Statute must be resolved only by the Authority as required by the Statute and that such disputes may not be resolved by an arbitrator in the guise of a grievance). A matter that is outside the duty to bargain is not necessarily outside the scope of a negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 15,</span> 33 FLRA at 238. Even assuming that the Arbitrator correctly found that the grievance did not involve an issue that was within the duty to bargain, as the foregoing precedent establishes, the Arbitrator's reliance on this finding to conclude that the grievance was not arbitrable was erroneous. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's assertion that the Arbitrator's substantive arbitrability conclusion was a procedural arbitrability conclusion is misplaced. Procedural arbitrability involves "procedural questions, such as whether the preliminary steps of the grievance procedure have been exhausted or excused," and is distinguished from substantive arbitrability, which involves questions regarding whether "the <span class="Italic">subject matter</span> of a dispute is arbitrable." <span class="Italic">Fraternal Order of Police, New Jersey Lodge 173,</span> 58 FLRA 384, 385 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting) (quoting Elkouri &#x0026; Elkouri, <span class="Italic">How</span> <span class="Italic">Arbitration</span> <span class="Italic">Works</span> 305) (Marlin M. Volz &#x0026; Edward P. Goggin eds., 5th ed. 1997) (emphasis in original). In particular, substantive arbitrability is a question of subject matter jurisdiction: whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate a particular category or type of dispute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As the Arbitrator's arbitrability determination was based on the subject matter of the grievance, not a procedural provision of the parties' agreement, he made a substantive--not procedural--arbitrability determination. Thus, the Agency's argument does not provide a basis for concluding that the Arbitrator's arbitrability conclusion was a procedural arbitrability conclusion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id.</span> at 385-86.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument that the Arbitrator's substantive arbitrability conclusion fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement is a restatement of its claim that the Arbitrator's substantive arbitrability conclusion is contrary to law. As such, we do not address the Union's arguments separately. <span class="Italic">See Library of Cong., Wash., D.C.,</span> 63 FLRA 122, 125 (2009) (as agency's claim that arbitrator exceeded his authority did nothing more than restate its essence claim, the claims were not addressed separately). Based on the foregoing, we find that the Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievance was not substantively arbitrable is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA distinguished the nature of a bargaining and arbitrability issues in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2823 and VAMC Cleveland</span>, 64 FLRA 1144, 1147 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also appears to have found the grievance substantively nonarbitrable based on his determination that if "there is no national bargaining obligation, there can be no local bargaining obligation." The Authority has held that "an issue concerning the scope of bargaining is not dispositive of an issue concerning the arbitrability of a grievance." <span class="Italic">Border Patrol</span>, 63 FLRA at 467 (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 15, </span>33 FLRA 229, 238 (1988)). In this connection, a matter that is outside the duty to bargain is not necessarily outside the scope of a negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Border Patrol</span>, 63 FLRA at 467. Thus, insofar as the Arbitrator based his finding of nonarbitrability on a determination that the grievance did not involve an issue that was within the duty to bargain, the award is contrary to Authority precedent on this basis as well.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1929</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, also determined that if the arbitrator rules on the merits of the grievance after incorrectly concluding that the grievance is not substantively arbitrable, the case will be remanded to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator, 63 FLRA at 467-68:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator erroneously concluded that the grievance was not substantively arbitrable; however, he nevertheless decided that the Agency did not violate Article 4H of the parties' agreement. Under Authority precedent, when an arbitrator incorrectly concludes that a grievance is not substantively arbitrable, the Authority has consistently remanded the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for a decision on the merits. <span class="Italic">E.g., United States Dep't of the Army, United States Army Dental Activity Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps. &#x0026; Ft. Bragg, Ft. Bragg, N.C.,</span> 62 FLRA 70, 72 (2007) (Member Pope not participating); <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 61 FLRA at 733. However, Authority precedent does not clearly establish what action the Authority must take where an arbitrator incorrectly concludes that a grievance is not substantively arbitrable, but has already addressed the merits of the grievance. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Local 1668,</span> 51 FLRA 714, 719 (1995) (upholding arbitrator's determination that grievance was not substantively arbitrable and denying remaining exceptions that were based on arbitrator's discussion of the merits). Stated differently, Authority precedent does not address whether an award must be remanded to an arbitrator for a decision on the merits following an incorrect substantive arbitrability determination even though the arbitrator has already considered the merits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Authority precedent does not provide a clear resolution for the above issue, it does establish that, once an arbitrator determines that a grievance is not arbitrable, the arbitrator's comments concerning the merits of the grievance constitute non-binding <span class="Italic">dicta</span>. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2172,</span> 57 FLRA 625, 629 (2001); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1668,</span> 51 FLRA at 719; <span class="Italic">see also NLRB, Wash., D.C.,</span> 61 FLRA 41, 45 (2005) (arbitrator's comments on issue not before him constituted <span class="Italic">dicta</span>). Statements that are <span class="Italic">dicta</span> do not provide a basis for finding an award deficient because these statements do not constitute a determination on the merits. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Commerce, NOAA, Office of Marine &#x0026; Aviation Operations, Marine Operations Ctr., Va.,</span> 57 FLRA 430, 434 (2001) (Member Armendariz not participating).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An examination of federal court precedent yields similar results.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See EEOC,</span> 53 FLRA 465, 477 (1997) (applying federal court precedent to resolve substantive arbitrability issue). In this regard, although courts have addressed situations where an arbitrator comments on the merits of a grievance after rendering an erroneous substantive arbitrability conclusion, they have not squarely addressed the appropriate course of action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Shank/Balfour Beatty v. Int'l Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 99,</span> 497 F.3d 83, 93 (1st Cir. 2007) <span class="Italic">(Shank)</span> (arbitrator rendered a decision on the merits after he inappropriately determined that he could resolve substantive arbitrability question, but appellant did not challenge merits award); <span class="Italic">Bokunewicz v. Purolator Products,</span> 907 F.2d 1396, 1400 (3rd Cir. 1990) (where arbitrator commented on merits of grievance after he incorrectly determined that it was not substantively arbitrable, court decided merits of claim because the parties did not have a binding arbitration agreement). However, as with Authority precedent, federal court precedent establishes that, once an arbitrator determines that a grievance is not substantively arbitrable, his or her comments <span id="page_1768"></span>on the merits are non-binding <span class="Italic">dicta</span>. <span class="Italic">See Shank,</span> 497 F.3d at 93; <span class="Italic">see also United Indus. Workers v. Virgin Islands,</span> 987 F.2d 162, 171-72 (3rd Cir. 1993) (arbitrator's comments concerning merits of grievance were <span class="Italic">dicta</span> and did not provide a basis for finding that arbitrator was biased against a party).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The above precedent sufficiently establishes that the Arbitrator's comments concerning the merits of the grievance are non-binding <span class="Italic">dicta</span>. In this regard, neither the record nor the award contains any indication that the Arbitrator informed the parties that he would consider the merits of the grievance regardless of his arbitrability determination; to the contrary, the sole issue the Arbitrator framed for resolution was "[i]s the grievance arbitrable?" In addition, the Arbitrator's award does not contain any indication that the Arbitrator solicited, accepted, or considered any arguments from either party concerning the merits of the grievance. The foregoing establishes that the only issue properly before the Arbitrator was whether the grievance was arbitrable. As such, once the Arbitrator determined that the grievance was not substantively arbitrable, it was inappropriate for him to address any other matters. Thus, the Arbitrator's comments on the merits of the grievance constitute non-binding <span class="Italic">dicta</span>. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1668,</span> 51 FLRA at 719.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the question of the interpretation of the parties' agreement is "a question solely for the arbitrator" because it is the arbitrator's construction of the agreement for which the parties have bargained, we are unable to offer our own interpretation of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def., Def. Logistics Agency, Def. Distrib. Agency, Red River, Texarkana, Tex.,</span> 56 FLRA 62, 67 (2000) (citation omitted). Accordingly, we set aside the award and remand it to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for a decision on the merits of the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 302 and Dept. of Treasury, OCC</span>, 65 FLRA 746, 750 (2011) (overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, WAPA and AFGE Local 3824</span>, 71 FLRA 111 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting)), the remand left it to the parties to determine who the arbitrator would be:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the Authority sets aside an arbitrator's determination that a grievance is not arbitrable, the Authority remands the matter to the parties for submission, absent settlement, to an arbitrator of their choice. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 2823</span>, 64 FLRA 1144, 1147 (2010). In those circumstances, the Authority also has declined to resolve additional arguments raised by parties. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (declining to order arbitrator to resolve merits of grievance because arbitrator could find grievance nonarbitrable on other grounds).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union requests that the Authority order the Agency to provide the information that the Union requested--in effect, requesting that the Authority resolve the merits of the information request grievance. The Arbitrator based his dismissal of that grievance solely on his finding that, as a result of <span class="Italic">NIMA</span>, the compensation grievance was not arbitrable. As such, he did not address the merits of the information request grievance, including whether the information requests satisfied the requirements of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. Consistent with the foregoing precedent, we decline the Union's request to order the Agency to provide the information and, instead, remand the award to the parties for resubmission, absent settlement, to an arbitrator of their choice.</p>
