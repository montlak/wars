<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-212"><span class="space">2.</span> Importance of Untainted Deciding Official</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In decisions that generally predated the "cat's paw" motivational theory, considering animus at levels below the deciding official, as in <span class="Italic">Staub v. Proctor Hospital</span>, 131 S. Ct. 1186, 1190 (2011), analysis often centered on the motivation of the deciding official. At least at the onset of Board operations, the focus was not so limited. <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR 163, 1 MSPB 159, 186 n.31 (1979), a Special Counsel corrective action case, emphasized the responsibilities of executives, managers, and supervisors involved in the administration of disciplinary actions. The Board cited in <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> the Senate report accompanying the Reform legislation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2 Sess. 23 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, p. 2745, enumerates the knowledge requirement for placing responsibility on any individual <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> prohibited personnel practices:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Subsection (c) specifically designates the head of each Executive Agency as the individual responsible for preventing prohibited personnel practices, and for insuring that applicable civil service laws, rules, and regulations, including merit system principles, are complied with. The same duty and responsibility is placed on any individual within the agency who is given authority for personnel management. Thus, to the extent that managerial or supervisory authority is delegated, this section means that responsibility for insuring compliance with the merit system, and potential disciplinary liability for failing to ensure compliance, will follow such a delegation. The delegation will not, however, relieve the head of the executive agency or other top officials from ultimate responsibility for personnel actions and policies within the agency, to the extent that such officials have knowledge or should have knowledge of the actions taken or policies implemented.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite the suggestion in the legislative history of a <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span> approach, the determinative issue in <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> was whether the director of the Marshals Service had retaliatory intent when he directed employees' reassignments. On the basis of the evidence before it, the Board concluded that the official did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the employees' participation in protected activities; he acted on the basis of reasonable advice recommending the reassignments of the employees and on information received from the management review teams that conducted the on-site inspections.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Frazier</span> was carried into the courts by the employees. The District of Columbia Circuit determined that the employees had standing to seek judicial review of the Board's decision, that the Board's procedural handling of the case was correct, and that although the Board's "opinion could have been clearer" as to the degree of knowledge required on the part of agency officials for a demonstration of reprisal, the Board's formulation correctly stated the law. The law is, first, that retaliatory intent on the part of officials subordinate to the official taking action can be attributed to that official to the extent that the subordinates contribute to the decision to take personnel action and, second, that the attributed intent may form the basis for the Board to find constructive knowledge of protected activities sufficient to invoke statutory protections on behalf of those engaged in the activities. The problem of proof was that "those who effected the transfers had no knowledge and those with knowledge had no effect," <span class="Italic">Frazier v. MSPB</span>, 672 F.2d 150 (D.C. Cir. 1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D. <span class="Italic">Elements of a Reprisal Case</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the Board decided that, in order to demonstrate the existence of prohibited personnel practices, the Special Counsel must prove "that the official accused of taking the retaliatory action against the whistleblower had knowledge that the protected disclosure had been made and by whom." Petitioners agree with the Board that official knowledge of protected activities constitutes an essential element of a reprisal finding. They read the Board's opinion, however, as requiring a showing of direct, personal knowledge by the final agency decisionmaker. Such a requirement, petitioners argue, conflicts with the purpose of the whistleblower provisions of the CSRA by permitting prohibited retaliations to be insulated by layers of bureaucratic "ignorance." Moreover, petitioners claim, the Board's imposition of an actual knowledge requirement with respect to the disclosures is inconsistent with the Board's treatment of the EEO-related claims.[56]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[56]&#x2003;In considering whether petitioners' EEO activities led to their transfers, the Board noted that retaliatory motive could be inferred. 1 MSPB at 186. Indeed, the Board's conclusion that Frazier's transfer was improper was based on its decision to attribute knowledge of the deputy's EEO activities to Director Hall. <span class="Italic">See</span> page 158 <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Petitioners do not challenge the Board's treatment of the EEO aspect of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There can be no doubt that a rule limiting retaliation findings to situations in which the top agency official has actual knowledge of the protected activities would seriously undercut the CSRA's goal of strengthening management accountability. Section 2302(c), for instance, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The head of each agency shall be responsible for the prevention of prohibited personnel practices, for the compliance with and enforcement of applicable civil service laws, rules, and regulations, and other aspects of personnel management. Any individual to whom the head of an agency delegates authority for personnel management, or for any aspect thereof, shall be similarly responsible within the limits of the delegation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In elaborating on this provision, the Senate Report explained, "to the extent that managerial or supervisory authority is delegated, this section means that responsibility for insuring compliance with the merit system, and potential disciplinary liability for failing to ensure compliance, will follow such a delegation."[57] The report continued:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The delegation will not, however, relieve the head of the executive agency or other top officials for ultimate responsibility for personnel actions and policies within the agency, to the extent that such officials have knowledge or <span class="Italic">should have knowledge</span> of the actions taken or policies implemented. (Emphasis added.)[58]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[58]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the statute imposes on agency heads an affirmative obligation to prevent prohibited practices of which they are or should be aware. We agree with petitioners, therefore, that <span class="Italic">constructive</span> knowledge of protected activities on the part of one with ultimate responsibility for a personnel action may support an inference of retaliatory intent. Moreover, while delegation of authority does not relieve an agency head of responsibility, subordinates with power to effect a personnel action may also be called to account. Thus, section 2302(b) expressly prohibits "(a)ny employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action" from taking such an action for prohibited reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4029"></span>While the Board's opinion could have been clearer, we believe it adequately conformed to these principles. With respect to the agency head, the Board was explicit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We are compelled by the record here to conclude that Director Hall did not have actual or constructive knowledge that these deputies had engaged in protected activities. Rather, he acted in full reliance upon the recommendation of the management review team which...was for the most part based upon sound management considerations.[59]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[59]&#x2003;1 MSPB at 181.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of these conclusions, the Board detailed the evidence showing Hall's lack of actual knowledge and noted the absence of evidence to the contrary.[60] The Board then considered the Special Counsel's argument that knowledge of the disclosures by the management review team should be attributed to Hall.[61] On review of the evidence, the Board rejected the factual predicate of the argument, crediting the uniform testimony of the team's members "that they did not know that the four deputies whose transfers they recommended had made disclosures" to the congressmen.[62] Finally, the Board found no basis for application of the "small plant" doctrine, a labor law rule attributing knowledge of protected activities to employers of relatively small labor forces.[63] Although the Board occasionally employed the phrase "actual knowledge" in its treatment of these points, its analysis implicitly acknowledged the possibility that a finding of retaliation could be based on constructive knowledge as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[60]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 181-82.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[61]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 182.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[62]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Special Counsel did not contend that, even if the team members were unaware of the whistleblowing, their report was fatally infected by any biased testimony from individuals who knew of the deputies' disclosures. The Board found that the team's report was reasonably based on discussions with all members of the Atlanta staff, that it did not wholly accept the contentions of any party, and that it reflected sound management considerations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1 MSPB at 174-75 &#x0026; 183. We see no reason to disturb these findings. Accordingly, we need not determine to what extent, if any, the Act prohibits personnel actions unwittingly based on evidence tainted by the retaliatory motives of non-decisionmakers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[63]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 182-83.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also recognized that retaliatory intent on the part of Hall's subordinates, even if not attributable to the Director, could form the basis of a prohibited practice to the extent that they contributed to the decision to take the personnel actions. The only individuals whose views might have lead to the transfer orders and who knew about the whistleblowing were three officials of the Marshals Service: Angel, Lora, and Vandergrift. The evidence did not indicate that either Vandergrift or Lora had played any role in the decision to transfer the deputies.[64] While Angel did seek the reassignment of three of the petitioners, the Board determined that his suggestion played no part in the ultimate decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]ssuming that Marshal Angel had the requisite knowledge and acted with retaliatory intent in recommending the transfers of Deputies Frazier, Reilly, Morris, and Jordan, that recommendation was a nullity since Hall did not act on it. Instead, Hall ordered the transfers of Chief Deputy Bowler and Deputies Love, Reilly, Morris, and Frazier, acting in reliance upon the recommendations of the management review team.[65]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[64]&#x2003;The Board found that Vandergrift "never discussed the inquiry from Fowler's office with Hall or any member of the (review) team." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 181. As to Lora, the Board determined that the extent of his "communication to Hall regarding his trip to Atlanta was to tell Hall that he concurred in Marshal Angel's transfer recommendation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Like Angel's recommendation itself, Lora's concurrence did not apparently persuade Hall who only decided to transfer some of the deputies mentioned by Hall after receipt of the Review Team's report.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[65]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 182-83.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the Special Counsel alleged that officials of the Marshals Service recommended or ordered personnel actions in retaliation for protected activities. The Board properly assumed that such a claim presupposes that individuals with actual or constructive knowledge of the activities helped cause the personnel actions. Fairly read, the Board's opinion determined that, in this case, those who effected the transfers had no knowledge and those with knowledge had no effect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Guin v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 99-3350) ("Where, as here, the initiating and deciding officials maintain a reasonable separation from the targets of the protected disclosures and the charges considered do not include the protected disclosures, the nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action may be lacking."); <span class="Italic">Sigler v. Dept. of Army</span>, 63 MSPR 103, 109 (1994) (target of grievances was the proposing official rather than the deciding official; the deciding official did not know of protected activities, but if he did, the appellant failed to show a nexus between protected activities and the removal action); <span class="Italic">Pope v.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 23 MSPR 549, 553 (1984) (deciding official knew nothing of the appellant's whistleblowing activities until the appellant raised them during the oral reply, and the deciding official testified that he made his decision solely on an investigation report); <span class="Italic">Wildeman v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 23 MSPR 313, 320 (1984) ("[A]ppellant has not established that both the proposing and deciding officials had actual or constructive knowledge that appellant had engaged in the protected activity.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board permitted the appellant to present evidence as to his claim of reprisal by tracing the events showing the animosity of decisionmakers toward him, <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 26 MSPR 164, 167 (1985) (following remand, 29 MSPR 447 (1985)), and even with the D.C. Circuit's description in <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> of the Board's formulation of attributed intent, causation has often not been established in cases involving an untainted deciding official, i.e., a deciding official to whom there was no attribution of the prohibited motivation of a proposing official. <span class="Italic">Stromfeld v. DOJ</span>, 21 MSPR 428, 433 (1984), inferred reprisal from the fact that a proposal for removal was initiated by the regional director of the agency soon after the appellant filed EEO complaints against him. The removal was sustained because the deciding official harbored no animus against the appellant and considered fairly the appellant's reply to charges that were supported by an internal investigation. This was an interesting result: the analysis failed to consider whether the action would have been initiated without reprisal. If the action would never have commenced at all without reprisal, the action of the deciding official hardly seemed sufficiently valid to sustain. This approach continued, sometimes with quite graphic results. Another reprisal case, <span class="Italic">Cardwell v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 1, 3-4 (1986), involving an insubordination charge, explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While a portion of one affidavit specifically alleges that the proposing official in appellant's case officially criticized appellant several times after appellant filed her complaints against him, and exhibited ill will towards her, we find that the record as a whole establishes that the agency would have taken the same action even if the appellant had not filed the discrimination complaints in question. Specifically, we find that all of the alleged instances of favoritism and reprisal relate exclusively to the proposing official. The deciding official, however, testified that he was only generally aware of appellant's discrimination complaints and first became further informed during the reply process. There is no indication, however, that the deciding official's decision was in any way based upon a reprisal motive. We, therefore, conclude that the agency action was based upon appellant's proven misconduct and that the agency would have taken this action even if appellant had not filed the discrimination complaints.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Walsh v. EPA</span>, 25 MSPR 460, 466-69 (1984), examined elements of causation in a reprisal case, leading to failure of the claim based on an unbiased decisionmaker:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official found the conflict between Mr. Campbell and Mr. Moraglia to be a "personal dispute," and therefore concluded that it could not constitute mismanagement, waste, abuse of authority, or a danger to the public. This finding ignores the undisputed evidence that Mr. Moraglia, with the support of appellant, made a formal complaint to the Inspector General, who considered the allegations serious enough to appoint an investigator who recommended that Campbell be relieved of supervisory duties. Therefore, we conclude that the disclosure was of the type protected by the statute, specifically relating to mismanagement or an abuse of authority....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question then is whether the merger of the Philadelphia and Washington offices was taken in retaliation for appellant's part in the disclosures. The presiding official alternatively found that there was no relationship between the disclosures and the reasons for the reduction in force. She discussed the reasons for this finding in detail when weighing the evidence as to the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>s of the reorganization. In this respect she noted that Mr. Campbell had input into the reorganization but did not have the authority to effectuate his recommendations. The evidence shows that the Inspector General was responsible for deciding <span id="Page_4030"></span>on the course and form of the reorganization, and the action had to be approved by the EPA Administrator. As mentioned previously, the fact that the agency offered to reassign appellant so that he could retain his same grade was viewed as significant by the presiding official. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 10 MSPB 15, 17, 11 MSPR 19, 22-23 (1982) "("agency's good faith...cannot be questioned because under 5 CFR 351.201(b) (it) was not required to fill the...position..."). We agree with the presiding official's conclusion as discussed below."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 672 F.2d 150 at n.62 (D.C. Cir. 1982), the Court left open the question of whether nondecision makers might taint a decision through presentation of improper evidence to the deciding official. <span class="Italic">See also Frazier</span>, 1 MSPB at 179 n.31, 1 MSPR at 186 n.31. In <span class="Italic">Sullivan v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 720 F.2d 1266 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the Court found that a nondecisionmaker had initiated an investigation leading to the employee's removal as a reprisal for the employee filing grievances against him. The Court found that the official had a dominant role in the case and concluded that the agency's action constituted reprisal in violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have not directly addressed this issue to date, the plain language of the statute clearly makes it a prohibited personnel practice for an employee with authority to "recommend" any personnel action to take a personnel action with respect to any employee as reprisal for a protected disclosure. 5 USC 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to be successful in regard to any such claim, however, an appellant must show not only that a prohibited personnel practice occurred, but also that the agency's "decision was based on that prohibited personnel practice...." 5 USC 7701(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, in analyzing any such claim it must first be determined whether: (1) there was a protected disclosure; (2) the recommending official knew of the disclosure and who made it; and (3) the recommendation was made as a means of retaliation. If this is shown, it still must be determined whether the recommendation tainted the action to such an extent as to cause the deciding official to reach a decision he would not otherwise have reached.[8] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sullivan,</span> 720 F.2d at 1275; <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, 1 MSPB at 179, 1 MSPR at 185-86.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">but see Coons v. Department of the Navy</span>, 15 MSPR 1 (1983), where we found the supervisor's recommendation to have been biased but mitigated the disciplinary action instead of reversing. <span class="Italic">Coons</span> is distinguishable from the instant case as the deciding official in <span class="Italic">Coons</span> intended to take disciplinary action and the supervisor's recommendation only affected his consideration of the penalty under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, we find that Campbell was aware of appellant's disclosures which were protected as previously discussed. However, the appellant failed to prove that Campbell recommended the merger of the Washington and Philadelphia offices in retaliation for the disclosure. The appellant emphasizes that he was the only employee who was ultimately adversely affected by the RIF. He cites <span class="Italic">Losure v. Interstate Commerce</span> <span class="Italic">Commission,</span> 2 MSPB 361, 2 MSPR 195 (1980), in which the Board found that the alleged RIF had altered nothing of substance but was intended as a means of removing the employee. In this case, however, the reorganization was one which affected all Inspector General Offices nationwide. Although appellant was the only employee adversely affected in the RIF, we conclude that this does not establish that the RIF was taken for pretextual reasons<span class="Italic">. See Farmer v. Department of Transportation</span>, 11 MSPB 622, 13 MSPR 384 (1982). As we noted, the agency's offer of a GM-15 position rebuts any inference of retaliation. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Air Force</span>, 10 MSPB at 17, 11 MSPR at 22.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if Campbell's motives were impure, he was not in a position that his recommendations would be accepted regardless of their merits. In fact, the evidence is that the Inspector General was personally involved in the details of the reorganization plan and drew advice from various staff members, Campbell being only one. Later, appellant presented his case to the Inspector General, who decided that the planned reorganization would go forward. Also, the Administrator of the agency separately approved the reorganization. Thus, Campbell's role was not shown to have been so dominant as to taint the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Clark v. EEOC</span>, 42 MSPR 467, 477 (1989), provides another example of a case demonstrating how an untainted deciding official cleanses an action initiated by a proposing official who arguably would be in a position to take a reprisal. This theme was echoed in <span class="Italic">Webster v. Dept. of Army</span>, 911 F.2d 679, 687 (Fed. Cir. 1990), suggesting that a clean deciding official removed the element of animus as a significant motivating factor in the decision to remove an employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Karapinka v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 6 MSPR 124, 128 (1981) (no indication that the deciding official knew of the appellant's complaint about waste and mismanagement); <span class="Italic">Shockro v. FCC</span>, 5 MSPR 113, 118, 5 MSPB 181 (1981) (agency executives stated that they made decisions concerning the reorganization leading to a RIF without knowing of the appellant's congressional testimony). The Federal Circuit added in <span class="Italic">Laber v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3452), that for there to be reprisal against a person associated with a whistleblower, the official taking the action against the appellant must have had actual or constructive knowledge of the relationship. <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (reprisal can result if one agency official controls the decisional process to ensure a predetermined result against the appellant); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, 68 MSPR 398, 402-03 (1995) (AJ should have analyzed the racial discrimination defense to an indefinite suspension by considering the impact of the alleged racial animus of the proposing official).

<p class="Body-Text">The Board may have advanced its analysis in <span class="Italic">Peterson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 54 MSPR 178, 184 (1992), by implying that a deciding official knowledgeable of protected complaints cannot engage in reprisal if the deciding official was not accused of the underlying acts of discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]t is undisputed that Mr. Metz knew of the protected activities. Nevertheless, Mr. Metz was not accused of involvement in any of the alleged acts of prohibited discrimination. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant failed to show that the adverse action could have been in retaliation for his protected activities. Therefore, we find that the appellant failed to prove his allegation of reprisal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Canada v. DHS</span>, 113 MSPR 509, 517 &#x00B6; 17, 2010 MSPB 69 (2010), the unbiased nature of the entity that proposed the action was a factor in the Board's decision that reprisal (for prior involvement in providing testimony in an MSPB case) did not influence the decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the evidence indicates that the appellants' discipline was proposed by the agency's Discipline Review Board rather than any specific agency official. The deciding official testified during the Canada hearing that the Discipline Review Board is composed of "senior employees within the organization that review...reports either from Internal Affairs or other investigative bodies" to determine if a disciplinary action should be issued. He further testified that the Discipline Review Board meets in Washington, D.C., that he has no contact with and provides no input to the Discipline Review Board when it is investigating and deliberating a particular case, and that he did not participate in the Discipline Review Board's investigation. The appellants failed to provide any evidence indicating a connection between the Discipline Review Board, which initially proposed the actions that the deciding official eventually mitigated, and the appellants' sworn statements and testimony provided in the agency's investigation of the third-line supervisor and the subsequent Board appeal. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge properly concluded that the appellants failed to establish that the agency reduced them in grade and pay as a result of their participation in the investigation of their third-line supervisor and their subsequent participation in his appeal before the Board.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In an appeal involving violation of the civil rights laws, some courts may be less willing than the Board or the Federal Circuit to permit an action motivated by discrimination to pass muster because it was blessed by a neutral deciding official. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crawford v.
