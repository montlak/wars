<p class="Block-Quote1">In her request for review of the arbitrator's decision, the appellant challenges the arbitrator's findings regarding her claims that the agency's third charge constituted an infringement of her right to engage in union activities in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102 ("Employees' rights") and harmful procedural error in violation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. The Board treats the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement to which the agency is a party in the same manner that it treats provisions of agency regulations, and it will enforce employee rights derived from such agreements. <span class="Italic">See Randle v. Department of the Navy</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 574, 581 (1991).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's third charge, which was upheld by the arbitrator, concerned a memorandum that was sent to the appellant dated August 27, 2002 concerning her use of official time. The memorandum advised the appellant that she must obtain prior approval before utilizing official time, pursuant to Article 7, Section 7.07 of the parties' CBA. The appellant first challenged the agency's instructions set forth in that memorandum in an unfair labor practice charge filed with the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). However, upon reviewing the evidence submitted in support of the charge, the FLRA found that the issuance of a complaint was not warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like the FLRA, the arbitrator in this case rejected the appellant's claim that the agency's instruction that she obtain approval before utilizing official time was contrary to past practice and, therefore, a violation of the parties' CBA and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102. The arbitrator observed that at the time of the incidents giving rise to this case, the appellant was only authorized to spend 25% of her time on union business, whereas she had previously been authorized to spend 100% of her time on union business and, consequently, had not been required to seek prior approval before engaging in representational activities. The arbitrator also rejected the appellant's claim that the agency improperly instructed her to divulge the specific nature of her union business, in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102. According to the arbitrator, the agency only required that she provide general accounting codes related to her representational activities so that it would be able to accurately account for her official time use.</p>

The appellant was charged with using a government computer to access child pornography. The Board omitted to state why the deciding official was at a level higher than the division chief, but from the nature of the harmful procedural error issue presented to the Board, it can be presumed that there was proof that the result (removal of the employee) could have been different had the division chief decided the case. Without examining or commenting on any evidence that may have been offered concerning the negotiating history of the MOU, the Board declared the case to be precedential, justifying the agency's elevation of the level of the deciding official:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency violated an MOU with the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) when it assigned Dr. Clark to serve, in place of Dr. Wright, as the proposing and <span id="Page_3145"></span>deciding official, (This opinion will generally refer only to the "deciding official" since it is uncontested that whomever the agency designated would act as both the proposing and the deciding official.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In September 1985, the agency and the AFGE entered into an MOU establishing a procedure for designating "proposing/deciding officials." Paragraph 1 of the MOU provides as follows: "Division Chiefs or their equivalents will normally serve as both Proposing and Deciding Official on conduct-based actions." Paragraph 3(b) of the MOU states, in relevant part, that a "higher level management official will be the Proposing and Deciding Official for...conduct-based actions in precedent-setting cases." Thus, under the terms of the MOU, Division Chiefs or their equivalents would "normally" act as deciding officials, but the agency reserved the right to name a higher-ranking official as the deciding official in "precedent-setting cases" involving misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Wright was the Chief of the Statistical Research Division where the appellant was assigned. Under the MOU, he or his equivalent would "normally" be designated as the deciding official when the charged misconduct concerned an employee in the Statistical Research Division. The agency has shown, however, that this was a "precedent-setting" case which allowed it under the MOU to designate Dr. Clark as the deciding official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MOU's provision that division chiefs or equivalent officials will "normally" serve as proposing and deciding officials indicates that the agency and the union regarded most disciplinary decisions as other than "precedent-setting," as they used that term. Indeed, the record shows that the agency has rarely invoked this provision.[2] Under these circumstances, we find that the provision at issue here covers cases that differ significantly from those the agency has handled previously, i.e., that it covers cases that will set a precedent in an area where there previously was none.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The assistant chief of the agency's human relations division testified that there had been only one other case, since the CBA went into effect in 1985, in which an official higher than the division chief served as the deciding official in an action against a member of the bargaining unit. She also indicated that a higher-level official was designated because the division chief "had not been to work in a long time," because he "was afraid that the employee might decide to go after him," and because "he just didn't want to do anything." Evidently, therefore, the present case is the only one in which the agency has invoked the "precedent-setting" provision. We do not conclude from this, however, that the agency must distinguish this case from all other cases since 1985. The MOU provision at issue here does not require that all "precedent-setting" cases must be decided by an official above the division director level. Instead, it only provides that they "may be" decided by such an official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The present case meets this criterion. The agency submitted unrebutted evidence that no Census Bureau employee had ever been accused of or charged with the type of misconduct in which the appellant had engaged. A search of the agency's records revealed that although prior cases involved misuse of agency computers, they dealt with matters such as using the computers for homeowners' association business or personal tax matters. At the union's request, the agency looked for any other case in which a Census Bureau employee may have used agency Internet access and computer equipment to download and possess images of children engaged in sexually graphic activities. It found no such case. Moreover, we find that the criminal nature of the appellant's use of the computer distinguishes this case significantly from the other unauthorized uses mentioned above. Thus, on its facts, this case was precedent-setting.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we find that the agency was authorized to designate, as the deciding official in this case, an official above the division director level, that the appellant accordingly has not shown that the agency violated the MOU, and that he therefore has not substantiated his claim of harmful procedural error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On review, the Board's decision was affirmed, although for reasons different than those expressed by the Board, <span class="Italic">Bross v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 389 F.3d 1212, 1216-17 (Fed. Cir. 2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We think the agreement is clear that the question of discipline must be addressed by the Division Chief or equivalent, unless (1) a higher level of management makes a determination to serve as the Proposing and Deciding Official; (2) that decision is based on the precedent-setting nature of the case; and (3) that the determination of the precedent-setting nature of the case is reasonable. The appellant contends that none of these requirements was satisfied here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bross first contends that the decision to elevate a case under Paragraph 3(a) of the MOU must be made explicitly by a high-level management official and that no such determination was made in this case. Rather, he contends that the decision to displace Wright as the Proposing and Deciding Official was made by personnel staff. Commerce contends that the decision to elevate was made in this case by Clark. The undisputed record supports Commerce's view that Clark made this determination. Clark indicated to Wright during their first meeting that she "would likely be the...proposing and deciding official in the case." While the record demonstrates that staff from personnel did encourage Clark to take the case, as Bross himself acknowledged, there is no evidence in the record that "the MOU placed the personnel shop in other than an advisory role." The fact that other members of the agency at the time also decided that the matter should be elevated to Clark's level does not establish that Clark herself did not make the decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the appellant claims that Clark did not herself make the determination that the case was precedent-setting. While Clark did not explicitly state that she made herself the decision-maker because of the precedent-setting nature of the case, she was advised that "there had not been similar offenses [and] ...it was one of the most serious offenses that the Census Bureau [had] dealt with." She also made it clear that she believed her authority to displace Wright rested in the MOU. Although it would have been preferable for Clark's determination of the precedent-setting nature of the case to have been made in a more explicit fashion, the plain language of the MOU does not so require; Paragraph 3(a) simply states that a "higher level management official may be the Proposing and Deciding Official for...conduct-based actions in precedent-setting cases."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Bross argues that even if a determination was made as to the precedent-setting nature of Bross's case, it was unreasonable. We disagree. We have no difficulty concluding on this record that substantial evidence supports the Board's conclusion that the determination that Bross's case was precedent-setting was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Bross's case was not the first case to involve unauthorized use of an agency computer, the parties agree that it was the first case involving the unauthorized use of a computer to access child pornography. The Board also found that the criminal nature of Bross's use of the computer distinguished this case significantly from other Census cases, and that "on its facts, [Bross's] case was precedent-setting." 94 M.S.P.R. at 667. We agree. The reasonableness of this determination is also demonstrated by the validity of the agency's concerns that unlimited access by the probation officer to Bross's work computer under the terms of his parole might negatively affect public trust in the Census Bureau's ability to protect the confidential and private nature of individual data.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bross also argues that it is unreasonable to elevate a precedent-setting case under Paragraph 3(a) of the MOU for the purpose of providing a harsher penalty. We disagree. The MOU does not bar the agency from factoring in the likelihood that a Division Chief's potential decision will be overly lenient (or overly harsh) in relation to the underlying conduct, and the impact that the imposition of a particular penalty would have on the functioning of the agency in the future. Clark was plainly concerned that Wright might not impose sufficient discipline, and that the imposition of insufficient discipline would create an undesirable precedent for the agency. She specifically noted "the serious nature of the incident, the misdemeanor and because [Wright] and his staff seemed--appeared to be so closely involved that they weren't recognizing the potential for adverse implications on the Census Bureau." Personnel officials advising Clark and responsible for assessing the impact of individual adverse action determinations upon the rest of the agency found that "it would have created a very bad precedent to have had a very light penalty or a light penalty in this kind of situation." We hold that it is reasonable to consider the impact that the penalty imposed in a precedential case will have on the rest of the agency when deciding to elevate the case to a higher-level official.</p>
