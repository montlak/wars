<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-421"><span class="space">a.</span> Support Personnel; Attorney-Client Relationship</h5>
<p class="noindent">Counsel fees are for counsel, that is, members of the bar, their law clerks, paralegals and supervised law students. 5 CFR 550.807(f) (2022); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Gallery of Art and AFGE Local 1831</span>, 39 FLRA 226, 236 (1991). Applying <span class="Italic">Nat'l Gallery of Art</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO and DHHS, SSA, Baltimore</span>, 49 FLRA 1666, 1671 (1994), concluded that the Back Pay Act does not provide for recovery of expert witness fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">The requirement of an attorney-client relationship is readily met. Counsel need not be present at a hearing; however, to qualify for a fee recovery, an attorney-client relationship must exist, <span class="Italic">Alabama ACT and DOD, Alabama NG</span>, 56 FLRA 231, 233 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2484"></span>[U]nder 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g) a prerequisite to awarding fees is a finding that fees were incurred by the employee. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.807(f). Attorney fees are "incurred" when an attorney-client relationship exists and counsel has rendered legal services on behalf of the employee. <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2030 and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Idaho Falls District, Idaho Falls, Idaho, </span>54 FLRA 626, 628 (1998); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3882 v. FLRA, et. al,</span> 944 F.2d 922, 933 (D.C. Cir. 1991). An attorney-client relationship exists when an attorney represents the employee on behalf of a union. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine and National</span> <span class="Italic">Association of Agriculture Employees, </span>53 FLRA 1688, 1691 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Animal and Plant</span>). This relationship is not severed even though the Union actually incurs the attorney fees on behalf of the employee. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Finally, representation of the grievant at the arbitration hearing is not a precondition to reimbursement under the Back Pay Act for post-hearing representational activities. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social</span> <span class="Italic">Security Administration and American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local 1923, </span>48 FLRA 1040, 1047 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator found that no attorney-client relationship existed. To support this contention, the Agency refers to findings of the Arbitrator that counsel was not at the hearing and was not mentioned until a request for attorney fees was submitted. As such, according to the Agency, no attorney-client relationship existed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award, however, clearly indicates that "[t]he fees were incurred by the Bargaining Unit Representative on behalf of the employee." This is sufficient to find that the fees were incurred by the employee under section 7701(g). <span class="Italic">Animal and Plant</span>, 53 FLRA at 1691. Moreover, it is undisputed that a posthearing brief was filed by an attorney on behalf of the grievant and for his benefit. Given this, the Agency's argument that no attorney-client relationship existed is not supported by the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">The issue of the attorney-client relationship as to fees claimed by counsel working with unions on employees' claims presented through grievances was again addressed, and again resolved in favor of standing by those counsel to claim fees, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot and AFGE Local 2142</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v58/58-017.html">58 FLRA 87</a>, 90 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision by the Back Pay Act for the payment of attorney fees shifts the payment of attorney fees in a reasonable amount from the employee to the agency, as a matter of law. Consequently, statutory attorney fees under the Act do not require that there must first be some agreement to that effect between employees and their legal representatives. In this case, the grievants incurred attorney fees by agreement with the two law firms, which provided counsel, and the obligation to make payment of a reasonable amount of those fees shifted to the Agency when the grievants prevailed and the other requirements of the Act were met.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the federal sector, the large unions have staff attorneys who provide representation, often with the assistance of paid field office staff who function similar to private-sector union business agents. <span class="Italic">FDIC, Div. of Info. Resource Mgmt., and NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA 1657, 1660-63 (1998), sustained an arbitration award that granted a counsel fee petition filed by a national union staff attorney and that included as part of the fee award compensation for the time of a nonattorney union field representative who provided paralegal assistance to and at the direction of union counsel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fees in this case were awarded pursuant to the Back Pay Act.&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596. That statute requires, among other things, that an award of fees must be in accordance with the standards established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), which pertains to attorney fee awards by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).<span class="Italic"> See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense, Defense Distribution Region East, New Cumberland</span>, <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 2004</span>, 51 FLRA 155, 158 (1995) (<span class="Italic">DDRE</span>). Section 7701(g)(1) applies to all cases except those involving allegations of employment discrimination and applies in this case. When exceptions concern the attorney fee standards established under section 7701(g)(1), the Authority looks to the decisions of the MSPB and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for guidance. <span class="Italic">See DDRE</span>, 51 FLRA at 160 n.5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Among the requirements for an award of attorney fees under section 7701(g)(1) is the requirement that the fees must have been incurred by the employee. <span class="Italic">See DDRE</span>, 51 FLRA at 158. Because the Agency only challenges the Arbitrator's determination that the fees were incurred, we do not need to consider the other requirements of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, North Chicago</span>, <span class="Italic">Illinois and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 2107</span>, 52 FLRA 387, 398 n.9 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Attorney fees are incurred by an employee within the meaning of section 7701(g)(1) when an attorney-client relationship exists and the attorney has rendered legal services on behalf of the employee. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration and</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923</span>, 48 FLRA 1040, 1047 (1993). Both the Authority and the MSPB have interpreted this requirement as requiring the denial of fees to non-attorney representatives. <span class="Italic">See National Gallery of</span> <span class="Italic">Art; Horton [v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 232 (1981)]. In addition, regulations implementing the Back Pay Act provide that "attorney fees shall be allowed only for the services of members of the Bar and for the services of law clerks, paralegals, or law students, when assisting members of the Bar." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.807(f).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Gallery of Art</span>, the Authority overturned an arbitrator's award of attorney fees for an individual who appeared on behalf of the union at the hearing. As pertinent here, the Authority concluded that the award conflicted with section 550.807(f). The Authority noted that as the individual was neither a member of a law firm nor a union-employed attorney, it was not apparent that the individuals participation warranted an award of attorney fees. In <span class="Italic">Horton</span>, the MSPB ruled that an employee was not entitled to an award of attorney fees when he was represented by an individual who was not an attorney. 7 MSPR at 235.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As section 550.807(f) makes clear, however, compensation is available for clerks, paralegals, or law students who are assisting in representation provided by an attorney. The rationale for including charges for such non-attorneys in fee awards is that they provide necessary services which, were they performed by attorneys, would be more costly. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration v. Goodman</span>, 33 MSPR 325, 337 (1987); <span class="Italic">see also Cook v. Brown</span>, 68 F.3d 447, 453 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> and <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, the MSPB awarded attorney fees under section 7701(g)(1) for the services of a legal assistant and law students, respectively. In <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, the employee was represented at the hearing by a law school graduate, who was a legal assistant to an attorney with the retained law firm, but who was not a member of the bar. In <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, the employee retained an attorney, who was employed by a law school and practiced with a law school clinic. The employee was represented at the hearing by law students from the clinic. In both cases, the MSPB ruled that an award of fees for the services of the non-attorneys was appropriate because an attorney-client relationship existed and the involvement of the nonattorneys was under the direct supervision of, and as agent for, the retained attorney. <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 55 MSPR at 551; <span class="Italic">Mitchell,</span> 6 MSPR at 23.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the national counsel, an attorney, was responsible for directing and overseeing all aspects of the case. In addition, he found that the field representative performed services as a paralegal under the supervision of, and as the agent for, the national counsel. Under these circumstances, the Arbitrator's finding of an attorney-client relationship and the award of fees for the paralegal services of the field representative is consistent with case precedent and section 550.807(f). In particular, the award is consistent with <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> and <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> and distinguishable from <span class="Italic">National Gallery of Art</span> and <span class="Italic">Horton</span>. Further, we do not agree with the Agency that a different result is dictated by the Authority's statement, in <span class="Italic">Naval Air Development Center</span>, 21 FLRA at 136, that "[a]n attorney-client relationship must exist and the attorney must have rendered legal services on behalf of the appellant." The Arbitrator found that the appropriate relationship existed and the regulation indicates that the services at issue may be considered compensable legal services.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are not persuaded by the Agency's arguments that <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> and <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> are not controlling in this case. We reject the Agency's attempt to distinguish these cases on the basis that the representative here was not a law school graduate or student. There is nothing in <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> or <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> that precludes an award of fees for paralegal services. Moreover, section 550.807(f) specifically provides for an award of fees for the services of paralegals, in addition to providing for fees for the services of law clerks and law students.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's argument that because there is no evidence that the grievant ever consulted with the national counsel, there necessarily was no attorney-client relationship in this case. Certainly, in the usual case, an attorney-client relationship is initiated by a client's intent to seek legal advice from an attorney. However, the Agency fails to establish any deficiency in the Arbitrator's finding that an attorney-client relationship existed under the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that, in the context of the Union's representation of the grievant, the grievant's awareness of the attorney's role was not critical. He reasoned that "with an attorney representing the Agency, she, and all employees, most likely assume that their union dues includes payment for legal representation when necessary." Furthermore, the Agency has not excepted to the Arbitrator's award of fees for the 10 hours of work performed by the national counsel on the case. Thus, the Agency has, in effect, conceded that an attorney-client relationship existed between the national counsel and the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In both <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> and <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, the employees were represented by non-attorneys before the administrative judges and nothing in either decision indicates that these individuals were not acting as the employees' representatives. There is nothing to suggest that the governing standards go beyond the requirements expressly set out in <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> and <span id="page_2485"></span><span class="Italic">Anderson</span>: (1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship; and (2) the functioning of the non-attorney representative under the supervision of, and as an agent for, the attorney. In this case, the Arbitrator specifically found that both of these elements were satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">FDIC</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 63 FLRA 492, 493-94 (2009) (reconsideration denied, 63 FLRA 653 (2009)), sustaining an award of fees for a law clerk working under the supervision of an attorney who was awarded fees in a challenge to a suspension:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that attorney fees are not payable for the services of the non-attorney, staff representative and that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">FDIC.</span> In <span class="Italic">FDIC,</span> the arbitrator awarded attorney fees for the services of a non-attorney, union field representative, who performed services as a paralegal under the supervision of, and as an agent for, a union staff attorney. <span class="Italic">FDIC,</span> 53 FLRA at 1657-58. Relying on the decisions of the MSPB in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Government Printing Office,</span> 55 MSPR 548 (1992) (GPO) and <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. United States Postal Service,</span> 6 MSPR 22 (1981), the Authority stated the standards for the payment of attorney fees for the services of a non-attorney, as follows: (1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship; and (2) the functioning of the non-attorney representative under the supervision of, and as an agent for, the attorney. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1663. The Authority rejected the agency's claim that attorney fees were not payable for the services of the field representative because he did not act as a paralegal assisting an attorney, but, instead, acted as the grievant's representative before the arbitrator. The agency asserted that, for attorney fees to be payable for paralegal services, the legal services of the attorney must predominate and the paralegal services must be ancillary to those legal services. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1659. The Authority concluded that the standards do not preclude an award of attorney fees for paralegals representing grievants before arbitrators, as long as the representative is functioning under the supervision of, and as an agent for, an attorney. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1663. The Authority explained that the rationale for including such services in attorney fee awards is that the non-attorney provides necessary services, which, if they were performed by an attorney, would be more costly. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1661.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">FDIC</span> fully supports the award in this case. In both cases, a non-attorney, union staff representative represented a grievant before an arbitrator, while supervised by a union staff attorney. Although the Arbitrator in this case found it unnecessary to specifically address whether the staff representative acted as an agent for the staff attorney, the necessary relationship is clearly established. As the Arbitrator emphasized, both the staff representative and the staff attorney are employed by the Union and together represented the grievant on behalf of the Union. This relationship is identical to the relationship found to satisfy the legal and regulatory requirements in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>. Accordingly, we conclude that the standards are satisfied and that attorney fees are payable for the non-attorney services provided by the Union staff representative. The Agency's arguments fail to establish otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award of attorney fees for the services of the staff representative is deficient because she was the "lead" representative for the Union and, consequently, was not "assisting" a member of the Bar, as required by &#x00A7; 550.807(f). The Authority rejected such an argument in <span class="Italic">FDIC.</span> The Authority held that there is no statutory or regulatory requirement that the legal services of the attorney must predominate and that the paralegal services must be ancillary to those legal services. <span class="Italic">See FDIC,</span> 53 FLRA at 1659, 1663. We also reject the Agency's argument that this case is distinguishable from FDIC because attorney fees were payable for the services of the non-attorney in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> on the basis that he was a "professionally trained paralegal[.]" Section 550.807(f) specifically provides for the payment of attorney fees for the services of paralegals while assisting members of the Bar. The regulation does not define "paralegal" or "services of...paralegals!.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.807(f). The regulation also does not require professional training as a paralegal to be entitled to attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In construing &#x00A7; 550.807(f) in <span class="Italic">FDIC,</span> the Authority held that the standards do not go beyond the existence of an attorney-client relationship and the functioning of the non-attorney representative under the supervision of, and as an agent for, the attorney. <span class="Italic">FDIC,</span> 53 FLRA at 1663. Accordingly, neither &#x00A7; 550.807(f) nor <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> imposes requirements that preclude payment for the services of the staff representative in this case.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;In addition, the Agency claims that the staff representative asserted that she is a law clerk and disputes that she is entitled to attorney fees as a law clerk. It is not clear that the staff representative made such an assertion. However, because the staff representative's services are properly viewed as paralegal services, the Agency's claim provides no basis on which to find the award of attorney fees for those services deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">Time for a nonattorney advisor or assistant was also awarded, and the award was sustained, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA 574, 576-77 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.807(f) provides, in pertinent part, that "[t]he payment of reasonable attorney fees shall be allowed only for the services of members of the Bar and for the services of law clerks, paralegals, or law students, when assisting members of the Bar." As the Authority has recognized, the rationale for allowing fees for time spent by such law clerks, paralegals or law students is that they provide necessary services that, if performed by attorneys, would be more costly. <span class="Italic">See FAA, citing Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp, Div. of Info. Res. Mgmt, Atlanta, Ga.,</span> 53 FLRA 1657, 1661 (1998) (<span class="Italic">FDIC</span>). In <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, the arbitrator found that a national counsel, an attorney, was responsible for directing and overseeing all aspects of the case and that a field representative performed services as a paralegal under the supervision of, and as the agent for, the national counsel. The Authority upheld the award of fees for the paralegal services of the field representative as consistent with case precedent and &#x00A7; 550.807(f). In addition, the Authority noted that in at least two decisions, the MSPB awarded attorney fees for the services of law students and legal assistants. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Anderson,</span> 55 M.S.P.R. 548, and <span class="Italic">Mitchell,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 22). In both decisions, the MSPB found that an award of fees for the services of non-attorneys was appropriate because their involvement was under the direct supervision of, and as the agent for, an attorney. In <span class="Italic">FAA,</span> the Authority applied <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> and found that a non-attorney, union staff representative was entitled to attorney fees for reasons similar to those in <span class="Italic">FDIC.</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> 63 FLRA at 493-94.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the Arbitrator considered <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> materially indistinguishable from this case. Moreover, it is clear from the fee award as a whole that the Arbitrator found that the Union's Acting Director of Labor Relations was responsible for directing and overseeing Staff Representative's work. Thus, the Arbitrator effectively found that the Staff Representative worked under the direct supervision of an attorney, as required by &#x00A7; 550.807(f). Moreover, by finding that the Union incurred "necessary attorney fees," the Arbitrator effectively rejected the Agency's assertion that the services of the Acting Director of Labor Relations were provided solely to form the basis for a fee request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Arbitrator's award of attorney fees for the services of the Staff Representative and the Acting Director of Labor Relations is consistent with &#x00A7; 550.807(f) and precedent interpreting that regulation. Thus, we deny the Agency's contrary-to-law exception.</p>
