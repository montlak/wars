<h6 class="h6" id="sec8-10"><span class="space">(i)</span> Historical Application of <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Cook</span></span> and Related Decisions</h6>
<p class="Body-Text">The ability of an agency to take adverse action based on approved leave, including LWOP, is tangled--too much so to straighten out by an evolutionary parsing of decades of decisions directly or indirectly addressing the topic. In this section we cautiously trace the decisions predating the Board's attempt in <span class="Italic">McCauley</span> to provide a grand unifying theory. To the extent the <span class="Italic">McCauley</span> analysis is not quite as unifying as the Board might hope, these cases may be of assistance, depending on specific factual contexts. The historical discussion is included because fact patterns may arise that make some of the material relevant. Additionally, the Board swings back and forth in its development of the law. What was once the law, and now overruled, may again creep back into the law as Board membership changes or, as occasionally occurs, OPM takes sufficient interest in an issue to pursue it, first through the reconsideration process with the Board, and then into the Federal Circuit, or failing to then achieve success through adjudication, OPM changes government-wide regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The exception to the rule that adverse action should not be taken on the basis of approved leave was addressed in the somewhat opaque analysis in <span class="Italic">Ryan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/RYAN_RAYMOND_H_DA_0752_06_0393_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_291109.pdf">107 MSPR 71</a>, 73-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 5-7, 2007 MSPB 240 (2007) (modified or overruled by <span class="Italic">McCauley v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/updatelinks.htm">116 MSPR 484</a>, 489-90 &#x00B6; 10, 2011 MSPB 59 (2011), <span class="Italic">supra</span>), applicable only to employees on long-term unscheduled leave without pay when (1) An employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond his control so that agency approval or disapproval of leave was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job; (2) the absences continued beyond a reasonable time, and the agency warned the employee that an adverse action could be taken unless the employee became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and (3) the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis and as noted in <span class="Italic">Curtis v. USPS, supra,</span> when the employee cannot return to duty because of the continuing effects of illness or injury. Under <span class="Italic">Ryan</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective March 21, 2006, the agency removed the appellant, a GS-12 Aerospace Engineer, based on a charge of excessive absence. In the agency's January 20, 2006 notice of proposed removal, it alleged that the appellant performed the essential duties of his position less than 50% of the time from July 24, 2005, through November 18, 2005, and failed to report to work after November 18, 2005, without providing sufficient medical documentation. The agency further noted that, while the appellant's absences may have been a result of circumstances beyond his control, the lack of a foreseeable end to his absence was causing undue hardship on the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general rule, an agency's approval of leave for unscheduled absences precludes the agency from taking an adverse action on the basis of those absences. <span class="Italic">Holderness v. Defense Commissary Agency,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 401, 404 (1997). An exception to this general rule exists where an employee makes excessive use of unscheduled leave without pay (LWOP). <span class="Italic">Id.; see Cook,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. at 611-12. To sustain an action based on excessive approved absences, an agency must establish that: (1) An employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond his control so that agency approval or disapproval of leave was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job; (2) the absences continued beyond a reasonable time, and the agency warned the employee that an adverse action could be taken unless the employee became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and (3) the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. <span class="Italic">Cook,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. at 611-12. This exception, however, only applies in a situation where the employee's absence was due to excessive use of unscheduled LWOP. <span class="Italic">Holderness,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. at 404.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge found that the agency met the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> criteria and sustained the charge of excessive absence. The agency, however, presented no evidence that the appellant made excessive use of unscheduled LWOP. In fact, it presented no evidence that the appellant was carried on LWOP at all. Rather, the appellant used sick leave to work a reduced schedule from July 24, 2005, through November 18, 2005, as an accommodation for his back injury, and used sick, annual, and holiday leave, among other leave, to cover the period from November 18, 2005, to January 2, 2006. Thus the exception in <span class="Italic">Cook</span> does not apply. <span class="Italic">See Holderness,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. at 404. Accordingly, since the agency has not shown that the appellant was on LWOP during the period of charged absences, and <span class="Italic">Cook</span> only applies in situations where the employee's absences were due to excessive use of LWOP, the administrative judge erred by applying the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> exception in this case. <span class="Italic">See Holderness,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. at 404.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While there is some conflicting evidence regarding whether the appellant was AWOL from January 3, 2006, through the effective date of his removal, resolution of this issue is unnecessary since the agency did not charge the appellant with AWOL, and an adverse action cannot be upheld on the basis of a charge that the agency could have brought, but did not. <span class="Italic">See Nazelrod v. Department of Justice,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. 461, 466 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 43 F.3d 663 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's charge of unacceptable attendance was based on absences totaling 81 days, of which 1 day was approved sick leave, 3 days were AWOL, and 77 days were approved LWOP. With regard to the single day of sick leave, we note that an agency cannot discipline an individual for his use of approved sick leave. <span class="Italic">Ryan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 71, &#x00B6; 6 (2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Holderness v.

Therefore, we do not take into consideration the appellant's use of 1 day of approved sick leave in deciding this appeal. We next examine whether the appellant's use of 77 days of unscheduled but approved LWOP and 3 days of AWOL constitutes unacceptable attendance/failure to meet the attendance requirements of his position. <span class="Italic">See Gartner</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 10 (combining consideration of AWOL and LWOP absences to determine if charge of excessive absences could be sustained).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's approval of unscheduled leave generally precludes the agency from taking adverse action on the basis of those absences. <span class="Italic">Combs v. Social Security Administration,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 14 (2002) (citing <span class="Italic">Rabago v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;There is also an exception permitting an agency to discipline an employee for failing to follow leave-requesting procedures, even though the agency approves the leave, where the employee was on notice of the agency's requirements. <span class="Italic">Holderness,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. at 404; <span class="Italic">Fleming v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 302, 308 (1986). In this case, however, the exception is not applicable, because the appellant was not charged with failing to properly request leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to take an adverse action against an employee based on excessive use of unscheduled LWOP, an agency must show that: (1) The employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond his control so that the agency's approval or disapproval of leave was immaterial, because the employee could not be on the job; (2) the absences continued beyond a reasonable time, and the agency warned the employee that an adverse action could be taken unless the employee became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and (3) the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. <span class="Italic">Ryan,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 71, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Holderness,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. at 404; <span class="Italic">Cook,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. at 611-12. In addition, an adverse action should be taken only under unusual circumstances, such as when the employee cannot return to duty because of the continuing effects of illness or injury. <span class="Italic">Gartner,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Combs</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant has at all times asserted that he was incapacitated for duty. HCD. He also has produced forms signed by his physician stating that he was unable to work during the entire period for which he had unscheduled absences. Furthermore, although the agency found the appellant's medical documentation inadequate under the ELM, it does not dispute that he had incapacitating medical conditions. We find that the agency may rely upon the appellant's representations <span id="Page_2435"></span>that he was unable to work, for which it approved LWOP in lieu of sick leave. Therefore, we find that the record shows that the agency's approval or disapproval of the appellant's leave was immaterial, because he could not work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's absences on AWOL and LWOP, together totaling 80 days, clearly continued beyond a reasonable time. The agency warned the appellant in its letter of July 18, 2007, that disciplinary action could result if he failed to return to work. The appellant also had prior discipline for unscheduled absences, i.e., a February 2006 suspension and an April 2007 Letter of Warning. Furthermore, Stark and Kim testified that the appellant's extended absence resulted in untimely mail deliveries and caused changes in other employees' schedules and workloads. HCD. We therefore find that all three of the above criteria for taking an adverse action based on excessive use of unscheduled LWOP have been met. It also appears, based on his testimony and record of continuing absences, that the appellant was unable to return to work because of the effects of his medical conditions. Accordingly, we find that the agency's removal of the appellant for unacceptable attendance, i.e., his excessive use of unscheduled LWOP in conjunction with the AWOL absences, was properly sustained. <span class="Italic">See Gartner,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The history of <span class="Italic">Ryan</span> is traced below.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An initial decision reprinted in <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. USPS</span>, 1 MSPR 498, 499-50 (1979) (initial decision), first stated the exception to the rule against taking action against employees who use LWOP--an agency may remove an employee who is known to be unable to return to duty because of illness or injury:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice of January 19, 1979 proposed the appellant's removal for the following reason:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"There is reason to believe that you are physically unable to perform your assigned duties. Your absences have continued beyond a reasonable period of time as you have been in a leave without pay status in excess of two (2) years due to illness or injury."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee is absent from work in a leave without pay status, his absence is approved. When the Postal Service exercised its authority to carry the appellant in an approved leave status, the employee was released from his obligation to report for duty and his absence did not constitute a breach of the employer-employee relationship. Accordingly, an adverse action based upon absence on approved leave in any amount fails to state a cause of action and the disciplinary action based thereon is not for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is, however, one exception to the above policy which provides that an agency may rely upon approved leave without pay as a basis for removal when:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The employee was prevented from reporting for duty by compelling reasons beyond his control,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The absences continued beyond a reasonable period of time, and,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The employee was warned that an adverse action might be initiated unless he became available for duty on a regular, full-time basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This exception is designed to allow an agency to remove an employee who is known to be unable to return to duty because of illness or injury, as is the case in the instant appeal, and is not expected to be used as a remedy for common attendance problems. My examination of the record in the instant case discloses that the removal action on appeal herein falls within the exception. The record reflects that the appellant was unable to report for duty due to circumstances relating to his illness or injury, that the absences continued beyond a reasonable period of time, more than two years, and that the appellant was warned by letter dated December 12, 1978, that adverse action would be initiated against him unless he became available for duty on a full-time basis. Accordingly, I find that the appellant's absences in a leave without pay status falls within the exception above-cited and that the Postal Service has set forth a proper cause of action for the appellant's removal in the instant case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the merits of the agency's reason, the record is replete with evidence supportive of the agency's reasons that the appellant was in fact continually absent for a period exceeding two years prior to the effective date of his removal. The appellant has acknowledged his absence citing his medical problems as the basis therefor. Accordingly, I find that the agency's reason for the appellant's removal is supported by a preponderance of the evidence and that reason is, therefore, sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although <span class="Italic">McKenzie</span> did not cite the basis for its rationale, the Board adopted OPM guidance in the (now defunct) FPM Ch. 752, Subch. 3, &#x00A7; 3-2b(4)(c) providing the exception to the general rule that adverse action could not be based on an employee's use of approved leave. The FPM section stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;The one exception to the general rule which most appellate decisions have upheld, is that adverse action may be taken based on a record of excessive unscheduled leave without pay (LWOP) when three criteria are met:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;The record shows the employee absent for compelling reasons beyond his control so that the agency approval was immaterial inasmuch as the employee could not be on the job;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;The absences continued beyond a reasonable time and the employee was warned that adverse action might be started unless the employee became available on a regular full-time or part-time basis; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;The agency shows that it was important for the position to be filled by an employee available for regular duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This exception would be applicable only under certain unusual circumstances, e.g., the inability of an employee to return to duty or to work on a regular basis because of the continuing effects of illness or injury (on or off-the-job). Other circumstances in individual cases may meet these criteria, but OPM believes they are uncommon. For example, repeated absences because of failure to obtain adequate transportation to work or to tend to personal affairs would presumably be situations under the control of the employee, and thus reasons for denial of leave and charges of AWOL. (Agencies with employees who are on leave while receiving employee's compensation will wish to be aware of the positions of chapter 353.)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board final decision, <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. USPS,</span> 1 MSPR 496, 497-98 (1980), recited:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no question that, as found by the presiding official, the appellant has not been present at work for some years. Removal for prolonged absence has long been considered just cause for removal, <span class="Italic">e.g. Rubin v. U.S.,</span> 150 Ct. Cl 28 (1960); <span class="Italic">Chiaverini v. U.S.,</span> 157 Ct. Cl. 371 (1962); <span class="Italic">Bond v. Vance,</span> 327 F.2d 901 (D.C. Cir. 1964). Employee absence for which no forseeable end is in sight is a burden which no employer can efficiently endure. The appellant, both on appeal and in his petition for review, argues in the main that the circumstances of his removal in 1970 were improper; that his back pay rights from the 1976 restoration have not been correctly settled; and that the agency has never established that he ever suffered from an on-the-duty injury or that he has been unable to work due to illness. He has not presented any new or material evidence that was not available when the record was closed. Further, the matters which the appellant is again attempting to argue were settled in prior appeals and thus were not properly before the presiding official at the time of the initial appeal. <span class="Italic">See Kessler v. General Services Administration,</span> 252 F. Supp. 629 (D.C.N.Y., 1966), where the court found judgments in prior cases were <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> of present claims relating to prior suspension and performance rating claims against the agency. Thus, the Board finds no indication that the initial decision of the presiding official was based on an erroneous interpretation of statute or regulation as it relates to the matters which were properly and currently before the presiding official.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dunnock v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 382, 383-86 (1983), ambiguously compared the application of <span class="Italic">Webb</span> and <span class="Italic">McKenzie</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Daniel H. Dunnock, (appellant) was removed from his position with the agency effective February 27,1981, based on his alleged "Failure to meet the requirements of his position, in that he failed to be regular in his attendance, as required by the Employee and Labor Relations Manual." The letter of proposed removal listed twenty-four (24) dates upon which the appellant was either late, AWOL, or on sick leave....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the matter of basing an adverse action on approved leave, subsequent to the issuance of the initial decision, the Board addressed this issue in <span class="Italic">Webb v. United States Postal Service,</span> 9 MSPB 749 (1982), where we held:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board concludes that it would be inequitable to allow an agency to take an adverse action against an employee based on his or her utilization of approved leave. Such would also be precluded by the laws (5 U.S.C. Ch. 63) and regulations (5 C.F.R. Part 630) that entitle an employee to use annual and sick leave within prescribed circumstances and limitations. Adverse actions based on periods of approved leave would have such a negative influence on the exercise of these rights so as to deny them. Additionally, the employer-employee relationship created at the time one commences his or her employment in the federal service allows for the adverse effects of approved leave usage to the extent that is properly exercised and is within the limits of the annual and sick leave periods specified. Therefore, an adverse action taken by an agency against an employee based on periods of approved leave is not "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Webb, supra</span>, at 753.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the Board finds that the presiding official improperly determined that approved leave could be used as a specification in support of the removal action. Thus, the charge against appellant is sustained only to the extent of the four specifications of AWOL, involving approximately 13 1/2 hours.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Presiding Official relied on <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. U.S. Postal Service,</span><span id="Page_2436"></span> 1 MSPB 480 (1980), to find that absences with no foreseeable end may be considered a just cause for removal, even when leave has been approved. That case differs from this one, however, in that removal there was based on a continuous absence for two years, and in the Board's finding that, as charged by the agency, appellant was "physically unable to perform the duties of his position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although periods of approved leave may not form the basis for an adverse action, nor may a prior disciplinary record based on approved leave be considered as warranting an enhanced penalty, an agency, in an otherwise appropriate case, may use an employee's record of approved leave in order to show that the employee is of marginal value to the agency because of his or her unreliable attendance. <span class="Italic">Cade v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 8 MSPB 362, 364, 8 M.S.P.R. 717, 721 (1981). An agency may properly consider an "employee's past work record, including length of service, performance on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability, as a factor in determining the appropriateness of a penalty." <span class="Italic">Douglas, supra.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dunnock</span> referenced <span class="Italic">Cade</span>, involving the removal of a Postal Service distribution clerk. Under <span class="Italic">Cade v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 717, 720 (1981), prior disciplinary actions for unsatisfactory attendance cannot be considered as aggravating factors under a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> penalty analysis when those prior actions involved approved leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have made it clear that a prior disciplinary record based on approved leave may not be treated as a disciplinary record warranting an enhanced penalty, we also point out that this principle need not preclude an agency, in an otherwise appropriate case, from showing that the employee is of marginal value to the agency because of his unreliable attendance. This evidence would be pertinent to an "employee's past work record, including length of service, performance on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability...." which is a factor relevant to the appropriateness of a penalty. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 332. The underlying facts relating to such a factor, of course, must be proven by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 324-25. An agency's reliance upon the employee's "past work record" is thus very different from its reliance on an employee's "past disciplinary record" as a factor relevant to the penalty, because the latter normally requires proof only of the disciplinary action and not of the underlying facts. In this case the agency did not present evidence, other than the disciplinary records themselves, tending to show that appellant was an unreliable employee due to excessive absenteeism.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board was unclear in <span class="Italic">Cade</span> whether it was establishing a category of adverse action based on unreliable attendance despite that attendance problem resulting from the use of approved leave. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-15-010.html#sec8-11">Unscheduled but Approved Absence Following Failure to Follow Procedure to Request Leave</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dornan v. IRS</span>, 7 MSPR 674, 675-77, 7 MSPB 499 (1981), sustained the removal for what appeared to be long-term AWOL of an employee who recovered from a job injury, but the Board applied the reasoning of <span class="Italic">McKenzie</span> and cited the former FPM even though LWOP did not seem to be the leave status of the employee for the period of the absence leading to removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant was employed by the Internal Revenue Service as a Tax Examiner when she suffered an on-the-job injury in November 1978. Appellant has been absent from work since that time except for a two-day period in April 1979 when she reported for duty. However, appellant experienced such discomfort during this time that she could not work and consequently left the office. Appellant received worker's compensation payments until April 1979, when the Department of Labor (DOL), based on the advice of a physician, determined that she was no longer totally disabled and could return to light duty. Accordingly, the agency offered her work which met the limitations outlined by the Office of Worker's Compensation Programs. Appellant failed to report for duty as directed by the agency. Based on the agency's offer of employment and her refusal, DOL terminated payments of worker's compensation. Two months later, the agency directed appellant to report for duty and advised her that failure to do so would result in changing her status to absence without leave. Appellant did not report for duty. In April 1980 the agency notified appellant that it intended to remove her based on two reasons: her continued absence which impaired the efficiency of her work unit, and unauthorized absence without adequate excuse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the agency's arguments regarding absent incumbents. Removal for prolonged absence has long been considered just cause for removal. In <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 1 MSPB 480, 481 (1980), the Board noted with regard to an employee who had been in a leave without pay status in excess of two years: "Employee absence for which no foreseeable end is in sight is a burden which no employer can efficiently endure."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, Section 3-2(b)(4)(C) of 752 FPM states that an adverse action based on a record of excessive unscheduled leave may be taken when the agency shows that the position needs to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. The testimony shows that during appellant's approximate two-year absence from her job, her supervisor had to recall and furlough seasonal employees and see that they were trained. In fact, the presiding official sustained the agency's charge that because of the appellant's continued absence, seasonal employees had to be recalled and furloughed to process the work appellant normally would have done. In addition, appellant testified that neither she nor her physician knows when she will be able to return to work. Therefore, we conclude that the agency would be unreasonably burdened by appellant's continued absence without leave and that it has established that her position needs to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rabago v. Dept. of Army</span>, 25 MSPR 530, 531-34 (1985), seemed to add a condition to removal for excessive unscheduled leave--that the employee fail to obey a directive to return to work and that the agency adverse action decision be based, at least in part, on AWOL:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Eva C. Rabago (appellant) filed a timely appeal from the action of the Department of the Army (agency) removing her from her position of Clerk Stenographer, effective October 5, 1982. The agency initiated the action based upon charges that appellant failed to maintain a proper work schedule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record indicates that appellant began her employment with the agency on September 26, 1980. On February 3, 1982 Major Donna LeMon, the chief of appellant's division, advised appellant that she proposed to remove appellant from her position. As grounds for the action, Major LeMon noted that appellant had been absent from duty for 1242 hours out of 2644 hours available for work from the date of her employment through January 23, 1982, and that the absences totaled over 47 percent of appellant's scheduled duty. On April 9, 1982, Colonel Leroy M. Barber, Executive Officer, issued a second written notice to appellant in which he advised her that he was cancelling the removal action and in its place substituting a letter of warning. The warning consisted of a notice that unless appellant was able to perform her duties on a regular full-time basis, action might be initiated to remove her from her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 16, 1982 Major LeMon again issued a notice of proposed removal to appellant because of failure to maintain a proper work schedule. The new proposal cited the earlier letter of warning and noted that since appellant's receipt of the warning, she had been absent an additional 209 hours as of July 28, 1982. These additional hours were all covered by sick leave, annual leave, leave without pay, or continuation of pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Webb v. United States Postal Service,</span> 9 MSPB 749, 753 (1982), we concluded that it would be unsuitable for an agency to base an adverse action on an employee's utilization of approved leave. We noted that the statutes and regulations controlling an employee's use of leave prescribe limitations on leave approval and use. Once an employee has obtained approval for leave, it would generally be inequitable to allow an agency to penalize an employee for absence from the work place, and it would not promote the efficiency of the service to do so. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Dunnock v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 3 MSPB 66, at 67-68, 14 M.S.P.R. 382 at 384-85 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we have also noted that Federal Personnel Manual (PPM) Chapter 752, Subchapter 2, paragraph 3-2b (4) (c), provides an exception to the general rule that an adverse action cannot be based on an employee's use of approved leave. <span class="Italic">See Cook v. Department of the Army,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. 610 (1984. The exception applies in situations where an employee makes excessive use of unscheduled leave without pay, and where the following three criteria are also met:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The record showed that the employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond his or her control so that agency approval or disapproval of leave was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case appellant had been frequently absent from the workplace over a two year period. However, the record indicates that the agency granted appellant approved leave for all of the absences. The agency has not shown that appellant was granted excessive unscheduled leave without pay to cover her absence. The record establishes that the agency predicated its adverse action on the basis of approved leave, contrary to the directive outlined in <span class="Italic">Webb,</span> and did not have a basis to claim the benefit of the FPM exception. <span class="Italic">See Cook, supra.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2437"></span>The presiding official, while noting the existence of the <span class="Italic">Webb</span> precedent, relied on <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 1 MSPB 480 (1980), in concluding that prolonged absence from the workplace can be a valid cause for removal. In <span class="Italic">McKenzie,</span> an employee was removed from his position after being in leave without pay status in excess of two years. The agency contacted the employee, and ordered him to report for duty within 14 days, or to contact the agency in writing if he was unable to report. The employee failed to report or otherwise reply to the agency directive. The agency sent a second request to the employee, informing the employee that if he failed to reply or report within 14 days, he would be removed. When the employee failed to respond to this second letter, the agency removed him. <span class="Italic">McKenzie, supra,</span> at 480-81.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, appellant was warned that her attendance had to improve or she would face adverse action. However, unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">McKenzie,</span> appellant did not disregard a specific order to report for duty. The employee in <span class="Italic">McKenzie,</span> by failing to report for work or to obtain agency authorization excusing his absence, was effectively absent without leave (AWOL). Although the agency also provided a warning to appellant in the instant case, the agency has not shown that it directed appellant to report for duty and that appellant failed to report without obtaining leave to excuse her absence. Thus, the instant case can be distinguished from <span class="Italic">McKenzie.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its reply to the appellant's petition for review the agency notes that it never carried appellant as being absent without leave. Having admitted such, the agency is precluded from basing as adverse action on appellant's use of approved leave.[4] <span class="Italic">Komora v. Veterans Administration,</span> 10 MSPB 719, 720 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The agency also claimed that it had no option in granting appellant leave without pay. However, as we stated in <span class="Italic">Desiderio v. U.S. Department of the Navy,</span> 4 MSPB 171, 172 (1980), the granting of leave without pay is a matter of administrative discretion. The agency also had the option of directing appellant to undergo a fitness for duty examination. The agency could have used the results to order appellant to return to duty, or to remove appellant for her disability if the examination showed appellant to be unfit for duty and likely to be disabled for an extended period of time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Taylor v. DHHS</span>, 32 MSPR 342, 344-45 (1987), involving an employee removed for excessive absenteeism, may have implied, but did not carefully explain, that if the employee is capable of doing some work (though the type of work was undefined), the agency cannot continue the employee on LWOP, but must instead recall the employee to duty to determine what the employee can do:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FPM section in question, which provides an exception to the general rule that an adverse action cannot be based on an employee's use of approved leave, is applicable only when each of the three criteria it establishes is met. OPM, Federal Personnel Manual, ch. 752, subch. 3, &#x00A7; 3-2b(4)(c), at 1215. The first criterion requires the agency to prove that "the employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond his or her control so that agency approval or disapproval was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The FPM also states that the exception is reserved for use in "unusual circumstances," giving as an example "the inability of an employee to return to duty or to work on a regular basis because of the continuing effects of illness or injury (on or off-the-job)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, however, found that the agency continued to grant appellant considerable leave without pay after it had been advised that she was able to return to "any type of work she is motivated to do without restriction." He concluded, therefore, that the agency had not borne its burden of proving that approval of the leave was "immaterial because the employee could not be on the job." The agency's mere disagreement with this conclusion is not a basis for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gaskins v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 331, 334-35 (1988), sustained removal resulting from lengthy LWOP and the medical inability of the employee to return to work (no AWOL was involved):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 610 (1984), the Board recognized that FPM Chapter 752, Subchapter 3, paragraph 3-2b(4)(c) provides an exception to the general rule that an adverse action cannot be based upon an employee's use of approved leave. To invoke this exception, an agency must establish that three criteria are met: (1) The employee must be absent for compelling reasons beyond his or her control so that agency approval or disapproval is immaterial because the employee can not be on the job; (2) the absences must continue beyond a reasonable time and the employee must be warned that an adverse action may be taken unless the employee becomes available for duty on a regular, full-time, or part-time basis; and (3) the agency must establish that the position needs to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. The Board also stated, however, that the FPM exception only applies to unusual circumstances, such as when the employee is unable to return to duty because of the continuing effects of illness or injury. <span class="Italic">Cook</span> at 611-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the criteria for taking an action on the basis of approved leave are satisfied in the present case. The record establishes that appellant's medical condition disabled her from performing her duties during the approximately eight months at issue. Thus, appellant was absent for compelling reasons beyond her control and agency approval or disapproval of her leave request was immaterial because appellant could not be on the job. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 342, 344 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that appellant's absence continued beyond a reasonable time and appellant was warned that an adverse action could be taken unless she became available for duty. Appellant was continuously absent for a period of approximately eight months. The agency specifically directed appellant to return to work, and warned her that her failure to report could result in her removal. Thus, the agency satisfied the second criteria for invoking the FPM exception. <span class="Italic">See Rabago v. Department of the Army</span>. 25 M.S.P.R. 530, 533-34 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, as found by the administrative judge on the basis of the hearing testimony, the agency established that it needed to fill appellant's position on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Holderness v. DCA</span>, 75 MSPR 401, 404-05 (1997) (modified or overruled by <span class="Italic">McCauley v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCCAULEY_LINDA_DC_0752_09_0694_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER__612104.pdf">116 MSPR 484</a>, 489-90 &#x00B6; 10, 2011 MSPB 59 (2011), <span class="Italic">supra</span>), seemed to return the analysis to situations only involving grants of LWOP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As a general rule, an agency's approval of leave for unscheduled absences precludes the agency from taking adverse action on the basis of those absences. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Army</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 537, 541 (1984). There are two recognized exceptions to this rule, but neither applies here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first exception is that an employee may be disciplined for failing to follow leave-requesting procedures, even though the agency eventually approves the leave request, so long as the employee is on notice of the agency's requirements. <span class="Italic">See Wilkinson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 4, 7 (1995). That exception is not applicable in the instant case because the agency did not charge the appellant with failing to properly request leave. <span class="Italic">See Gottlieb v. Veterans Administration,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 606, 609 (1989) (the Board is required to review the agency's decision on an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency; the Board may not substitute what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second exception is where an employee makes excessive use of unscheduled leave without pay (LWOP); an adverse action based on that excessive use may be sustained if certain criteria are met. <span class="Italic">Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 610, 611-12 (1984). The administrative judge found that the agency met the criteria and sustained the charge of excessive absences. The record evidence, however, does not show that the appellant made excessive use of unscheduled LWOP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its letter of proposed removal, the agency stated that the appellant used over 300 hours of sick leave and LWOP between June 21, 1995, and October 3, 1995. During the hearing, however, the proposing official testified that from June 21, 1995, to October 3, 1995, the appellant was on sick leave. Moreover, the "Individual Daily Time and Attendance Records" show that the appellant was on sick leave from June 21, 1995, through October 3, 1995. Accordingly, since the agency has not shown that the appellant was on LWOP during the period of charged absences, and the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> exception only applies in situations where the employee's absence was due to excessive use of unscheduled LWOP, the administrative judge erred by finding that the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> exception applied in this matter. <span class="Italic">See Rabago v. Department of the Army</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 530, 533 (1985). Under the circumstances of this case, the agency's charge of excessive absences cannot be sustained. To the extent that the agency implies in its petition for review that the appellant's removal should be upheld on the ground that she was unable to perform her duties on the date that the agency took this adverse action, we disagree. The agency did not charge the appellant with inability to perform, and an adverse action cannot be upheld on the basis of a charge that the agency could have brought, but did not. <span class="Italic">See Nazelrod v. Department of Justice</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 461, 466 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 43 F.3d 663 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Allen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 76 MSPR 564, 570-71 (1997), similar to <span class="Italic">Gaskins,</span> permitted adverse action against the employee for prolonged sick leave (that the Board implied should have been granted) rather than for LWOP or AWOL status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge decided not to sustain the charge of excessive absenteeism because "the agency improperly denied the appellant's request for sick leave. The agency argues that the administrative judge erred in not sustaining this charge, and we agree. As noted above, an agency can bring an action against an employee for excessive absence even if the absence is excused on grounds of poor health. <span class="Italic">See Schultz</span>, 810 F.2d at 1137 n.*; <span class="Italic">Wilkinson</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 6. Prolonged absence with no foreseeable end can provide just cause for removal because it constitutes a burden which no employer can efficiently endure. <span class="Italic">See Rhodes v. Department of the Interior</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 193, 195-97 (1984); <span class="Italic">aff'd <span id="Page_2438"></span>in part, vacated in part</span>, 770 F.2d 182 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 474 U.S. 1103 (1986); <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 496, 497 (1980). To take such an action, however, an agency must establish that: (1) The employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond his or her control so that agency approval or disapproval was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job; (2) the absences continued beyond a reasonable time, and the employee was warned that an adverse action could be taken unless the employee became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and (3) the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. Such an action should also be taken only under unusual circumstances, i.e., such as when the employee is unable to return to duty because of the continuing effects of illness or injury. <span class="Italic">See Gaskins v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 331, 334 (1988); <span class="Italic">Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 610, 611-12 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the parties stipulated that the appellant was absent for reasons beyond his control, and the discussion above demonstrates that his absence was compelled because of psychological illness that incapacitated him for duty. As noted above, moreover, the appellant had been continuously absent for almost seven months when the agency proposed his removal, and it had warned him that his prolonged absence could lead to disciplinary action unless he returned to duty as soon as possible. The agency has also presented documentary evidence showing that the appellant's position needed to be filled and that his absence created a significant staffing problem for the Oakland Arts and Crafts Center. The parties stipulated that the appellant was absent from January to August of 1994 based on Dr. Volk's advice that he could not return to work unless he was "insulated" from contact with Mr. Ortega; they also stipulated that the appellant "would have been unable to work after August 17, 1994, because Dr. Volk advised him that he should not work unless he was insulated from contacts with Victor Ortega."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The criteria for taking an action against the appellant based on excessive absence thus appear to have been met here because: (1) He was absent for compelling reasons beyond his control and could not be on the job so that agency approval or disapproval of his leave requests was immaterial; (2) he was absent for almost seven months, and the agency warned him that failure to report for duty could result in disciplinary action; and (3) the agency needed an employee to fill the appellant's position. Based on the parties' own stipulation, moreover, there did not appear to be any foreseeable end to his absence. Under those circumstances, the agency properly took action against the appellant based on his excessive absence. <span class="Italic">See Gaskins</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. at 334-35; <span class="Italic">Rhodes</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. at 195-97 (the agency properly removed an employee who could not return to her position at a foreseeable time because the work environment exacerbated her emotional problems, and where the agency needed the employee to serve in her position on a regular basis). The administrative judge thus erred by not sustaining this charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cole v. VA</span>, 77 MSPR 434, 440-41 (1998), sustained removal involving a medical condition leading to long-term placement in nonpay status. AWOL was disavowed as a necessary condition to the adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The undisputed record evidence shows that the appellant stopped working on October 4, 1993, when she took several weeks of emergency annual leave to care for her son. She subsequently requested continued leave, citing her rheumatoid arthritis and depression. By April 12, 1994, she exhausted her sick and annual leave balances, as well as donated leave made available through the Voluntary Leave Donor Program, and was placed on non-paid status until she was removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may take an adverse action based on excessive use of leave without pay (LWOP), where (1) the record shows that the employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond her control so that the agency's approval or disapproval of leave was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job; (2) the absences continued beyond a reasonable time, and the employee was warned that adverse action might be initiated unless the employee became 6 available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and (3) the agency shows that the position must be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. <span class="Italic">Holderness v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 401, 404 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the appellant's absences here were due to her severe, incapacitating rheumatoid arthritis, a compelling reason beyond her control, so that the agency's approval or disapproval of leave was immaterial. Second, her total continuous absences lasted more than two years, of which her continuous unpaid absences lasted more than nineteen months and, thus, continued beyond a reasonable period of time. In addition, the agency specifically warned the appellant several times that an adverse action up to and including removal might be initiated unless she became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. And third, the record shows that the agency considered the appellant's Medical Technician position on the evening shift to be a "critical" position, solicited volunteers for the position during her absence, and assigned other staff members to perform her duties during her absence. The agency deciding official stated that the appellant's absences resulted in "thousands of dollars in overtime and unscheduled hours." The record thus shows that the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, fulltime or part-time basis. We therefore find that the criteria for sustaining a charge of excessive unpaid absences are satisfied here.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We note that the agency charged the appellant with absence without leave (AWOL) for her continuous absences after August 8, 1994. We find it unnecessary to address the propriety of this AWOL charge because, for purposes of sustaining the charge of prolonged unpaid absence, the relevant fact is that, regardless of the propriety of the AWOL charge, the appellant had no leave to cover her absences commencing April 12, 1994.</p>

Under <span class="Italic">Cook</span>, the agency has the burden of demonstrating the exceptions to the rule that an employee may not be removed for approved leave. The agency's burden was emphasized in <span class="Italic">Smisson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 85 MSPR 427, 429-32 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-7 (2000). The employee was removed for absences that were covered by approved leave. The employee requested a hearing, but the AJ reversed the action without a hearing because the agency's record did not demonstrate that the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> exceptions were established. The Board's discussion of the agency's prehearing submission (and witness list) is scant, but the Board apparently concluded that the agency did not show that its proposed witnesses (or exhibits) would have demonstrated that Ms. Smisson's absences were for compelling reasons beyond her control. The Board did not state whether the agency listed the appellant as a witness for the purpose of proving the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> exceptions. The Board's decision (over Member Marshall's dissent), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective November 6, 1998, the agency removed the appellant from her WG-8 position of Sheet Metal Worker, based on a charge of excessive absences. The agency alleged that between February 18 and August 17, 1998, the appellant was absent for 63 days and that 56 of those days were charged to leave without pay (LWOP). On appeal, the appellant requested a hearing. During a prehearing conference, the administrative judge (AJ) ordered the parties to file briefs addressing the issue of whether the agency's removal action satisfied the criteria under <span class="Italic">Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 MSPR 610 (1984)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that all of the appellant's absences during the period in question were approved by the agency. As a general rule, an agency's approval of leave precludes the agency from taking an adverse action based on those absences. <span class="Italic">Holderness v. Defense Commissary Agency,</span> 75 MSPR 401, 404 (1997). Notwithstanding this general rule, an agency may take an adverse action based on approved absences if the following criteria set forth in <span class="Italic">Cook,</span> 18 MSPR at 611-12, are satisfied:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The record showed that the employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond his or her control, so that agency approval or disapproval [of leave] was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The absence or absences continued beyond a reasonable time and the employee was warned that adverse action might be initiated unless the employee became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The agency showed that the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> All three criteria must be satisfied before an agency may take an adverse action based on approved leave. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Taylor v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 32 MSPR 342, 344 (1987). The AJ found that the agency established neither the first nor the second criterion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the first criterion--whether the appellant was absent for compelling reasons beyond her control--the agency must establish that the appellant was unable to report for duty because of "unusual circumstances, i.e.,...because of the continuing effects of illness or injury" and not because of "personal affairs, as these situations would presumably be under the control of the employee and thus the agency could have legitimate reasons for denial of leave." <span class="Italic">Cook,</span> 18 MSPR at 612. The AJ found that the appellant's absences were not for compelling reasons since the agency acknowledged in its prehearing submission that the absences were due to the appellant's "personal problems."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In challenging this finding on review, the agency contends that, had it been given the opportunity, it would have presented evidence that the appellant requested leave for medical reasons, based on medical documentation, and also would have solicited hearing testimony from the appellant showing that she believed she was incapable of working on the days she was absent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2439"></span>Regarding the agency's contention that it would have solicited hearing testimony from the appellant, an agency has no statutory right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">Hulett v. Department of the Navy,</span> 27 MSPR 510, 512-13 (1985). Moreover, it is the agency's burden to establish the charge, and the agency may not require the appellant to submit evidence to prove its case. <span class="Italic">See Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 54, 71 (1997) (the appellant was not required to submit medical evidence to assist the agency in proving its charge against her). The agency has not alleged or shown why it could not have submitted pertinent documentary evidence to establish its charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency was not prevented below from submitting evidence showing that the appellant's absences were for compelling medical reasons. Nor does the agency submit any such evidence on review. The agency has not submitted any documentation of the appellant's requests for leave, and in fact admitted during discovery that it had no written documentation of her leave requests. Although the agency contends on review that the appellant stated in a deposition that her absences were due to "severe depression," the deposition has not been submitted for the record. In a "Memorandum for Record" submitted below, the appellant's supervisor, George Story, stated that the appellant's "absences were due to illness and personal emergencies." However, the record contains no specifics regarding the particular reasons for the appellant's intermittent absences. The agency contended in its prehearing submission that Story would testify "about the Appellant's relationship with her abusive boyfriend (Mr. Keith Shields) and how this prevented her from coming to work" and "that the Appellant never told him that she was unable to report for work because of depression...." Under these circumstances, we find that the agency failed to establish error in the AJ's decision not to hold a hearing, or in the AJ's finding that the appellant's absences were not shown to have been for compelling medical reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency disputes the AJ's statement that the agency could have properly denied many of the appellant's requests for leave. The agency contends that it could not have denied leave that was requested for medical reasons if there was a foreseeable end to the absences, citing <span class="Italic">Bologna v. Department of Defense,</span> 73 MSPR 110, 114, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 135 F.3d 774 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table), and <span class="Italic">Joyner v. Department of the Navy,</span> 57 MSPR 154, 159 (1993) (where an employee who is incapacitated for duty has exhausted all of her leave, an agency may properly deny her request for leave without pay where there is no foreseeable end in sight to her absence and where that absence is a burden on the agency). As noted above, however, the agency submitted scant evidence on the circumstances surrounding the appellant's absences, and thus failed to show that it could not have denied leave under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Cook</span> expressly presumes that absences due to personal affairs are within the control of the employee, so that the agency would have legitimate reasons for denying leave for such absences if excessive. 18 MSPR at 612. Thus, there is a presumption that absences due to personal affairs are not covered by the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> exception. The record here simply does not warrant any reexamination or alteration of <span class="Italic">Cook's</span> presumption concerning the appellant's control over her personal affairs because the agency utterly failed to document the nature of the appellant's absences. Because the agency has not shown that the appellant's absences were for compelling reasons beyond her control so as to make the agency's grant of LWOP superfluous, we concur in the AJ's finding that the agency failed to establish the first criterion under <span class="Italic">Cook</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the second criterion--whether the appellant's absences continued beyond a reasonable time--the AJ found that the absences did not continue beyond a reasonable time because they were intermittent in nature. Although the agency challenges on review the AJ's finding, we find it unnecessary to resolve this issue, in view of our dispositive finding that the agency failed to establish the first <span class="Italic">Cook</span> criterion.</p>

Between December 15, 2004 and June 7, 2005, the agency counseled and disciplined the appellant for several leave-related violations, including her failure to timely report to duty and to follow leave requesting procedures, and her excessive use of unscheduled sick leave and leave without pay (LWOP). Following additional absences, the agency removed the appellant based on a charge of excessive absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal of the agency's removal action and argued that her removal was improper because all of her absences were approved as LWOP....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy applies only to defendants in criminal cases and not to petitioners in administrative proceedings before the Board, the Board has held that an agency cannot impose disciplinary or adverse action more than once for the same misconduct. <span class="Italic">Wigen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 381, 383 (1993); <span class="Italic">see also Eichner v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 202, &#x00B6; 17 (1999) (where an agency has imposed disciplinary or adverse actions because of an employee's misconduct, it is barred from subsequently taking another adverse action for the same reason). Upon reviewing the agency's proposed removal notice, we find that the agency erred by imposing discipline more than once for the same misconduct. The notice specifically stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You are rarely at work. From January 9 to July 23 2005, you were gone as much as you were here. Of the potential 1080 hours of regular work hours, you were gone at least 515 of those hours. Since July 19, 2005, you have not been to work at all. When you are not here it places an extreme burden on the rest of our General Surgery/Urology staff whom must then do your job as well as their own job. We are very busy clinic seeing over 600 patients a month on average. When you do not show up for work, it results in delays in patient check-in, patient care, and appointment scheduling. Because your absences are unscheduled or of indefinite duration, it makes it impossible for us to hire someone to temporary fill your position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The proposal notice specifically refers to the time frame from January 9 to July 23, and provides that, during this time frame, the appellant was absent at least 515 of 1080 regular work hours.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the agency submitted documentation below to demonstrate that the appellant had been officially disciplined on two occasions during this time period for leave-related issues. On March 17, the appellant received a letter of reprimand for, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, failing to follow leave procedures for her absence from January 12 to January 21, by failing to submit medical documentation to support her absence....&#8197;Because the notice of proposed removal does not exclude leave-related misconduct for which the appellant has already been disciplined, it is unclear whether the agency was attempting to impose a second round of discipline, at least in part, for the same misconduct. <span class="Italic">Wigen</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 383. Thus, we will not consider the appellant's absences from January 12-21, March 29, or April 6 and 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we will not consider the appellant's absences during any period that she was on approved sick leave. <span class="Italic">See Holderness v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 401, 404 (1997) (where the record showed that the employee was on sick leave for the entire period of charged absence, the agency failed to prove that the employee was on LWOP status during that time, and thus the <span class="Italic">Cook</span>[3] exception, which allows the agency to take an adverse action based on approved unscheduled absences when the employee makes excessive use of unscheduled LWOP, did not apply to the employee's removal). The time and attendance records submitted by the agency show that the appellant used 272 hours of sick leave between January 9 and July 23. Pursuant to <span class="Italic">Holderness</span>, we have not considered these absences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 610, 611-12 (1984); <span class="Italic">see also Combs v. Social Security Administration</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 12 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without considering any of the leave noted above, the agency's evidence reflects that, from January 9 through July 23, the appellant used 252 3/4 hours of LWOP and was AWOL for 80 3/4 hours, for a total of 333 1/2 hours of unscheduled absences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency's removal action was improper because she was on approved medical leave. As a general rule, an adverse action cannot be based on an employee's use of approved leave. <span class="Italic">See Combs v. Social Security Administration</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 12 (2002). However, the Board has held that, when certain criteria are met, an agency can bring an action against an employee for excessive approved absence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 610, 611-12 (1984). To take such an action, an agency must establish that: (1) The employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond her control so that the agency's approval or disapproval was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job; (2) the absences continued beyond a reasonable time, and the agency warned the employee that an adverse action could be taken unless the employee became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and (3) the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. <span class="Italic">Combs</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 13. Such an action should also be taken only under unusual circumstances, such as when the employee is unable to return to duty because of the continuing effects of illness or injury. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's charge was "excessive absences." Although the agency stated in support of the charge that the appellant was "gone at least 515" of 1080 regular work hours during the period in question, the essence of the charge is that her absences during that time were excessive. We have found that, between January 9 and July 23, the appellant was on LWOP or was AWOL for 333 1/2 hours. Because an agency is required to prove only the essence of its charge, <span class="Italic">see Aiu v. Department of Justice</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 509, 519, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 98 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table), we find that, if the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> exception is applicable, the agency's charge of excessive absences may be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it appears that the appellant never submitted medical documentation to support her absences prior to the proposed removal notice, below, she submitted written documentation from her physician showing that she was unable to work because of Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Based on this evidence, it appears that the agency's approval or disapproval of the appellant's leave was immaterial because she could not work. The agency disciplined the appellant on numerous occasions for her absences, and informed her that her failure to report to duty would result in an adverse action. And, the agency informed the appellant on several occasions that her repeated absences from work had an adverse impact on the department's operations. Because all of the factors noted above have been satisfied, and it appears that the appellant could not return to work because of the continuing effects of her mental illness, the AJ properly affirmed the agency's removal action. <span class="Italic">Combs</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Cook</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. at 611-12.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The removal for excessive-but-approved absence was permitted even though the absence was the result of emotional problems that led to an unsuccessful retirement application; it was appropriate for the agency to use a "nondisciplinary" removal if the employee could not return to her position at a foreseeable time and if there was a critical need for the employee in the position on a regular full-time basis. <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 21 MSPR 193, 196 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Kohler v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 108 MSPR 510, 513 &#x00B6; 5, 2008 MSPB 84 (2008) (removal sustained for excessive approved absence including sick and annual leave, donated leave and LWOP with no prediction of a return to work and only a statement from a physician that the appellant would receive treatment for six to eight months and then be reevaluated to determine if she could return to work); <span class="Italic">Meldrum v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3285) (referring to ELRM &#x00A7; 514.4(d)(4): an employee may be separated if required to be absent for more than one year unless there is cause to expect recovery and return within a reasonable time after the end of one year in LWOP status).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although removal was sustained for other reasons, a charge of excessive absence was not sustained when the agency failed to demonstrate that the appellant's absences were for compelling reasons beyond his control or that his absences continued beyond a reasonable time. <span class="Italic">Bergstein v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 232, 235 (1986). [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-145.html#sec6-144">Adverse Action Related to Disability</a>"; refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-15-033.html#sec8-34">No Foreseeable End to Absence; Absence When Compensation Ends</a>," concerning prolonged use of LWOP by employees receiving OWCP benefits.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Providing a quantitative analysis of a removal based on excessive absence, <span class="Italic">New v. VA</span>, 99 MSPR 404, 418 (2005), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If all of those 889 hours were considered, the appellant's absence rate would be 12% (5 months of nonconsecutive absences in 3 1/2 years), a rate we find not sufficient to sustain an excessive absence or poor overall attendance charge.[4] <span class="Italic">Cf. Combs v. Social Security Administration</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 14 (2002) (absence for 53% of the time over a 2-year period was sufficient to sustain charge of inability to maintain regular attendance); <span class="Italic">Gaskins v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 331, 334 (1988) (the appellant's continuous absence for 8 months continued beyond a reasonable time); <span class="Italic">Richards v. Department of the Navy</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 50, 53-55 &#x0026; n.1 (1984) (5,453 hours of absence in less than 5 years, including a 96% absence rate over the appellant's last 2 years, were sufficient to sustain excessive absence charge). Therefore, we find that the poor overall attendance charge was not a valid removal for cause unrelated to the appellant's compensable injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;As noted, however, some unspecified number of those 889 hours consisted of approved sick and annual leave. Ordinarily, an agency may not discipline an employee for excessive use of approved sick leave. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Holderness v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 401, 404 (1997). Removing from the 889 hours even the unspecified number for which the appellant was granted sick leave would reduce the total to fewer than 889 hours and her overall absence rate to less than 12%.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Zellars v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 208 Fed. Appx. 895, 896-97 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), provides an example of a "nondisciplinary" removal, affirmed by the Board's reviewing court, for excessive absence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Juelithia G. Zellars was employed by the Air Force as an Office Assistant, GS-0318-5, in the Maintenance Engineering Section, Operations Flight, 11th Civil Engineering Squadron, located at Bolling Air Force Base, in Washington, D.C. In a notice of proposed removal dated August 3, 2005, the Air Force proposed Ms. Zellars' removal for "non-availability," indicating that she failed for some time to maintain a regular work schedule and had been absent excessively on an ongoing basis. The proposal notice also indicated that while the absences may have been for medical reasons beyond her control, it was the agency's determination that non-disciplinary removal was warranted due to her inability to keep a regular work schedule. Ms. Zellars did not respond to the proposal notice, and the agency deciding official issued a notice of decision to remove her from her position effective September 9, 2005.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon review of the administrative record, the AJ's finding that Ms. Zellars was removable from her position for non-availability is supported by substantial evidence. An agency can bring a removal action against an employee for excessive absences even if the absences are excused because of poor health. <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1137 n.* (Fed. Cir. 1987). Prolonged absences of an employee with no foreseeable end can provide just cause for removal because it constitutes a burden on the employing agency. Ms. Zellars does not dispute that, before her removal, she was frequently late to work or absent due to various medical conditions.[2] The record as a whole demonstrates that Ms. Zellars had been absent from work for a significant amount of time over a two-year period, and there is no dispute that she lacked the available leave to cover prior absences, much less anticipated future absences had she not been removed. Several memoranda and letters from the Air Force warned that her continued tardiness and absences could result in an adverse action unless she became available for duty on a regular, full-time basis. The documentary evidence and testimony before the AJ also indicate that the position needed to be filled on a regular, full-time basis. Further, Ms. Zellars communicated to the agency before her removal that she was "very sick" and unable to work at that time, and would be on leave without pay until "further notice." On appeal, Ms. Zellars has not demonstrated reversible legal error in the Board's judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The record indicates that Ms. Zellars was absent 817 hours, or approximately 40% of the time in the 2004 leave year, and 1013.25 hours or approximately 79% of the time in the 2005 leave year.</p>
