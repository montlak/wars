<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-115"><span class="space">b.</span> Investigation Accompanied by Other Circumstances</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Am agency may not indefinitely suspend an employee while it investigates general concerns about possible misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GONZALEZ_MANUEL_J_NY_0752_09_0052_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_514402.pdf">114 MSPR 318</a>, 333-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24, 28, 2010 MSPB 132 (2010) ("The agency has failed to identify any valid statutory or regulatory basis for the proposition that it can preliminarily suspend the appellant based on some lesser standard of proof while it gathers additional evidence to support an action based on the underlying alleged misconduct.... "the mere existence of the agency's open investigation into allegations regarding the appellant's conduct is not "cause" for taking an action under subchapter II of chapter 75."). Criminal investigations may support indefinite suspensions. [<span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span> is discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-13-124.html#sec6-123">Inquiry Into Other Issues</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The investigation properly supporting an indefinite suspension will often be one conducted by criminal law enforcement authorities. Reasonable belief may be established, for example, on the basis of information already developed by the agency, an ongoing investigation by the FBI, and referral of a theft-related charge to the U.S. Attorney for possible criminal prosecution. <span class="Italic">Farris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 20 MSPR 547, 550 (1984) ("As a result of an on-going investigation conducted by the FBI and the agency OSI, appellant was implicated in the criminal activity noted above. The agency decided as a result of the information which had already been developed, that there was a need both to continue the investigation and to refer the case to the U.S. Attorney's Office for possible criminal prosecution. Therefore, the agency decided to indefinitely suspend appellant pending the outcome of these matters.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sustaining an indefinite suspension based on the agency's determination that there was reasonable cause to believe that the appellant committed a crime supporting a term of imprisonment based on an arrest and a police report and felony complaint, <span class="Italic">Ascencio v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-11-0821-I-1 (NP 11/5/2012), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In addition, to the extent the appellant challenges the agency's failure to perform its own investigation of the facts surrounding the underlying criminal charges, the Board has held that an agency is not required to conduct an independent investigation into criminal charges against an employee before invoking the indefinite suspension procedure. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 20 (2010) (citing <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Department of the Navy</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 660, 664-65 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 900 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1990)). Further, the appellant's argument that he could not fully comment on the facts set forth in the police report is similarly unavailing. In an indefinite suspension appeal based on the crime exception, the issue is whether the agency has made the requisite showing of reasonable cause, not whether the agency has shown that the appellant engaged in the charged criminal behavior. Therefore, substantive defenses to the underlying criminal charges do not defeat an agency's showing of reasonable cause where, as here, that showing is supported by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See Pararas-Carayannis v. Department of Commerce</span>, 9 F.3d 955, 957-58 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the administrative judge incorrectly found that he had not denied the criminal charges. The administrative judge is correct that, although the appellant pled not guilty to the underlying criminal charges, he did not specifically respond to the allegations against him. In any event, notwithstanding his general denial of the charges, the administrative judge properly found that the agency's reliance on the amended felony complaint, the documents supporting the arrest warrant, including Detective Merritt's declaration, and the police report was sufficient to support a conclusion that reasonable cause existed to believe that the appellant committed a crime for which he was subject to imprisonment. <span class="Italic">See Pararas-Carayannis</span>, 9 F.3d at 958; <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Department of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151, 1157-58 (Fed. Cir. 1992). In particular, the administrative judge relied heavily on Merritt's personal observation of the appellant's suspicious behavior on August 6, 2009, and his follow-up investigation, to find the agency had reasonable cause.</p>

Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 660, 664-65 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("An independent administrative investigation into the misconduct that has given rise to an employee's indictment on criminal charges is not advised, however, while the criminal action is pending.... [D]ue process is not observed if an accused person is subjected, without his consent, to an administrative hearing on a serious criminal charge that is pending against him. His necessary defense in the administrative hearing may disclose his evidence long in advance of his criminal trial and prejudice his defense in that trial. [T]here is no requirement that the agency conduct an independent investigation into the criminal charges against an employee before invoking indefinite suspension procedures. Rather, such an investigation is discouraged in order to minimize the pitfalls of subjecting an employee to simultaneous administrative and criminal actions.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Senyszyn v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 200 Fed. Appx. 990, 992 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), an agency may rely upon an external investigation by law enforcement authorities to support an indefinite suspension when there is a criminal complaint based on a detailed supporting sworn statement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151, 1155 (Fed. Cir. 1992), we stated that an agency may indefinitely suspend an employee "only when there has been an allegation of a serious crime, and only when the misconduct alleged bears a sufficient relationship to the employee's duties in the agency to warrant the action as promoting the efficiency of the service." Further, an agency may suspend an employee pending the outcome of criminal proceedings; however, it must terminate the suspension within a reasonable time after resolution of the criminal charges. <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Nat'l Sci. Found.</span>, 423 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The main thrust of Mr. Senyszyn's appeal is that the decision of the Board cannot stand because the agency's deciding official failed to conduct an independent investigation into the charges against him before suspending him because he had not been indicted; and that the Board's decision is defective because the AJ failed to address what he refers to as "material issues." Neither contention has merit. The deciding official considered the criminal complaint and the accompanying sworn statement detailing the charges against Mr. Senyszyn. This was all the agency was required to do. <span class="Italic">See Dunnington</span>, 956 F.3d at 1156-57. At the same time, the AJ did not fail to address "material issues." The matters to which Mr. Senyszyn points all relate to the merits of the criminal charges against him. Because neither the agency nor the Board was required to determine Mr. Senyszyn's guilt or innocence, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, those matters were not relevant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The investigation may include information gathered by the agency as well as by a law enforcement agency, <span class="Italic">Lockwood v. VA</span>, 725 Fed. Appx. 938, 943-44 (Fed. Cir. 2018 NP), sustaining an indefinite suspension and a shortened notice period:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span> court noted that it was preferable for the agency to conduct its own investigation and satisfy itself that reasonable cause exists: "Obviously, the best evidence of reasonable cause will be that determined by the agency after an appropriate investigation of the facts and circumstances of the alleged misconduct." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1157.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That is precisely what the VA did in this case. The VA police office received multiple allegations of unlawful activity and conducted a three-month investigation involving numerous witnesses and including observations by a VA police officer. Following that investigation, Mr. Lockwood was arrested and formally charged by the district attorney's office. Rather than relying solely on the fact-finding of the prosecutor's office, the VA found reasonable cause based upon its own investigation. Moreover, Mr. Lockwood's argument that the evidence should be discounted because it is "<span class="Italic">ex parte</span>" and "onesided," is unpersuasive: an indictment returned by a grand jury is both <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> and one-sided, but it provides "more than enough evidence of possible misconduct to meet the threshold requirement of reasonable cause." <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequent cases confirm that the VA's evidence met the reasonable cause threshold. For example, in <span class="Italic">Smart v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 342 Fed. Appx. 595 (Fed. Cir. 2009), this court suggested that a criminal information, standing alone, could be the basis for invoking the crime provision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 598. In <span class="Italic">Pararas-Carayannis v. Department of Commerce</span>, 9 F.3d 955 (Fed. Cir. 1993), this court upheld the agency's invocation of the crime provision based on a criminal charge, an affidavit from the investigating officer, and a criminal indictment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 956, 958; <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 958 ("This was not a case of an agency suspension based merely on an arrest."); <span class="Italic">see also Senyszyn v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 200 Fed. Appx. 990, 992 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("The deciding official considered the criminal complaint and the accompanying sworn statement detailing the charges against Mr. Senyszyn. This was all the agency was required to do."). Here, the VA's extensive investigation, the arrest, and the criminal charges provided reasonable cause sufficient to satisfy the crime provision. <span class="Italic">See Cooke v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 125 Fed. Appx. 274, 277 &#x0026; n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (affirming application of the crime provision after the agency conducted an initial investigation that led to a criminal complaint). The arbitrator did not abuse his discretion in sustaining the VA's finding that there was reasonable cause to invoke the crime provision.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Mr. Lockwood argues that "[i]n the absence of an actual warrant, the [VA's] reliance on a mere assertion that a warrant existed is unreasonable." He adds that "[t]here was no evidence then, nor is there any now, that Mr. Lockwood was arrested pursuant to a <span id="Page_2131"></span>judicial warrant." However, there is no applicable evidentiary rule prohibiting the agency from relying on a police report to establish the existence of a warrant. <span class="Italic">See Kewley v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 153 F.3d 1357, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (hearsay rule inapplicable in Merit Systems Protection Board proceedings). In any event, this argument is beside the point, as neither the notice of proposed indefinite suspension nor the arbitrator's opinion relied on the existence of a warrant in addressing the issue of reasonable cause.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The propriety of an agency's reliance on an ongoing criminal investigation to support an indefinite suspension was confirmed in <span class="Italic">Pararas-Carayannis v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 9 F.3d 955, 958 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("The agency's reliance on the criminal charge, the detailed information in the affidavit, and the subsequent indictment was sufficient to support a conclusion that a reasonable cause existed to believe that petitioner committed a crime for which he was subject to imprisonment. This was not a case of an agency suspension based merely on an arrest. The agency had ample evidence of alleged misconduct, based on the Government's extensive investigation, on which to base its decision to suspend."). If the criminal process provides reasonable cause, the agency need not conduct an independent investigation, <span class="Italic">McDonald v. Dept. of Interior,</span> DE-0752-15-0358-I-1 (NP 2/22/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency cannot satisfy the reasonable cause requirement because it improperly failed to verify whether he engaged in the criminal misconduct alleged, and also failed to consider evidence proving his innocence. However, a substantive defense to the alleged criminal misconduct on which an indefinite suspension is based does not defeat an agency's showing of reasonable cause. <span class="Italic">Pararas-Carayannis v. Department of Commerce</span>, 9 F.3d 955, 957-58 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Further, our reviewing court has held that an agency is not required to conduct an independent investigation in all circumstances and that a formal judicial determination made following a preliminary hearing provides more than enough evidence of possible misconduct to meet the threshold requirement of reasonable cause to suspend. <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Department of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151, 1156-57 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In October 2014, a district attorney filed criminal information with a district court charging that the appellant committed the third-degree felony of aggravated assault using a dangerous weapon or other means or force likely to produce death or serious bodily injury. A term of imprisonment may be imposed for this offense. Utah Code Ann. &#x00A7; 76-3-203(3). On March 5, 2015, following a preliminary hearing, a court found "sufficient probable cause to bind the case over on all counts." On March 23, 2015, the appellant was arraigned. He entered a not guilty plea and the case was set for a jury trial.<span class="Italic"></span> These circumstances are sufficient for the agency to meet its burden of showing that it had reasonable cause to believe that the appellant committed a crime for which a term of imprisonment may be imposed. <span class="Italic">See Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157. Further, in light of this evidence, we discern no error in the agency's failure to conduct an independent investigation. <span class="Italic">See Hernandez v. Department of the Navy</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16 (2013) (finding that the reasonable cause requirement was satisfied, notwithstanding that the agency proposed the indefinite suspension based upon court documents and did not conduct an independent investigation into the criminal charges, because the district attorney had filed a complaint and the employee had been ordered to appear for a jury trial).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "reasonable cause" for an indefinite suspension may be furnished by information uncovered through the agency's internal investigation, along with a referral for criminal prosecution, <span class="Italic">Bell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 54 MSPR 619, 627 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the strength of the evidence revealed in the investigation by the agency, apart from the agency's referral to the United States Attorney's Office and that office's acceptance of the matter for possible criminal prosecution, it is not necessary for us to examine whether the state of the possible criminal proceedings pending against this appellant was sufficient, in itself, to provide the agency with "reasonable cause."<span class="Italic">See Dunnington v. Department of Justice</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 305, 306-09 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 956 F.2d 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1992). That is, we find that here, as in <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, regardless of the stage of the criminal proceedings at the time that the indefinite suspension was effected, "the surrounding facts [were] sufficient to justify summary action by the agency." <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Commenting on agency investigative efforts, coupled with an ongoing criminal prosecution review, <span class="Italic">Harvell v. DHUD</span>, AT-0752-12-0549-I-1 (NP 2/28/2014), offered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has approved the use of indefinite suspensions when the agency has reasonable cause to believe an employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed--pending the outcome of the criminal proceeding or any subsequent agency action following the conclusion of the criminal process, i.e., the indefinite suspension must have an ascertainable end. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 13 (2010); <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 5 (1999). In the context of an indefinite suspension of a federal employee an arrest warrant alone is insufficient to show reasonable cause, as is an actual arrest; however, a formal judicial determination following a preliminary hearing or an indictment following an investigation and grand jury proceedings is more than sufficient. <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Department of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The best evidence of reasonable cause will be that determined by the agency after an appropriate investigation of the facts and circumstances of the alleged misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board has found that <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span> requires the agency to "take some affirmative action on its own to satisfy itself that there was reasonable cause to believe that a crime was committed for which imprisonment could be imposed." <span class="Italic">Barresi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 666 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency took appropriate affirmative action and submitted evidence from an investigation to show that it had reasonable cause to believe the appellant had engaged in the criminal misconduct of mortgage fraud. The agency submitted the following: a copy of the lease that the appellant used in support of his refinance application, allegedly signed by the appellant's nephew; an affidavit from the appellant's nephew stating that he did not sign the lease and had never lived at the property used in the refinance application; a copy of the refinance application completed by the appellant relying on the lease; and evidence that the appellant was able to obtain more than $20,000 as a result of the refinancing. This investigation combined with the fact that the U.S. Attorney was conducting a criminal investigation based on the same alleged misconduct establishes that the agency had taken the appropriate affirmative action to satisfy itself that there was reasonable cause to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which imprisonment could be imposed.[2] <span class="Italic">See Barresi</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. at 666. Further, the indefinite suspension based on the alleged criminal misconduct had a discernable end, an indictment by the U.S. Attorney or a declination of indictment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that this appeal is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span>. In <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span>, the Board found that the mere existence of an open agency investigation into alleged misconduct alone does not serve as cause for imposing an indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 28. Here, the agency's investigation was an appropriate affirmative action to satisfy its obligation to find that there was reasonable cause to believe that misconduct sufficient to justify an indefinite suspension under the crime provision had occurred. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 13. Therefore, the appellant's suspension was not based upon a mere agency investigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Thompkins v. USPS</span>, 23 MSPR 5, 10 (1984), a dormant agency investigation and referral to the U.S. Attorney for prosecutorial consideration did not constitute a valid basis for an indefinite suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the only evidence that the agency had in its possession at the time it proposed the suspension action on August 26, 1981, was a report of an internal investigation prepared by the Postal Inspector which had been referred to the United States Attorney's Office for investigation of appellant's alleged fraudulent and conflicting statements. We also note that although the agency proposed the suspension on August 26, 1981, it did not effectuate the suspension until November 27, 1981. During this intervening period, the agency did not conduct any further investigation of the action and the United States Attorney did not take any action on the agency's referral. In fact, as of the hearing date, there had been no action taken by the U.S. Attorney.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the evidence of record, this Board cannot find that the agency has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that it had reasonable cause to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which imprisonment could be imposed. The Board held in <span class="Italic">Martin</span> that an investigation, in and of itself, is insufficient to give rise to "reasonable cause" to believe the employee has committed a crime for which imprisonment could be imposed. Although the Board stated that an investigation accompanied by certain circumstances may give rise to reasonable cause in certain instances,[7] the agency investigation in this case and the mere referral to the United States Attorney for further investigation does not constitute the reasonable cause that is necessary to prove the validity of the indefinite suspension....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Examples cited by the Board in <span class="Italic">Martin</span> included: an employee arrested and held for further legal action by a magistrate; an investigation resulting in evidence supporting a reasonable cause to believe; a "criminal information" (which differs from an indictment only in that it is brought by a prosecutor instead of by a grand' jury); and, certain egregious acts detrimental to the accomplishment of the agency's mission, such as murder or national security offenses, brought to the agency's attention via the news media.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cooke v. SSA</span>, 125 Fed. Appx. 274, 276-77 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), noted the significance of a criminal, as opposed to an administrative, investigation in an indefinite suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Cooke argues that the arbitrator erred in finding that the SSA properly invoked 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) (the crime provision) when it indefinitely <span id="Page_2132"></span>suspended Mr. Cooke with less than thirty days notice. Mr. Cooke asserts that the SSA improperly relied on the criminal charges as a justification reason for his indefinite suspension when the crime provision may only be used to truncate the notice period. In addition, Mr. Cooke challenges SSA's reliance on the crime provision at all because it had already completed its investigation.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Mr. Cooke also argues that because imprisonment was not the likely result of the charges brought against him, the crime provision should not have been invoked. The statutory language, however, only requires the crime to be one for which imprisonment "<span class="Italic">may</span> be imposed." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) (2000) (emphasis added). The charges brought against Mr. Cooke include imprisonment as a possible penalty. <span class="Italic">See</span> 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1030 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to Mr. Cooke's assertion, this court has held that the criminal charges may constitute the substantive basis for indefinite suspension without pay pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings, as long as the agency also shows that "the nature of the crime alleged relates to the employee's ability to perform his or her duties." <span class="Italic">Richardson v. United States Customs Serv.</span>, 47 F.3d 415, 419 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">see also Pararas-Carayannis</span>, 9 F.3d at 957. In this case, the record shows that the criminal charges stem from Mr. Cooke's unauthorized use of SSA records during employment. The record also shows that SSA supervisors testified that they had lost trust and confidence in Mr. Cooke. These aspects of the record establish the required nexus between the alleged criminal conduct and the employee's job responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, Mr. Cooke argues that the SSA did not act in a timely manner in deciding to indefinitely suspend him, instead imposing the suspension after completion of the administrative investigation. Contrary to Mr. Cooke's contentions, indefinite suspension is appropriate pending the outcome of the <span class="Italic">criminal</span> investigation. <span class="Italic">See Richardson</span>, 47 F.3d at 419. Moreover, the SSA had not even begun an administrative investigation. The SSA suspended Mr. Cooke shortly after filing of the criminal complaint. Thus, SSA properly invoked 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1).</p>
