<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-29"><span class="space">a.</span> Analysis of Motivation, Pretext</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A presumption of good faith is inappropriate in a discrimination action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dice v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> DE-4324-11-0186-I-1 (NP 3/29/2012) (USERRA case: "In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in relying on <span class="Italic">LaChance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1999), to presume that the selecting officials for vacancy numbers ACE-AT-99-0001-41882 and ANM-AT-99-AFSS-40759M acted in good faith because that is the ultimate issue to be decided in the appeal. We agree with the appellant that the presumption of good faith recognized in <span class="Italic">LaChance</span> is inappropriate in the context of a discrimination action."). But the Board does not require much in the way of a demonstration of legitimacy of agency action to dispel a claim of pretext. The Board admitted that its theory of deference regarding agency penalty determinations undercuts its ability to carefully scrutinize pretext claims. <span class="Italic">Fenn v. Dept. of Army</span>, 35 MSPR 362, 367-68 (1987) (clarified by <span class="Italic">Buckler v. Fed. Retirement Thrift Inv. Bd.</span>, 73 MSPR 476 (1997), <span class="Italic">supra</span>), an appeal involving a dismissal based on a charge of skimming against a commissary worker who defended on the basis of a disparate treatment claim, declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is important to recognize that even though the agency's reasons may seem poor or erroneous to outsiders, the relevant question for the Board and its administrative judges to address is simply whether the stated reasons are a pretext for discrimination. The agency's stated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason must be reasonably articulated and nondiscriminatory, but it does not have to be a reason that the Board or its administrative judge would act upon or approve. <span class="Italic">Loeb v. Textron, Inc.</span>, 600 F.2d 1003, 1012 n.6 (1st Cir. 1979). Additionally, "an element of subjectivity is essentially inevitable in employment decisions" and as long as there are demonstrable reasons for the decision which are unrelated to race, "subjectivity is permissible." <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Aetna Insurance Co.</span>, 616 F.2d 719, 726 (4th Cir. 1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A more elaborate explanation of the burden of proof is provided by <span class="Italic">Gregory v. Dept. of Army</span>, 114 MSPR 607, 623-24 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 40-41, 2010 MSPB 175 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish an affirmative defense of prohibited employment discrimination or retaliation before the Board, a Federal employee first must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under the burden shifting scheme in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, (1973). An appellant may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing that he (1) is a member of a protected class; (2) suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) that the unfavorable action gives rise to an inference of discrimination. 411 U.S. at 802. <span class="Italic">See also Chappell-Johnson v. Powell,</span> 440 F.3d 484, 488 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citing <span class="Italic">Brown v. Brody,</span> 199 F.3d at 452); <span class="Italic">Stella v. Martin</span>, 284 F.3d 135, 145 (D.C. Cir. 2002). However, with most appeals of adverse actions taken under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, the agency has already articulated a nondiscriminatory reason for its action, i.e., the charged misconduct. Accordingly, the agency has done everything that would be required of it if the appellant had made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, and whether he in fact did so is no longer relevant in most cases. <span class="Italic">See Marshall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 16 (2008). Thus, the inquiry proceeds directly to the ultimate question of whether, upon weighing all of the evidence, the appellant has met his overall burden of proving illegal discrimination. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In most adverse action cases involving claims of prohibited discrimination before the Board, where the appellant has established his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and the agency has articulated the charged misconduct as the nondiscriminatory reason for its action, resolution of the discrimination issue may proceed directly to the ultimate question of whether, upon weighing all of the evidence, the appellant has met his overall burden of proving illegal discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Gregory v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To support his claim of race discrimination, the appellant identifies a number of purportedly similarly situated employees outside of his protected class who were allegedly treated more favorably by the agency. The Board has held that, for another employee to be deemed similarly situated for purposes of an affirmative defense of discrimination based on disparate treatment, all relevant aspects of the appellant's employment situation must be "nearly identical" to that of the comparator employee. <span class="Italic">Ly v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 481, &#x00B6; 10 (2012); <span class="Italic">Gregory</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 44. Thus, to be similarly situated, a comparator must have reported to the same supervisor, been subjected to the same standards governing discipline, and engaged in conduct similar to the appellant's without differentiating or mitigating circumstances. <span class="Italic">Ly</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 481, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Gregory</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 44.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The comparator employees identified by the appellant fail to meet the requirements articulated in <span class="Italic">Ly</span> and <span class="Italic">Gregory</span>. The appellant does not allege that the purported comparator employees worked for the same supervisor as he did. Moreover, three of the comparator employees identified by the appellant purportedly tested positive for drug use, but the appellant does not claim that these employees were also charged, as he was, with AWOL and with attempting to bring marijuana or a weapon onto the base. Another purported comparator identified by the appellant allegedly participated in the theft of a television from the agency, but again there is no indication that he engaged in the types of misconduct in which the appellant engaged. The appellant also claims that two employees had known drug or alcohol problems and were never subjected to a drug test, but he does not indicate whether these alleged comparator employees held testing-designated positions, as he did. Moreover, the appellant does not allege that these employees committed the same offenses that he did. In sum, the appellant fails to show that the comparator employees he identified were similarly situated to him. <span class="Italic">See Ly</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 481, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Gregory</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 44. Thus, he has not established his claim of discrimination by showing that similarly situated employees who were not members of his protected class were treated more favorably.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues in support of his discrimination claim that the agency's purported reason for searching his vehicle as he entered DDDSJ, at which time the marijuana and the switchblade knife were discovered, was a pretext for discrimination. While the search of his vehicle is not a personnel action within the purview of the Board, because the discovery of marijuana and a weapon during the search either formed the basis for the adverse action or directly led to it, we will consider the appellant's claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the appellant, several white police officers conducted the search upon confusing him with his son, and the officers fabricated evidence and submitted a false report to accentuate his infraction. The arbitrator's statement of facts indicates that there is a sign posted at the main gate of the agency facility stating that all vehicles must stop and all personnel are subject to a search, and the appellant was informed by an officer that he was randomly selected for a search when he attempted to enter DDDSJ on March 10, 2009. The appellant does not contest that finding and has offered nothing, other than his assertion, to suggest that the decision to search his vehicle as he attempted to drive onto the military base was a pretext for discrimination against him. Moreover, the suggestion that the police officers fabricated evidence against the appellant and falsified a report is belied by the arbitrator's uncontested finding that the appellant acknowledged that he possessed a switchblade knife and marijuana as he tried to enter DDDJS. Finally, the appellant has not explained how the confusion of the appellant with his son, even if true, demonstrates that the decision to search the appellant's vehicle was a pretext for discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the agency's decision to subject him to a reasonable suspicion drug test on March 23, 2009, was a pretext for discrimination. In this regard, the arbitrator found that the appellant's supervisor was informed about the incident at the installation gate, received a copy of the police report, and was instructed by Human Resources to schedule the appellant for a reasonable suspicion drug test. As stated previously, the appellant occupied a testing-designated position, and he has presented nothing to support his assertion that the decision to subject him to a reasonable suspicion drug test less than two weeks after he was stopped with marijuana in his car while attempting to enter the military base was a pretext for discrimination. Based on our review of the record, nothing supports such a conclusion.</p>

USPS</span>, DA-0752-11-0496-I-1 (NP 9/27/2012) ("While showing that the employer treated similarly-situated employees differently is one method of proving discrimination, an appellant may also prevail on a discrimination claim by introducing evidence (1) that the employer lied about its reason for taking the action; (2) of inconsistency in the employer's explanation; (3) of failure to follow established procedures; (4) of general treatment of minority employees or those who engage in protected activities; or (5) of incriminating statements by the employer. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scott v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gregory</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, did not represent a departure from <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, <span class="Italic">Benjamin v. DHHS,</span> DC-0432-09-0794-I-2 (NP 9/29/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's affirmative defense of racial discrimination, the appellant contends that the administrative judge applied an erroneous legal standard because the Board in <span class="Italic">Gregory v. Department of the Army</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 40 (2010) "abandoned" the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case/burden shifting analysis applicable to certain discrimination claims under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973). Under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, if an individual introduces evidence (1) that he is a member of a protected group (2) who suffered an adverse employment action (3) which gives rise to an inference that the action was a result of prohibited discrimination, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the action. 411 U.S. at 802. <span class="Italic">See also Chappell-Johnson v. Powell</span>, 440 F.3d 484, 488-89 (D.C. Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Stella v. Mineta</span>, 284 F.3d 135, 145 (D.C. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gregory</span>, we clearly did not abandon the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> requirement that an appellant introduce evidence sufficient to give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination in order to shift the burden onto the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the action. 114 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 40. Rather, we merely recognized that in most, if not all, federal employment cases, that burden-shifting framework is not particularly apt because the agency will normally have already articulated a nondiscriminatory reason for taking the action by charging misconduct or poor performance. <span class="Italic">Id. See also Marshall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 16 (2008). In other words, in such cases, the question of whether the appellant has introduced sufficient evidence to raise an <span class="Italic">inference</span> of discrimination gives way to the ultimate question of whether the appellant has <span class="Italic">proven</span> discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> There is nothing in our decision in <span class="Italic">Gregory</span> that alters the requirements for triggering the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> burden-shifting or the elements of a cause of action based on a claim of disparate treatment discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge correctly identified those elements as follows: (1) the appellant is a member of a protected group (2) who suffered an adverse employment action, (3) and that there was a causal relationship between his membership in the protected class and the adverse action that he suffered. She also properly recognized that one way that an appellant may prove the third element of causation is with evidence that other similarly-situated employees were treated differently. Thus, contrary to the appellant's contention, the administrative judge did not apply an improper legal standard to his disparate treatment claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Previously, the Board reduced the disparate treatment analysis in a discrimination case to a burden on the appellant to show that discrimination was intentional, although under <span class="Italic">Buckler v. Fed. Retirement Thrift Inv. Bd.</span>, 73 MSPR 476 (1997), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the burden is on the appellant to prove that the real reason for the action was discrimination. That burden is difficult to surmount, as <span class="Italic">Mallery v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 288, 290-92 (1989), demonstrates. In <span class="Italic">Mallery</span>, the appellant, a mailhandler technician who shoplifted a piece of merchandise of small value, unsuccessfully attempted to demonstrate racial discrimination after a white employee involved in an off-duty sexual offense was retained without discipline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he white employee pled guilty in 1983 to contributing to the delinquency of a minor. According to testimony from the deciding official in the appellant's case, the white employee had been having an affair with a minor teenager, and her father pressed charges. The deciding official distinguished the cases by noting that, by all accounts, the white employee's misconduct was not common knowledge at the facility at the time it occurred. The appellant's arrest, however, was reported in the local newspaper. In addition, the deciding official emphasized that the crime of theft was deemed particularly serious because it had a direct impact on the appellant's duties and could, therefore, be repeated in the work setting. Finally, the deciding official in the appellant's case testified that he was not present in 1983, and that there was a different postmaster at the facility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We agree that the appellant failed to show that the difference in treatment was based upon an intent to discriminate, and that although the white employee's crime may be viewed as more serious by the law, the appellant did not establish that his removal was more likely than not due to an intentional consideration of race. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fenn v. Dept. of Army</span>, 35 MSPR 362, 366-67 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the administrative judge that, even if the appellant were found to have established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of racial discrimination, the agency presented legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its different treatment of the appellant. The lack of publicity surrounding the criminal misconduct of the white employee, the nexus between theft, trustworthiness, and the sanctity of the mails...and the different deciding officials involved in the 1983 and 1987 incidents all constitute <span id="Page_3352"></span>legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the agency's different treatment of the appellant. As noted by the administrative judge, the agency's reasons need not be reasons that the Board would approve; as long as the reasons proffered are unrelated to race, a certain amount of subjectivity in agency decisions is permissible....</p>
