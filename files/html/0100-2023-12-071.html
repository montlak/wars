<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-71"><span class="space">f.</span> Retirement Appeal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Expressing some sound judgment addressing retirement cases and a minor relaxation of often inflexible and inequitable rules concerning the bar against submitting new evidence through a PFR if that evidence could have been first presented to the AJ, <span class="Italic">Matson v. OPM</span>, 105 MSPR 547, 552-54 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-21, 2007 MSPB 122 (2007), denying a PFR but reopening the appeal, displayed some leniency in finding ways to evaluate evidence first presented with a PFR in a disability retirement case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that appeals involving an appellant's entitlement to retirement benefits are fundamentally different from other types of appeals within its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Edney v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 60, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-7 (1998) ("Unlike the competing interests of agency management and employee rights involved in a disciplinary appeal, there is only one primary interest involved in a retirement appeal, that of the applicant's entitlement under law to a benefit."); <span class="Italic">see also Karker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 235, &#x00B6; 9 (1998) (Board reopened case on its own motion and found good cause to waive filing deadline for appeal of denial of appellant's disability retirement application because "the Board has placed a high priority on resolving retirement benefits cases on the merits"). The Board has therefore shown a greater willingness to reopen such appeals on its own motion. <span class="Italic">See Ormerod v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 201, 204 (1982) (denying the appellant's PFR, but reopening the appeal to consider additional medical evidence "in the interest of equity and administrative finality").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Edney</span>, the appellant withdrew her disability retirement appeal, but then filed a timely PFR through new counsel seeking reinstatement of her appeal. <span class="Italic">Edney</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 60, &#x00B6; 2. She also submitted additional evidence that was not submitted below. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board denied the PFR, finding that it did not meet the review criteria under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 3. Noting the "unusual circumstances" of the appeal, however, the Board exercised its "broad discretion to reopen and reinstate the appeal, in the interest of justice." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the factors cited by the Board in support of reopening in <span class="Italic">Edney</span> was that the appellant's withdrawal of her appeal on the eve of an adjudication on the merits was inexplicable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 4. Equally inexplicable is the failure of the appellant in this case to identify her ongoing treatment in response to interrogatories from OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant's representative, not the appellant herself, signed the responses to OPM's discovery requests. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b) (requiring that written answers to interrogatories be made under oath and signed by the person making them).[3] The appellant's answers to OPM's 21 interrogatories consisted of a single typed page. In those responses, dated April 10, 2006, the appellant's representative indicated that the appellant was no longer undergoing any treatment for her conditions. However, the documents submitted on PFR establish that the appellant had seen her psychologist, Dr. Nix, as recently as April 4, 2006, and was meeting with Dr. Nix on a weekly basis. Those documents also establish that the appellant was seeing her primary care provider on a monthly basis, as well as undergoing outpatient treatment for her substance abuse. Although the appellant's discovery responses indicate that they were prepared by her representative on the basis of his interaction with the appellant, it seems rather unlikely that the appellant's representative could have discussed the matters raised in the discovery requests without learning, at a minimum, that his client had a weekly appointment with her psychologist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We recognize that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are instructive, rather than controlling, in proceedings before the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(a).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submits for the first time on review progress reports and clinical notes from Dr. Renick, dating from November 7, 2008, to May 5, 2011. Aside from April 21, 2011 and May 5, 2011 progress notes, which we discuss below, these reports were available before the close of the record below, and the appellant has not argued that they were unavailable to her despite her due diligence. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115, the Board will not consider evidence submitted for the first time with the petition for review absent a showing that it was unavailable before the record was closed despite the party's due diligence. <span class="Italic">Avansino v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 211, 214 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge noted that the appellant did not produce any treatment notes from Dr. Renick describing the basis for his initial medical diagnosis of the appellant aside from her subjective complaints. On review, the appellant's representative argues that he did not file the complete set of medical documents from Dr. Renick because he believed that the documents submitted below "appeared to be a complete medical basis for the [a]ppellant's claim" and that he did not anticipate having to produce these documents. Thus, he argues, the Board should consider these documents to be new evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In rare circumstances, the Board will reopen the record in a retirement appeal to consider documentation that was previously available below because the Board's primary consideration in such appeals is whether the appellant is entitled to the benefits that she seeks. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Matson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16, 21 (2007). Such circumstances do not exist here. The appellant was represented below and is represented on review by the same attorney. The <span id="Page_1658"></span>administrative judge gave the appellant notice of her burden of proof, including all of the elements necessary to establish her entitlement to disability retirement benefits, and she does not claim that she was misled or lacked notice of the applicable legal standard to prove her case. The administrative judge further specified that the type of evidence to be considered in a disability retirement appeal includes objective clinical findings, diagnoses and medical opinions, and evidence relating to the effect of the appellant's condition on her ability to perform in the grade or class of position last occupied. Although we make no finding regarding whether Dr. Renick's notes and reports might have affected the outcome of this case had they been properly submitted below, we find counsel's argument that he was unaware that such documents were necessary to be an insufficient reason for the Board to consider documents that were available to the appellant prior to the close of the record below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have also considered Dr. Renick's April 21, 2011 and May 5, 2011 reports, which were not available to the appellant prior to the close of the record below, and we find that they do not change the outcome of this appeal. Neither report includes material information regarding the appellant's anxiety and depression. In fact, the May 5, 2011 report tends to demonstrate that her symptoms have improved. Further, neither report explains how her medical condition affects her ability to perform the functions of her position. Thus, they are not of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Russo v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 345, 349 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also submits on review a follow-up report from Dr. Renick that postdates the initial decision. In this April 29, 2011 report, Dr. Renick specifically responds to several of the administrative judge's findings. He relies upon his previous assessments of the appellant and states that "[his] expressions with regard to her inability to work took into consideration her work duties." He attaches the appellant's job description to the report and states that his familiarity with the appellant's duties and responsibilities were initially developed from discussions with her and have subsequently been confirmed by his review of the attached job description. The contents of the April 29, 2011 letter, and Dr. Renick's opinions contained therein, are solely based upon the doctor's previous diagnoses of the appellant from November 7, 2008, through May 26, 2010, which is information that was clearly available prior to the close of the record below. <span class="Italic">See Musser v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 18, &#x00B6; 11 (2006); <span class="Italic">Grassell v. Department of Transportation</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 554, 564 (1989). The document does not purport to explain any change in circumstance that might warrant a different outcome. Further, this document was created for the specific purpose of providing information that was available prior to the close of the record below to rebut the explained findings of the administrative judge. An appellant must set forth her strongest case before the administrative judge and support it by the relevant evidence available to her at the time; there is no evidence or claim here that the appellant was somehow prevented from doing so. Additionally, under the circumstances of this case, any assertion that the appellant or her counsel was unaware that particular evidence is relevant to her claim is unpersuasive. Consequently, we find that the April 29, 2011 follow-up report does not constitute new evidence warranting the Board's consideration.</p>
