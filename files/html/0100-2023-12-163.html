<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-162"><span class="space">a.</span> Proof of Mailing; Postmark; Mailbox Rule</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A recurrent problem caused by the Board's rigid insistence on timely filings is proof of mailing. The regulations governing mailing define the date of mailing by the postmark date on the mail. Once a letter is dropped into a letter box or deposited over the counter of the post office, there is no real control over the process of postmarking the packet. Many cases were dismissed by the Board because the party filing the PFR incorrectly assumed a postmark would be affixed to the envelope containing the PFR on the same day that the envelope was dropped into the mails. Through 1991 the Board's approach was essentially to determine whether a party was reasonable in its expectations or presumptions concerning the efficiency of the local post office. Now the Board is more concerned about the circumstances of the mailing than it is about the circumstances of the postal collection scheme. The rule now is that a postmark date may be rebutted by evidence of when the pleading was actually placed into the postal mail stream. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-12-172.html#sec5-171">Mailroom Delay in Posting PFR</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When there is an issue as to when and how a PFR was mailed, evidence must be submitted in the form required by the Board's show cause order. That order will call for a sworn statement or affidavit and any supporting documentary evidence. Under 5 CFR 1201.114(g) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Late filings</span>. Any pleading described in paragraph (a) of this section that is filed late must be accompanied by a motion that shows good cause for the untimely filing, unless the Board has specifically granted an extension of time under paragraph (f) of this section, or unless a motion for extension is pending before the Board. The motion must be accompanied by an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746. (<span class="Italic">See</span> Appendix IV.) The affidavit or sworn statement must include: The reasons for failing to request an extension before the deadline for the submission, and a specific and detailed description of the circumstances causing the late filing, accompanied by supporting documentation or other evidence. Any response to the motion may be included in the response to the petition for review, the cross petition for review, or the response to the cross petition for review. The response will not extend the time provided by paragraph (e) of this section to file a cross petition for review or to respond to the petition or cross petition. In the absence of a motion, the Board may, in its discretion, determine on the basis of the existing record whether there was good cause for the untimely filing, or it may provide the party that submitted the document with an opportunity to show why it should not be dismissed or excluded as untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1991 the Board simplified its analysis of how one proves that a document is mailed short of a properly certified receipt from the Postal Service. <span class="Italic">Raphel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 614, 617-18 (1991), announced that a party may establish a mailing date by presenting credible, unrebutted evidence in the form of an affidavit or sworn statement that, despite the postmark date, the pleading was actually placed in the Postal Service mail stream before the filing deadline and, accordingly, was timely filed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations provide for three methods of filing a document, i.e., by personal delivery, facsimile, or mail. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.4(l) and 1201.26(b)(2).... [T]he Board considers the postmark date to be the date of filing of a mailed submission. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.4(l). The Board has noted, however, that, under Federal civil practice, "[a] paper is mailed when it has been placed in an envelope addressed to the last known address of the opposing attorney--or party when service on a party is proper--and deposited in a United States Post Office or post office box." <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 37, 40 (1987), quoting Wright &#x0026; Miller, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice and Procedure</span>, Civil &#x00A7; 1148 (1969). Thus, the date that a pleading submitted to the Board is actually placed in the Postal Service mail stream constitutes the mailing date....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the postmark date ordinarily determines the date of a filing by mail under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.4(l), a party in an appeal before the Board must be permitted to present credible evidence--in the form of an affidavit or a <span id="Page_1741"></span>sworn statement to show good cause for an apparently untimely petition for review as required by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.114(f)--to establish that, despite the postmark date, the pleading was actually placed in the Postal Service mail stream before the filing deadline and thus was timely filed. In fact, the Board in some cases has examined such evidence to determine whether it was sufficient to establish that a pleading postmarked after the deadline date was actually timely placed in the Postal Service mail stream.... The Board cannot presume that the Postal Service is an error-free organization and that all mail is always timely and properly postmarked. Thus, if the affidavit or sworn statement filed by a party is unrebutted by the opposing party and is not inherently incredible...the Board may find that the pleading was timely filed. The fact that a party waited until the last day for filing the pleading with the Board by mail is irrelevant, because the pleading was in fact timely filed by the deadline date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This rebuttable presumption analysis is similar to the Board's rule that "if no legible postmark date appears on the mailing, the submission <span class="Italic">is presumed</span> to have been mailed five days...before its receipt." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.4(l) (emphasis supplied). This analysis is also similar to the well-established rebuttable presumption of receipt by the addressee of properly mailed letters and notices.... The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have determined that the presumption of receipt of properly mailed letters and notices can be overcome by the unrebutted testimony, if credible, or affidavit of the addressee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kelly v. United States</span>, 826 F. 2d 1049, 1053 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 39 MSPR at 301.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we hold that while under the Board's regulations the postmark date is ordinarily the date of filing of a mailed submission, a party may establish otherwise by presenting credible, unrebutted evidence in the form of an affidavit or sworn statement that, despite the postmark date, the pleading was actually placed in the Postal Service mail stream before the filing deadline and thus was timely filed.[2]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">"Under the common law mailbox rule, 'if a letter properly directed is proved to have been either put into the post office or delivered to the postman, it is presumed, from the known course of business in the post office department, that it reached its destination at the regular time, and was received by the person to whom it was addressed.'" <span class="Italic">Rios v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board rejected the affidavit from Mr. Anania's counsel, Mr. Carpenter, as per se insufficient. Without examining the credibility of Mr. Carpenter's affidavit, the Board explained that the mailbox rule presumption does not attach to Mr. Anania's filing because "the only evidence cited by the representative as proof of the mailing is his own sworn affidavit," which "amounts to no more than self-serving testimony, as described by the [Veterans] Court in <span class="Italic">Rios II.</span>"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The common law mailbox rule is a longstanding doctrine that originated from British case law early in the nineteenth century, <span class="Italic">Adams v. Lindsell</span> (1818) 106 Eng. Rep. 250 (KB). It was recognized by the Supreme Court by the end of the nineteenth century. <span class="Italic">See Rosenthal</span>, 111 U.S. at 193; <span class="Italic">Patrick v. Bowman</span>, 149 U.S. 411, 424 (1893). In assessing the correctness of the Veterans Court's bright-line rule against party affidavits, we consider the application of the common law mailbox rule in other circuits.[2] Many of our sister circuits have previously identified evidence sufficient to invoke the presumption of receipt under the rule, and have consistently opted not to apply a per se rule against self-serving testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the common law mailbox rule has become less important over time with the emergence and preference for electronic filing. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(b)(2)(E) (allowing service by filing papers with the court's electronic-filing system).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After reviewing the decisions of our sister circuits, we conclude that the common law mailbox rule is best understood as not including a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule holding party affidavits insufficient. As we have previously stated, all that is required for the presumption to attach is evidence demonstrating that the mail was "properly addressed, stamped, and mailed in adequate time to reach the [destination] in the normal course of post office business," or, "[i]n lieu of 'direct' proof of mailing,...evidence of mailing custom or routine practice." <span class="Italic">Rios I</span>, 490 F.3d at 933. The Veterans Court therefore erred in applying a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule to find Mr. Carpenter's affidavit insufficient.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Government does seem to argue that Mr. Carpenter's affidavit is conclusory. Resp. Br. 23 ("Without more, the conclusory statements provided in the affidavit are insufficient to establish proof of mailing by circumstantial evidence of mailings and practices."). Whether testimony is conclusory presents a legal question within our purview. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., TQ Delta, LLC v. Cisco Sys., Inc.</span>, 942 F.3d 1352, 1358-1362 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (determining that certain expert testimony was conclusory and thus inadequate to support the Board's factfinding regarding motivation to combine); <span class="Italic">Pure Gold, Inc. v. Syntex (U.S.A.), Inc.</span>, 739 F.2d 624, 627 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (determining that certain attorney argument was merely conclusory and so did not raise a genuine issue of material fact). We hold that Mr. Carpenter's testimony is not conclusory for purposes of demonstrating that the substantive appeal was properly addressed, stamped, and mailed in adequate time to reach the VA. In his affidavit, Mr. Carpenter expressly stated that his mail was properly addressed "to the Regional Office in Waco, Texas." Though his statement does not say that he put on postage, putting on postage is inherent in his statement that he "mailed a substantive appeal." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Finally, mailing the substantive appeal on January 18, 2010 is more than adequate time to reach the VA before the filing deadline of March 3, 2010, a point conceded by the Government.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit accepted the Board's "mailbox rule," <span class="Italic">Tatum v. MSPB</span>, 482 Fed. Appx. 554, 556-57 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under the common law mailbox rule, if a properly directed letter is proved to have been delivered to the post office, this creates an "inference of fact" that the letter was received by the addressee. <span class="Italic">Rios v. Nicholson</span>, 490 F.3d 928, 930-31 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quoting <span class="Italic">Rosenthal v. Walker</span>, 111 U.S. 185, 193 (1884)). If there is opposing evidence that the letter was not received, the trier of fact must weigh the evidence "with all the other circumstances of the case" to determine whether the letter was actually received. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 931 (quoting <span class="Italic">Rosenthal</span>, 111 U.S. at 194). In this case, the Board concluded that Tatum failed to rebut the presumption because he did not explicitly claim that he did not receive the letter or that the address was incorrect, and we cannot conclude that this factual finding is unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">One issue resolved in 1993, among the extraordinary number of issues that seem to arise from an act as simple as mailing a PFR, was whether an item is "mailed" on the date it is placed into a mailbox if it is placed in the mailbox after the last collection scheduled from the box on the day of mailing. <span class="Italic">Fisher v. DOD</span>, 59 MSPR 165, 167-69 (1993), determined that the mailing is made on the day of mailing irrespective of the collection schedule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Board's regulations, a document may be filed by personal delivery, by facsimile, or by mail. 5 CFR 1201.22(d). When a document is filed by mail, the filing date is ordinarily determined by the postmark date. 5 CFR 1201.4(l).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Raphel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 614 (1991), as here, the appellant's petition for review was postmarked 1 day after the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 616. In response to the Clerk's show-cause notice, Ms. Raphel submitted an affidavit in which she averred that her husband had mailed her petition at a particular U.S. Post Office before midnight on the filing deadline date. The Board held that the filing date for a mailed document is the date that it is mailed, viz., placed in the Postal Service mail stream, and that the postmark date merely constitutes rebuttable evidence of the mailing date. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 617-18. The Board thus found that the appellant's credible, unrebutted affidavit was sufficient to establish that her petition was timely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1742"></span>In the present appeal, the appellant has submitted a declaration, under penalty of perjury, in which he avers that he mailed his petition to the Board shortly after 10:15 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, on January 7, 1993, by depositing it in a U.S. Postal Service mailbox at the Pittsburgh General Mail Facility. We find that this declaration is specific and plausible concerning the steps taken by the appellant to mail his petition for review and constitutes credible evidence that he placed it in the Postal Service mail stream before midnight on the filing deadline date. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Raphel</span>, 50 MSPR at 618-19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends and has submitted supporting evidence to show that the last scheduled mail collection time for the mailboxes at the Pittsburgh General Mail Facility is 10:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, as marked on the mailboxes, and that any mail deposited in those mailboxes after 10:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> is postmarked the following day. The agency refers to the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Raphel</span> that the Board could not "presume that the Postal Service is an error-free organization and that all mail is always timely and properly postmarked," <span class="Italic">Raphel</span>, 50 MSPR at 618, and contends that the appellant's petition was postmarked on January 8, 1993, not because of any Postal Service error but because he failed to deposit it in the mailbox before the last scheduled collection time on January 7, 1993. The agency further contends that, "[i]n at least two cases, decided after <span class="Italic">Raphel</span>, the Board attached significance to evidence that placement in the mailbox occurred prior to the last scheduled collection for that location," and cites <span class="Italic">Jude v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 5, 6 n.* (1991), and<span class="Italic"> De La Cruz v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 610, 612 (1991). The agency thus argues that, because the appellant failed to deposit his petition in the mailbox before the last scheduled collection time on the filing deadline date, his petition was not timely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board did state in <span class="Italic">Raphel</span> that mail may not always be "timely and properly postmarked" by the Postal Service. <span class="Italic">Raphel</span>, 50 MSPR at 618. Ms. Raphel did not allege that her petition was placed in the mailbox before the last scheduled collection time, however, and the holding in <span class="Italic">Raphel</span> was not limited to situations where the Postal Service may have failed to timely and properly postmark a filing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 616-19. In <span class="Italic">Jude</span>, 52 MSPR at 6 n.*, and <span class="Italic">De La Cruz</span>, 51 MSPR at 612, the Board described the petitioners' assertions that their petitions were placed in mailboxes before the last scheduled collection time. However, the Board did not specifically rely on the petitioners' assertions regarding the mail collection time to find that their petitions were timely filed; nor did the Board state that it was limiting in any way its holding in <span class="Italic">Raphel</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jude</span>, 52 MSPR at 6 n.*; <span class="Italic">De La Cruz</span>, 51 MSPR at 612; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Morey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 22, 25 (1991); <span class="Italic">Palmer v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 552, 554 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, a document placed in a mailbox, or otherwise deposited in the U.S. Postal Service mail stream, before midnight on the filing deadline date is timely filed. We therefore find that the appellant's credible, unrebutted declaration under penalty of perjury is sufficient to establish the timely filing of his petition for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The PFR is timely if it almost makes it to the letter box on time, but instead is given to the Postal Service driver making his collection rounds. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rhea v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 254, 256 n.1 (1993). The key to proper filing of a mailed PFR is proof of whether it was timely "placed into the Postal Service mail stream." In <span class="Italic">Thomas v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 31, 34 n.1 (1993), a response to a PFR was rejected. The Board explained that "OPM's representative has submitted a statement signed under penalty of perjury in which he asserts that the response was properly mailed on the last day for filing, but does not state based on his own knowledge or other evidence that the response was deposited in the Postal Service mailstream on the last day for filing." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Manker v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 405, 409 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (accepting a PFR when a sworn statement from counsel's legal assistant stated that he had placed the PFR in a post office box at a pickup time of 1:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, July 30, 1998, and that the post office apparently failed to postmark it until August 1: "While this claim is less specific than it could be, we find that it suffices to explain the brief delay involved."); <span class="Italic">Vargo v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 66, 70-71 (1998) (PFR was timely when the appellant submitted an uncontested affidavit demonstrating that the PFR was placed in the mail stream by the filing deadline).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, however, has recognized an exception to this presumption where a party presents credible, unrebutted evidence that its pleading was placed in the Postal Service mail stream before the filing deadline despite its postmark. <span class="Italic">See Turner v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 381, &#x00B6; 5 n.2 (2003). In such cases, the Board has found petitions timely, where, for example, a party avers that he placed the filing in a mail shoot at a post office prior to the filing deadline, or where he attests that he properly stamped and addressed the mailing and presents evidence corroborating the date on which the mailing was delivered to the post office, notwithstanding the postmark. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Williams v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 472, 475-76 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the evidence submitted by the agency on review fails to meet these standards. The agency has only offered a generalized statement that its submission was placed "in the stream of mail per normal and customary office procedures." Left unanswered, however, is whether the agency's submission was deposited into the Postal Service's mail stream on December 9, 2014, or what the agency's "normal and customary office procedures" entail. As our decisions emphasize, in order to establish the timeliness of an otherwise facially untimely submission, the moving party must submit "credible, unrebutted evidence...[that] the pleading was placed in the <span class="Italic">Postal Service</span> mail stream before the filing deadline." <span class="Italic">Turner</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 381, &#x00B6; 5 n.2 (emphasis added). Averring that the submission was placed in the "stream of mail per normal and customary office procedures," without more, does not satisfy this standard.[3] <span class="Italic">See Carranza v. Department of the Navy,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. 209, 212 (1994) (finding the statement that the filing was placed in the "normal office stream of mail" did not establish that it was placed in the Postal Service's mail stream).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note, moreover, that the agency's representative stated in her response to the Clerk's notice that "the [a]gency placed the [p]etition for [r]eview into <span class="Italic">its</span> mail stream on the deadline." (emphasis added). Although the statements of a representative are generally not evidence, we find this statement reinforces our conclusion that the record does not reflect that the agency placed its petition for review in the Postal Service mail stream on December 9, 2014. <span class="Italic">See Marcantel v. Department of Energy</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6; 6 n.1 (2014) (statements of representatives are generally not evidence).</p>

Unlike the first paragraph, however, the second statement concerning the document dated August 28, 2013, was not made under the penalty of perjury, nor was there language at the end of the document indicating that the content of the document in its entirety was made under the penalty of perjury. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. ("I further state and affirm that...I mailed the Appellant's reply and 5 exhibits in a Priority Mail Container stamped August 28, 2013...."). Therefore, we find that this statement is not probative evidence of the mailing. Further, although the appellant's representative stated "see attached," presumably indicating that there is evidence of his assertions concerning the August 28, 2013 documents, he did not attach any documents to the statement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may consider circumstantial evidence concerning mailing a PFR in addition to the information presented by affidavit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rivers v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 54 MSPR 128, 131 (1992) (concerning the agency's argument that it timely mailed its PFR, the Board considered that the appellant's response to the PFR was filed exactly 25 days after the agency claimed to have served its PFR), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Gaydon v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 198, 204 (1994). One item of evidence that is likely to convince the Board is a USPS-stamped certified mail receipt, accepted in <span class="Italic">Nance v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 55 MSPR 68, 69 n.1 (1992), to overcome the date of mailing suggested by a postmark entered a day later.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is flexible, not bountiful. A PFR was evidently prepared well in advance of the deadline and apparently mailed to the agency before the deadline, but it was not postmarked until well after the deadline. The Board faulted the appellant for not submitting a sworn statement concerning the circumstances of the mailing of the PFR to the Board, and noted that the appellant claimed he mailed the PFR in New Jersey, but the postmark was New York. The Board decided that the "timing of that receipt [of the PFR by the Board] is consistent with the proposition that, even though the petition evidently was prepared a month before the postmark date, it was not mailed until the date it was postmarked." <span class="Italic">Mack v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 572, 575 (1992) (given the circumstances pertaining to the mailing of the PFR, the Board did not place much weight on notarization of PFR and certificate of service).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before 1991 the Board's analysis was less forgiving of parties who relied on the post office to postmark an envelope on the same day it was placed into the letter box. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gray v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 40 MSPR 155, 158 (1989). Eleventh-hour mailings, resulting in untimely postmarks, were insufficient to warrant acceptance of the PFR in <span class="Italic">Baker v. DOJ</span>, 41 MSPR 25, 27 (1989), in <span class="Italic">Lander v. GSA</span>, 43 MSPR 272, 273-74 (1990), and in <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 45 MSPR 118, 119 (1990). <span class="Italic">Cook v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 271, 273 (1990), admonished that if the appellant waited until the last day to post the PFR, he should have determined whether his petition would be postmarked on the day it was mailed or he should have determined the location of another postal office that would postmark the mail on the same day.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some things did not change in 1991. An affidavit should be provided describing the manner of mailing a PFR postmarked after the day it was allegedly mailed. <span class="Italic">Stromfeld v. DOJ</span>, 25 MSPR 240, 241 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cantrell v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 248, 250 (1987) (alleged four-day delay in the mailing and postmarking was unexplained by an affidavit or statement signed under penalty of perjury). A PFR postmarked one day late was rejected as untimely. Although the appellant wrote the Board a letter stating that it had been mailed a couple days before the deadline, the letter was not a substitute for the affidavit or a statement signed under the penalty of perjury, as the Clerk's notice to show cause directed the appellant to file. <span class="Italic">Hutton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 56 MSPR 165, 167 (1992) (appellant with two jobs did not demonstrate how he was prevented from making a timely filing); <span class="Italic">Vitale v. DOJ</span>, 33 MSPR 97, 99 (1987) (additionally, the appellant failed to supply a certified mail receipt or explain how holding two jobs prevented a timely filing); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 395, 397 n.2 (1988) (cross-PFR and a response to the PFR was untimely by a day and rejected when the explanation that the materials were mailed on time but postmarked a day later was not contained in an affidavit or a statement under the penalty of perjury). The party who sought to excuse a PFR that was placed in a Postal Service letter box on the day it was due, but that was not postmarked until the following day, should have included in the affidavit a statement concerning the pickup schedule for that letter box as well as a statement demonstrating that the PFR was mailed prior to that pickup time. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fogelson v. OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 9, 12 (1988) (rejecting an agency PFR one day late when the affidavit describing the mailing did not state whether the affiant checked the mail pickup schedule).</p>
