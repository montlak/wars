<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-181"><span class="space">m.</span> Back Pay Act</h5>
<p class="noindent">By reason of its importance in FLRA and arbitration determinations concerning entitlement to back pay, we excerpt here the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596, providing for back pay in the event of unwarranted or unjustified personnel actions (or omissions to act), interest on back pay, and counsel fees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Back pay due to unjustified personnel action</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this section, "agency" means--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;an Executive agency;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the Federal Judicial Center, and the courts named by section 610 of title 28;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;the Library of Congress;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(4)&#x2003;the Government Printing Office;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(5)&#x2003;the government of the District of Columbia;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(6)&#x2003;the Architect of the Capitol, including employees of the United States Senate Restaurants; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(7)&#x2003;the United States Botanic Garden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)(1)&#x2003;An employee of an agency who, on the basis of a timely appeal or an administrative determination (including a decision relating to an unfair labor practice or a grievance) is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, to receive for the period for which the personnel action was in effect--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that period; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;reasonable attorney fees related to the personnel action which, with respect to any decision relating to an unfair labor practice or a grievance processed under a procedure negotiated in accordance with chapter 71 of this title, or under chapter 11 of title I of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, shall be awarded in accordance with standards established under section 7701(g) of this title; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;for all purposes, is deemed to have performed service for the agency during that period, except that--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;annual leave restored under this paragraph which is in excess of the maximum leave accumulation permitted by law shall be credited to a separate leave account for the employee and shall be available for use by the employee within the time limits prescribed by regulations of the Office of Personnel Management, and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;annual leave credited under clause (i) of this subparagraph but unused and still available to the employee under regulations prescribed by the Office shall be included in the lump-sum payment under section 5551 or 5552(1) of this title but may not be retained to the credit of the employee under section 5552(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)(A)&#x2003;An amount payable under paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection shall be payable with interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;Such interest--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;shall be computed for the period beginning on the effective date of the withdrawal or reduction involved and ending on a date not more than 30 days before the date on which payment is made;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;shall be computed at the rate or rates in effect under section 6621(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 during the period described in clause (i); and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iii) shall be compounded daily.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;Interest under this paragraph shall be paid out of amounts available for payments under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Back Pay Act is a grant of remedial authority that avoids the sovereign immunity of the United States that would otherwise preclude nonstatutory charges against the federal fisc. The Back Pay Act, operating as a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, also serves as a check on the authority of arbitrators to fashion monetary remedies that are outside the scope of the Back Pay Act. The remedies established by the Civil Service Reform Act generally preclude implied sources of monetary relief for federal employees, although the Back Pay Act, incorporated into the remedial scheme of the Reform Act, is not the only statutory source of authority for economic recovery by employees. The civil rights statutes, overtime statutes, and the Whistleblower Protection Act, among other statutes and constitutional provisions, establish remedial authority that supplements, or that is independent of, the Reform Act. OPM regulations at 5 CFR Part 550 Subpart H (2022) implement the Back Pay Act.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">An award of backpay is authorized under the Back Pay Act only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or the reduction of an employee's pay, allowances, or differentials.[21]</p>

The Union acknowledges that the Arbitrator found that the parties' agreement is "silent regarding issues of improper pay grade and an appeal for backpay," but the Union did not file an essence exception to this finding. Therefore, absent a finding that the grievants were affected by an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action, the Arbitrator did not have the authority to award backpay under the Back Pay Act.[26]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">First, the Agency argues that the award is deficient because the Arbitrator did not find that the grievants were affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. The first BPA requirement is satisfied if an arbitrator finds a violation of an applicable law, rule, regulation, or provision of a collective-bargaining agreement.[64] The Agency <span id="page_1983"></span>contends that this requirement is not satisfied because the Arbitrator failed to identify which provision of law, regulation, or the agreement that the Agency violated when it released the grievants to non-work status. However, the Authority has stated that an arbitrator's finding of a contract violation satisfies the first requirement even if the arbitrator fails to specify what contract provision was violated.[66]</p>

He also found that the Agency violated the agreement when it released the grievants to non-work status. As noted above, we have denied the Agency's exceptions challenging that determination. Thus, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency violated the agreement satisfies the first BPA requirement.[69]</p>

<p class="noindent">But an arbitrator should articulate in her award the connection between a contract, statutory, or regulatory violation and the remedial award of back pay. <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU Chap. 164</span>, 65 FLRA 160, 164 (2010), overturned a portion of an award for lack of an explicit connection:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, an award of backpay is authorized under the Back Pay Act only when an arbitrator finds that the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or the reduction of an employee's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See Warner Robins</span>, 56 FLRA at 543. Here, the Arbitrator failed to find a nexus between the removal of the grievant's firearm and a loss in pay or benefits, as required by the Back Pay Act. Accordingly, the award of backpay for the removal of the grievant's firearm is contrary to the Back Pay Act, and we set it aside. <span class="Italic">See Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, N.H</span>., 49 FLRA 1522, 1533 (1994) (Authority declined to order an award of backpay where there was no nexus between the violation and a monetary loss). </p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator awarded backpay because the Agency's right to place the grievant on administrative duties pending investigation contained "implicit time dimensions" and "a 'timely investigation' is, <span class="Italic">in [the Arbitrator's]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic"> judgment</span>, an essential ingredient of <span class="Italic">due process</span>," and because he found that the grievant was subjected to disparate treatment. And while the Arbitrator obliquely refers to an unspecified right "(impliedly) create[d]" by "the parties' [agreement] or the applicable statutes," the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency violated any applicable law, rule, regulation, or provision of the parties' collective-bargaining agreement in connection with the Agency's delay in conducting its internal investigation, or with due-process or disparate-treatment issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, although the Arbitrator quotes Article 32 (among other articles) at the beginning of the award, he does not discuss that provision in his analysis. Likewise, although the Union argues that while the Arbitrator's finding of a "'due[-]process' violation is framed in general terms, it can easily find its foundation in either Article 32...or[&#8197;] the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution," the Arbitrator expressly rejected the reasoning of another recent arbitrator, who found that Article 32.G requires the Agency to conduct internal investigations as quickly as practicable.[22] Further, a finding of a constitutional due-process violation would require a finding that the grievant had a property interest in his eligibility to earn AUO pay.[23] But the Arbitrator made no such finding, and the Union provides no authority for such a proposition. Likewise, the Arbitrator does not reference any relevant statutory or regulatory provisions other than the BPA. Finally, "[i]n order to find disparate[-]treatment...discrimination, the Arbitrator was required to find that the grievant [is a] member[&#8197;] of a protected class,"[24] and the Arbitrator made no such finding.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As such, the award does not include a finding that the Agency committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action as required by the BPA.

<p class="noindent-1">Even though the Arbitrator found that there was insufficient evidence to show that the Agency should have selected the grievant for the position, the Arbitrator awarded the grievant backpay as though he had established his entitlement to the position. Explaining his decision, the Arbitrator stated that the grievant deserved compensation for the Agency's many violations. The Agency argues that the backpay remedy is contrary to the Back Pay Act (the Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, in order justify an award of backpay under the Act, an arbitrator's findings must establish that a violation "resulted in" an employee's loss of some pay.[80] Here, the Arbitrator explicitly found that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the grievant lost any pay due to the Agency's violations.

<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;The Remedy Award</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that there is no statute waiving sovereign immunity for the remedies imposed.&#x2003;As a general matter, the United States is immune from liability for money damages under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">See INS, L.A. Dist., L.A., Cal.</span>, 52 FLRA 103, 104 (1996) (<span class="Italic">INS L.A.</span>). In certain circumstances, as discussed further below, the United States <span id="page_1984"></span>Constitution alone supports a cause of action for damages against Federal actors. <span class="Italic">See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics</span>, 403 U.S. 388 (1971) (<span class="Italic">Bivens</span>). In addition, sovereign immunity can be waived by statute if the waiver is unequivocally expressed in the statutory text. <span class="Italic">See INS L.A.</span>, 52 FLRA at 104-05. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine whether the First Amendment and/or the Back Pay Act support an award of the various monetary remedies here.[13]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;We do not address whether either the Fifth Amendment or the WPA authorizes these remedies, as we have set aside the Arbitrator's findings of Fifth Amendment and WPA violations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;The First Amendment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has held that where the claims alleging violations of constitutional rights "arise out of an employment relationship that is governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions giving meaningful remedies against the United States,...it would be inappropriate for [the Court] to supplement that regulatory scheme with a new judicial remedy." <span class="Italic">Bush v. Lucas</span>, 462 U.S. 367, 368 (1983). In this connection, the Supreme Court cited the Back Pay Act and the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) as examples of legislation that have contributed to the "comprehensive scheme" that provides Federal employees with meaningful remedies. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 385. Accordingly, a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action is unavailable to employees covered by the Back Pay Act and the CSRA. <span class="Italic">Cf. Feit v. Ward</span>, 886 F.2d 848, 855 (7th Cir. 1989) (addressing the CSRA).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the grievant is covered by the Back Pay Act and the CSRA, <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> damages are not available to the grievant. Instead, any damages awarded must be authorized by the comprehensive statutory scheme created by Congress for Federal employees. Accordingly, we conclude that the First Amendment, by itself, does not provide a basis for the remedies awarded in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;The Back Pay Act</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Back Pay Act constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of HHS</span>, 54 FLRA 1210, 1217 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of HHS</span>). Accordingly, we address whether the various remedies awarded are authorized by the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-3">i.&#x2003;Backpay</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, an award of backpay is authorized only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of HHS</span>, 54 FLRA at 1219.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first requirement, a violation of an "applicable law" constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803. <span class="Italic">Accord United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr., Newport, R.I.</span>, 56 FLRA 477, 479 (2000) (citations omitted). There is no assertion, and no other basis for concluding, that the First Amendment is not an applicable law under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Cf. Pan. Canal Comm'n</span>, 33 FLRA 15, 21-22 (1988), <span class="Italic">clarified</span>, 34 FLRA 740 (1990) (First Amendment constitutes an "applicable law" within meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute). Accordingly, the Arbitrator's finding of a First Amendment violation satisfies the first requirement of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the second requirement, the Agency argues that the grievant did not suffer a loss of pay as a result of the Agency's violation. Under regulations implementing the Back Pay Act, an employee may receive backpay if the employee is unavailable to work due to an incapacitating illness that was caused by, or related to, the personnel action. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Educ.</span>, 50 FLRA 34, 37 (1994) (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(c)). <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Educ.</span> involved a grievant who had a "stress-induced condition precipitated by the [a]gency's action." 50 FLRA at 35.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that "the unrebutted evidence confirms the Grievant was so emotionally damaged by the Agency's actions that he has been unable to perform nursing duties[.]" Thus, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's inability to work was caused by the violation of the First Amendment. As a result, the second requirement of the Back Pay Act is satisfied here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Arbitrator did not explain the amount of backpay that he awarded, and the record does not reflect how he determined that amount. In this connection, as the Agency argues, it is unclear whether the Arbitrator deducted any amounts already paid to the grievant, such as compensation for sick and annual leave he used during the time period at issue, or any other deductions required by law. <span class="Italic">See Veterans Admin. &#x0026; Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Northport, N.Y.</span>, 25 FLRA 523, 527 (1987) (citation omitted), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 843 F.2d 550 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (backpay award must deduct, among other things, "annual leave payments[&#8197;]"). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805 (explaining how backpay computations must be made). Accordingly, we are unable to determine whether the amount of backpay awarded is permitted under the Back Pay Act, and we remand the backpay award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for a clarification as to the appropriate amount of backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">ii.&#x2003;Lost retirement benefits</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) definition of the "pay, allowances, and differentials" recoverable under the Back Pay Act states, in pertinent part, that "[a]gency and employee contributions to a retirement investment fund, such as the Thrift Savings Plan, are not covered." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803. Applying this regulation, we conclude that the Back Pay Act does not authorize the award of lost retirement benefits, and we set aside that portion of the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">iii.&#x2003;Moving expenses, medical expenses and related travel expenses, the cost of a replacement life insurance policy, and damages for psychological injuries</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, OPM defines "pay, allowances, and differentials" as "pay, leave, and other monetary employment benefits to which an employee is entitled by statute or regulation and which are payable by the employing agency to an employee during periods of Federal employment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803. Thus, in order to constitute "pay, allowances, and differentials" recoverable under the Back Pay Act, a remedy must not only constitute "pay, leave, [or] other monetary employment benefits[,]" but also must be something to which the employee "is entitled by statute or regulation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In determining whether an employee "is entitled by statute or regulation" to a remedy, the Authority has considered whether a Federal statute or regulation other than the Back Pay Act itself permits payment of that type of remedy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 52 FLRA 46, 50 n.6 (1996) (considering whether 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7901 and 8101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> permit payment for medical expenses under the Back Pay Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The WPA is the only "statute"--and there is no "regulation"--relied on by the Union to argue an entitlement to moving expenses, medical expenses and related travel expenses, the cost of a replacement life insurance policy, and damages for psychological injuries. As we have set aside the Arbitrator's finding of a WPA violation, there is no basis for finding that these remedies are permitted under the Back Pay Act, and we set them aside.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">iv.&#x2003;Front pay</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Front pay is not authorized by the Back Pay Act.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See SSA, Branch Office, E. Liverpool, Ohio</span>, 54 FLRA 142, 149 (1998). Accordingly, as the Back Pay Act does not authorize the award of front pay, we set it aside.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Back Pay Act now provides that omissions can constitute an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.&#x2003;OPM regulations and Comptroller General precedent permitted omissions to constitute an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action even before the statute was amended to include omissions. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, 61 Comp. Gen. 408, 411 (1982). The part of the Back Pay Act in dispute here is whether an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action took place as determined under "applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement" (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)). The Comptroller General, in interpreting law, rule and regulation, has established certain rules as to when "administrative or clerical errors" (hereinafter the administrative error rule) constitute unjustified or unwarranted personnel actions under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The basic administrative error rule is set forth in <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, 58 Comp. Gen. 51, 53 (1978), and is discussed in the context of being an exception to the general rule that personnel actions may not be retroactive so as to increase employee compensation. We note that Arbitrator Bloch cited to this same rule in making his decision. The administrative error rule identifies three situations when an administrative error creates an unjustified or <span id="page_1985"></span>unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, when the administrative error: (1) prevents a personnel action from being effected as originally intended; (2) results in a nondiscretionary administrative regulation or policy not being carried out; or (3) deprives an employee of a right granted by statute or regulation. Later Comptroller General decisions confirm explicitly that these administrative errors constitute unjustified or unwarranted personnel actions under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See Bishop</span>, Comp. Gen. Decision No. B-206,181 (May 5, 1982) (unpublished). While most of the Comptroller General's decisions addressing this issue deal with promotion actions, <span class="Italic">Butler</span> speaks of "personnel actions" in general, and <span class="Italic">Whitlock</span>, 58 Comp. Gen. 290 (1979), for example, addresses the issue in the context of a quality step increase. Thus, the rule is clearly not limited to promotion actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first prong under the administrative error rule is time sensitive in that the error must occur after the official authorized to approve the personnel action has so acted.&#x2003;An error falling under the second and third prongs is not time-sensitive. <span class="Italic">See Cahill</span>, 58 Comp. Gen. 59 (1978), where the Comptroller General noted that an administrative error occurring before the authorizing official acted would not fall under the first prong of the administrative error rule but could fall under the second or third prong if there were some applicable law, rule or regulation mandating a specified time frame for action, or specified criteria which limited the agency's discretion to approve or disapprove the personnel action. The rationale for the distinction made under the first prong is that, after the authorizing official has exercised his or her authority by approving the personnel action, all that remains to effect the personnel action is a series of ministerial acts, for which a retroactive personnel action would be the appropriate remedy for the failure or delay in accomplishing those ministerial acts. <span class="Italic">See McMenamin</span>, Comp. Gen. Decision No. B-211,143 (May 16, 1983) (unpublished) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Cahill</span>, 58 Comp. Gen. at 61). The Comptroller General has also noted that "the cause of the delay is less important than when the delay occurs." <span class="Italic">See Mehutcs</span>, Comp. Gen. Decision No. B-261,592 (Nov. 13, 1995) (unpublished).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that none of the three arguments made by the Agency provide a basis for overturning the award.&#x2003;As to the first argument (obligation to pay not in question), the entire line of Comptroller General precedent regarding the administrative error rule refutes this assertion. In those circumstances falling under the administrative error rule, the Agency has already concluded that the personnel action is going to be accomplished, hence the obligation to effect the action (along with the obligation to pay the employee any additional sums concomitant therewith) is already established and is not in dispute, with an enforceable right to backpay and interest as a remedy for failure to do so. The precedent relied on by the Agency, <span class="Italic">Testan</span>, is not persuasive in this particular case given that it dealt with a classification challenge and interpreted the Back Pay Act prior to its amendment to cover "omission or failure to confer a benefit." Accordingly, the first argument provides no basis for overturning the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second argument (the obligation to pay must be nondiscretionary and by a specific date before a delay or omission can constitute an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act) is equally unpersuasive. Prong one of the administrative error rule, in contrast to prongs two and three, does not require the presence of a nondiscretionary law, rule, or regulation mandating action in accordance with specific criteria, or that action will be effected by a specific date. Prong one instead finds an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action where the agency fails to act (due to an administrative error) after the personnel action has been approved. The Agency's citation to <span class="Italic">Cahill</span> in support of its argument misstates the holding in that decision and fails to acknowledge Comptroller General precedent regarding prong one of the administrative error rule. As noted in <span class="Italic">Cahill</span>, the requirement that there be some law, rule or regulation, making action on or the timing of the personnel action nondiscretionary, becomes a factor only in the event that prong one of the administrative error rule was not applicable. Hence, the <span class="Italic">Cahill</span> holding addresses matters falling only under prongs two and three of the administrative error rule and fails to address (or modify) Comptroller General precedent finding the Back Pay Act applicable to a "ministerial" obligation to effect a personnel action where prong one of the administrative error rule has been satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency, in this second argument, also seems to be asserting that these personnel actions may not have been sufficiently "authorized" or "approved" to fall within prong one of the administrative error rule, although this assertion is not made with any degree of specificity. The Agency does not identify who it believes had the authority to approve or authorize these personnel actions and does not identify who (correctly or otherwise) approved or authorized these personnel actions. In this regard, the Agency cites no authority for its assertion other than <span class="Italic">Cahill</span>, where the Comptroller General found that an agency regional personnel office had the authority to approve the personnel action. Given this lack of specificity, we find that this argument to be an unsubstantiated assertion and reject it on that basis. Additionally, the Agency's concession that the error here "occurred between the [A]gency and its pay processing activity" lends credence to the conclusion that all necessary approvals had been made by Agency personnel and that it was subsequent to these approvals that a problem arose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third argument by the Agency (administrative error or delay is not, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action) and the legal authority in support of it also are not persuasive. As noted earlier, <span class="Italic">Testan</span> is of limited probative value here because of the narrow issue presented therein (a classification challenge) and because the decision was issued before the Back Pay Act was modified to expressly apply to "omission or failure to confer a benefit." The Agency also relies on <span class="Italic">Bell</span> for its assertion that its failure to pay "money due" is not a claim under the Back Pay Act and is analogous to non-Back Pay Act claims "for unpaid salary for time actually worked." That assertion misreads the court which, in finding that the matter was not subject to the Back Pay Act, expressly found that no unjustified or unwarranted personnel action was at issue before it. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 23 Cl. Ct. at 77.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument is also at odds with the already-noted Comptroller General precedent which clearly identifies situations where delay or error does constitute an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. In examining the Comptroller General decisions cited by the Agency, the Agency misreads the holding of those decisions and/or fails to take into account the breadth of situations referenced by the Comptroller General's precedent. The Comptroller General has recognized that under some circumstances, delay or error does constitute an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, even in the absence of explicitly or directly applicable nondiscretionary laws, rules or regulations (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the noted difference between prong one and prongs two and three of the administrative error rule). Other precedent cited is just not on point. There also is nothing in any legislative history referenced by the Agency that warrants modification to the conclusions already set forth above. Accordingly, these arguments provide no basis for overturning the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency asserts that the Back Pay Act is not an exclusive authority for paying money to its employees, and cites to <span class="Italic">Testan</span> in support of its belief that the settlement agreements are not automatically subject to the Back Pay Act. The Agency's argument misreads the nature of the Back Pay Act. As the Agency correctly notes, the Back Pay Act does not in and of itself confer any right to receive pay, allowances or differentials, but rather is "derivative" in nature in that it is the vehicle by which those other rights (to receive pay, allowance or differentials) are enforced. Other court precedent is in accord. <span class="Italic">See Sparrow v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</span>, 949 F.2d 434, 435 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (in reviewing settlement agreement waiving claims under Back Pay Act and other laws, court noted the "Back Pay Act does not itself give rise to an independent claim").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The import of this precedent, however, is only that an appropriate authority must first find a violation of some applicable law, rule, regulation or agreement provision before the Back Pay Act may be relied on to mandate payment: this precedent does not compel the conclusion that Arbitrator Lubic erred, as a matter of law, in finding that the payments under these settlement agreements were subject to the Back Pay Act. In that regard, the Authority itself has enforced settlement agreements providing for backpay by imposing liability under the Back Pay Act for breach of the settlement agreements, to include the payment of interest. <span class="Italic">See Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Distribution Region East, New Cumberland, Pennsylvania and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2004</span>, 50 FLRA 282, 283 (1995). Therefore, this argument provides an insufficient basis to overturn the award as being contrary to the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the application of <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392 (1976), to sovereign immunity arguments, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 67 FLRA 461, 464 (2014), noted:</p>

In <span class="Italic">Testan</span>, federal employees claimed that they should receive backpay as compensation for the alleged misclassification of their positions, but the Court found that the employees had no "substantive right...to backpay" under the Act "for the period of their claimed wrongful classifications." The Authority has previously held that <span class="Italic">Testan</span> is inapposite to backpay claims that are not based on alleged classification errors.[61]....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">(emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent">If there is no finding of an unjustified personnel action, there is no basis for an award of back pay, <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 1 and Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 67 FLRA 587, 590-91 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of backpay is authorized under the Act when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the employee's pay, allowances, or differentials.[37] A violation of a collective-bargaining agreement or a law, rule, or regulation constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Act.[38]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Arbitrator Pereles did not find that the Agency failed to comply with the Vaughn award; rather, he found that the parties were <span class="Italic">mutually</span> unable to implement that award. And the Union does not claim that the failure to implement the Vaughn award violated the parties' agreement or any law, rule, or regulation. Consequently, there is no basis for finding that the parties' joint failure to implement the Vaughn award--which resulted in the grievant's additional year on an informal detail--was an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. As the first requirement for awarding backpay is not satisfied, we find that Arbitrator Pereles's failure to award backpay is not contrary to the Act, and we deny this exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Budget Control Act of 2011[4] required Congress to pass a budget-reduction plan by November 2011; however, Congress was unable to pass a budget-reduction plan, triggering a process known as "sequestration," which required across-the-board cuts to the federal discretionary budget. In response to sequestration, the Agency implemented spending restrictions for FY 2013. With regard to its employee awards for FY 2013, the Agency proposed a process whereby employees would receive recognition for exceptional performance and contributions, but the Agency would hold in abeyance any monetary amount attached to those awards, pending the release of funding by Congress. Of the three unions who represent employees that would be affected by the Agency's decision to implement spending restrictions, two unions reached agreement with the Agency. The third union submitted this grievance, alleging that the Agency was violating the parties' agreement, Agency policy, regulation, and law when it suspended the employee-awards program for FY 2013.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Pub. L. 112-25 (Aug. 2, 2011).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator failed to find that the Agency violated a statutory provision or a provision of the parties' agreement. Without such a finding, the Agency contends that it is contrary to law and in violation of the doctrine of sovereign immunity for the Arbitrator to award backpay. The Agency argues, to the contrary, that the Arbitrator explicitly found that the Agency did not violate the parties' agreement, and remained silent on whether there was a statutory violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union, however, contends that the Arbitrator found that the Agency committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the reduction of the employees' pay, allowances, or differentials. Specifically, the Union cites to the portion of the award that states: "[I]t is the [A]rbitrator's decision that employees in the [b]argaining unit who were given outstanding performance appraisal[s] during FY 2013[,] and were eligible for [q]uality[-s]tep [i]ncreases and had not received for that period, be awarded them." Thus, the Union argues that the Arbitrator's award of backpay was consistent with the BPA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of backpay is authorized under the BPA only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or the reduction of an employee's pay, allowances, or differentials.[22] With respect to the first requirement, the necessary element of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action can be satisfied by a violation of applicable law,[23] a governing agency regulation,[24] or the parties' agreement.[25]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator quoted from Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum 13-11, and invoked OMB Memorandum 13-05, in the award's summary of the memoranda's references to quality-step increases. However, the Arbitrator did not reach a conclusion or make any finding that the quality-step increases at issue before her were themselves mandatory. The Arbitrator then found that: "the sequestration was not a normal set of circumstances and could not be ignored by the [Agency]." Next, the Arbitrator awarded backpay for "any quality[-]step increases not [already] granted," despite the Arbitrator's decision that "the Agency did not violate the [parties'] [a]greement when it suspended the [employee-]awards program because of the sequestration order."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Arbitrator specifically found that the Agency did not violate the parties' agreement and did not find that the Agency violated a law or a governing Agency regulation, the award does not include a finding that the Agency committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action as required by the BPA.[29] Therefore, the Arbitrator did not have any basis under the BPA to award backpay.[30] Further, the Arbitrator did not find, and the Union does not argue, that any law other than the BPA waives sovereign immunity in this case. Accordingly, we find the award contrary to law and grant the Agency's exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1987"></span>In this case, the Agency suspended the grievant for three days for misconduct. Although Arbitrator Jan Stiglitz found the misconduct undisputed and the suspension appropriate, he also found that the Agency delayed in taking disciplinary action, and sustained the grievance with regard to the grievant's financial penalty and awarded backpay. The Agency argues that the award is contrary to the Back Pay Act (BPA). Because we find that the Arbitrator's award of backpay is contrary to law, we vacate the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant is a "lead police officer" with supervisory obligations, holding the rank of Sergeant. On December 3, 2017, the grievant and multiple other junior officers conducted a traffic stop of two underage Marines entering United States Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. As the officers were conducting field sobriety tests, the situation escalated and resulted in the grievant and junior officers yelling and threatening the Marines. At some point thereafter, the incident came to the attention of a Captain who had reviewed a "'blotter' entry that raised questions." On March 28, 2018, based on the body camera footage of the incident, the Agency proposed that the grievant be suspended for fourteen&#8209;days for failing to carry out his duties by correcting the junior officers, unprofessional conduct, and unprofessional behavior.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The reviewing official found merit to the charges and sustained the misconduct.&#x2003;In determining the appropriate penalty, the reviewing official considered that the employee had a letter of reprimand for similar behavior just a few months prior to the incident at issue. The reviewing official determined a three-day suspension was appropriate. The Union grieved the suspension. Both the Step 1 and Step 2 grievance officials sustained the discipline and arbitration ensued.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At arbitration, the stipulated issues included: "[w]as the Agency's [three]-day suspension of [the grievant] consistent with the requirement[s] of the [parties' agreement]" and "[i]f not, what shall the remedy be?" The Arbitrator found that given the body camera footage of the incident, there was no real dispute that the grievant committed the misconduct. He stated that he could not fault the Agency for deciding a suspension was appropriate to correct the grievant's behavior when "counseling, followed shortly by a written warning, failed to work," and that it was not appropriate for him "to second guess the exact number of days chosen by the Agency when the choice is well within the range of discipline normally imposed for such an offense."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Arbitrator sustained the grievance "because of the Agency's unexcused delay and failure to interview the participants [to the incident]." He noted that delaying in taking disciplinary action risks memories fading, losing evidence or testimony, and that here, "the delay arguably undermines the Agency's arguments as to the severity of the misconduct." He ordered the Agency to make the grievant whole "to the extent of any financial consequence of the [three]-day suspension" and, if no similar misconduct occurred within a year, to expunge the discipline from the grievant's record and to not use the suspension as prior discipline for any similar charges.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to the BPA.&#x2003;Specifically, the Agency contends that the Arbitrator has no legal basis to make the grievant whole because the Arbitrator upheld the suspension and determined that the Agency's action was "warranted and justified."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that a grievant may be entitled to compensation under the BPA when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials.[11] A violation of an applicable law, rule, regulation, or provision of a collective-bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the first prong.[12] The second prong is only met where there is a <span class="Italic">causal connection</span> between--as relevant here--a violation of the parties' agreement and a withdrawal or reduction in pay, allowances, or differentials.[13] In other words, backpay is only authorized if the arbitrator has found that but for the unwarranted action, the loss of pay, allowances, or differentials would not have occurred.[14]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator cited Article 10, Section 1 of the parties' agreement in his award, which provides, in part, that disciplinary actions will be timely. Because he was "troubled" by the Agency's "unexcused delay" in taking disciplinary action against the grievant, the Arbitrator sustained the grievance "with regard to the financial penalty imposed." Although the Arbitrator did not explicitly find that the Agency violated Article 10, Section 1, the issue in this case was whether the Agency violated the parties' agreement and the Arbitrator sustained the grievance, at least in part, because he found some wrongdoing on the Agency's part with regard to Article 10, Section 1's requirement that disciplinary actions be timely. Read in context, the Arbitrator's findings indicate he found a contractual violation. Thus, the award arguably satisfies the BPA's first requirement of a contractual violation constituting an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">However, the award fails to satisfy the BPA's second requirement. Here, the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency's failure to take timely disciplinary action resulted in the grievant's loss of pay, or that but for the Agency's "unexcused delay" in taking disciplinary action, the grievant would not have been suspended. Rather, the Arbitrator's findings demonstrate that the grievant's misconduct led to his suspension and loss of pay. Furthermore, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's misconduct was undisputed, that a suspension was an appropriate penalty, and that the duration of the suspension was "well within the range of discipline normally imposed for such an offense." Because of this, he "sustain[ed] the grievance [only] to the extent that [the grievant] has suffered a financial penalty," and directed the Agency to make the grievant "whole to the extent of any financial consequence of the [three]-day suspension."[23] The Arbitrator, in effect, upheld the suspension itself.[24] Therefore, because it was the suspension that caused the grievant's loss of pay, and not the Agency's failure to take timely disciplinary action, and the Arbitrator never rescinded that suspension, the award does not support finding a causal connection between the contract violation and loss of pay.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the award of backpay is deficient as contrary to the BPA.[25] Because we set aside the Arbitrator's award as contrary to law,[26] we do not address the Agency's remaining exception.</p>

<p class="noindent">It is significant that a violation of a statute or contract provision alone does not furnish the basis for back pay. There must be a logical demonstration in the award between the violation and the amount of the back pay awarded, that is, there must be a demonstrable causal connection between the violation and the loss sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Oakdale and AFGE Local 3957</span>, 59 FLRA 277, 278-79 (2003) (setting aside portion of award that contract provision was violated as to reassignment of employee when award did not demonstrate that grievant would have suffered loss of monetary benefit ordered by arbitrator absent the contract violation). If there is no violation of a contract, and if, as a result, there is no unwarranted personnel action, there is no back pay entitlement. That the parties give the arbitrator the authority to determine the remedy does not expand the remedial authority beyond the limitations of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 2343</span>, 60 FLRA 728, 730 (2005). The arbitrator may limit a finding to an entitlement to back pay, leaving the parties to sort out what is owed or litigate the matter through compliance proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA,</span> 63 FLRA 502, 504 (2009); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 68 FLRA 157, 164 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting) ("Third, the Agency argues that the backpay award is deficient because the Arbitrator did not expressly reconcile certain testimony that the Agency identifies in its exceptions.

Thus, we reject this argument as a basis for finding the award contrary to law.")

<p class="noindent">If an unjustified personnel action occurs, and if a back pay remedy is required by law, exceptions will be sustained to an award that does not provide the required remedy, as in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 164 and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 67 FLRA 336, 338 (2014), involving overtime claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of backpay is authorized under the BPA when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or the reduction of the employee's pay, allowances, or differentials.[31]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[31]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, U.S. Penitentiary, Atwater, Cal</span>., 66 FLRA 737, 739 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that where an arbitrator's findings support an award of backpay under the BPA, the arbitrator's failure to award backpay is contrary to the BPA.[32] While the Authority has held that nothing in the BPA requires a monetary award for every unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, that holding is applicable only to situations where an arbitrator has found that the requirements of the BPA were not fully met.[33]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NTEU I</span>, 66 FLRA at 1026.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator considered the requirements of the BPA and found that those requirements were met. Specifically, he found that the Agency's failure to provide the grievant overtime consistent with Section F.(10) of the Handbook, was "[an] unjustified personnel action" that "resulted in a reduction of the [g]rievant's pay." Thus, the Authority precedent discussed above supports a conclusion that the Arbitrator erred by not ordering backpay for the grievant.[37]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NTEU I</span>, 66 FLRA at 1026; <span class="Italic">see also, Bremerton</span>, 62 FLRA at 7-8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that, under &#x00A7; 5596(b)(4) of the BPA, "the scope of any monetary remedy available under the [BPA] is limited to the remedy authorized under the [RNIAP]," which the Agency states is the "provision of the next overtime opportunity." However, the Authority has found that &#x00A7; 5596(b)(4)'s purpose is to establish an outermost time limit on backpay awards, while allowing for a shorter limitations period where "authorized by the applicable law, rule, regulations, or...agreement under which the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" was found.[39] In other words, &#x00A7; 5596(b)(4) merely places time limits on recovery under the Act. As time limits on recovery were not an issue in this case, the Agency's reliance on &#x00A7; 5596(b)(4) is misplaced.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the award is contrary to the BPA. Accordingly, we modify the award and direct the Agency, consistent with the BPA, to make the grievant whole for the overtime pay he lost as the result of the Agency's violation of its rules and regulations.[40]</p>
