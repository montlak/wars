<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-363"><span class="space">a.</span> Application of Remedy</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot and Lewis</span>, 38 FLRA 647, 649-50 (1990), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot and Lewis</span>, 39 FLRA 1472 (1991), directed an SQA remedy when a RIF was conducted without impact bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the record establishes that the Respondent failed to notify the Union as to when the reorganization and RIF would occur or when the RIF notices would be issued to bargaining unit employees, despite the Union's written requests to the Respondent to provide the Union advance notice of such changes in employees' conditions of employment. Further, it is clear that the Union requested that the Respondent bargain over the impact and implementation of the reorganization and RIF. In addition, as the Respondent's failure to discharge its bargaining obligation under the Statute was intentional, although based on an erroneous conclusion that it was not obligated to bargain over the subject matter, we find that the Respondent's refusal to bargain was willful....&#8197;As to the impact of the reorganization and RIF on bargaining unit employees, the record supports a finding that the impact was considerable. Significantly, the reorganization resulted in the relocation of the work site for many of the bargaining unit employees. Additionally, as a result of the reorganization, employees were assigned additional duties and responsibilities which were outside their assigned trade. Such changes had a considerable impact on the working conditions of these employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Respondent has not supported its assertion that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy would disrupt its operations with specific allegations or evidence concerning how, and to what degree, such disruption would occur. Inasmuch as the Authority bases a finding as to the appropriateness of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy on specific evidence in the record indicating the disruption that will be caused by such a remedy, the Respondent's assertions that the...remedy would create "personnel turbulence" and "an administrative mess" provide an insufficient basis for finding that such a remedy would disrupt or impair the efficiency and effectiveness of the Respondent's operations....&#8197;Insofar as the Respondent appears to be arguing that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy would require that the Commercial Activity study process be redone or the contracts rebid, the argument is <span id="page_1638"></span>unavailing. The remedy requires only a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> before the reorganization and RIF, events that occurred well after the awarding of the contract. The decision to reorganize is not at issue here. We see nothing in the requirement that the Respondent reinstate the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> and bargain before implementing that decision that would create undue disruption to its operations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another RIF was ordered undone when an agency failed to bargain with a union its impact, <span class="Italic">DOD, DCA, Peterson AFB and AFGE Local 1867</span>, 61 FLRA 688, 694-95 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an agency has failed to bargain over the impact and implementation of a management decision, the Authority evaluates the appropriateness of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy using the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">FCI, </span>8 FLRA 604; <span class="Italic">Army Corps, Memphis,</span> 53 FLRA at 84 &#x0026; n.4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appropriateness of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy must be determined on a case-by-case basis, carefully balancing the nature and circumstances of the particular violation against the degree of disruption in government operations that would be caused by such a remedy. <span class="Italic">Willow Grove</span>, 57 FLRA at 857; <span class="Italic">FCI</span>, 8 FLRA at 606. In making this determination the Authority relies upon application of the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors. <span class="Italic">See</span> footnote 2, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the first factor, the Judge determined that the Respondent provided adequate notice to the Union of its proposed changes. For the reasons expressed previously, we agree with the Judge. With respect to the second factor, the record reveals that the Union made timely demands to negotiate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the third factor, the Judge found that the Respondent willfully failed to discharge its bargaining obligation. The record reveals that the Union requested three specific times to bargain over the Respondent's changes. Despite these requests, the Respondent implemented these changes without bargaining. Under these circumstances, knowing that these bargaining requests were outstanding, the Respondent's failure to engage in bargaining with the Union and implement was willful. Additionally, factor four weighs in favor of finding this remedy appropriate as the nature and the impact on the bargaining unit is substantial.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the last factor, the Respondent claims that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy would seriously "disrupt the accomplishment of the Agency's mission and the efficiency of its operations[.]" In this regard, it is well established that in rendering a decision on this factor, the Authority requires a respondent's argument to be "based on record evidence."<span class="Italic"> Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Waco Distribution Center, Waco, Tex.</span>, 53 FLRA 749, 763 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In agreement with the Judge we find that the Respondent has offered no evidence as to how a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy would disrupt or impact the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations.[7] While the evidence indicates that the RIF was the result of budget considerations, this alone does not explain how a <span class="Italic">status quo </span>remedy would disrupt or impact the efficiency and effectiveness of the Respondent's operations. In this respect, the Respondent has provided us with the rationale behind its original decision to conduct a RIF but has not shown the Authority why, given its failure to negotiate over impact and implementation of the RIF, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy is not appropriate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Blue Grass Army Depot</span>, 38 FLRA at 649-50. Accordingly, based on weighing the<span class="Italic"> FCI</span> factors and noting that four of the five factors support finding that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is appropriate, we deny the Respondent's exception and affirm the Judge's decision consistent with this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Respondent makes several arguments concerning the potential impact of granting a <span class="Italic">status quo</span> remedy. However, we agree with the GC that these arguments do not constitute "record evidence" of how a <span class="Italic">status quo</span> remedy would disrupt the Agency's mission and the efficiency of its operations as it was not presented at the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">That management has a right to implement a change that adversely affects employees does not provide a basis for denying an SQA remedy. <span class="Italic">DHS, Customs &#x0026; Border Security and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 65 FLRA 88 (2010) (citing <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, WAPA and AFGE Local 3824</span>, 56 FLRA 9, 13 (2000)). <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Eng'rs, Memphis Dist. and NFFE Local 259</span>, 53 FLRA 79, 86 (1997), directed a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> order to restore a cook's position when agency failed to timely notify the union of its intent to eliminate the job. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Kirtland AFB and AFGE Local 2263,</span> 64 FLRA 166, 177 (2009) (see remedial order), imposed a <span class="Italic">status quo</span> remedy requiring an individual to be moved to his original office location prior to a reorganization when the agency failed to negotiate impact of the office move upon that employee. An SQA remedy is permissible, but not required, to remedy a failure to bargain over impact and implementation. If a change was made, then terminated, FLRA may decide that a return to old ways would be meaningless and instead order the agency to cease and desist from changing conditions of employment without satisfying its bargaining obligations; at the request of the union, FLRA may concurrently order that the agency bargain over appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the change. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU Chap. 133</span>, 38 FLRA 770, 799, 801 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the bargaining failure is limited to impact, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> equation weighs possible disruption to agency operations more heavily. Under <span class="Italic">FCI and AFGE Local 2052</span>, 8 FLRA 604, 606 (1982), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the disruption to agency operations that must exist to block a <span class="Italic">status quo</span> order should be demonstrated through a specific showing of how, and to what degree, a disruption would occur. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 35 FLRA 940, 951-53 (1990) (ordering SQA remedy for failure to bargain impact of pilot program even though program was allegedly already enhancing efficiency of agency operations); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 44 FLRA 1065, 1075 (1992) (an impact bargaining case applying <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors to failure to negotiate effects of changes in agency firearms policy).</p>
<p class="noindent">An example of a factor analysis of the propriety of a <span class="Italic">status quo</span> remedy in a case involving failure to bargain over impact is <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, WAPA and AFGE Local 3824</span>, 56 FLRA 9, 13 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an agency has failed to bargain over the impact and implementation of a management decision, the Authority evaluates the appropriateness of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy using the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">FCI</span>, 8 FLRA at 606. In this connection, the Authority considers: (1) whether, and when, an agency notified the union concerning the change; (2) whether, and when, the union requested bargaining over procedures for implementing the change and/or appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the change; (3) the willfulness of the respondent's conduct in failing to bargain; (4) the nature and extent of the impact upon adversely affected employees; and (5) whether, and to what extent, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy would disrupt the respondent's operations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the first <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factor, the Judge found, on the basis of undisputed evidence, that the Respondent did not provide the Union with prior notice of the two reassignments. Although the Respondent contends that it had previously notified the Union that the two employees were surplus and likely to be reassigned, the Respondent does not dispute that it failed to notify the Union when it eventually issued the two reassignments and, as a result, the first <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factor supports a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy in this case. As the Respondent does not dispute the Judge's finding that the Union promptly requested bargaining, the second <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factor also supports a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the third <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factor, the Judge based his finding that the Respondent's failure to bargain was willful on the undisputed fact that the Respondent denied the Union's request to bargain. Although the Respondent asserts that it refused to bargain because it believed that the subject matter was "covered by" the parties' agreement, the Authority has held that, if a respondent's actions are otherwise intentional, then the respondent's erroneous belief that it had no duty to bargain does not support a conclusion that the respondent's actions were not "willful" for the purposes of <span class="Italic">FCI. See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Lexington-Blue Grass</span> <span class="Italic">Army Dept, Lexington, Kentucky, </span>38 FLRA 647, 649 (1990). As there is no assertion that the Respondent's actions were unintentional, the third <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factor also supports a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found, with regard to the fourth <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factor, that the effects on the two employees were "immediate and severe." Rather than challenge the Judge's findings in this regard, which support a conclusion that the two employees suffered adverse effects as a result of the reassignments, the Respondent contends that those adverse effects do not support a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy, because the employees would nonetheless suffer those effects if management ultimately exercises its right to reassign those two employees. Based on Authority precedent, we reject the Respondent's contention. In this connection, the Authority has held that the fact that management has the right to implement a change that adversely affects employees does not provide a basis for denying a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Health and</span> <span class="Italic">Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland, </span>36 FLRA 655, 673 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the fifth <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factor, a conclusion that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy would be disruptive to agency operations must be "based on record evidence[.]" <span class="Italic">Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Waco</span> <span class="Italic">Distribution Center, Waco, Texas, </span>53 FLRA 749, 763 (1997). The Respondent concedes that it cannot accurately anticipate the degree of disruption the reinstatements would have on the efficiency of its operations. The Judge, relying on the testimony of the Respondent's communications manager, found that it would not increase the Respondent's costs to return one of the employees to his previous position, because that employee will continue to receive the same salary and benefits without regard to which position he encumbers. In addition, the Judge relied on witness testimony to find that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy would increase the Respondent's overhead by a maximum of 2 percent, and that there was existing work for the two employees to perform in their previous positions. Given this evidence, on the one hand, and the speculative nature of the Respondent's assertions, on the other hand, a preponderance of the record evidence supports the Judge's conclusion that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy would not disrupt the Agency's operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Judge properly ordered a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy, and we deny the Respondent's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1639"></span>Prior to its 1990 revisions in theory concerning the interrelationship of <span class="Italic">status quo</span> remedies and retroactive bargaining orders, the Authority would consider, in the case of a failure to allow impact bargaining over a change in performance standards, that the parties may themselves agree to make certain provisions retroactive, and that if there is an impasse, the FSIP could properly consider a proposal for retroactive application and impose that requirement. FLRA noted that it has directed an SQA remedy in cases involving proposals previously held by FLRA to be within the duty to bargain or involving refusals to implement the specific terms of unexcepted interest arbitration awards, rather than in cases not involving specific proposals. <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE</span>, 21 FLRA 786, 790 (1986), <span class="Italic">on remand for reconsideration from</span> <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 16 FLRA 602 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">An SQA remedy was appropriate when management unilaterally changed the starting and quitting time of a previously established shift<span class="Italic">. IRS Los Angeles Dist. and NTEU</span>, 10 FLRA 653, 655 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 16 FLRA 674 (1984) ("While we agree with the Chief Judge that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is warranted, we do not rely upon his application of the criteria in Federal Correctional Institution, 8 FLRA 604 (1982), to reach such result. Consideration of the Federal Correctional Institution criteria is applicable in cases where a Respondent was found to have failed to negotiate impact and implementation of a decision which was itself not negotiable. In this case, by contrast, we conclude that the decision to change the start time of employees in the San Jose District Office was negotiable inasmuch as the record fails to establish that the change effectuated by the Respondent was determinative of the numbers, types or grades of employees or positions assigned to a work project or tour of duty within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, D.C., and its Chicago Airways Facility Sector</span>, 16 FLRA No. 71 (1984), and cases cited in note 3. In view of the Respondent's failure to fulfill its bargaining obligation concerning the decision to change the start times of unit employees, the Authority finds that an order directing the restoration of the previous existing start time will effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The SQA remedy was imposed for unlawful alteration of a dress and grooming code. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Weapons Station, Concord and AFGE Local 1931</span>, 33 FLRA 770, 809-10 (1988) (ALJ Decision). An SQA remedy was directed when the agency improperly failed to bargain over the decision to change starting and quitting times of previously existing shifts. There was no demonstration by the agency that public safety would be compromised. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and PASS</span>, 19 FLRA 732, 736 (1985). A <span class="Italic">status quo</span> remedy was also imposed to correct an unlawful unilateral imposition of a smoking policy that should have been negotiated. <span class="Italic">DHHS, Pub.

<p class="noindent">The SQA remedy was appropriate to redress a failure to bargain over a change in the type of safety clothing to be worn by employees. <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard and FEMTC</span>, 17 FLRA 511 (1985). The unilateral change by the agency of the practice of permitting new officers to be issued blackjacks was remedied through restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>.

Failure to negotiate the impact of a change in weapons policy resulted in an SQA order.

Aspects of an office relocation were reversed through an SQA remedy in <span class="Italic">PBGC and NAGE Local R3-77</span>, 59 FLRA 48 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">An SQA remedy is warranted as to a change in the duties of an employee if the imposition of the remedy would not create a serious disruption of agency operations. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Field Assessment Office and AFGE</span>, 11 FLRA 419, 429 (1983) (ALJ Decision). An SQA remedy requires rescission of improper employee evaluations if it does not create hardship for the agency or disrupt its operations. <span class="Italic">San Antonio Air Logistics Ctr., Kelly AFB and AFGE Local 1617</span>, 5 FLRA 173, 174 (1981). An SQA remedy is appropriate for a failure to bargain with proper notice over appropriate arrangements for a change in working conditions, including safety conditions; there was no evidence that the remedy would cause a severe disruption in agency operations. <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth and Tidewater, Va. FEMTC</span>, 6 FLRA 74, 76-77 (1981).

An SQA remedy was warranted for a management decision to discontinue training, even though the decision was nonnegotiable. Employees were adversely affected. They were put into a competitively poor position for new career paths. Management was not adversely affected. The training program was still being continued for some employees. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 10 FLRA 326, 328-29 (1982) (ALJ Decision).
