<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-356"><span class="space">b.</span> Department of Veterans Affairs</h5>
<p class="noindent">There are unusual facets of cases involving VA bargaining rights and unfair labor practices. FLRA decided in <span class="Italic">VA, Washington and AFGE Local 2610</span>, 34 FLRA 260 (1990), that VA did not commit a ULP by failing to provide advance notice to the union of changes in qualification standards for DM&#x0026;S employees. FLRA relied on <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 851 F.2d 1486 (D.C. Cir. 1988), deciding that the VA is not obligated to bargain over the conditions of employment of Title 38 professional employees of the Department of Medicine and Surgery (now the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration). The VA Administrator had "unfettered discretion to issue regulations concerning the working conditions of DM&#x0026;S employees," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1492. The VA "had no obligation to bargain over the impact and implementation of changes in the conditions of employment of those employees." 34 FLRA at 263.</p>
<p class="noindent">Adding complexity, the Eighth Circuit determined in as extensive an opinion as is found on this topic, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3884 v. FLRA</span>, 930 F.2d 1315, 1317-29 (8th Cir. 1991), <span class="Italic">rev'g</span> <span class="Italic">VA, Washington and AFGE</span>, 34 FLRA 182 (1990), that: VA did not have to negotiate a new agreement with the union, but that VA did have to honor an agreement that it had negotiated with the union before the controversy arose concerning the exemption of professional personnel from the labor relations provisions of the Reform Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he FLRA concluded it lacked jurisdiction to consider the union's contentions. The Authority reasoned that because the nurses were classified as medical professionals under Title 38, the VA was under no duty to bargain with them under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. The Authority further concluded that while the VA and the nurses' union could voluntarily enter into an agreement regarding the nurses' working conditions, any such agreement was not enforceable by the Authority. The FLRA's position stems from the agency's interpretation of a recent District of Columbia Circuit Court decision, <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association v. FLRA</span>, 851 F.2d 1486 (D.C. Cir. 1988), which interpreted 38 USC 4108 as granting the VA exclusive authority over the working conditions of medical professionals in VA hospitals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union argues on appeal that the FLRA has misconstrued the <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span> decision, which did not involve enforcement of an existing collective bargaining agreement. The union further contends that the <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span> decision conflicts with this Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Minneapolis v. FLRA</span>, 705 F.2d 953 (8th Cir. 1983). The union maintains VA officials have a duty to abide by the collective bargaining agreement currently in effect and must bargain with professional nurses over proposed changes in their working conditions under the Civil Service Reform Act unless those proposals are inconsistent with specific provisions of Title 38 or specific regulations adopted by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The union urges this Court to reverse both FLRA decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span> court that the VA has no mandatory duty under the Civil Service Reform Act to bargain with nurses over working conditions, because Title 38 grants the Secretary the authority to prescribe the working conditions of medical professionals employed by the VA. Accordingly, we affirm the FLRA's dismissal of the union's negotiability appeals. We reverse the FLRA's dismissal of the union's unfair labor practice petition, however, because we find the collective bargaining agreement the VA voluntarily entered into with the union is enforceable under the Civil Service Reform Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consideration of the issues presented in these cases requires an understanding of two statutory schemes: chapter 73 of Title 38, 38 USC 4101-4119, which governs the activities of the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration, formerly the Department of Medicine and Surgery within the Veterans Administration, and chapter 71 of Title 5, 5 USC 7101-7135, which governs collective bargaining rights for federal employees generally.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Title 38 and the Department of Medicine and Surgery</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Department of Medicine and Surgery (DM&#x0026;S) was created in 1946 to provide "a complete medical and hospital service...for the medical care and treatment of veterans."...&#8197;The Department, now the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration, operates the largest single medical care delivery system in the United States....&#8197;When the DM&#x0026;S was first created, there was no union activity on the part of any federal employees, who were hired, fired, and promoted under the civil service system established by Title 5....&#8197;Concerned that the VA had been unable to attract qualified medical professionals under the civil service system's regulations and rates of pay, Congress enacted provisions specifically relating to the hiring, promotion, pay, hours and conditions of employment, retirement, and discipline of health care professionals employed by the DM&#x0026;S....&#8197;The nurses represented by petitioner are among the health care professionals covered by Title 38 provisions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From the time of enactment in 1946, section 4108(a) of the DM&#x0026;S statute had provided that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Notwithstanding any law, Executive order, or regulation, the Administrator [now the Secretary of Veterans Affairs] shall prescribe by regulation the hours and conditions of employment and leaves of absence of doctors, dentists, and nurses....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Collective Bargaining by Title 38 Professionals</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record in this case does not reveal when negotiations first began between VA officials and unions representing Title 38 employees.&#x2003;Collective bargaining rights for federal workers generally were first recognized in 1969 under Executive Order No. 11,491....&#8197;The Order required federal agencies to bargain with a properly certified union over "personnel policies and practices and matters affecting working conditions, so far as may be appropriate under applicable laws and regulations."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1974, officials of the Fargo VA Medical Center entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the North Dakota State Nurses' Association, then the exclusive representative of the nurses now represented by petitioner herein. This agreement was amended on December 30, 1976, to provide in article XII as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Vacancies in the positions of head nurse, supervisor, specialty positions and newly created positions will be filled from among the best qualified and available nurses. The Center agrees that such selection will not be based solely on educational achievement, and will take every means to insure that the principles of equal opportunity are strictly adhered to.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fargo VA officials thus had already engaged in collective bargaining with professional nurses when Congress enacted the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.&#x2003;Codified as the Labor-Management Relations chapter of Title 5, the purpose of the Act was "to lay the foundation for open and mutually beneficial labor-management relations throughout the federal sector." <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota v. FLRA</span>, 705 F.2d 953, 957 (8th Cir. 1983)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 28, 1980, the Federal Labor Relations Authority certified the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, as the exclusive representative of a national consolidated bargaining unit consisting of certain VA professional employees, including nurses. In April 1980, the VA entered into an interim collective bargaining agreement with the union. Because no Master Agreement has ever been reached between the VA and the union, this Interim Agreement remains in effect and provides in article 4 that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The terms of any local agreement which was in effect at the time of the consolidated unit certification shall remain in effect until final approval of the Master Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The same year the VA reached an interim agreement with the American Federation of Government Employees, Congress amended the DM&#x0026;S statute in an effort to enhance the VA's ability "to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of capable, qualified health-care professionals and personnel."...&#8197;With regard to nurses, the 1980 amendments authorized a pilot program and study to evaluate the impact of various administrative actions on the VA's ability to recruit and retain qualified nurses, <span id="page_1618"></span>amended Title 38 provisions relating to premium pay, and provided the VA Administrator with authority to modify rates of pay as necessary on a local, regional, or nationwide basis to meet rates paid by private hospitals....&#8197;Although the Senate bill contained express language requiring the Administrator to consult with the exclusive representative of any employees "as is required under any collective bargaining agreement" prior to implementing several of these provisions, the bill enacted by the Congress excluded this language. The Explanatory Statement of the Compromise Agreement indicated the reason for the deletion was to avoid confusion. The Statement explains:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It was the Senate's intention, as expressed in the Senate Committee report, in including the consultation provisions to assure that nothing in the bill would be construed as negating recognized collective bargaining rights, including consultation rights. Those provisions are not included in the compromise bill in recognition of the Committees' agreement that such a specific reference to such rights is unnecessary and could engender confusion. In deleting those provisions, the Committees wish to make clear that they do not intend that any of the changes made by the legislation to the VA's health-care personnel authorities detract in any way from employee rights under existing collective bargaining agreements between the VA and its employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other sections of the 1980 amendments spoke directly to the relationship between Title 38 and Title 5 civil service system provisions....&#8197;Section 116 added a new section 4119 to Title 38, which states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no provision of title 5 or of any other law pertaining to the civil service system which is inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter shall be considered to supersede, override, or otherwise modify such provision of this subchapter except to the extent that such provision of title 5 or of such other law specifically provides, by specific reference to a provision of this subchapter, for such provision to be superseded, overridden, or otherwise modified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Explanatory Statement reveals only that in reaching a compromise, committee members agreed to</p>
<p class="noindent-2">an amendment to clarify that the general relationship between title 38 medical personnel system provisions in subchapter I of chapter 73 of title 38 and provisions in title 5 or elsewhere pertaining to the civil service personnel system is such that no provisions from title 5 or elsewhere (whether heretofore or hereafter enacted) shall be considered to supersede, override, or otherwise modify title 38 provisions unless such other provision does so expressly by specific reference to the title 38 provision....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Shortly after enactment of the 1980 DM&#x0026;S amendments, this Court was called upon to resolve the interplay between Title 5 and Title 38 provisions. In <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota v. FLRA</span>, 705 F.2d 953 (8th Cir. 1983), the VA appealed from an order of the Federal Labor Relations Authority requiring the VA to bargain with the American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3669, over certain proposals presented by the union regarding disciplinary actions. The FLRA held the proposals were negotiable because they provided for alternative dispute resolution procedures as permitted by section 7121 of the Civil Service Reform Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7121(e)(1). The VA did not dispute the proposition that DM&#x0026;S professionals were generally covered by the Civil Service Reform Act, but maintained that section 4110 of the DM&#x0026;S statute provided the exclusive means for disciplining DM&#x0026;S professionals....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In analyzing the VA's position, the <span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span> court reviewed the legislative history and purpose of the 1946 DM&#x0026;S statute and the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act. The court indicated that "[i]n the absence of further guidance from Congress, we would resolve the conflict between these two statutes in favor of the duty to bargain over alternative grievance and arbitration procedures mandated in 5 USC 7121(e)(1)," based on language in the legislative history of section 7121 which specifically referred to providing an option for employees under the Title 38 personnel system....&#8197;Turning to the 1980 amendments to the DM&#x0026;S statute, however, the court concluded that the express language used by Congress in the new section 4119 required the court to "resolve any conflict between section 4110 and the duty to bargain under section 7121 of the Civil Service Reform Act in favor of the continued applicability of the Veterans Administration law."...&#8197;<span class="Italic">In dicta</span>, the court noted that section 4110 did not create procedures for the resolution of disputes over other personnel decisions common to all employment situations, such as vacation assignments or working conditions, and indicated that its decision did not preclude union proposals to resolve disputes over such matters....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The VA's obligation to negotiate with DM&#x0026;S professionals over non-disciplinary grievance procedures and conditions of employment was squarely presented in <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association v. FLRA</span>, 851 F.2d 1486 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The Colorado Nurses Association had begun the process of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with VA Medical Center officials in Fort Lyons, Colorado. The union had made proposals concerning work schedules and a grievance procedure for disputes regarding conditions of employment unrelated to disciplinary actions. The VA refused to bargain over any of the proposals, claiming that section 4108 of the DM&#x0026;S statute gave the VA Administrator the exclusive authority to determine working conditions. The FLRA rejected this argument, but found that two of the union's proposals were nonnegotiable because they would infringe upon rights specifically reserved to management under the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 USC 7106....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The D.C. Circuit reversed the FLRA, holding that section 4108(a) of the DM&#x0026;S statute requiring the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to prescribe by regulation the hours and conditions of employment of DM&#x0026;S professionals granted exclusive authority to the Administrator to determine the working conditions of DM&#x0026;S professionals. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1492. The <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span> court began its analysis by viewing section 4108(a) of the DM&#x0026;S statute as an integral part of an independent DM&#x0026;S personnel system Congress created in 1946....&#8197;Rejecting the notion that the Civil Service Reform Act impliedly overrode provisions of the DM&#x0026;S statute, the court concluded that provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act "can be just as intrusive as standards imposed by civil service laws."...&#8197;Finally, the court held that even assuming the Civil Service Reform Act applied to DM&#x0026;S professionals in 1978, Congress' passage of section 4119 in 1980 reaffirmed the preeminence of the DM&#x0026;S statute with regard to DM&#x0026;S professional personnel....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court reconciled its holding with portions of the 1980 legislative history which refer to the need to respect DM&#x0026;S employees' rights under existing collective bargaining agreements by noting that the VA Administrator could voluntarily agree to recognize and negotiate with a union over terms and conditions of employment. According to the court, the Explanatory Statement accompanying the 1980 legislation "may therefore reasonably be read as an indication that Congress did not wish to upset the settled expectations of those VA employees working 'under <span class="Italic">existing</span> collective bargaining agreements.'"...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With this legal background in mind, we turn to the facts which gave rise to the appeals now before this Court. Shortly after the 1980 amendments to the DM&#x0026;S statute, Fargo VA officials recognized Local 3884 as the exclusive bargaining representative for nurses employed at the Fargo Medical Center. In 1981, these registered nurses were included as part of the national consolidated unit represented by the American Federation of Government Employees and became parties to the Interim Agreement reached between the union and the VA in Washington. Pursuant to the Interim Agreement, Fargo officials continued the practices which had been developed under the local agreement which had previously been reached between the agency and Local 3884's predecessor, the North Dakota State Nurses' Association.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One of these past practices involved supplying the union, upon its request, with information on newly hired nurses to allow the union to evaluate whether any nurses had been hired contrary to the provisions of article XII of the collective bargaining agreement. In 1984, union president...Worth requested and received 80 to 90 VA forms, which Worth and union vice president Deb Cederholm reviewed to determine whether the VA had been complying with article XII by selecting the best qualified candidates. Worth requested similar information in 1987, using a form which had been agreed to by the parties in settlement of a prior FLRA case. Worth made the request after a union member had failed to receive a requested transfer to an operating room "specialty position" and after Worth had received additional information to suggest that the VA had not been complying with article XII. The VA refused Worth's 1987 request for information on privacy grounds, and the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Federal Labor Relations Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In answer to the union's petition, the VA admitted that the union was a labor organization within the meaning of 5 USC 7103(a)(4), that the VA was an agency within the meaning of 5 USC 7103(a)(3), and that the union and the VA were parties to an Interim Agreement covering registered nurses employed by the Fargo VA. At the hearing conducted before the Administrative Law Judge, Personnel Officer Ray Johnson affirmed that the Interim Agreement was in effect between the VA and the union and that the VA continued to respect article XII of the prior Nurses' Association agreement as a past practice under the Interim Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the hearing, but prior to the ALJ's issuance of his decision, the D.C. Circuit's <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span> opinion was issued. In a "DM&#x0026;S Hotline Statement," the VA in Washington advised local and regional VA officials that it was studying the decision and would be establishing an agency position on implementation. The statement further advised that "[i]n the meantime, all facilities should continue the present posture of maintaining <span class="Italic">status quo</span> in dealings with union officials representing Title 38 employees until further VACO directive."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1619"></span>Fargo VA officials supplied the <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span> decision to the ALJ by letter. After studying the decision and the facts presented to him, the ALJ concluded the decision did not preclude the union from filing grievances concerning the interpretation of language in a collective bargaining agreement the VA had previously agreed to. On the merits, the ALJ found the union had a right to obtain the information it had requested, the limited disclosure of which would not violate any Privacy Act provision. The VA filed exceptions to the ALJ's decision with the FLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA considered the case, along with two negotiability appeals which were submitted by the union. The negotiability appeals pertained to proposals made by the union in response to notices the union received regarding proposed changes in the working conditions of professional nurses. The first notice was received in October, 1987, when Personnel Officer Ray Johnson gave the union notice of a proposed change in reporting requirements for nurses who observe incidents which result in harm or which have the potential for causing harm to the patients or staff. The union responded with a request for bargaining over the proposed change. Thereafter, the VA revised its proposal, and the revised procedures were again forwarded to the union. The union again requested that the VA bargain over the proposed change and forwarded written proposals to the VA for consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before receiving a formal response to its demand for bargaining, the union received notice in March, 1989, of another proposed change regarding nursing documentation. The proposed change required each patient to receive, at a minimum, one daily observation nursing progress note. The union requested a short bargaining session, and proposed that the VA more specifically assign responsibility for the daily observation note.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The VA responded to both demands for bargaining in April, 1989, by indicating that the union's proposals "conflict with the management rights of the Agency and with Agency regulations and are, therefore, nonnegotiable." The union challenged the VA's refusal to bargain by submitting negotiability appeals to the FLRA. The FLRA dismissed both the negotiability appeals and the unfair labor practice petition in January, 1990. The Authority concluded, based on its interpretation of section 4108(a) of the DM&#x0026;S statute, that the VA had no obligation toward members of the nurses' union which could be enforced by the FLRA under the Civil Service Reform Act, even in situations where the VA had agreed to be bound by a collective bargaining agreement. The FLRA reasoned that any collective bargaining agreement was not a "collective bargaining agreement" under the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 USC 7103(a)(8), and that "the decision of the Administrator, pursuant to his discretion under [the DM&#x0026;S statute], to comply with the parties' interim agreement...does not subject the Administrator to the [Civil Service Reform Act] statute's mechanisms for enforcing the parties' rights and obligations under that agreement."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union's appeal requires the court to again consider the interplay between provisions of the DM&#x0026;S statute and the Civil Service Reform Act. We examine first the VA's obligation to bargain with Title 38 employees over proposed changes in their working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The VA's Duty to Negotiate Over Working Conditions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Citing <span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span>, the union argues its nurses are "employees" under the Civil Service Reform Act who have the right to organize into unions and demand that the VA bargain in good faith with them in an effort to reach an agreement over the proposed changes in their working conditions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7117. The union maintains that nothing in section 4108(a) or section 4119 of the DM&#x0026;S statute precludes this right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The VA and FLRA concede there is language in the <span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span> decision which would support the union's position. Both submit, however, that the <span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span> court was presented only with the issue of the exclusive nature of the disciplinary procedures contained in section 4110 of the DM&#x0026;S statute; the effect of section 4108(a) on the Administrator's duty to bargain over working conditions was neither presented to nor decided by the court....&#8197;This observation is undoubtedly true, since at the time of the <span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span> decision both agencies appeared to concede that the Civil Service Reform Act required the VA to bargain with Title 38 employees over matters unrelated to discipline, including the employees' working conditions....&#8197;Both agencies now argue the VA has no duty to bargain over working conditions under the Civil Service Reform Act, relying on sections 4108(a) and 4119 of the DM&#x0026;S statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e begin with the proposition that the Civil Service Reform Act applies to the VA, absent other overriding provisions of law....&#8197;Section 7102 of the Act grants employees the right to bargain over conditions of employment, defined to include "personnel policies, practices and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions, except...to the extent such matters are specifically provided for by Federal statute." 5 USC 7102, 7103(a)(14). The VA argues that working conditions are beyond the scope of mandatory bargaining under the Civil Service Reform Act because the matter of working conditions for DM&#x0026;S employees is "specifically provided for by Federal statute," namely, section 4108(a) of, the DM&#x0026;S statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7103(a)(14)(C)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4108(a) of the DM&#x0026;S statute provides that "[n]otwithstanding any law, Executive order, or regulation," the Administrator of Veterans Affairs, now the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, "shall prescribe by regulation the hours and conditions of employment" of Title 38 professional employees. 38 USC 4108(a). Pursuant to the authority granted in section 4108, the VA has issued a manual containing "those policies which are applicable to the overall conduct of the personnel program for those subject to 38 USC ch. 73 [DM&#x0026;S professionals]." VA Personnel Policy Manual, MP-5, Part II 1-1 (June 1, 1964). The Manual has chapters pertaining to appointments (chapter 2), pay (chapter 3), probationary employment (chapter 4), advancement (chapter 5), proficiency evaluations (chapter 6), duty and leave (chapter 7), disciplinary actions, grievances and hearings (chapter 8), separations (chapter 9), physical requirements (chapter 10), recruitment and placement (chapter 11), overseas employment of non-U.S. citizens under 38 USC 4114(a)(1)(A) (chapter 12), and outside professional activities (chapter 13). <span class="Italic">See</span> VA Personnel Policy Manual, MP-5, Part II &#x0026; DM&#x0026;S Supplement to VA Personnel Policy Manual, MP-5, Part II.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the VA and the FLRA also cite section 4119 of the DM&#x0026;S statute, which indicates, again "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law," that no provision of Title 5 pertaining to the civil service system which is inconsistent with any provision of the DM&#x0026;S statute shall be considered to "supersede, override or otherwise modify" the DM&#x0026;S statute unless the Title 5 provision specifically indicates that the Title 38 provision is to be overridden or modified. 38 USC 4119. According to the <span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span> court, section 4119 requires us to resolve any conflict between the DM&#x0026;S statute and the Civil Service Reform Act in favor of the DM&#x0026;S statute. <span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span>, 705 F.2d at 958.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding section 7121 of the Civil Service Reform Act conflicted with section 4110 of the DM&#x0026;S statute, the <span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span> court reviewed the legislative history of section 4110 and concluded that when Congress enacted the DM&#x0026;S statute in 1946, it intended the section 4110 disciplinary procedures to be the exclusive means for disciplining DM&#x0026;S professionals. The concept that these procedures were to be exclusive conflicted with the union's alternative grievance procedure proposals; hence, under section 4119 the VA had no obligation to bargain with the union over these procedures....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The VA and the FLRA argue Congress intended the same exclusivity with regard to the Secretary's authority to set hours and conditions of employment pursuant to section 4108(a), and the <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span> court agreed....&#8197;The agencies argue before this Court that because the Civil Service Reform Act's mandatory duty to bargain over working conditions is inconsistent with the Secretary's exclusive authority to set these conditions, the DM&#x0026;S statute must prevail.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union responds that the general authority to set working conditions contained in section 4108 is different from the specific disciplinary procedures Congress addressed in Section 4110. The union attempts, in the words of the <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span> court, "to drive an analytical wedge between [section 4108] and other provisions of the [DM&#x0026;S] law that are admittedly exclusive in their application."...&#8197;The sparse legislative history of section 4108 reveals Congressional concern over the rigid application of civil service rules in the context of providing a professional service....&#8197;This same concern motivated Congress to provide a more efficient disciplinary scheme in section 4110. The union has failed to provide any convincing support for the proposition that Congress intended exclusivity in matters of discipline, but did not so intend with regard to the hours and conditions of employment of Title 38 employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union further argues that its proposals regarding changes in nursing documentation are not "inconsistent" with the Secretary's authority to prescribe regulations concerning working conditions so long as the subject of documentation is not covered by any provision in the VA Personnel Policy Manual. The union urges us to remand the negotiability issues to the FLRA for a determination of whether any of the union's specific proposals regarding nursing documentation are contrary to any Personnel Policy Manual provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The VA and the FLRA maintain that any inconsistency between section 4108 and the duty to bargain over working conditions derives not from actual conflicts between existing regulations or provisions in the Personnel Manual and specific union proposals.&#x2003;Rather, they argue the inconsistency stems from the Secretary's authority to set hours and conditions of employment "[n]otwithstanding any law, Executive order, or regulation."...&#8197;According to the agencies, a mandatory duty to bargain over any proposals, whether over an issue dealt with in the Personnel Manual or not, conflicts with the Secretary's exclusive authority to determine hours and conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span>, this Court found an inconsistency between the alternate grievance procedures proposed by the union and the disciplinary peer review board procedure set forth in section 4110 even when the proposed procedure culminated in final review by the <span id="page_1620"></span>Administrator (now the Secretary), because the union's proposal added "red tape" which conflicted with Congress' attempt to simplify disciplinary procedures. <span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span>, 705 F.2d at 957 n.4. The same inconsistency is present in the case at bar with regard to the Secretary's duty to bargain over working conditions. Requiring the VA to bargain over the changes in reporting procedures could subject the VA to a Federal Service Impasses Panel order forcing adoption of the union's proposals....&#8197;It is the compulsory nature of bargaining over working conditions, not any particular union proposal, which conflicts with Congress' expressed intent that the Secretary be allowed to act independently of all other laws, Executive orders, and regulations in establishing the hours and conditions of employment for DM&#x0026;S professionals....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We thus hold that assuming the Civil Service Reform Act requires mandatory bargaining over conditions of employment for Title 38 employees, the express language of the DM&#x0026;S statute and the reasoning employed by this Court in <span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span> requires us to resolve any conflict between the DM&#x0026;S statute and the Civil Service Reform Act in favor of the DM&#x0026;S provisions. The Authority's decision in Case No. 90-1379, 34 FLRA No. 40, dismissing the union's negotiability appeals is therefore affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The FLRA's Jurisdiction Over An Existing Collective Bargaining Agreement</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn now to the question of the Authority's jurisdiction to enforce a collective bargaining agreement which the VA has voluntarily entered into with the union. The VA and the FLRA argue that even though the VA has exercised the authority granted under section 4108 to enter into a collective bargaining agreement with the union, that agreement is not enforceable by the FLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In rejecting the union's claim that the VA <span class="Italic">must</span> bargain over working conditions, the <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span> court specifically observed that section 4108(a) "does not preclude the VA from choosing to negotiate about particular matters."...&#8197;The court also made reference to the legislative history of the 1980 DM&#x0026;S amendments, which the court interpreted as "an indication that Congress did not wish to upset the settled expectations of those VA employees working 'under <span class="Italic">existing</span> collective bargaining agreements.'"...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its answer to the unfair labor practice petition filed by the union, the VA conceded that it was an "agency" covered by the Civil Service Reform Act, that the union was a "labor organization" under the terms of the Act, and that the VA had agreed to abide by the Interim Agreement, which remained in force....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA reasoned that because the VA had no mandatory duty to bargain over working conditions under the Civil Service Reform Act, the collective bargaining agreement in effect between the VA and the union did not fit the definition of "collective bargaining agreement" under the Act and the Authority was without jurisdiction to enforce it....&#8197;The union urges us to reject the FLRA's "miserly reading of the term 'collective bargaining agreement,'" citing <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. FLRA</span>, 750 F.2d 143, 146, 148 (D.C. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the <span class="Italic">American Federation</span> case, the FLRA contended, as it does here, that collective bargaining agreements which are voluntarily negotiated fall outside the term "collective bargaining agreement" under the Civil Service Reform Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. While the issue arose in a different context from that presented here, we find the Authority's "crabbed construction" of the term "collective bargaining agreement" is equally unwarranted in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. As the union points out, the Civil Service Reform Act itself contemplates that certain issues are negotiable "at the election of the agency," 5 USC 7106(b)(1), and the Authority has exercised jurisdiction over agreements reached as a result of these voluntary negotiations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Local 1917, American Federation of Government Employees and U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, Eastern Region</span>, 13 FLRA 77, 78 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA argues that comparing an agency's voluntary bargaining agreement under section 7106(b)(1) with the VA's voluntary bargaining agreement is like comparing "apples and oranges" because the VA is acting independently of Title 5 provisions. We cannot agree. In <span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span>, this Court ruled that the provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act applied to the VA "absent other overriding provisions of law." <span class="Italic">VA Minneapolis</span>, 750 F.2d at 955. Unlike the issue of mandatory bargaining discussed above, section 4108(a) of the DM&#x0026;S statute does <span class="Italic">not</span> preclude the VA from engaging in voluntary bargaining over terms and conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span>, 851 F.2d at 1491. Moreover, because voluntary bargaining is not inconsistent with the DM&#x0026;S statute, section 4119 does not apply and cannot be read to preclude the application of any Title 5 provisions....&#8197;In short, there is nothing in the DM&#x0026;S statute which conflicts with the FLRA's assertion of jurisdiction over a collective bargaining agreement the VA has voluntarily agreed to abide by.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agencies' position that the FLRA lacks jurisdiction over the VA's voluntary agreement with the union renders that agreement unenforceable. Nothing in the language or legislative history of either the DM&#x0026;S statute or the Civil Service Reform Act supports this result. To the contrary, there is ample evidence that when Congress passed the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act, it believed Title 38 employees would be covered by its provisions. There is also ample evidence that when Congress amended the DM&#x0026;S statute in 1980, it knew that the VA had entered into collective bargaining agreements with Title 38 employees, and it did not wish to "detract in any way from employee rights under existing collective bargaining agreements between the VA and its employees."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, we must reject as unreasonable the FLRA's position that it lacks any jurisdiction over existing collective bargaining agreements with Title 38 employees. We hold the FLRA has jurisdiction over disputes under collective bargaining agreements the VA has voluntarily agreed to abide by, and accordingly we reverse the FLRA's dismissal of the union's unfair labor practice petition in Case No. 90-1380, 34 FLRA No. 40 [<span class="Italic">VAMC Fargo and AFGE</span>, 34 FLRA 182 (1990)], which was brought pursuant to the terms of such an agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether because the working conditions of Title 38 employees are "specifically provided for by Federal statute," 5 USC 7103(a)(14)(C), or because any conflict between the Civil Service Reform Act and the DM&#x0026;S statute must be resolved in favor of the latter, we agree with the <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span> court that the FLRA lacks jurisdiction to compel the VA to engage in collective bargaining over the conditions of employment of Title 38 professional employees. We also agree with the D.C. Circuit's observation that nothing in the DM&#x0026;S statute precludes the VA from voluntarily entering into a collective bargaining agreement with a union representing Title 38 employees, and we reject the contention that the DM&#x0026;S statute precludes the FLRA from asserting jurisdiction over such a collective bargaining agreement. The decision of the FLRA dismissing the union's negotiability appeals is therefore affirmed, but the FLRA's decision rejecting jurisdiction of the union's unfair labor practice petition, which arises from an existing collective bargaining agreement between the union and the VA, is hereby reversed.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to ULPs involving VA professional personnel exercising protected rights, there are limitations on FLRA jurisdiction. Under <span class="Italic">VAMC, San Francisco and O'Rourke</span>, 40 FLRA 290, 295-302 (1991) (decided a few days after and without reference to the Eighth Circuit decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3884</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>), involving allegations of discriminatory termination of a probationary nurse, interference in the form of interrogation of an employee about organizational efforts, and interference with distribution of organizational material, FLRA could not address an adverse action against an employee within the exclusive purview of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (as long as the VA asserted a lawful reason for taking the action):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear, and not contested by the Respondent, that the Charging Party is an "employee" within the meaning of section 7102. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2)(A), defining "employee," with exceptions not relevant here, as all individuals "employed in an agency[.]" It is also clear, however, that as a professional medical employee appointed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4104, the Charging Party does not have a right to bargain collectively, through representatives chosen by employees under the Statute, over conditions of employment....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the Charging Party is not entitled to exercise the right, under section 7102(2) of the Statute, to "engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees." We have no basis on which to conclude, however, and it is not asserted, that the absence of rights under section 7102(2) affects the other rights encompassed by section 7102. Accordingly, we hold, as relevant here, that the Charging Party has the right to form, join, or assist a labor organization without fear of penalty or reprisal under section 7102 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlawful interference by the Respondent with the Charging Party's right to form, join, or assist labor organization without fear of penalty or reprisal would constitute an unfair labor practice under section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute....&#8197;Moreover, unlawful discrimination against the Charging Party on the basis of her exercise of rights under section 7102 would constitute a violation of section 7116(a) (2) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot</span>, 35 FLRA 113, 117-26 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although this matter does not now appear to be in dispute, we confirm that as the Charging Party is covered by and may exercise rights pursuant to section 7102 of the Statute, and as interference with or discrimination based on the exercise of those rights constitutes an unfair labor practice under section 7116(a) of the Statute, the Authority has statutory jurisdiction to resolve the consolidated unfair labor practice complaints in this case. Stated simply, as conceded by the Respondent, the Charging Party's status as a professional medical employee subject to title 38 of the United States Code does not deprive the Authority of jurisdiction to resolve complaints alleging violations of section 7116(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint...alleges that the Respondent violated section 7116(a) (1) and (2) of the Statute by, among other things, separating the Charging Party from her position as a staff registered nurse in reprisal for her <span id="page_1621"></span>exercise of rights protected by section 7102 to form, join, or assist a labor organization. In other cases alleging such violations, the General Counsel must establish that the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity and that consideration of such activity was a motivating factor in the respondent's treatment of the employee in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 118. If the General Counsel makes this required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, the respondent may seek to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the affirmative defense that there was a legitimate justification <span id="page_1622"></span>for its action and that the same action would have been taken even in the absence of the consideration of protected activity....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, however, we are unable to apply the framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> for determining whether the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (2) by separating the Charging Party. We find, instead, that as the Respondent has exclusive authority under title 38 to determine to separate the Charging Party, the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework does not apply and, as a matter of law, the Respondent's motion for summary judgment must be granted insofar as it relates to the allegations in Case No. 9-CA-80473 regarding the separation of the Charging Party.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Charging Party was separated, during her 2-year probationary period, by the Respondent's Medical Center Director on the grounds that she had abandoned her position. The Medical Center Director's decision was based on a recommendation of the Nurse Professional Standards Board. The NPSB is established pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 4106....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The regulations, referred to in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106(b), pursuant to which the NPSB's action in this case were taken, are contained in Department of Medicine and Surgery (DM&#x0026;S) Supplement MP-5, Part II, Chapter 9, Paragraph 9.10....&#8197;In particular, a recommendation that an employee be separated during his or her probationary period is transmitted to the Medical Center Director who...has authority to approve such recommendation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear and undisputed that the Charging Party's separation for abandonment of her position was effected pursuant to the foregoing statutory and regulatory provisions. Further, although no violations of these provisions are alleged in this case, it is clear also that any such allegations would not be reviewable pursuant to grievance and arbitration procedures negotiated under the Statute....&#8197;Indeed, apart from the Agency's "unfettered" discretion to issue regulations concerning general working conditions...the Authority has long held that the Agency has exclusive authority to make determinations regarding alleged professional misconduct or incompetence....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although previous decisions regarding the Agency's authority to make determinations regarding professional misconduct or incompetence addressed 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110, which is not involved in this case, we have no basis on which to conclude that the Agency's authority to make determinations regarding the separation of probationary employees under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106 should be treated any differently than the Agency's authority under section 4110. Therefore, consistent with the Agency's authority to issue regulations regarding working conditions under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4108 as well as its authority to take action resulting from recommendations of disciplinary boards established under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110, we conclude that the Agency's authority to separate, or take other actions affecting the employment status of, probationary employees under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106 is exclusive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency's and Respondent's authority...to make determinations regarding the employment status of probationary employees is exclusive, we conclude that final determinations made pursuant to that authority are not substantively reviewable in an unfair labor practice proceeding. To hold otherwise, in our view, would be inconsistent with Congress' intent "to grant the Administrator exclusive authority to determine the working conditions of DM&#x0026;S employees."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we hold that, in resolving unfair labor practice complaints alleging violations of section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute involving professional medical employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, a respondent's asserted lawful reasons for taking the allegedly unlawful action must be evaluated with due regard for the Agency's exclusive authority to determine working conditions and make decisions regarding inaptitude, inefficiency, and misconduct under title 38. To the extent that a respondent asserts a lawful reason for taking a disputed action, and that reason is consistent with a final determination made pursuant to the exercise of the Agency's exclusive authority under title 38, review of such action may be sought only pursuant to the procedures, if any, set forth in title 38 and/or Agency regulations issued pursuant to title 38. A final determination made pursuant to such exclusive authority will not be substantively reviewable in an unfair labor practice proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In Case No.&#x2003;9-CA-80403, the Respondent asserts a lawful reason for separating the Charging Party from her position, the Respondent's separation action was taken pursuant to its exclusive authority under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106, and the determination is final. As such, the Respondent's determination to separate the Charging Party for abandonment of her position is not substantively reviewable in this unfair labor practice proceeding. As the Respondent's determination to separate the Charging Party is not substantively reviewable, the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework, requiring a determination as to whether a respondent has established by a preponderance of the evidence a legitimate justification for its action, does not apply. Stated otherwise, the Respondent has established a lawful reason for separating the Charging Party from her position as a staff registered nurse. As such, it would be meaningless to determine whether, for example, the General Counsel established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Respondent violated the Statute. Even if the General Counsel established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the General Counsel could not, as a matter of law, prove the allegations in the complaint by a preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, to the extent that the complaint in Case No. 9-CA-80473 encompasses the Charging Party's separation, the complaint must be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the portion of the complaint in Case No.&#x2003;9-CA-80473 challenging the Respondent's separation of the Charging Party must be dismissed, other allegations in the complaint may properly be adjudicated. In particular, portions of the complaint...allege that the Respondent violated the Statute by making certain statements to the Charging Party...that the Respondent violated the Statute by impermissibly interrogating an employee and by promulgating an allegedly improper no-solicitation, no-distribution rule. No reason is asserted, or otherwise apparent to us, that these allegations in the two complaints may not be processed further. We will, therefore, remand these aspects of the complaints to the Administrative Law Judge for action consistent with this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that the Charging Party, and other professional medical employees, are entitled to exercise rights pursuant to section 7102 of the Statute, including the right to form, join, or assist a labor organization without fear of penalty or reprisal. Unlawful interference with such rights constitutes a violation of section 7116(a)(1) and, in certain circumstances, section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute. The Authority has, and will exercise, statutory jurisdiction to resolve complaints alleging such violations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving such complaints, however, the Agency's exclusive authority to determine working conditions and make decisions regarding inaptitude, inefficient, and misconduct under title 38 must be observed. If as here, a respondent asserts a lawful reason for a disputed action, and such assertion is consistent with action taken pursuant to its exclusive authority under Title 38 of the United States Code and is final, the determination made pursuant to that authority is not substantively reviewable in an unfair labor practice proceeding. If, however, a respondent does not make such assertion, the respondent will be found to have violated the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">VA San Francisco</span> analysis was judicially accepted in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3306 v. FLRA</span>, 2 F.3d 6, 10 (2d Cir. 1993) ("The only clearly recognized area in which the FLRA may find an unfair labor practice in connection with DVA matters is the DVA's violation of existing collective bargaining agreements....&#8197;Thus, at a minimum, the relevant statutes cannot be said to prohibit the FLRA's construction."). The analysis was applied to support a ULP finding against a VA installation that refused to supply certain information to the requesting union. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VA, Washington and AFGE Local 2250</span>, 42 FLRA 333, 341-42 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA also explained its review authority in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Canandaigua and AFGE Local 3306</span>, 42 FLRA 1059, 1066-71 (1991) (<span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3306 v. FLRA</span>, 2 F.3d 6 (2d Cir. 1993)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>, the Authority established the framework for resolving complaints alleging violations of section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute in connection with a professional employee appointed to a position in the Department of Veterans Affairs under the provisions of title 38 of the United States Code. For reasons fully set forth in that decision, the Authority concluded, as an initial matter, that as such an employee "may exercise rights pursuant to section 7102 of the Statute, and as interference with or discrimination based on the exercise of those rights constitutes an unfair labor practice under section 7116(a) of the Statute, the Authority has statutory jurisdiction" to resolve complaints alleging violations of section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute. 40 FLRA at 297.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>, the Authority noted that complaints alleging violations of section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute are resolved on the basis of the analytical framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot</span>, 35 FLRA 113 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>). Specifically, the General Counsel must establish in such cases that an affected employee was engaged in protected activity and that consideration of such activity was a motivating factor in a respondent's treatment of the employee in connection with the employee's conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>, 40 FLRA at 197 (citing <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 118). If the General Counsel makes this showing, a respondent may seek to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the affirmative defense that there was legitimate justification for its action and that the same action would have been taken even if protected activity had not been considered. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 123).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority held, however, that it was unable to apply the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework in <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>. The Authority noted, as relevant here, that the authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs to make determinations regarding professional misconduct or incompetence under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110 is exclusive. The Authority concluded, for the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he [Department of Veterans Affairs] exclusive authority to determine working conditions and make decisions regarding inaptitude, inefficien[cy], and misconduct under title 38 must be observed. If as here, a respondent asserts a lawful reason for a disputed action, and such assertion is consistent with action taken pursuant to its exclusive authority under title 38 of the United States Code and is final, the determination made pursuant to that authority is not substantively reviewable in an unfair labor practice proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">40 FLRA at 302.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no reason to depart from our conclusion regarding the Authority's jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>. Accordingly, insofar as the Judge's decision may be read as holding either that the Authority lacks jurisdiction to resolve the complaint in this case or that Ward and Bellomo were not entitled to exercise rights under section 7102 of the Statute, we reject those holdings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find no reason, and none is urged, for applying a different framework for resolving complaints alleging violations of section 7116(a)(4) of the Statute, especially where, as here, such alleged violation is based on the same conduct alleged to have violated section 7116(a)(2). Accordingly, we conclude that, consistent with <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>, a respondent's asserted lawful reason for taking action which is alleged to violate section 7116(a)(2) or (a)(4) of the Statute is not substantively reviewable in an unfair labor practice proceeding if that asserted lawful reason is consistent with final action taken pursuant to exclusive authority under title 38 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the framework set forth in <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span> we conclude that the complaint must be remanded to the Judge. We note two things at the outset.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>, that a respondent's asserted lawful reason for taking a disputed action must be evaluated "with due regard for the...exclusive authority to...make decisions regarding inaptitude, inefficiency, and misconduct under title 38." 40 FLRA at 300. Based on this exclusive authority, the Authority held that a respondent's asserted lawful reason for taking an action is not substantively reviewable if "such assertion is consistent with action taken...under title 38...and is final[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 302.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority did not elaborate on the meaning of "final" action in <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>, which involved the separation of a probationary employee following review of the employee's qualifications by a Nurse Professional Standards Board under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106. We now hold that "final" action, within the meaning of <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>, encompasses a final administrative determination made pursuant to the exercise of exclusive authority under title 38. That is, an action taken under title 38 is final, for purposes of unfair labor practice proceedings, at such time as that action is accorded administrative finality under title 38 or regulations issued pursuant to title 38. We find no reason, however, and none is asserted, for holding that any subsequent judicial review of title 38 proceedings affects administrative finality for our purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the "due regard" for exclusive authority under title 38 would be rendered meaningless, in our view, if we were to hold that a respondent's asserted lawful reasons for taking a disputed action were substantively reviewable in unfair labor practice proceedings provided such review occurred during the pendency of, rather than after conclusion of, title 38 proceedings. As such, the finality of administrative action under title 38 is a prerequisite to adjudication of complaints alleging violations of section 7116(a)(2) and (4). Put simply, until such time as title 38 proceedings are administratively final, it is impossible to determine whether action which allegedly is unlawful under the Statute is, in fact, consistent with the exclusive authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs under title 38. Accordingly, insofar as the Judge's alternative findings regarding the complaint are based on the fact that the complaint involved proposed, rather than final, actions, we reject those findings.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;We do not hold that a complaint alleging a violation of section 7116(a)(2) or (a)(4) may not issue until the administrative conclusion of title 38 proceedings. We hold only that such a complaint may not be adjudicated until that time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case involves disciplinary proceedings under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110. Subsection (d) of that section provides that "[t]he decision of the (Secretary) shall be final."...&#8197;Subsection (e) provides that although the Secretary's authority may be delegated to the Chief Medical Director, "[a]ny person against whom disciplinary action is taken...shall have the right to appeal such action to the [Secretary.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Subsection (e) also provides that in the absence of an appeal, the Chief Medical Director's decision "shall have the same force and effect as a decision of the [Secretary]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The record before us does not disclose whether the Department of Veterans Affairs has issued regulations under section 4110. It appears from the plain wording of the section, however, that an action taken under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110 is accorded administrative finality when: (1) no appeal is taken from a decision by the Chief Medical Director, or (2) a decision is rendered by the Secretary, pursuant to an appeal of such decision. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Northport, New York v. FLRA</span>, 732 F.2d 1128, 1131 (2d Cir. 1984) (court stated that under section 4110, "peer review boards hold hearings, determine facts, and recommend disciplinary action to the Veteran's Administrator, whose decision is final.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing, we are unable to determine from the record before us whether the disputed proposed notices of discharge are consistent with final determination made by the Department of Veterans Affairs under title 38. It is undisputed that the complaint in this case issued, and the unfair labor practice hearing occurred, at a time when disciplinary proceedings under title 38 were pending. Consistent with the record developed at the unfair labor practice hearing, the Judge's decision makes no reference to events subsequent to the disciplinary board hearings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent asserts, without elaboration, that subsequent to the disciplinary board hearings, the Respondent "discharged nurse Ward and suspended nurse Bellomo."...&#8197;These assertions are undisputed. However, the Respondent further asserts that at the time its opposition was filed, Ward had "appealed his discharge to the VA Secretary[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Although it is possible to infer from the Respondent's opposition that no appeal was filed regarding suspension and that, accordingly, that action is final, we are unwilling to make that finding in the absence of further information in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we are unable, on the basis of this record, to resolve the complaint, we will remand the complaint to the Judge. On remand, absent settlement, the Judge must determine, consistent with this decision and <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>, whether the disputed proposed discharges are consistent with final action taken by the Respondent pursuant to its exclusive authority under title 38. If the proposed discharges are consistent with such final action, the complaint must be dismissed. If the proposed discharges are not consistent with such final action, the Judge must resolve the merits of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA revisited statutory protection for VA professional employees without bargaining rights but with limited protection against ULPs. <span class="Italic">VAMC Jackson and NFFE Local 589</span>, 48 FLRA 787, 793-94 (1993), considered whether the agency was required to permit union representation at investigations or interviews of probationary employees by a Nursing Professional Standards Board. FLRA concluded that the employees were entitled to representation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we reject the Respondent's contentions that the Authority does not have jurisdiction to determine whether the Respondent failed to comply with section 7114(a)(2)(B) and thereby violated section 7116(a)(1) and (8). In this connection, we find that the Respondent's reliance on 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d) is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422, entitled "Collective bargaining," states that "the authority of the Secretary to prescribe regulations...is subject to the right of Federal employees to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(a)....&#8197;38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b) prohibits collective bargaining over matters or questions concerning or arising out of professional conduct or competence, or peer review, and section 7422(d) gives the Secretary the exclusive authority to determine, whether a matter arises out of the prohibited subjects....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the rights contained in section 7114(a)(2)(B) are not tied to collective bargaining. Indeed, there is no duty to bargain with any union representative who attends an investigatory interview. <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, 420 U.S. at 259. The purpose of section 7114(a)(2)(B) is to create representational rights for Federal employees similar to the rights provided to private sector employees by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in interpreting the National Labor Relations Act and the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Respondent's assertion that section 7114(a)(2)(B) is inconsistent with title 38. There is nothing in title 38 which indicates that employees are excluded from coverage of the representation rights under section 7114(a)(2)(B). Further, the Respondent has not demonstrated how section 7114(a)(2)(B) is inconsistent with its authority under 38 USC 7403 to terminate probationary employees. In this connection, we agree with the Respondent that title 38 does not specify the procedures that a reviewing board must follow in reviewing and/or recommending the termination of a probationary employee who is not fully qualified and satisfactory. Nonetheless, the Respondent argues that, under title <span id="page_1623"></span>38, it has exclusive authority to prescribe regulations governing the termination of its probationary employees. However, nothing in title 38 supports the Respondent's assertion here. Thus, no conflict with title 38 exists.</p>
<p class="noindent">This result changed, however, in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Leavenworth and NFFE Local 1765</span>, 49 FLRA 1624, 1626-28 (1994), denying employees the right of union representation at Nursing Professional Standards Boards and recognizing an intervening change in the law:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VAMC II</span>, we reversed our finding in <span class="Italic">VAMC I</span> that the Department could not, by regulation, limit or override the rights outlined in section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. In reaching that result, we took into account the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs v. FLRA</span>, 9 F.3d 123 (D.C. Cir. 1993). In that case, and as relevant here, the court found that the Department was free to prescribe regulations governing peer review procedures for "nonhybrid employees," <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, professional medical employees, without regard to the bargaining and representational rights and obligations set forth in the Statute, other than those statutory rights specifically referencing title 38 employees. We stated that we would adhere to and henceforth follow the court's decision. We further found that the Department had promulgated a regulation, VA Manual MP-5, Part II, Chapter 4.06(4), precluding union representation in probationary peer review hearings and that nothing in section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute specifically referenced title 38 employees so as to permit union representation. As a result, we found that the refusal to permit union representatives to participate in the peer review hearings did not violate the Statute and we dismissed the consolidated unfair labor practice complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint in this case alleged a violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute based on the Respondent's refusal to permit union representation at a peer review hearing. Consistent with our decision in <span class="Italic">VAMC II</span> we find that the Respondent did not violate the Statute. In this connection, and as we stated in <span class="Italic">VAMC II</span>, the Department was free to promulgate regulations precluding union representation at peer review hearings. Although the Respondent did not rely on a regulation in denying the employee's request for representation, the Respondent's opening statement at the unfair labor practice hearing explicitly referenced an agency regulation governing the employee's probationary period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, the Respondent stated that the employee was "hired as a probationary employee under 38 USC 7403 with a two-year probationary period subject to review under Department of Veterans Affairs manual provision MP-5, Part 2, Chapter 4." Obviously, the referenced regulation is the same regulation that was found in <span class="Italic">VAMC II</span> to contain a prohibition on union representation at professional standards board reviews. Consequently, and as explained more fully in <span class="Italic">VAMC II</span>, the Respondent was under no obligation to permit the employee to have union representation at the NPSB hearing and its conduct in refusing to allow such representation did not violate the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of our conclusion, there is no basis on which to grant the relief requested by the Charging Party in its exceptions or to reconsider our precedent on remedial relief for violations of section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. We also find no merit to the Charging Party's arguments in its opposition that the right to representation is unconstrained by restrictions on the scope of bargaining and that Congress mandated the right to representation, which mandate supersedes the Department's right to promulgate regulations on working conditions. The Authority rejected essentially the same argument in <span class="Italic">VAMC III.</span>, 49 FLRA at 704, finding that the union had failed to support its assertion. Similarly here, the Union has failed to provide support for its contentions. Moreover, as we stated in <span class="Italic">VAMC II</span>, the Department is authorized to prescribe regulations "without regard to" the representational rights set forth in the Statute, unless there is a specific reference to title 38 employees in the Statutory section at issue. 49 FLRA at 175. As noted in <span class="Italic">VAMC II</span>, there is nothing in section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute that specifically references title 38 employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">To sort out what is and what is not reviewable, it appears that FLRA looks to correspondence to it from the Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs pertaining to what the VA believes involves a question of professional conduct or competence, peer review, or employee compensation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC Washington and Dist. of Columbia Nurses Ass'n</span>, 51 FLRA 896, 901 (1996) (complaint concerning entitlement to incentive award and jurisdictional issue concerning whether award was matter involving conduct or competence or adjustment or employee compensation), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 53 FLRA 822, 823 (1997) (regulation alleged to divest FLRA of jurisdiction under Secretary's authority pursuant to 38 USC 7422(d) need not be of specific type or contain specific language).</p>
<p class="noindent">Correspondence from the Under Secretary was sufficient to divest FLRA of ULP jurisdiction over a complaint to enforce an arbitration award involving premium pay for certain Title 38 nurses. The award, favoring the union, was final (exceptions by the agency were untimely) by the time of the ULP complaint. A determination by the Under Secretary that the ULP involved employee compensation was submitted in response to the General Counsel's summary judgment motion, <span class="Italic">VA, VAMC Asheville and AFGE Local 446</span>, 57 FLRA 681, 683-84 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the Secretary or designee has made a &#x00A7; 7422(d) determination concerning a matter, the Authority is deprived of jurisdiction over that matter<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs</span> <span class="Italic">Med Ctr., Wash., D.C., </span>53 FLRA 822 (1997) (ULP case); <span class="Italic">Wis. Fed'n of Nurses &#x0026; Health Prof'ls, Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Admin. Staff Nurses Council, Local 5032, </span>47 FLRA 910, 913-14 (1993) <span class="Italic">(Wis. Fed'n of Nurses) </span>(negotiability case). As the Under Secretary--the Secretary's designee--has made a &#x00A7; 7422(d) determination, the Authority lacks jurisdiction over this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC argues that the Under Secretary's &#x00A7; 7422(d) determination is invalid because it is not supported by a regulation. However, nothing in the wording of &#x00A7; 7422 or Authority precedent, including the cases relied on by the GC, requires the issuance of a regulation before the Secretary may make a valid &#x00A7; 7422(d) determination regarding the scope of grievance procedures under &#x00A7; 7422(b).[6] In particular, none of the cases relied on by the GC involve the scope of collective bargaining or grievance procedures as they relate to professional conduct or competence; peer review; or the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation. The limitations as to those three matters are set forth exclusively in &#x00A7; 7422(b) and (d). <span class="Italic">See Wis. Fed'n of Nurses</span>, 47 FLRA at 913-14 (Authority found Secretary made valid &#x00A7; 7422(d) determination with respect to matters included in &#x00A7; 7422(b), despite absence of a regulation). By contrast, the Secretary's authority to limit the Statutory rights involved in the cases relied on by the GC is set forth in &#x00A7; 7421(a), which authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations "[n]otwithstanding any law."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We note that in <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs Med. Ctr, Hampton, Va., </span>51 FLRA 1741 (1995), the Authority, citing &#x00A7; 7422(a), stated that "section 7422, by its terms, is inapplicable unless the Secretary exercises his regulatory authority, pursuant to section 7421, to override rights under the Statute<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1744-45 (footnotes omitted). Noting the citation to &#x00A7; 7422(a) and the context of the discussion, it appears that the quoted reference to &#x00A7; 7422 was intended to refer specifically only to &#x00A7; 7422(a). We also note that in <span class="Italic">Dep't</span> <span class="Italic">of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Wash., D.C.,</span> 53 FLRA 822, 823 (1997), the Authority stated that nothing in the wording of &#x00A7; 7421 or &#x00A7; 7422, or in the legislative history of those sections, supports a conclusion that a regulation alleged to divest the Authority of jurisdiction, pursuant to a determination of the Secretary under &#x00A7; 7422(d), must be of a specific type or contain specific language. We do not read this statement as mandating the issuance of a regulation in order to implement a determination of the Secretary under &#x00A7; 7422(d). Rather, the plain language of &#x00A7; 7422(d) makes it clear that the Secretary decides issues of whether a matter or question concerns or arises out of the three identified subject matters, and the Secretary's decision as to such issues, whether or not made in the context of a regulation, is not itself subject to collective bargaining and may not be reviewed by any other agency, including the Authority.</p>
