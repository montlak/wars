<p class="Body-Text">"The Board has held that, generally, reassignment should be considered only when accommodation within the individual's current position is unavailable or would pose an undue hardship." <span class="Italic">Schrodt v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 609, 614, 620 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 552, 565 (1997)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ponder v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-13-0201-I-2 (NP 8/28/2014) ("Reasonable accommodation may also include reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 405, &#x00B6; 14 (2013). Reassignment is the reasonable accommodation of last resort, which is only required after it has been determined that there are no effective accommodations that will enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his current position, or that all other reasonable accommodations would impose an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 14 n.5."). An agency need not reassign an employee to a position that is not within his restrictions, and the agency need not offer a higher level position or a detail as an accommodation. <span class="Italic">Okleson v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 415, 424 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2001); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Thibeault v. MSPB</span>, 611 Fed. Appx. 975, 979 (Fed. Cir. 2015) ("Further, to the extent that Thibeault does argue that USPS should have created a new position for him to accommodate his disability, the AJ correctly determined that USPS was not required to do so. <span class="Italic">Office of the Architect v. Office of Compliance</span>, 361 F.3d 633, 643 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ('[A]n employer is not required to create a new position to accommodate a disabled employee....'); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Wade v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 157 Fed. Appx. 268, 270 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP) ('While the agency is required to assign a disabled employee to a position he can perform, if one exists, it is not required to generate such a position when it does not reasonably exist.')."); <span class="Italic">Holly v. DHHS</span>, 92 MSPR 601, 606 &#x00B6; 9 (2002) (a request for a detail does not constitute reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Ransom v. Dept. of Army</span>, 49 MSPR 553, 556-59 (1991), the duty to reassign an employee may arise if there is a demonstration of accommodative necessity, or if there is a showing of harmful error resulting from the agency's failure to follow an agency policy requiring reassignment. As to a regulatory error, the appellant has the burden of proving harmful error. In the disability case, the appellant has the burden to prove the disability and an available accommodation. Then the agency must show that it would suffer an undue hardship if the accommodation were granted. Failing a demonstration of harmful error or disability discrimination, the appellant may still show that her removal should be mitigated to a demotion if she is physically unable to perform her job, but she is able to perform another position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue of reassignment in an appeal of a removal action for physical inability to perform may be relevant and material as an affirmative defense by an appellant of handicap discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Such a removal action cannot be sustained if an appellant shows that she is entitled to reasonable accommodation for a handicapping condition by reassignment to an available position and the agency does not show resulting undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Cavanagh v. US. Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 485, 491-92 (1990); <span class="Italic">Bucci v. Department of Education</span>, 43 MSPR 558, 564-65 (1990); <span class="Italic">Schoening v. Department of Transportation</span>, 34 MSPR 556, 559, 561 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue of reassignment may also be relevant and material in connection with an appellant's claim of harmful error under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) (the agency's decision may not be sustained if the employee "shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision"). Such a removal action also cannot be sustained, therefore, if an appellant shows that the agency committed harmful error: (a) By not affording her reassignment rights under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, <span class="Italic">see e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Marsh v. US. Postal Service</span>, 9 MSPB 175, 9 MSPR 548, 549-51 (1982); or (b) in the application of its own internal regulations by failing to reassign her to an available position. <span class="Italic">See Klipstine v. Department of the Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 257, 258-61 (1987); <span class="Italic">Almazan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 26 MSPR 318, 320 (1985). <span class="Italic">See</span> also <span class="Italic">Giesler v. Department of Transportation</span>, 3 MSPB 367, 3 MSPR 277, 280 (1980) (the Board will treat the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement to which the agency is a party in the same manner as it treats provisions of the agency's regulations), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> sub nom. <span class="Italic">Giesler v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 686 F.2d 844 (10th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of the record, we find that the appellant's claim in this case, although somewhat inartfully drafted, was not one of handicap discrimination, but instead one of harmful procedural error in the agency's failure to reassign her. In so finding, we first note that, in her petition for appeal, the appellant answered "N/A" to Question 24 which asked whether she believed she was discriminated against by the agency because of any of several prohibited factors, including handicap. Notwithstanding that answer, however, she did allege that the agency "is responsible to continue efforts to place employees who are physically disqualified from their positions." Moreover, in her response to the proposal notice, the appellant stated that the agency did not comply with the usual procedures in physical incapacitation cases. In addition, in her close-of-the-record submission, she argued "in conclusion" that the agency's action was procedurally defective.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of proof with regard to a claim of harmful procedural error. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(1) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(1)].The appellant's burden is to show that, in the absence of the agency's procedural error, the outcome of the case could have been different. <span class="Italic">See Mercer v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 772 F.2d 856, 859-60 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has failed to produce any evidence to show, what, if any, burden the agency had to reassign her under its own policies. Although she made various references to the agency's procedures regarding the placement of employees deemed unable to perform their duties, she submitted no such procedures. We conclude, therefore, that the appellant has not established that the agency committed harmful procedural error with regard to its failure to reassign her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn now to the issue of whether the agency's choice of penalty was reasonable. The Board will review an agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within the tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that, in lieu of removal, the agency considered the appellant for the position of WG-6 Parts Attendant, but refused to place her in that position. The agency based its placement denial on the opinion of Dr. Allen, Director of the agency's Health Clinic. Dr. Allen offered three reasons for refusing to concur with the placement. First, he cited the degenerative nature of the appellant's disease. Next, he indicated that even occasional operation of the forklift, as required, would cause an aggravation of her condition. Finally, he opined that the appellant's continued employment represented a liability to herself and to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that these reasons are not consistent with the appellant's medical restrictions. The first reason offered was not an acceptable reason to deny the appellant the job in question because the degenerative nature of her disease was not a part of her medical restrictions. Moreover, if the degenerative nature of the appellant's disease were an acceptable reason, it would necessarily apply to any and all positions regardless of their physical requirements. The second reason offered, that operating the forklift would aggravate the appellant's condition, was also clearly not a part of her medical restrictions. Even if it were, it would have been of no consequence because the forklift requirement was specifically waived by management. Finally, the third reason offered, that the appellant's continued employment represented a liability, was inconsistent with the specific restrictions placed on the appellant. That is, although her physician recommended a change in her duties, he did not state that employment was impossible for her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find on review that the appellant could have been placed in the WG-6 Parts Attendant position. The record shows that agency officials met prior to the effective date of her removal to discuss placing the appellant in the vacant WG-6 Parts Attendant position. Gary Statler, Chief, Vehicle and Artillery Branch, and Dennis E. Perry, In-coming Supervisor, executed a statement concerning their efforts. In it, they stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">From this discussion, it was agreed...that we would waive the lifting requirements, the Forklift operating, of which is very seldom, would present no problem, in fact the past person, who worked in the position for 3 yrs, didn't have to operate the Forklift at all to our knowledge. Gary Statler and...Dennis Perry agreed she could perform the job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, placement in the WG-6 Parts Attendant position was essentially approved by management, but for Dr. Allen's refusal to concur, based on reasons which we have found lack support in the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances, we find that removal is not a reasonable penalty in this case because it has been shown that the appellant could perform in the lower-graded position of WG-6 Parts Attendant. Accordingly, the penalty in this case is mitigated to demotion to that position. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Department of the Army,</span> 27 MSPR 90, 93 (1985) (demotion to the employee's previously-held position, rather than removal for physical inability to perform, was the maximum reasonable penalty under the circumstances)<span class="Italic">. See also Brown v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 9 MSPB 638, 10 MSPR 411, 413-14 (1982) (demotion of employee for physical inability to perform from GS-4 Computer Aid position to a less strenuous GS-3 Scheduling Clerk position, in which he could meet the physical requirements of the position, was within the tolerable limits of reasonableness).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Aquilina v. Dept. of Interior</span>, SF-0752-10-0020-I-4 (NP 12/22/2011), sustained removal when the appellant refused to report back to duty and accept her position with accommodation and the appellant instead insisted that she be reassigned to a different position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant asserts that she presented documentation from her "physical and mental physicians" releasing her <span id="Page_3499"></span>to return to work, that she provided such documentation prior to the agency's issuance of the notice of proposed removal, and that she thus "placed herself back to the Employer for return to work." The appellant relies on numerous Board cases in asserting that once an employee presents new medical evidence showing that she has recovered from the condition that previously prevented her from performing her duties, a removal for physical inability to perform cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of Transportation</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 579 (2008); <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Department of Interior</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 54 (1997); <span class="Italic">Street v. Department of the Army</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 335 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cases relied upon by the appellant are inapposite. Unlike the appellants in the cited cases, the appellant here was not removed for physical inability to perform her job duties. Rather, the appellant here was removed for refusing to accept a valid job offer and return to work. The appellant is correct that she provided documentation on March 3, 2006, releasing her to return to work prior to the agency's issuance of the September 27, 2007 notice of proposed removal. However, she failed to actually return to work despite the referenced medical evidence establishing that she could perform her Supply Technician position with accommodation and despite the agency's April 3, 2006 offer for her to return to her Supply Technician position with an appropriate accommodation. Furthermore, to the extent that the appellant is arguing that she reported to work on January 7, 2008, and was sent home, the record is clear that, following the issuance of the September 27, 2007 notice of proposed removal and the appellant's December 7, 2007 oral reply to the proposing official, Ms. Bartling, the agency simply advised the appellant not to report to work until a decision had been made on her proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing and quoting various Board decisions, the appellant seems to assert in her petition for review that the agency was required to accommodate her by reassigning her to the Event Assistant position unless it could show that such reassignment would pose an undue hardship. While the law establishes that a reasonable accommodation may entail reassignment to a vacant position the duties of which an employee can perform, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(9); <span class="Italic">Aka v. Washington Hospital Center</span>, 156 F.3d 1284, 1301-05 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o), the appellant has failed to cite precedent that actually supports her assertion that the agency must reassign her to the position of her choice even when her current position can be modified to accommodate her. Accordingly, the appellant has failed to identify any error in the administrative judge's consideration of her claim of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that her removal does not promote the efficiency of the service, seemingly based on the fact that she can now perform the duties of her position. The agency's charge, however, was based on the appellant's refusal to accept the agency's valid job offer to return to her Supply Technician position in April 2006 and her instead lobbying for reassignment to an Event Assistant position that she preferred until the agency finally proposed her removal in September 2007. The administrative judge found that the nexus between the agency's action and the efficiency of the service was apparent based on Mr. O'Neill's explanation of the steps taken by the agency over the period of years the appellant had been absent to ensure that her duties were being fulfilled within the organization. The appellant's assertions in her petition for review provide no reason to disturb the administrative judge's analysis of this issue. Accordingly, the appellant has failed to provide any reason to disturb the administrative judge's findings that the agency proved a nexus between its removal action and the efficiency of the service and that the penalty of removal was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">From the vantage point of an appellant, the Board has been restrictive as to reassignment as a form of disability accommodation. The Board's position was, until <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>, that if an employee could not perform his particular job with some relatively minor modification, the agency properly separated him. After <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, the bottom line is that because a disabled employee must be considered "qualified" if he can perform the essential functions of a reassigned position with a reasonable accommodation, the agency is required to consider whether other vacant positions identified by the appellant could be restructured to accommodate his disability. <span class="Italic">McLean v. Dept. of Army</span>, 36 MSPR 405, 408 (1988), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. United States Postal Service,</span> 30 MSPR 471 (Spec. Pan. 1986), the Special Panel adopted the decision of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and found that an agency must consider reassignment as a reasonable accommodation of a qualified handicapped employee. The EEOC had held that the phrase "position in question" in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(f)--which provides in part that a qualified handicapped person is one who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question--is not limited to the position occupied or held by the complainant. Rather, it also includes the position the complainant could have held as a result of reasonable accommodation by reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Ignacio v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03840005, slip op. at 11 (Sept. 4, 1984). Because a handicapped employee must be considered "qualified" if he can perform the essential functions of a reassigned position with a reasonable accommodation, the agency is required to consider whether other vacant positions identified by appellant could be restructured to accommodate his handicap. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boomer v. Department of the Navy,</span> 34 MSPR 636, 638-39 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under older decisions, without a finding of disability discrimination, an agency is under no general legal obligation to reassign an employee unless that obligation is created by agency regulations. <span class="Italic">Konieczko v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 509, 512 (1991); <span class="Italic">Newton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 156, 158 (1985) (Chapter 43 performance-based removal was set aside because the agency did not follow its regulations to seek a vacant position for an employee disabled by alcoholism). Provisions of collective bargaining agreements may carry the same force as agency regulations. [Refer to Chapter 6, "Collective Bargaining Contract."]</p>
