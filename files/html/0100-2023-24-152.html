<p class="Body-Text">In limited circumstances, a federal employee may be able to sue an agency official in his individual capacity to recover monetary damages for a violation of constitutional rights through a lawsuit that has come to be called a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action, finding its genesis in <span class="Italic">Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics</span>, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). In <span class="Italic">Bivens</span>, the Supreme Court decided that federal officials could be held individually liable in damages for violating a person's Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> spawned much litigation over so-called constitutional torts. The <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action, when properly brought, is directed against a government official. The remedy does not extend to lawsuits against federal agencies, although frequently a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action against an individual is joined with an action under another theory against the federal government. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tapia-Tapia v. Potter</span>, 322 F.3d 742, 746 (1st Cir. 2003) (as a basis for a nonstatutory suit for damages arising out of a constitutional violation, a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> case is not available against a federal agency; it is only available against an individual in his or her "individual capacity"); <span class="Italic">Whitley v. Hunt</span>, 158 F.3d 882, 885 (5th Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim is only available against government officers in their individual capacities); <span class="Italic">Enplanar, Inc. v. Marsh</span>, 11 F.3d 1284, 1294 n.12 (5th Cir. 1994) (same result as <span class="Italic">Whitley</span>); <span class="Italic">Platsky v. CIA,</span> 953 F.2d 26, 28 (2d Cir. 1991 ("even in <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> actions jurisdictional limitations permit a plaintiff to sue only the federal government officials responsible for violating the plaintiff's constitutional rights; a plaintiff cannot sue the agency for which the officials work"); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko</span>, 122 S. Ct. 515, 521 (2001); <span class="Italic">FDIC v. Meyer</span>, 114 S. Ct. 996, 1005-06 (1994) ("If we were to recognize a direct action for damages against federal agencies, we would be creating a potentially enormous financial burden for the Federal Government.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bivens</span> remedies were redefined and confined by <span class="Italic">Egbert v. Boule</span>, 142 S. Ct. 1793 (2022), precluding monetary damages (arising as a result of an alleged assault by a border patrol officer and later alleged reprisal after an internal complaint was lodged) when an internal agency grievance procedure provided for an investigation of the alleged misconduct, even if that process did not provide for a monetary remedy. Implicated in the determination of whether to provide a judicial remedy were at least two considerations: where there is any rational reason to think that Congress is better suited than the courts to weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed; whether Congress had provided alternative remedies for aggrieved parties--even if the remedies are not as effective as an individual damages remedy. The statutory (congressionally-mandated) remedy in <span class="Italic">Egbert</span> was indirect. 8 USC 1103(a)(2) requires the Border Patrol to control its employees, and under regulation, 8 CFR 287.10 (a-b), the Border Patrol must investigate alleged violations of standards for enforcement activities. <span class="Italic">Egbert</span> went on to determine that no <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action lies for First Amendment retaliation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> case is brought against a federal official in his or her personal capacity based on a violation of constitutional interests in a suit for damages.

<p class="Body-Text">As the decisions that follow are reviewed, keep in mind that plaintiffs will ordinarily sue an individual federal official in his or her personal capacity, in his or her official capacity as a government official, and the lawsuit will often join the United States or a federal agency as a defendant. Plaintiffs may bring alternative causes of action in law and equity, seeking damages as well as injunctive relief. Decisions must be read carefully to determine what claims are made, who is being sued, what theories of recovery are advanced, and what bases are adopted for disposition of the various claims against various defendants.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The seminal decision discussing federal employees and <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> actions is <span class="Italic">Bush v. Lucas</span>, 462 U.S. 367, 388 (1983). A reinstated NASA official sought damages against his supervisor on the theory that his removal, allegedly in reprisal for critical comments about the agency, violated his First Amendment rights. Prior to initiating the action against his supervisor, Bush appealed his removal to the MSPB. The Board ordered him reinstated with back pay. The Supreme Court, after noting the CSRA did not specifically preclude federal employees from seeking judicial relief in addition to relief under the Act, found that the extensive remedies provided under the Reform Act were a "special factor counselling hesitation" against the creation of additional judicial remedies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question is not what remedy the court should provide for a wrong that would otherwise go unredressed. It is whether an elaborate remedial system that has been constructed step by step, with careful attention to conflicting policy considerations, should be augmented by the creation of a new judicial remedy for the constitutional violation at issue. That question obviously cannot be answered simply by noting that existing remedies do not provide complete relief for the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Court determined that through the Reform Act, Congress provided an adequate, if not complete, means for addressing the constitutional violation alleged by Bush, in the form of an MSPB appeal with the right to judicial review of the Board decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, the debate focused on whether the Supreme Court intended an absolute preclusion of federal employees' <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> actions against supervisors, or instead based the decision of preclusion on the availability of adequate alternative remedies. Most commentators and many courts eschewed the absolute preclusion analysis in favor of the meaningful relief analysis. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, Note, <span class="Italic">Two Approaches to Determine Whether an Implied Cause of Action under the Constitution is Necessary: The Changing Scope of Bivens Actions</span>, 19 Ga.

<p class="Body-Text">Court decisions did not turn on the ultimate adequacy of the remedy; that some portions of the employee's harm might go uncompensated did not determine the employee's right to bring a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action. <span class="Italic">Heaney v.

<p class="Body-Text">Lost in a few of the court decisions expanding <span class="Italic">Bush</span>'s preclusive effect was the Supreme Court's original emphasis on the "comprehensive overhaul" that the Reform Act effected as to federal personnel law for those employees covered by the Act. Arguably, courts should have been much more circumspect in precluding the creation of judicial remedies for employees who fall outside the CSRA's scope and for whom Congress has not enacted such a sweeping revision and update of applicable laws. Before reversing its position as a result of the Supreme Court decision in <span class="Italic">Schweiker v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We are therefore unable to read <span class="Italic">Bush</span> as simply placing probationary employment off limits to the judiciary. It is true that <span class="Italic">Bush</span> emphasized Congress' special interest and authority in dealing with questions of federal employment....&#8197;But <span class="Italic">Bush</span> cannot be read apart from its pervasive emphasis on the remedies provided by Congress for the complaining employee in that case--remedies that the Court noted were unavailable to probationary employees....&#8197;While the remedies provided by Congress were in some respects not as complete as those that would be available in a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action, the congressional scheme nevertheless provided "meaningful remedies for employees who may have been unfairly disciplined for making critical comments about their agencies." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 386....&#8197;That conclusion, we suggest, is central to the holding in <span class="Italic">Bush</span>....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The D.C.

The D.C. Circuit was inconsistent in its treatment of <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> actions. In <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. EPA</span>, 809 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir. 1986), the court declined to permit a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action for an applicant who had no appeal rights, but who had the right to file a complaint with Special Counsel. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Spagnola v.

Cir. 1986). <span class="Italic">Hubbard</span> and <span class="Italic">Spagnola</span> were vacated in part pending a decision following rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc</span> by the D.C.

In that decision, the court concluded that it would not examine the meaningfulness of particular remedies, as long as a remedial scheme seemed comprehensive. <span class="Italic">Spagnola</span> is discussed following the mention, below, of the Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">Chilicky</span> decision. To the extent that circuits differed as to the existence of a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> remedy for anyone in or on the periphery of the federal civil service, the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 108 S. Ct. 668, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, gave some indication of the willingness to extend the doctrine of preclusion to employees mentioned in the Reform Act, but given little or no protection by the Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1988, the Supreme Court decided <span class="Italic">Schweiker v. Chilicky</span>, 108 S. Ct. 2460, 2465-70 (1988). The issue was whether the improper denial of Social Security benefits, alleged to have resulted from due process violations by government officials administering the Social Security program, gave rise to a damages action against those officials. As in <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, the Court concluded that the remedy sought was precluded by the remedial scheme established by Congress:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[R]espondents experienced delays of many months in receiving disability benefits to which they were entitled.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1971, this Court held that the victim of a Fourth Amendment violation <span id="Page_5395"></span>by federal officers acting under color of their authority may bring suit for money damages against the officers in federal court. <span class="Italic">Bivens</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our more recent decisions have responded cautiously to suggestions that <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> remedies be extended into new contexts. The absence of statutory relief for a constitutional violation, for example, does not by any means necessarily imply that courts should award money damages against the officers responsible for the violation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e refused...to create a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> remedy for a First Amendment violation "aris[ing] out of an employment relationship that is governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions giving meaningful remedies against the United States." <span class="Italic">Bush v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the concept of "special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress" has proved to include an appropriate judicial deference to indications that congressional inaction has not been inadvertent. When the design of a government program suggests that Congress has provided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of its administration, we have not created additional <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> remedies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Millions of claims are filed every year under the [Social Security] Act's disability benefits programs alone, and these claims are handled under "an unusually protective [multi-] step process for the review and adjudication of disputed claims...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An initial determination of a claimant's eligibility for benefits is made....&#8197;Next, a claimant is entitled to a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> reconsideration by the state agency, and additional evidence may be presented at that time....&#8197;If the claimant is dissatisfied..., review may then be had by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through a federal ALJ; at this stage, the claimant is again free to introduce new evidence or raise new issues....&#8197;If the claimant is still dissatisfied, a hearing may be sought before the Appeals Council of the Social Security Administration....&#8197;Once these elaborate administrative remedies have been exhausted, a claimant is entitled to seek judicial review, including review of constitutional claims....&#8197;The Act, however, makes no provision for remedies in money damages against officials responsible for unconstitutional conduct that leads to wrongful denial of benefits....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The case before us cannot reasonably be distinguished from <span class="Italic">Bush v. Lucas</span>. Here, exactly as in <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, Congress has failed to provide for "complete relief": respondents have not been given a remedy in damages for emotional distress or for other hardships suffered because of delays in their receipt of Social Security benefits....&#8197;The creation of a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> remedy would obviously offer the prospect of relief for injuries that must now go unredressed. Congress, however, has not failed to provide meaningful safeguards or remedies for the rights of persons situated as respondents were. Indeed, the system for protecting their rights is, if anything, considerably more elaborate than the civil service system considered in <span class="Italic">Bush</span>....</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chilicky</span> did not clarify how minimal a remedial scheme can be before preclusion will be applied to constitutional damage claims. Returning to the <span class="Italic">Spagnola</span> decision, the D.C. Circuit gave some indication of how it interpreted <span class="Italic">Chilicky</span>, 859 F.2d at 228-30:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we read <span class="Italic">Chilicky</span> and <span class="Italic">Bush</span> together, the courts must withhold their power to fashion damages when Congress has put in place a comprehensive system to administer public rights, has "not inadvertently" omitted damages remedies for certain claimants, and has not plainly expressed an intention that the courts preserve <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> remedies. In these circumstances, it is not for the judiciary to question whether Congress' "response [was] the best response, [for] Congress is the body charged with making the inevitable compromises required in the design of a massive and complex...program." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2470-71.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find nothing in the legislative history suggesting that Congress' omission of a damages remedy in the CSRA was anything but advertent, nor do we discern any clear expression of congressional intent that the courts preserve <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> remedies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Concededly, the Court has provided few, if any principles governing whether a particular claimant--and his underlying claims--should be included in a given congressional "comprehensive system" for purposes of applying "special factors" analysis. After <span class="Italic">Chilicky</span>, of course, this issue has become critical. Nevertheless, while in some cases the outer boundaries may be less than clear, there can be little doubt as to whether Congress has brought claims like those advanced by Hubbard and Spagnola within CSRA's ambit. This is because the CSRA itself, in one fashion or another, affirmatively speaks to claims such as Hubbard's and Spagnola's by condemning the underlying actions as "prohibited personnel practices." Thus, we are dealing with a statutory scheme that at least technically accommodates appellants' constitutional challenges....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we decline to extend <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> remedies to Hubbard and Spagnola, we do not suggest that the CSRA precludes the exercise of federal jurisdiction over the constitutional claims of federal employees and job applicants altogether....&#8197;On the contrary, time and again this court has affirmed the right of civil servants to seek equitable relief against their supervisors, and the agency itself, in vindication of their constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Whitman v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 382 F.3d 938 (9th Cir. 2004), provides the background for another Supreme Court pronouncement on preemption. In <span class="Italic">Whitman,</span> the plaintiff's underlying employment dispute was that he was subjected to a disproportionately large number of drug tests under the random testing process. Although Whitman had a grievance process available to him, he filed suit in federal court asserting, among other allegations, violations of the First Amendment. The circuit court dismissed the complaint for reasons that included preemption of the subject matter by reason of the remedial scheme of the Reform Act. <span class="Italic">Certiorari</span> was sought and granted, and the case was remanded to the circuit court for further consideration of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's remand decision left open questions as to the preclusive effect of the CSRA, suggesting that preclusion may not have been quite as complete as some circuit courts suggested. The Supreme Court determined in <span class="Italic">Whitman v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> 547 U.S. 512 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Terry Whitman, the petitioner, is an employee of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and is subject to the agency's drug and alcohol testing program. Without first seeking to pursue grievance procedures under his collective-bargaining agreement, he filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, alleging the FAA tested him in a nonrandom manner, in violation of his constitutional rights and 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 45104(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FAA has its own procedural framework for the resolution of claims by its employees; and for this purpose it adopts certain sections of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), including Chapter 71 of Title 5, which sets forth the rules for grievances. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(C). The District Court held that, under the provisions of the CSRA, it was without jurisdiction to consider the petitioner's claims. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, stating that because "5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1), as amended in 1994, does not expressly confer federal court jurisdiction over employment-related claims covered by the negotiated grievance procedures of federal employees' collective bargaining agreements," his claims are precluded. 382 F. 3d 938, 939 (2004). This Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to review the judgment. 545 U.S. [1138] (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals was correct to say that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) does not confer jurisdiction. Another statute, however--a very familiar one--grants jurisdiction to the federal courts over "all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1331. The question, then, is not whether 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 confers jurisdiction, but whether &#x00A7; 7121 (or the CSRA as a whole) removes the jurisdiction given to the federal courts,<span class="Italic"> see Verizon Md. Inc. v.</span> <span class="Italic">Public Serv. Comm'n of Md.,</span> 535 U.S. 635, 642 (2002) (holding that "even if [47 U.S.C.] &#x00A7; 252(e)(6) does not <span class="Italic">confer</span> jurisdiction, it at least does not <span class="Italic">divest</span> the district courts of their authority under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1331 to review the Commission's order for compliance with federal law"), or otherwise precludes employees from pursuing remedies beyond those set out in the CSRA, <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto,</span> 484 U.S. 439, 443-444 (1988); <span class="Italic">Abbott Laboratories v.</span> <span class="Italic">Gardner,</span> 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967) ("The question is phrased in terms of 'prohibition' rather than 'authorization' because...judicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding the question of jurisdiction and preclusion, the Court would be required first to ascertain where Whitman's claims fit within the statutory scheme, as the CSRA provides different treatment for grievances depending on the nature of the claim. It may be, for example, that the FAA's actions, as described by the petitioner, constitute a "prohibited personnel practice."<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b); 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(A). Both the petitioner and the Government say they do not, but because the ultimate question may be jurisdictional, this concession ought not to be accepted out of hand.<span class="Italic"> See Weinberger v.</span> <span class="Italic">Bentex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</span> 412 U.S. 645, 652 (1973) ("Parties, of course, cannot confer jurisdiction; only Congress can do so"). The Court of Appeals did not decide whether the petitioner's allegations state a "prohibited personnel practice." The proper course, then, is to remand for the Court of Appeals to address the <span id="Page_5396"></span>matter,<span class="Italic"> see National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.</span> <span class="Italic">Smith,</span> 525 U.S. 459, 470 (1999), as well as the ultimate issue of preclusion. The various other issues raised before this Court, but not decided below, may also be addressed on remand, including: whether the petitioner has challenged final agency action; whether the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies; whether exhaustion is required given this statutory scheme and the Administrative Procedure Act, as interpreted in <span class="Italic">Darby v.</span> <span class="Italic">Cisneros,</span> 509 U.S. 137 (1993); and whether the Government has forfeited its exhaustion-of-remedies argument. It may be that a decision on these questions can obviate the need to decide a more difficult question of preclusion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cases postdating <span class="Italic">Chilicky</span> are uniform in their rejection of suits against individuals and the government for damages or other extraordinary relief unless there are extraordinary constitutional grounds. Each circuit fell into line.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should a federal employee be able to avoid the preclusive effect of alternate remedies, he must still meet a high burden in pleading his case to invoke a constitutional damages action against a federal official. For an analysis of those requirements, refer to <span class="Italic">Whitacre v. Davey</span>, 890 F.2d 1168 (D.C. Cir. 1989), and <span class="Italic">Siegert v. Gilley</span>, 895 F.2d 797 (D.C.

<p class="Body-Text">What remains of <span class="Italic">Bivens</span>? At the very least, if an individual sues a federal employee for an assault (as <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> had sued for an unlawful search), and the assault occurred outside the reasonable scope of the defendant's employment, the lawsuit might survive, as in <span class="Italic">Green v. Hill</span>, 954 F.2d 694, 698 (11th Cir. 1992). <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Carter</span>, 939 F.2d 180, 186 (4th Cir. 1991), did not bar a tort suit by a civilian employee who allegedly was called a liar by a military officer who, at the time of the incident, acting principally in a civilian and unofficial capacity. As to the argument that the tort suit was precluded by the remedies under the CSRA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA is applicable only to personnel actions involving one of the enumerated prohibited personnel practices: an appointment, promotion, disciplinary or corrective action, a detail, transfer or reassignment, a reinstatement, a restoration, a reemployment, a performance evaluation, a decision concerning pay benefits or awards, or any other significant change in duties or responsibilities. 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Johnson's suit does not arise out of disciplinary or corrective action as Carter contends. Carter admitted that he did not intend to discipline Johnson but rather to file a formal complaint, on a personal level. Further, the disciplinary action that was ultimately taken against Johnson is not the basis of this suit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even an allegedly unlawful search may not be subject to a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim if the search is conducted as part of the processing of a personnel action that could, in the estimation of the court, rise to the level of a prohibited personnel practice. Search of an employee's home did not constitute a matter covered under the remedial structure of the CSRA, and was within the ambit of a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action, <span class="Italic">Collins v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">FACTS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In February 1994, DEA agent Edward Collins was placed on administrative leave because of numerous allegations of serious, sometimes dangerous, misconduct.[2] While Collins' supervisor was notifying Collins of the administrative leave decision, other DEA agents removed Collins' DEA credentials and official firearm from his desk. After Collins was placed on administrative leave, his supervisor, Robert Bender, ordered two other DEA agents, Stephen D'Erchia and Richard Plunkett, to go to Collins' house and retrieve all government property and Collins' personal firearms. To retrieve Collins' firearms, D'Erchia and Plunkett searched Collins' home. Collins claims that he never gave his consent to the search, but that he allowed the agents to conduct the search after they handled their firearms in a threatening manner and told him that Bender demanded that they retrieve the weapons. According to Collins' complaint, the agents then engaged in various unconstitutional actions to prevent Collins from reporting their illegal activities. Collins was eventually terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;According to the Non-Drug Custodian, Collins pointed and cocked a pistol at the back of her head, and two female law enforcement officers claimed that Collins was stalking them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts can hear constitutional tort claims against federal officials in their individual capacities if Congress has not foreclosed a remedy for the constitutional violation and if there are no special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress. <span class="Italic">See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Fed. Bureau of Narcotics</span>, 403 U.S. 388, 396-97, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed.2d 619 (1971). But the Supreme Court "respond[s] cautiously to suggestions that <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> remedies be extended into new contexts." <span class="Italic">Schweiker v. Chilicky</span>, 487 U.S. 412, 421, 108 S. Ct. 2460, 101 L. Ed.2d 370 (1988). "'When the design of a Government program suggests that Congress has provided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of its administration,' the Supreme Court has not created additional <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> remedies." <span class="Italic">Blankenship v. McDonald</span>, 176 F.3d 1192, 1195 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting <span class="Italic">Chilicky</span>, 487 U.S. at 423, 108 S. Ct. 2460). Judicial deference is particularly appropriate in the realm of federal personnel policy. Because Congress "is far more competent than the Judiciary to carry out the necessary 'balancing [of] governmental efficiency and the rights of employees,'" the Court defers to Congress' judgment regarding the proper remedy for unconstitutional federal personnel actions, <span class="Italic">Chilicky</span>, 487 U.S. at 423, 108 S. Ct. 2460 (quoting <span class="Italic">Bush v. Lucas</span>, 462 U.S. 367, 389, 103 S. Ct. 2404, 76 L. Ed.2d 648 (1983)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress created the framework for federal personnel policy in the CSRA. "The CSRA contains an 'elaborate remedial system that has been constructed step by step, with careful attention to conflicting policy considerations.'" <span class="Italic">Blankenship</span>, 176 F.3d at 1195 (quoting <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, 462 U.S. at 388, 103 S. Ct. 2404). When allegedly unconstitutional conduct falls within the broad confines of the CSRA, courts lack jurisdiction to hear a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action based on the conduct. <span class="Italic">See Saul v. United States</span>, 928 F.2d 829, 840 (9th Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the CSRA, "prohibited personnel practices" include the taking of a "personnel action" that violates merit system principles. 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Saul</span>, 928 F.2d at 833. "The merit system principles include treating employees fairly and equitably, 'with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights.'" <span class="Italic">Saul</span> 928 F.2d at 833 (quoting 5 USC &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2)). The question before the panel, then, is whether appellees' actions constituted "personnel actions" as defined in the CSRA. If so, the CSRA applies to appellees' conduct, and the CSRA procedures, not the federal courts, will determine what remedy, if any, is available to vindicate Collins' constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA defines "'personnel action' as including 'disciplinary or corrective action.'" <span class="Italic">Saul</span>, 928 F.2d at 833 (quoting 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii)). In <span class="Italic">Bush v. Lucas</span>, the Supreme Court noted that there are limits to the types of actions that can be considered "personnel actions" under the CSRA: "[C]ertain actions by supervisors against federal employees, such as wiretapping, warrantless searches, or uncompensated takings, would not be defined as 'personnel actions'" under the CSRA. <span class="Italic">Bush v. Lucas</span>, 462 U.S. 367, 386 n.28, 103 S. Ct. 2404, 76 L. Ed.2d 648 (1983). But despite the <span class="Italic">Bush</span> footnote, the <span class="Italic">Saul</span> court took an expansive reading of the phrase "personnel action." In <span class="Italic">Saul</span>, a federal employee sued his supervisors for, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "seizing and opening personal mail addressed to him at the office, thereby violating his constitutional rights and invading his privacy." <span class="Italic">Saul</span>, 928 F.2d at 829. The court held that "[t]he term 'corrective action' [which is a subset of 'personnel action'] can be read broadly enough to encompass the mail opening before us.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 834. The court decided that the <span class="Italic">Bush</span> footnote did not preclude its holding because "the footnote was [not] meant to decide whether every allegation that a supervisor has subjected a federal employee to a warrantless search is barred from appeal under the CSRA. Read in context, the footnote indicates only that CSRA remedies, while comprehensive, are not infinitely so." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 839.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, <span class="Italic">Saul</span>'s statement that not all warrantless searches fall outside of the CSRA certainly does not mean that all warrantless searches by supervisors fall within the CSRA. The issue, as the <span class="Italic">Saul</span> court framed it, is whether the particular search is a "personnel action" as defined by the CSRA. In <span class="Italic">Saul</span>, this court held that the term "corrective action" could be read broadly enough to encompass the search of the employee's private mail at the office. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 834. The <span class="Italic">Saul</span> court did not clearly articulate the reasoning that led to this conclusion. As a result, <span class="Italic">Saul</span> makes clear that some warrantless searches can qualify as "personnel actions" under the CSRA, but <span class="Italic">Saul</span> is of little help in determining whether the search of Collins' home falls within the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Collins concedes that the issue before the court is whether the search of his home was, like the search in <span class="Italic">Saul</span>, a "personnel action," which would place it under the purview of the CSRA. But Collins argues that the search of his home was not a "personnel action" because no actions outside the workplace, let alone a warrantless search and seizure and uncompensated taking in the employee's home, so qualifies. Collins, therefore, seems to argue that the location of this action alone determines whether the action is a "personnel action." We disagree. The fact that agents searched <span id="Page_5397"></span>Collins' <span class="Italic">home</span> is an important factor in our decision, but location alone is insufficient to determine whether an action is a "personnel action." It is true that "personnel actions" rarely take place "outside the workplace." We would expect this as most business is conducted inside the workplace. But the scarcity of examples of "personnel actions" outside of the office does not mean that conduct outside the office necessarily falls outside the definition of "personnel action." If, for example, a supervisor fired a federal employee because of racial animus, it should not matter whether the firing took place in the office, over dinner, or at the employee's home. Conversely, if a supervisor engages in truly reprehensible conduct in the workplace that is unrelated to conditions of employment, the supervisor has not engaged in any "personnel action." <span class="Italic">See Brock v. United States</span>, 64 F.3d 1421, 1425 (9th Cir. 1995) (Rape and physical abuse of an employee during an overnight field outing did not constitute "personnel action.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Collins' second argument for reversal is a curious one. Collins argues that Congress, even if it wanted, could not preclude his <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action because it did not leave him with any relief for the appellees' invasion of his home. Collins' argument is long on flowery language and short on substance. First, Collins has not established that he is without any relief absent this <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action. He has simply ignored the district court's query regarding potential CSRA remedies, and he has ignored the defendants' argument that the CSRA provides Collins with potential remedies. Nevertheless, we too will ignore the availability of CSRA remedies because Collins' argument suffers from a more fatal defect. Whatever the merits of Collins' philosophical musings on the sanctity of the home, Collins' argument lacks a legal foundation. This court has already held that the CSRA can preclude <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> actions even where the CSRA does not provide an alternative remedy. <span class="Italic">See Saul</span>, 928 F.2d at 840. Therefore, even if no remedy were available to Collins under the CSRA, he still could not bring a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action if the acts complained of fell within the CSRA's confines.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our dissatisfaction with Collins' arguments is not an endorsement of the defendants' arguments. The defendants claim that the search of Collins' home was a "personnel action" in that it was related to Collins' placement on administrative leave and subsequent termination. We disagree. Any connection between the defendants' search and Collins' employment was, at best, attenuated. The agents searched not in the workplace but in Collins' home. They searched not for government property but for private property, and they still have made no showing how Collins' private property was related to his employment. Presumably, the only difference between Collins' privately owned firearms and his other possessions, for example his television or his microwave oven, was the ability of the firearms to do harm. Thus, as we understand the defendants' argument, the term "personnel action" encompasses any actions taken by a government supervisor to insure that recently disciplined or terminated employees do not lash out and harm supervisors, coworkers, or themselves. But if the term "personnel action" encompasses the taking of an employee's firearms, would it not also encompass the taking of the employee's softball bat, kitchen knives, and rat poison? All of these items could, themselves, make powerful implements for revenge. And if Bender, as he asserts, acted to preserve Collins' well-being, would "personnel action" not allow for the retrieval of Collins' belt and shoelaces in addition to his guns? The defendants' interpretation of "personnel action" would seem to encompass all of these measures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not believe that "personnel action" can be defined so broadly. Congress intended for the CSRA to be the sole mechanism through which employment disputes are settled. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Saul</span>, 928 F.2d at 833. But we do not believe that Congress intended to deputize government supervisors as chieftains of security forces that police the private lives of their employees subject only to some administrative oversight, and we do not believe that Congress meant to shoehorn into the CSRA every odd occurrence where a supervisor forms and leads such a renegade posse. Where the only connection between a supervisor's illegal search of a government worker's residence and that worker's employment is the supervisor's hunch that the worker may be dangerous, the search is too attenuated from the worker's employment to be considered a personnel action. Therefore, the search of Collins' home was not a "personnel action" under the CSRA, and the district court's dismissal of Collins' claims was improper.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sarullo v. USPS</span>, 352 F.3d 789, 794-97 (3rd Cir. 2003), precluded a lawsuit instituted by a federal employee on a theory of malicious prosecution arising out of an investigation and arrest based on alleged drug dealing on the job:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA provides a comprehensive statutory scheme which enables federal employees to obtain remedies for prohibited personnel practices engaged in by federal agencies. The defendants, relying upon <span class="Italic">Bush v. Lucas</span>, 462 U.S. 367, 103 S. Ct. 2404, 76 L. Ed.2d 648 (1983), argue that the CSRA affords Sarullo the exclusive remedy for his malicious prosecution claim and that the District Court therefore lacked jurisdiction over his claim for malicious prosecution as it "relate[d] to his employment relationship with the postal service...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, the Supreme Court held that "the history and structure of the CSRA spoke with sufficient clarity to preclude the creation of a new <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim." <span class="Italic">Mitchum v.</span> <span class="Italic">Hurt</span>, 73 F.3d 30, 35 (3d Cir. 1995). In <span class="Italic">Mitchum</span>, we held that the CSRA affords the exclusive remedy for damage claims of federal employees seeking redress for alleged constitutional violations arising out of the employment relationship. We noted that the employment relationship underlying disputes between federal employees and the government implicates the interest of the government as employer and therefore gives rise to "'special factors counseling hesitation' [that] militate against the creation of a new [<span class="Italic">Bivens</span>] damages remedy." <span class="Italic">Mitchum</span>, 73 F.3d at 34 (quoting <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, 462 U.S. at 377, 103 S. Ct. 2404 (quoting <span class="Italic">Bivens</span>, 403 U.S. at 396, 91 S. Ct. 1999)). Accordingly, we must at the outset determine whether we have subject matter jurisdiction to resolve the merits of Sarullo's <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim for damages based upon the alleged malicious prosecution. <span class="Italic">See Rice v. United States</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms</span>, 68 F.3d 702, 707 (3rd Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Pontarelli v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 285 F.3d 216 (3d Cir. 2002) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Schweiker v. Chilicky</span>, 487 U.S. 412, 108 S. Ct. 2460, 101 L. Ed.2d 370 (1988), the Supreme Court announced a very broad rule, holding that a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> action for an alleged constitutional tort will not lie "[w]hen the design of a Government program suggests that Congress has provided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of its administration." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 423, 91 S. Ct. 1999. We agree with the government that, under <span class="Italic">Chilicky</span>, this is a case arising out of the employment context and that the CSRA therefore provides the full scheme of remedies available to Sarullo. Sarullo allegedly engaged in illegal drug activity at his place of employment during regular business hours. His supervisors, alerted to this possibility, understandably became concerned and launched an internal investigation into these alleged wrongdoings. Sarullo was discharged after the investigation revealed that he was dealing drugs at work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A commonsense reading of the CSRA and of the jurisprudence it has generated forces us to conclude that measures designed to investigate an employee who is dealing drugs at work are actions arising out of the employment context.[5] True, those same actions could have taken place in a wide variety of places: Sarullo's home, the street corner, a local bar. But under the facts of this case, these alleged actions took place at work, and Sarullo was discharged because of his alleged drug dealings at work--not because of alleged illegal activity taking place in the privacy of his own home--or elsewhere--outside of working hours. There is no reasonable explication of the CSRA which would have us decide that dealing drugs at work is not related to the employment context.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The CSRA contains a number of lengthy definitions of personnel actions and the circumstances under which they become "prohibited personnel practices," including the requisite motive, most of which are unhelpful here. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(a)-(b), 7512. As the Ninth Circuit noted in <span class="Italic">Saul v. United States</span>, 928 F.2d 829 (9th Cir. 1991), <span class="Italic">Bush</span> holds squarely that the CSRA prevents federal employees from bringing <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> actions to job-related wrongs and the specification of "covered actions" clearly reflects a congressional intent to extend the CSRA to the kind of decisions of the employee/employer relationship. We have no doubt that a discharge of an employee is such a personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This conclusion is supported by the jurisprudence of other circuits. In <span class="Italic">Lombardi v. Small Business</span> <span class="Italic">Administration</span>, 889 F.2d 959 (10th Cir. 1989), the plaintiff, an intern at the Small Business Administration, filed a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim after his termination. The intern sought damages and injunctive relief alleging violation of his constitutional rights by the Small Business Administration and its officials. The Court held that the intern could not pursue a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim because:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the violations complained of by the Appellant occurred only as a result of the employment relationship with the Small Business Administration. His position as a federal employee is central to his complaints, and it is this employment relationship that the Supreme Court emphasized in <span class="Italic">Bush</span> and its progeny, rather than the nature of the specific violation involved. This Court can find no facts in the case at bar that sufficiently distinguish it from the numerous other cases finding no <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> remedies in similar situations, especially in light of the Supreme Court's clear directive in <span class="Italic">Chilicky</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 961.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Just as in <span class="Italic">Lombardi</span>, Sarullo's status as a federal employee is central to his complaint, and the CSRA therefore precludes his claim. In addition to the initial bar announced in <span class="Italic">Bush v. Lucas</span> where the CSRA was held to preclude a<span class="Italic"> Bivens</span> claim for the abridgment of the plaintiff's First Amendment rights, our sister circuits have found <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claims to be similarly barred by the CSRA under a number of different circumstances<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Stephens v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 901 F.2d 1571, 1576-77 (11th Cir. 1990) (CSRA held to preclude plaintiff's <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claims for due process infractions)<span class="Italic">; Berrios v. Dep't. of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army,</span> 884 F.2d 28, 30-33 (1st Cir. 1989) (CSRA held to preempt plaintiff's defamation suit against former supervisors).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5398"></span>Sarullo argues that his claim for malicious prosecution does not fall within the scheme of remedies provided by the CSRA and that he is entitled to prosecute a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim because "[n]ot all personnel actions are covered by [the CSRA] ....&#8197;[C]ertain actions by supervisors against federal employees, such as wiretapping, warrantless searches, or uncompensated takings, would not be defined as 'personnel actions' within the statutory scheme." <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, 462 U.S. at 386 n.28, 103 S. Ct. 2404. Based on this dicta, Sarullo claims that the investigation initiated against him by his supervisors was not a "personnel action" within the statutory scheme and that the CSRA therefore does not provide a remedy. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is true that Sarullo's supervisors placed a tape recorder on their informant, an action that bears a similarity to wiretapping, and that such an activity did not itself constitute a "personnel action" within the CSRA's statutory scheme, Sarullo did not prosecute a statutory or Fourth Amendment damages claim because of the interception, but rather a claim for malicious prosecution. Under the facts of this case, the attempted tape recording was one of the actions that Sarullo's supervisors (clumsily) took during the investigation they conducted to determine whether Sarullo was engaged in illegal drug sales at the work place, but it was certainly not the central factor that led to his arrest and prosecution. As we have noted, no conversations relating to drugs were actually recorded during these alleged drug transactions. Despite the failed recording, Sarullo was nevertheless indicted and tried for possession and distribution of a controlled substance. Thus, although the recording itself does not qualify as a "personnel action" within the statutory scheme implemented by the CSRA, the recording constitutes only a small part of the overall investigation, and a botched one at that.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Sarullo's claim for malicious prosecution clearly arises in the employment context, in light of the broad rule of <span class="Italic">Chilicky</span> and its progeny, we conclude that the CSRA provides him with his sole remedy. For these reasons, we hold that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear Sarullo's <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim as such a claim was barred by the comprehensive statutory scheme provided in the CSRA, and should have dismissed the <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
