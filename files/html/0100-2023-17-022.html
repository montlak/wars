<p class="noindent">5 USC 7116(d) provides, in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]ssues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice under this section, but not under both procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent">[Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-269.html#sec8-269">Election/Preclusion of Remedies; Statutory Appeals; 5 USC 7116, 7121</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Any person may file a ULP charge. Section 7116(d) may be applied to an employee, a union, or both, concerning a particular action or course of conduct involving an unfair labor practice. FLRA may <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> determine whether, as a jurisdictional issue, a grievance or ULP charge was blocked through an earlier election. <span class="Italic">SPORT and Edwards AFB</span>, 71 FLRA 626, 627 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Warner Robins ALC and AFGE Local 987</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-146.html">71 FLRA 758</a> (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting) (<span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> consideration of election of remedies between EEO and grievance processes) (recon. den., <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-62.html">72 FLRA 319</a> (2021) (Chairman DuBester dissenting)).

Bragg CPAC</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-11.html">72 FLRA 74</a>, 75-76 (2021) (Member DuBester concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute, issues may be raised under a negotiated grievance procedure or under the statutory ULP procedure, but not under both procedures.[10] In order for a ULP charge to bar a grievance under &#x00A7; 7116(d), (1) the issue which is the subject matter of the grievance must be the same as the issue which is the subject matter of the ULP; (2) such issue must have been earlier raised under the ULP procedures; and (3) the selection of the ULP procedure must have been in the discretion of the aggrieved party.[11] The Authority will find that a ULP charge and a grievance involve the same issue where they: (1) arise from the same set of factual circumstances; and (2) advance substantially similar legal theories.[12] As relevant here, the Authority has also held that where a grievance is filed before a ULP charge, &#x00A7; 7116(d) does not bar resolution of the grievance, and an award finding the grievance barred is contrary to law.[13]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator considered whether the Union's <span class="Italic">earlier-filed</span> grievance was barred under &#x00A7; 7116(d) due to the <span class="Italic">later-filed</span> ULP charge. The Arbitrator found, and the record clearly indicates, that the grievance was filed on December 18, 2019, and that the ULP charge was filed on January 3, 2020. The Arbitrator also noted that the grievance and the ULP charge related to the bargaining process that "involve[d] changes" to the parties' agreement, and without further discussion or explanation, the Arbitrator applied &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute. Because the grievance was filed <span class="Italic">before</span> the ULP charge, a fact that both the Arbitrator and the Agency did not address, the grievance is not barred from consideration under &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute by the later-filed ULP charge.[18]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Arbitrator's conclusion that the later-filed ULP charge was a bar under &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute to arbitration of the earlier-filed grievance on the merits is contrary to law.[19] As the grievance was filed before the ULP charge, it is unnecessary to address whether the issues raised in the grievance and the charge are the same.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span id="page_1695"></span>An issue is "raised" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7116(d) at the time a grievance or a ULP charge is filed even if the grievance or charge is not adjudicated on the merits. <span class="Italic">DOD, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany and AFGE Local 2317</span>, 37 FLRA 1268, 1273 (1990). A union makes an election under &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute when it raises a matter as a ULP charge but the General Counsel does not issue a complaint. An arbitrator cannot then assume jurisdiction over the same matter. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 16 FLRA 648, 649 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA,</span> 63 FLRA 34, 37 (2008), noted that if an argument is made that a grievance constitutes an election, the party seeking to defend against the later-filed ULP charge must place into the record information about the scope of the grievance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that the determination of whether a ULP charge is barred by an earlier-filed grievance requires an examination of whether "the ULP charge arose from the same set of factual circumstances as the grievance and the theory advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Transp., FAA, Fort Worth, Tex</span>., 55 FLRA 951, 953 (1999) (quoting <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Army Fin. &#x0026; Accounting Ctr., Indianapolis, Ind</span>., 38 FLRA 1345, 1351 (1991). It is therefore possible that, even if the factual circumstances underlying the grievance and the ULP charge are the same, the theory is not. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216,</span> 49 FLRA 906, 914–15 (1994) (&#x00A7; 7116(d) not a bar where grievance was based on the just cause provision of parties' agreement and ULP alleged a statutory violation based on retaliation and discrimination).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Respondent claims that a grievance was filed before the complaint, <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 1, the record contains no information concerning the nature of the grievance. In this regard, the Respondent did not include a copy of the grievance with its exceptions and made no assertions concerning the specific facts or theories underlying the grievance. Without such support for its claim, it is impossible to assess whether the grievance concerns the same factual circumstances or legal theories as the ULP complaint. Where a party has provided no support for a claim that &#x00A7; 7116(d) bars access to a particular forum, the Authority has found that the claim constitutes a bare assertion and has declined to consider it. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Homeland Sec., United States Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., Port of Seattle, Seattle, Wash</span>., 60 FLRA 490, 492 n.7 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Respondent provides no support for its claim that the ULP involved issues identical to those raised in an earlier-filed grievance, its allegation constitutes a bare assertion. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">The underlying purpose of &#x00A7; 7116(d) is to prevent relitigation of the same issue in a different forum. In the context of a challenge to an arbitration award, the issue is generally whether the arbitrator correctly applied the Statute to permit or bar litigation of a grievance that is arguably duplicative of a ULP charge. FLRA offered a summary of its law governing the bar in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3475 and DHUD</span>, 55 FLRA 417, 418-19 (1999), involving a grieved suspension of a union official:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for a grievance to be barred from consideration under section 7116(d) of the Statute by an earlier-filed ULP charge: (1) the issue that is the subject matter of the grievance must be the same as the issue that is the subject matter of the ULP; (2) such issue must have been earlier raised under the ULP procedures; and (3) the selection of the ULP procedures must have been at the discretion of the aggrieved party. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, North</span> <span class="Italic">Chicago, Illinois and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2107, </span>52 FLRA 387, 392 (1996). In determining whether a grievance and a ULP charge involve the same issue, the Authority examines whether the ULP charge and the grievance arose from the same set of factual circumstances and whether the legal theories advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 392-93.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Pleasant was the same "aggrieved party" in both the grievances and ULP charges which were filed at her discretion</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute in this case that the ULP charges and the grievances were filed by both the Union and Pleasant.&#x2003;Furthermore, it is clear that the charges focus on the Agency's action in placing Pleasant on AWOL status and proposing a five-day suspension. The notice of arbitration, which identifies the nature of the grievances, also focuses on the same disciplinary action against Pleasant. Specifically, the grievances raise issue with the Agency's action in placing Pleasant on AWOL status and the decision to implement a five-day suspension. Although a ULP charge may be formally filed by a union, when it is drawn, in part, to allege specifically a violation of the grievant's rights, the Authority has concluded that the grievant was the aggrieved party in both the ULP charge and grievance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Army Finance,</span> 38 FLRA at 1353. Since the ULP charges in this case focus on actions taken against Pleasant as an individual employee, and the grievances relate to the same actions taken against Pleasant in her capacity as an employee, we find that Pleasant was the aggrieved employee in both the grievances and ULP charges. Furthermore, there is no showing that Pleasant was deprived of discretion in deciding which procedure to pursue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The same "legal theories" were involved in both the grievances and ULP charges</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted earlier, to determine whether a grievance and a ULP charge involve the same issue, the Authority examines whether the legal theories underlying each are substantially similar. Also, as noted earlier, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's underlying factual findings in assessing whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent. <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 156, </span>54 FLRA at 769-70. In this case, the Arbitrator found that the five-day suspension "presents no theories of violation not presented to FLRA in the unfair labor practice charge." As to the AWOL grievance, the Arbitrator found that the grievance "presents the same theory of violation under the same statute and the same provisions of the labor agreement presented in the prior unfair labor practice charges." Our review of the award in this case confirms that, in reaching his conclusions, the Arbitrator made a <span class="Italic">purely factual </span>assessment that the underlying theories were the same. These factual findings, to which we defer, fully support the Arbitrator's legal conclusion that the grievances were barred under section 7116(d).</p>
<p class="noindent">Through 2018, FLRA decisions allowed a degree of splitting of causes of action, e.g., a ULP for an allegation of contract repudiation and a grievance for a contract violation or failure to bargain a change in employment conditions. That flexibility was considerably constrained by <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Navy Region Mid-Atlantic and IBPO Local 800</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-104.html">70 FLRA 512</a>, 514-18 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (recon. den., 70 FLRA 860 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting)), <span class="Italic">post</span>. Earlier, <span class="Italic">VAMC N. Chicago and AFGE Local 2107</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v52/52-037.html">52 FLRA 387</a>, 392-93 (1996), referenced in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3475</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, determined there was no bar to a grievance claiming that the agency violated its contract when it failed to award performance awards despite a ULP charge that the agency unilaterally changed employment conditions by altering a past policy concerning performance awards. The issues (or theories of liability) differed in the grievance and ULP cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For a grievance to be barred under section 7116(d) by an earlier-filed ULP charge all the following requirements must met: (1) the issue which is the subject matter of the grievance must be the same as the issue which is the subject matter of the ULP; (2) such issue must have been earlier raised under the ULP procedures; and (3) the selection of the ULP procedures must have been in the discretion of the aggrieved party. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Department of the Army, Army</span> <span class="Italic">Finance and Accounting Center, Indianapolis, Indiana</span> <span class="Italic">and</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1411</span>, 38 FLRA 1345, 1350 (1991), <span class="Italic">review denied AFGE Local 1411 v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 176 (D.C. Cir. 1992). In determining whether the procedures involved the same issue, the Authority focuses on whether the ULP charge arose from the same set of factual circumstances as the grievance and whether the theories advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1350-51. Actions seeking the same remedy do not necessarily present the same issue or substantially similar theories under section 7116(d). <span class="Italic">Olam</span> <span class="Italic">Southwest Air Defense Sector (TAC), Point Arena Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Station, Point Arena, California</span>, 51 FLRA 797, 805 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the theories are not substantially similar. The theory advanced in support of the ULP charge was that the Agency implemented a change in conditions of employment without providing the Union with notice and an opportunity to bargain. The theory advanced in support of the grievance was that the Agency's denial of performance awards to the grievants upon reconsideration after settlement of the ULP was not fair and equitable as required by the parties' collective bargaining agreement. In addition, the Agency's claim that the grievance was barred because the grievance and the ULP sought the same remedy is without merit. Although performance awards were sought as remedies in both forums, each case advanced a different legal theory. <span class="Italic">See</span> 51 FLRA at 804-05 &#x0026; n.12. As the grievance did not present the same issue as the ULP, no basis is presented for finding that the Arbitrator's order is precluded by section 7116(d) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, McChord AFB and AFGE Local 1501,</span> 63 FLRA 677, 677-81 (2009), illustrates the ability to take a single action--a suspension that might have been mitigated to a greater degree had the employee not used a union representative to present a reply--and prosecute it as both a grievance (with a remedy for the employee) and a ULP case (with a remedy for the union):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employee's supervisor (the supervisor) served the employee with a notice of a proposed five-day suspension. The employee sought the representation of a Union steward (representative), who prepared a written response and submitted it to the supervisor. The supervisor refused the representative's efforts to arrange an oral response to the proposed suspension, indicating that he had read the written response and "that there was nothing more to discuss."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At a subsequent meeting, the supervisor notified the employee and the representative of his decision to suspend the employee for three days. The employee, supervisor, and representative provided conflicting testimony regarding the supervisor's explanation of his decision. The employee testified that the supervisor stated he had to deal with the employee "more harshly" than if the employee had written the response himself. <span id="page_1696"></span>The supervisor testified that he explained that a lack of contrition in the written response precluded lesser discipline. The representative testified that the supervisor explained to the employee that "things would have [been] easier on [the employee]" had he written his own response.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employee, through the representative, filed a grievance over his three-day suspension, which set forth his grievance as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I received a 3 day suspension for alleged dereliction of duty on November 7, 2006. My supervisor refused to accept my oral reply in addition to my written response to the proposed suspense with my representative. With in his letter to suspend, he stated I omitted facts and accepted no responsibility,...I just believe the punishment is more harsh than required to correct my mistake. Also, the comments my supervisor made to me were coercive and anti-union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievance alleged that the Respondent violated Article 6, Section 3 of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During a meeting held at Step 1 of the grievance procedure, the supervisor attempted to clarify the scope of the grievance and the meaning of the last quoted sentence of the grievance. The representative explained that the sentence regarding the supervisor's allegedly "coercive and anti-union" comments would be handled as a "separate matter." The Respondent's responses at Steps 1 and 2 of the grievance procedure made no mention of the supervisor's comments. The Respondent's Step 3 response specifically stated that the disputed comments would not be addressed in the grievance process because they concerned an "apparent dispute between the government and the union" and would more appropriately be dealt with separately. The Union did not invoke arbitration over the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge alleging that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by telling the employee that the discipline being imposed might have been less severe had he prepared his response without the involvement of the Union. In response, the Respondent filed a motion to dismiss the unfair labor practice (ULP) charge, contending that it is barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute because the factual predicate and legal theories for the ULP are the same as those for the grievance. The General Counsel opposed the motion to dismiss, contending that the ULP charge is not barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d) because the grievance and ULP do not involve the same aggrieved party and are not based on the same legal theory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(d) of the Statute provides that issues that may be raised under a negotiated grievance procedure or as a ULP may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under either procedure, but not under both procedures. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., Fort Worth, Tex.,</span> 55 FLRA 951, 953 (1999) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>). In order for a ULP charge to be barred under &#x00A7; 7116(d) by an earlier-filed grievance: (1) the issue that is the subject of the grievance must be the same as the issue that is the subject of the ULP; (2) such issue must have been raised earlier under the grievance procedure; and (3) the aggrieved party in both actions must be the same. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Medical Ctr., N. Chicago, Ill,</span> 52 FLRA 387, 392 (1996) (<span class="Italic">VAMC, North Chicago</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Judge did not err in finding that the grievance and the ULP charge involve different aggrieved parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Respondent's claim, the record supports the Judge's findings that the Union, not the employee, is the aggrieved party in the ULP. In this regard, the Judge found, and the Respondent does not dispute, that the ULP charge and complaint seek no relief for the employee. The Judge noted, in this regard, that the Respondent's brief provided no argument that the Union is not the aggrieved party in the ULP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the wording of the grievance, when the supervisor sought clarification of the reference to the supervisor's comments during the Step 1 meeting, the representative explained that the comments would be treated as a separate matter. Subsequently, the Respondent's responses at Steps 1 and 2 made no reference to the comments and the Respondent's Step 3 response stated that the comments would not be addressed in the grievance procedure because they concerned a separate "dispute between the government and the union." In circumstances such as these, it is appropriate to consider the actions of the parties and how those actions reflect the parties' understandings of the scope of the grievance. Here, those actions reflect that both parties understood that the issue regarding the supervisor's comments was not part of the grievance and that the dispute over those comments was to be treated separately.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also claims that, as the ULP alleges a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), it necessarily alleges a violation of the employee's individual right. The Respondent is mistaken, however, because alleged violations of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) can pertain to interference with the rights of a union as well as of an individual. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Def., Def. Contract Audit Agency, Northeastern Region, Lexington, Mass.,</span> 47 FLRA 1314, 1321 (1993) (alleged violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) based on individual right); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health and Human Services, SSA, Balt., Md,</span> 43 FLRA 318 (1991) (alleged violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) based on union right).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Judge noted, the ULP charge and complaint seek no relief for the employee. As the Judge noted further, the charge is not drawn, in any part, to allege a violation of the individual's rights regarding the disciplinary action brought against him. Instead, the sole basis for the alleged violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) is the supervisor's comments regarding the employee's reliance on the representative in preparing the written response.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we deny the Respondent's exception to the Judge's determination that the aggrieved parties in the ULP and the grievance are not the same.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The grievance and ULP charge have different legal predicates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determination of whether a ULP is barred by an earlier-filed grievance requires examining whether "the ULP charge arose from the same set of factual circumstances as the grievance and the theory advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Army Finance &#x0026; Accounting Ctr., Indianapolis, Ind.,</span> 38 FLRA 1345, 1351 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Army Finance</span>), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied sub nom. AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1411 v. FLRA,</span> 960 F.2d 176, 177-78 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Only if both requirements are satisfied is a subsequent ULP charge barred by a former grievance. <span class="Italic">OLAM Southwest Air Def. Sector (TAC) Point Arena Air Force Station, Point Arena, Cal.,</span> 51 FLRA 797, 801-02 (1996) (<span class="Italic">OLAM</span>) and cases cited therein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the ULP and the earlier-filed grievance arose from the same factual circumstances. However, they rest on different legal theories. Specifically, the issue in the grievance is whether the employees' suspension violated Article 6, Section 3 of the agreement while the ULP alleges that the supervisor's statements interfered with, restrained or coerced an employee in violation of &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute. As the grievance alleges a violation of the contract while the ULP alleges a violation of the Statute, the legal theories are not the same. In this regard, the Authority has held, in a variety of circumstances, that a ULP alleging a violation of the Statute raises a sufficiently distinct theory from a grievance alleging a violation of a contract even when both matters arise from the same set of facts. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. United States Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C,</span> 59 FLRA 112, 115 (2003), and cases cited therein. For example, in <span class="Italic">VAMC, North Chicago,</span> the Authority found that a ULP charge alleging that the agency implemented a policy denying cash performance awards without providing the union with notice and an opportunity to bargain was not barred by a prior grievance alleging that the agency's denial of performance awards violated the collective bargaining agreement. 52 FLRA at 392-93. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">AFGE, National Council of EEOC Locals, No. 216,</span> 49 FLRA 906, 914 (1994), the Authority found no bar where the ULP charge alleged retaliation against the grievant for her union activity, and the grievance contended that there was no support for her suspension. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">OLAM,</span> the Authority found no bar where the grievance sought to establish preferential treatment of employees and the ULP sought to establish the agency's statutory failure to bargain over a change in working conditions. 51 FLRA at 803.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its opposition, the Respondent contends that &#x00A7; 7116(d) bars the ULP because the grievance is based on a violation of the Statute. In this regard, the Respondent contends that the grievance's reference to the supervisor's "coercive and anti-union" comments "intimates a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1)." The Respondent contends further that the Union's failure to cite Article 4, Section 8(d) of the agreement, which would have directly addressed the supervisor's comments, further supports the argument that the grievance raised a statutory violation instead of contractual violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's contentions are without merit. As the Judge found, the parties' conduct during the grievance procedure indicates that the grievance involved only the disciplinary action and not the disputed comments. Therefore, there was no reason for the Union to have cited a contractual provision addressing the comments. Moreover, even if the Union did not base the grievance on the contract provision most relevant to disciplinary actions, the fact remains that the grievance was expressly based on the contract. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Def., United States Army Reserve Personnel Command, St. Louis, Mo.,</span> 55 FLRA 1309, 1313, n.5 (ULP based on the Statute not barred by earlier-filed grievance based on a contract provision even if the contract provision is not a "plausible basis" for the grievance). As such, the grievance was based on a different legal theory from the ULP.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;For the same reason, the Authority rejects the Respondent's contention that after filing the grievance, the representative attempted to withdraw the statutory issue from the grievance. As discussed above, the Authority concludes that the grievance raised no statutory issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the facts and theories underlying a ULP charge and grievance are alike, <span id="page_1697"></span>a binding election may preclude the later-filed action. FLRA explained in <span class="Italic">VA, VAMC, Newington and NAGE Local R1-109</span>, 36 FLRA 441, 444-46 (1990), involving initial resort to the ULP procedure on the basis of a theory of contract repudiation (and implicit contract violations) followed by a grievance based on a theory of contract violation involved in the reassignment of an employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(d) effectively provides that when, in the discretion of an aggrieved party, an issue has been raised as an unfair labor practice, the issue may not subsequently be raised as a grievance....&#8197;The elements of section 7116(d) that must attach in order for a grievance to be precluded are: (1) the issue which is the subject matter of the grievance is the same as the issue which is the subject matter of the unfair labor practice; (2) such issue was earlier raised under the unfair labor practice procedures; and (3) the selection of the unfair labor practice procedures was in the discretion of the aggrieved party....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's contention that the ULP issue of whether the Activity repudiated the agreement in violation of section 7116(d) of the Statute is separate and distinct from the grievance issue of whether the Activity violated provisions of the agreement. We find that the Arbitrator correctly applied section 7116(d) in determining that the issues in the ULP charge and the grievance were the same because they both alleged that the Activity's actions in reassigning DeWayne violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement....</p>

Therefore, we must return to the straight-forward interpretation of the Statute as given to us by Congress.[28]</p>

For too long, that thinking has permitted parties to manipulate Title V as if it were a smorgasbord of unlimited options.

<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that the language of &#x00A7; 7116(d) is modeled after, though not mirroring, &#x00A7; 19(d) of the 1969 Executive Order 11491, which earlier provided for federal labor management relations in federal service:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">When the issue in a complaint of an alleged violation of paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (4) of this section is subject to an established grievance or appeals procedure, that procedure is the exclusive procedure for resolving the complaint. All other complaints of alleged violations of this section initiated by an employee, an agency, or a labor organization, that cannot be resolved by the parties, shall be filed with the Assistant Secretary.[30]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With the enactment of the Statute, Congress made &#x00A7; 7116(d) even more pointed:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Issues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised as [ULPs] prohibited under this section. Except for matters wherein, under [&#x00A7;] 7121(e) and (f) of this title, an employee has an option of using the negotiated grievance procedure or an appeals procedure, issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as a [ULP] under this section, but not under both procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By the plain language of the Statute, Congress clearly intended to discourage forum shopping, or the classic "two bites at the apple."[32] The Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">United States Department of Defense, Defense Commissary Agency</span> and its like are contrary to these principles.[33]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;69 FLRA 379, 381 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The case now before the Authority perfectly illustrates what Congress intended to avoid when it enacted &#x00A7; 7116(d). As discussed above, the Agency notified the exclusive representative in 2011 of its intent to implement a new Agency regulation, the instruction. Their discussions <span id="page_1698"></span>may not have been fruitful; however, the Agency did provide the Union an opportunity to bargain. But in October of 2012, the Union alleged violations of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5) for failing to properly negotiate over the instruction before implementation:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">By letter to the Union,...the Employer, Commander Navy Region, Mid-Atlantic Directorate,...[i]nformed "[a]ll" that the bargaining obligation regarding [the] [i]mplementation of CNIC 5530.14 had been met and the Directorate <span class="Italic">was going to implement</span> the entire instruction effective immediately....There are a number of issues in the instruction including taking and passing a physical and PAT test that may result in termination if the employees in our bargaining unit fail, that are changes in the conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The charges were dismissed.&#x2003;Additional ULP charges, citing the same statutory provisions and interpretations, were filed and dismissed in 2013, 2014, and 2015. The only difference was <span class="Italic">where</span> the policy was implemented. Then, in 2016, the Union tried something different. This time, the Union filed a grievance involving the same issue, stating:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The [U]nion alleges that [the Agency] is in violation for implementing a change in working condition, a condition of employment, a [PAT] for all bargaining[-]unit employees of Commander, Navy Region Mid-Atlantic Region without bargaining. The implementation of this [PAT] is part of...CNIC 5530.14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is obvious that the issues presented in both the earlier-filed ULP charges and the instant grievance are the same. Even the Arbitrator could find no distinction between the 2014 and 2015 ULP charges and the grievance, stating that the grievance concerned "the identical refusal to bargain claim that was raised in the Union's unsuccessful [2014 and 2015] ULP charge[s]." The issue in all of these claims was that the Agency announced and then implemented an Agency regulation, which contained an agility test for its shore-bound security police officers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union now argues that the issue here differs from those in the earlier-filed ULP charges because the grievance alleges that the Agency committed a contractual violation when it "required two...employees [at the Naval Station Norfolk] to complete the PAT without bargaining or the proper medical screening." The Arbitrator found, and we agree, that this argument is no different in any meaningful respect than the arguments made in the earlier-filed ULP charges by the Union because the contractual claim is a derivative of the statutory claim. Specifically, the 2015 ULP charge in Case No. WA-CA-15-0481 arose from the same announcement that the Agency was implementing the PAT at the Sewells Point Police Precinct. While the Union's earlier-filed ULP charges make no mention of contractual bargaining rights, the issues are nonetheless substantially similar to the alleged violation of the parties' agreement.[41] We cannot simply turn a blind eye when parties, through carefully crafted pleadings, try to avoid the &#x00A7; 7116(d) bar in order to get two bites of the proverbial apple. Instead, we return to the plain language of the Statute and the intent of Congress, and hold that &#x00A7; 7116(d) bars a later-filed grievance when the grievance raises issues which are substantially similar to those raised in an earlier-filed ULP.[42]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that &#x00A7; 7116(d) does not apply where the contractual obligation in the agreement "[does] not mirror language within the Statute."[43] We disagree. In <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association v. FLRA</span>, the Court specifically noted that "Congress...left the route selection to the discretion of the aggrieved party, while at the same time mandating that selection of one route precluded the use of the other."[44] Furthermore, the Authority does not require that the theories advanced in the ULP charge and the grievance to be <span class="Italic">identical</span>.[45] Instead, the Authority found that &#x00A7; 7116(d) bars the grievance when the theories advanced in the ULP charge and the grievance are <span class="Italic">substantially similar</span>.[46] Here, the Arbitrator found that the Union's contractual claim was derived from its statutory claim raised in its unsuccessful ULP charges. Thus, given the derivative nature of the contractual bargaining obligation from the statutory bargaining obligation, we find that &#x00A7; 7116(d) bars the grievance.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union argues that &#x00A7; 7116(d) does not apply because its collective bargaining agreement with the Agency was not implemented until July 2013. We agree that &#x00A7; 7116(d) would not apply where there is no negotiated grievance procedure.[49] However, this is not the case here because the Union filed substantially similar ULP charges after July 2013, in 2014 and 2015.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Because the Union made the choice to file the same basic issue in earlier-filed ULP charges, the grievance which was filed in 2016 is barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute.[50] Accordingly, we set aside the award because the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law in concluding that &#x00A7; 7116(d) does not bar the grievance in this case.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrator John C.&#x2003;Alfano found that &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) barred a Union-filed grievance because the Union had previously filed an unfair-labor-practice (ULP) charge over the same issue. We deny all exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency is a federal correctional institution.&#x2003;All Agency employees in the Union's bargaining unit are "[c]orrectional [w]orkers," but their regular positions are designated as either "custody" or "non-custody." The Agency would occasionally assign non-custody employees to work certain custody posts, such as when those posts were unstaffed during training periods or emergencies--a practice known as "augmentation." On June 1, 2016, the Agency notified the Union that, because of vacancies in custody posts caused by unfilled positions or employees using leave, the Agency would implement a policy of regularly assigning non-custody employees to custody posts (the augmentation policy).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union sought to bargain over the impact and implementation of the augmentation policy, but the Agency notified the Union that it had no duty to bargain because the matter was covered by the parties' collective-bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 17, 2016, the Union filed a ULP charge against the Agency with the Federal Labor Relations Authority's Washington Regional Director (RD). The charge alleged that the Agency violated the Statute and the parties' agreement by refusing to bargain over implementation of the augmentation policy. Shortly thereafter, the Union requested to withdraw the ULP charge, and the RD granted the Union's request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ten days after the Union withdrew the ULP charge, on August 15, 2016, the Agency implemented the augmentation policy. The Union then filed a grievance alleging that the Agency's failure to bargain and its implementation of the augmentation policy violated the Statute and the parties' agreement. The grievance sought, in part, a remedy that required the Agency to stop augmentation until the parties completed bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievance went to arbitration, where the Arbitrator framed the issues, in relevant part, as whether: (1) the grievance was arbitrable, and (2) the Agency violated the parties' agreement when it implemented the augmentation policy on August 15, 2016.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued that the grievance was not arbitrable because the earlier-filed ULP charge barred the grievance under &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute. The Arbitrator found that the ULP charge and the grievance made the "same claims" and that both arose from the Agency's notice of its intent to implement the augmentation policy and the Agency's refusal to bargain. For example, the Arbitrator found that both the ULP charge and the grievance cited the day on which the Agency first notified the Union of its intent to implement the augmentation policy as the initial date of the alleged violations, used nearly identical wording, contained the same "essential claims," and "would have resulted in the same relief if granted." Thus, the Arbitrator concluded that &#x00A7; 7116(d) barred the grievance and he made no findings regarding the grievance's merits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 19, 2018, the Union filed exceptions to the Arbitrator's award, <span id="page_1699"></span>and on February 23, 2018, the Agency filed an opposition to those exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator erroneously found that the earlier-filed ULP charge barred all of the claims in the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute, issues may be raised under a negotiated grievance procedure or under the statutory ULP procedure, but not under both procedures. As relevant here, for an earlier-filed ULP charge to preclude a grievance under &#x00A7; 7116(d), the ULP charge and the grievance must concern the same issue.[10] To determine whether the issues involved in a ULP charge and a grievance are the same, the Authority examines whether: (1) the ULP charge and the grievance arose from the same set of factual circumstances, and (2) the theories advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance were "substantially similar."[11] As emphasized in Navy, &#x00A7; 7116(d) bars a later-filed grievance where the theories advanced in an earlier-filed ULP charge are "<span class="Italic">substantially similar</span>"--it does not require that the theories "be <span class="Italic">identical</span>."[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;In addition, the issue must have been earlier raised under the ULP procedures, and the selection of the ULP procedures must have been in the discretion of the aggrieved party. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Air Eng'g Station, Lakehurst, N.J</span>., 64 FLRA 1110, 1111 (2010) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of HHS, Indian Health Serv., Alaska Area Native Health Servs., Anchorage, Alaska</span>, 56 FLRA 535, 538 (2000)). Here, the Union's exception challenges only the Arbitrator's finding that the ULP charge and the grievance concerned the same issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;Navy, 70 FLRA at 514 (emphasis omitted) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Army Fin. &#x0026; Accounting Ctr., Indianapolis, Ind</span>., 38 FLRA 1345, 1351 (1991), <span class="Italic">pet. for review denied sub nom, AFGE, Local 1411 v.

<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;70 FLRA at 517.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, the Authority found that a grievance's contractual claims were not "different in any meaningful respect" from a ULP charge's statutory claims and, therefore, &#x00A7; 7116(d) barred the grievance. Here, the Union argues that the ULP charge and the grievance involved different theories because the ULP charge concerned the Agency's failure to bargain over implementation of the augmentation policy and the grievance concerned contractual violations that arose from the Agency's decision to implement without having bargained. But the Arbitrator found that the charge and the grievance both arose from the Agency's decision to implement the augmentation policy without bargaining, were "essentially" the same, and sought the same relief. Accordingly, we find that the theories advanced in support of both claims are "substantially similar,"[16] and the Arbitrator did not err in concluding that the ULP charge and the grievance concern the same issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., Navy</span>, 70 FLRA at 516-17.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Union is mistaken that, because it withdrew the ULP charge, it had a choice of filing either a ULP charge or a grievance after the Agency implemented the augmentation policy. The Authority has consistently held that an issue is raised for the purposes of &#x00A7; 7116(d) when a ULP charge is filed, even if that charge is withdrawn before adjudication on the merits.[18] Thus, when the Union elected to file the ULP charge, it foreclosed its ability to file a grievance later over the same issue.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, the Union has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to law. Additionally, because the Arbitrator correctly found that &#x00A7; 7116(d) barred the grievance, he did not exceed his authority by failing to resolve whether the Agency violated the parties' agreement.[21]</p>

The litigation began with a ULP charging bad faith bargaining over negotiations that started in 2015 for a new term agreement. The ULP was filed in 2017. Matters evolved, or deteriorated, over a series of hit-and-miss attempts to resume negotiations, mediation, and attempts at impasse resolution, coupled with various statutory information requests over the next year. The union filed several grievances in 2018 challenging the agency's approach to bargaining and its failure to respond properly to some information requests. Several arbitrators separately found that the agency failed properly to bargain and respond to information requests. On exceptions to those awards, FLRA determined the arbitrators lacked jurisdiction over the grievances because the ULP charge and the grievances challenged the same thing: bad faith bargaining over time and through several unsuccessful attempts to continue and conclude bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case concerns a jurisdictional question under the Statute that we consider <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>. Under &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute, a ULP charge bars a later-filed grievance if the ULP charge and the grievance involve the same issue. The Authority has held that a ULP charge and a grievance involve the same issue where they: (1) arise from the same set of factual circumstances, and (2) advance substantially similar legal theories.[34] In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Navy Region Mid-Atlantic, Norfolk, Virginia</span> (<span class="Italic">Navy</span>), the Authority clarified that the legal theories in a ULP charge and grievance need not "be identical" for the &#x00A7; 7116(d) bar to apply.[35]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">First, the Union's ULP charge and grievances arise from the same set of factual circumstances--specifically, the parties' attempt to negotiate a new term agreement. The Union filed the ULP charge when the Agency disapproved the 2016 Panel order establishing ground rules for the term agreement, and the Union filed its four grievances during substantive negotiations of that term agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Union's subsequent grievances concerned ongoing negotiations, including events that had not yet occurred at the time that the Union filed the ULP, &#x00A7; 7116(d) does not require precise factual parity. The Authority has repeatedly stated that a ULP and later-filed grievance need arise only "from the same set of factual circumstances."[38] Generally, negotiations over a collective-bargaining agreement constitute a single set of factual circumstances.[39] This is particularly relevant here, where with each grievance, the Union presented evidence from a previous filing to allege, under the totality of the circumstances, that the Agency bargained in bad faith.[40] </p>

As an example, the filing of a grievance should normally be treated as one "set" of factual circumstances, even though it consists of several discrete acts, such as submitting a formal written complaint; an agency official reviewing the complaint; the grievance proceeding to step two; a higher-level agency official reviewing the complaint; a meeting; the grievance proceeding to step three; and so on.

Member Kiko notes that the dissent would have the Authority treat each action that occurs during the course of a negotiation as inherently independent. The dissent's reasoning would render &#x00A7; 7116(d) meaningless as no two actions could ever constitute a "set of factual circumstances" by virtue of the passage of time--that is, one event having occurred after the other. <span class="Italic">See</span> Dissent at 14-16. To the extent that either the concurrence or dissent rely on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 72 FLRA 80, 82 (2021) (<span class="Italic">NLRB</span>) (Member Abbott dissenting), that case is distinguishable as it presented two sets of factual circumstances: one set involved the union's 2018 request for fiscal year 2018 budgetary materials to prepare for a September 2018 meeting; the other set involved a <span class="Italic">different</span> request, in a <span class="Italic">different</span> year, for <span class="Italic">different</span> budgetary information, to prepare for a <span class="Italic">different</span> <span id="page_1700"></span>meeting. <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 72 FLRA at 82. <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> did not involve a course of alleged bad-faith bargaining during a single collective-bargaining negotiation. Moreover, unlike here, the resolution of the earlier-filed ULP charge in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> could not have rendered the subsequent grievance effectively moot, because the ULP charge and grievance were entirely independent. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7)(B) (stating that if an agency has engaged in a ULP, then the Authority may issue an order "requiring the parties to renegotiate a collective[-]bargaining agreement...and requiring that the agreement, as amended, be given <span class="Italic">retroactive</span> effect" (emphasis added)). Member Abbott's claim that <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> is indistinguishable from <span class="Italic">Navy</span> is confounding given that his NLRB dissent did not even purport to apply Navy.

<p class="noindent-2">[40]&#x2003;Member Kiko notes that the evidence plainly shows that the Union continuously relied on facts occurring <span class="Italic">throughout</span> the negotiations to argue that the Agency acted in bad faith. <span class="Italic">See</span> AR-5506, Attach. 3, Union Post-Hr'g Br. at 25 (The Agency "acted in bad faith by <span class="Italic">repeatedly</span> and unlawfully refusing to bargain over new dates for the exchange of initial bargaining proposals [and] by insisting on implementing the terms of the [2016] Panel [o]rder...." (emphasis added)); AR-5549, Union Post-Hr'g Br. at 8 ("The evidence in the record demonstrates that [the Agency] engaged in bad[-]faith bargaining <span class="Italic">throughout</span> the bargaining of the parties' successor term agreement...."

(emphasis added)); AR-5567, Union Post-Hr'g Br. at 30 ("[T]he Agency's actions from the <span class="Italic">inception</span> of bargaining through the Panel-imposed impasse proceedings overwhelmingly demonstrate that [the Agency] repeatedly acted in bad faith...." (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's frequent reliance on facts that occurred throughout the bargaining process shows that each grievance was dependent on the circumstances that came before it. Even in the Union's final grievance and its related exceptions, it recapped the entire "[h]istory of the [p]arties' [t]erm [c]ontract [n]egotiations," starting with the opening of ground-rules negotiations and including the 2016 Panel order. Additionally, the Union acknowledged in its very first grievance that the resolution of the ULP charge would affect substantive term bargaining. This establishes that <span class="Italic">all</span> of the Union's grievance claims--whether related to ground rules, substantive bargaining, or information requests--emanate from the Agency's alleged refusal to comply with the 2016 Panel order concerning ground rules.[44] For these reasons, we find that the ULP charge and grievances arise from the same set of factual circumstances.[45]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[44]&#x2003;Member Kiko is persuaded that all the Union's filings arise from the same set of factual circumstances because resolution of the Union's ULP could, conceivably, moot the subsequent grievances. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7)(B). Viewing collective-bargaining negotiations as always involving a series of individual and discrete facts, as the dissent does, leads to the type of absurd results that brought this series of disputes to the Authority: one party splitting several related ULP claims between the FLRA forum and the grievance forum, and within the grievance forum, between three different arbitrators. By claim splitting, the Union has circumvented the procedures put in place that would have permitted it to amend its ULP charge. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.9 ("Before the issuance of a complaint, the Charging Party may amend the charge under the requirements set forth in &#x00A7; 2423.6."); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Educ</span>., 72 FLRA 203, 203 n.6 (2021) ("The FLRA was without a General Counsel, the official authorized to prosecute ULP charges, from November 2017 to March 2021."). In Member Kiko's opinion, the Union's actions evidence an attempt to avoid the consequence of one decisionmaker finding against it. The Authority should not permit any party to employ such a claim-splitting tactic as it undermines the requirement of an effective and efficient government. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(b); <span class="Italic">see also Vanover v. NCO Fin. Servs., Inc</span>., 857 F.3d 833, 841 (11th Cir. 2017) ("By spreading claims around in multiple lawsuits in other courts or before other judges, parties waste scarce judicial resources and undermine the efficient and comprehensive disposition of cases."

<p class="noindent-1">Second, the ULP charge and later-filed grievances advance substantially similar legal theories. <span class="Italic">All</span> of the Union's filings allege that the Agency engaged in bad-faith bargaining in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8). The ULP charge alleged the Agency "engaged in bad[-]faith bargaining by...refusing to comply" with the 2016 Panel order establishing ground rules for the new term agreement. And the Union alleged in all of its grievances that the Agency engaged in bad-faith bargaining while negotiating the new term agreement. Moreover, the Union requested, in its second and third grievance, that the Agency "comply with [the eighteen]-week bargaining schedule" in the 2016 Panel order. Additionally the Union, in its last grievance, claimed that the Agency consistently delayed term bargaining--an allegation the Union also raised in its ULP charge. Therefore, the Union's grievance allegations involving bad-faith negotiations are substantially similar to its ULP-charge allegations.[52]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[52]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See AFGE</span>, 70 FLRA at 743 (finding &#x00A7; 7116(d) barred the grievance because the ULP charge and the grievance "arose from the [a]gency's decision to implement the augmentation policy without bargaining"). The dissent asserts that "even if one of the grievances had alleged the same legal claim set forth in the ULP, &#x00A7; 7116(d) would properly apply to bar only that claim from the arbitrator's consideration." Dissent at 16-17. But that is how this decision applies &#x00A7; 7116(d); we have found that each issue raised by the Union in a later-filed grievance, and considered by an Arbitrator, involved the same issue from the earlier-filed ULP. To the extent that the dissent suggests that we should remand all four awards in order to allow the Arbitrators to decide claims from the grievances that the Arbitrators already elected not to address, the dissent provides no support for such a result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the ULP charge and the grievances arise from the same set of factual circumstances and advance substantially similar legal theories, the grievances are barred under &#x00A7; 7116(d).[53] Accordingly, we set aside the Arbitrators' awards.</p>

<p class="noindent">Having sorted out the "substantial similarity" approach to the matter of ULP/grievance elections, FLRA complicated an already complex matter when it decided that distinct statutory violations could be distinctly pursued under a ULP and a grievance arising from the same operative events. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Educ. and AFGE Council 252</span>, 71 FLRA 516, 518-19 (2020) (Member DuBester concurring), following the failure to bargain a successor contract, the agency unilaterally implemented its version of the contract. The union filed a ULP charging a bargaining failure under 5 USC 7116(a)(1) and 5), and the ULP was closely followed in time by a grievance asserting the agency violated 5 USC 7114(c) when it failed to submit the contract to agency head review so as to deny the union the opportunity to challenge the agreement through a negotiability appeal. Considering both <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-104.html">70 FLRA 512</a> (2018), and <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 420</span>, 70 FLRA 742 (2018), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> FLRA determined that both challenges could proceed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to law[23] because the grievance is barred under &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute. Specifically, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator ignored &#x00A7; 7116(d), and recent Authority decisions, when he suspended the grievance instead of dismissing it.[25]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings unless the excepting party establishes that they are nonfacts. E.g., <span class="Italic">U.S. DOD, U.S. Marine Corps, Air Ground Combat Center, Twentynine Palms, Cal</span>., 71 FLRA 173, 174 n.8 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Minot Air Force Base, N.D</span>., 71 FLRA 188, 189-90 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting) (<span class="Italic">Air Force</span>) ("the Authority has previously reviewed an arbitrator's conclusion as to whether a ULP charge and a grievance involved similar factual circumstances as a question of law").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;Member Abbott would like to take this opportunity to <span id="page_1701"></span>dissuade arbitrators from the belief that they have more than two options when addressing a motion to dismiss. Arbitrators may grant the motion or they may deny the motion. However, they do not have the option to "suspend" (or to place in abeyance) a grievance pending the outcome of another matter. The Arbitrator's treatment of the grievance in this case is puzzling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute, issues may be raised under a negotiated grievance procedure or under the statutory ULP procedure, but not under both procedures.[26] For an earlier-filed ULP charge to preclude a grievance under &#x00A7; 7116(d), the ULP charge and the grievance must concern the same issue.[27] To determine whether the issues involved in a ULP charge and a grievance are the same, the Authority examines whether: (1) the ULP charge and the grievance arose from the same set of factual circumstances, and (2) the theories advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance were substantially similar.[28] The Authority's recent decisions in <span class="Italic">Navy</span>[29] and <span class="Italic">Local 420</span>,[30] which the Agency relies on to support its argument, clarify when theories are "substantially similar."</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, the Authority made clear that it does not require the theories advanced in an earlier-filed ULP charge be "identical" to those advanced in a later-filed grievance, just "substantially similar."[31] In that case, the Authority found that &#x00A7; 7116(d) barred a grievance where the contractual claim was "a derivative of" the statutory claim and that the issues in the grievance did not differ "in any meaningful respect" from the issues in the earlier-filed ULP charge.[32] Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Local 420</span>, the Authority found that &#x00A7; 7116(d) barred a grievance where an earlier-filed ULP charge and grievance "both arose from the [a]gency's decision to implement [an] augmentation policy without bargaining."[33] In both cases, the Authority rejected as contrary to the intent and purpose of &#x00A7; 7116(d) the union's attempt to parse into different forums (grievance and ULP) the agency's contractual duty to bargain and the agency's statutory duty to bargain.[34]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">However, the circumstances of this case are distinguishable. Here, the arguments the Union raises in its grievance are not "derivative of" those presented in the earlier-filed ULP charge.[35] While the ULP charge alleges that the Agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute by failing to negotiate and bargain in good faith when it refused the Union's request to negotiate and unilaterally implemented the proposed CBA, the gravamen of the grievance is whether the Agency violated &#x00A7; 7114(c)(1) of the Statute and the parties' 2013 CBA when it failed to submit the proposed CBA for Agency-head review. Thus, the grievance concerns the parties' 2013 CBA and <span class="Italic">&#x00A7; 7114(c)(1)</span>, not &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5)--the issue in the ULP charge. We do not agree with the Agency that these legal issues are "essentially the same" because they concern two separate statutory claims, not just the Agency's statutory and contractual duties to bargain. Consequently, unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, and contrary to the Agency's assertions, the allegations in the Union's grievance <span class="Italic">do</span> differ in a meaningful way from the allegations in the earlier-filed ULP charge. Therefore, we find that the legal theories advanced in the ULP charge and the grievance are not substantially similar and, therefore, that &#x00A7; 7116(d) does not bar the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[35]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 70 FLRA at 516.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found the language of the ULP charge and the grievance "'sufficiently similar' to suggest that the two are duplicative" and may not be pursued "concurrently." He also found the Agency's argument that the ULP charge and grievance could not exist simultaneously in different forums to be "supportable." Yet, the Arbitrator determined these findings did not warrant dismissal of the grievance, and concluded instead (without elaboration) that they justified suspending the grievance pending resolution of the ULP charge. However, given our determination that the grievance is not barred under &#x00A7; 7116(d), and that the Arbitrator's findings in that respect were erroneous, the Arbitrator was not required to dismiss or "suspend" the grievance pending the outcome of a separate matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that a remand of this matter is appropriate. In order to promote the prompt and efficient resolution of this dispute, we remand this case to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for a determination on the outstanding procedural and substantive issues. The parties should request that the Arbitrator determine, in accordance with this decision: (1) whether the 2013 or 2018 agreement is in effect; (2) based on that determination, whether the Union's grievance was timely filed; (3) whether the Agency was obligated, by contract or statute, to submit the 2018 agreement for Agency-head review under &#x00A7; 7114(c)(1) of the Statute; and (4) if so, what is the appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">A ULP charge, later withdrawn, protesting unilateral modification of official time allocations, precluded a later grievance and arbitration concerning the same change, <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 1594</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-154.html">71 FLRA 785</a>, 785-87 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting), with the distinction argued that the legal argument in the ULP rested principally on statute, the grievance on the contract:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a charge against the Agency on November 1, 2016, alleging that the Agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), and (5) when it "unilaterally removed [the Local President's] official time" without notice and bargaining. While the Union alleged that the act was retaliatory in nature, it also claimed that the act "violates a long&#8209;term past practice...allowing [the Local President] to work full&#8209;time...performing representational duties...which could only by changed through negotiations."[5] In the charge, the Union sought a "temporary restraining order against removing official time [from the Local President]," a "<span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy order [requiring the Agency] to bargain," and a posting.</p>

On the jurisdictional issue, the Arbitrator found that the Union's earlier&#8209;filed charge was "claiming retaliation against the Union by removing [the Local President] from her 100 [percent official time]," and the grievance "concerned the revocation and removal of the [Local President's official time], as well as, related violations of [the parties' agreement]." The Arbitrator concluded that the grievance was not barred because the ULP and the grievance were "representative of different factual theories." The Arbitrator sustained the grievance on the merits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7116(d) because the Union's earlier&#8209;filed ULP charge bars the grievance. An earlier&#8209;filed ULP charge bars a grievance under &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute if the ULP charge and the grievance involve the same issue.[14] In this regard, the Authority has held that an issue is raised for the purposes of &#x00A7; 7116(d) when a ULP charge is filed, even if it is withdrawn before adjudication on the merits.[15] Therefore, the Union's November 2016 ULP charge is considered for the purposes of &#x00A7; 7116(d) even though it was withdrawn.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will find that a ULP charge and a grievance involve the same issue where they: (1) arise from the same set of factual circumstances, and (2) advance substantially similar legal theories.[17] Legal theories do not need to be identical--just substantially similar--in order for the &#x00A7; 7116(d) bar to apply.[18] Here, both criteria are fulfilled. First, the earlier&#8209;filed charge and the grievance both arise from, reference, and <span id="page_1702"></span>argue the same set of factual circumstances--the Agency's removal of the Local President from 100 percent official time.[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Second, the earlier&#8209;filed ULP and the grievance also both advance substantially similar legal theories. In fact, the Union concedes that the only distinction between the ULP and the grievance is that the ULP alleged statutory violations and the grievance alleges contractual violations.[20] As the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, "[w]e cannot simply turn a blind eye when parties, through carefully crafted pleadings, try to avoid the &#x00A7; 7116(d) bar in order to get two bites of the proverbial apple."[21] Furthermore, the Authority has found that an earlier&#8209;filed ULP charge barred a grievance where substantially similar legal theories were based on the same Agency action and sought the same remedies.[22]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the earlier&#8209;filed ULP charge and the grievance both challenge the removal of the Local President's 100 percent official time and seek restoration of the Local President's 100 percent official time and a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> as remedies. Therefore, we find that the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law in finding that the grievance was not barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d), because the earlier&#8209;filed ULP and the grievance involve substantially similar issues. Accordingly, we vacate the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">For &#x00A7; 7116(d) to apply, the election between the ULP and the grievance must have been in the discretion of the same party aggrieved in the grievance. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 170 and DOD, DCMA Dist.
