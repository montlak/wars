<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-160"><span class="space">d.</span> Improper Directive; Command Influence</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gragg v. Air Force</span>, 13 MSPR 296, 299, 11 MSPB 546 (1982) [discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-15-162.html#sec8-161">Federal Labor Law Policy; Collective Bargaining Contract</a>"], determined, following <span class="Italic">Walker v. Birmingham,</span> 388 U.S. 307 (1967), that individuals do not have "the unfettered right to disregard a law, rule or regulation merely because substantial reason exists regarding the constitutionality or validity of that law, rule or regulation and that, as a result, an employee must follow an agency's order while taking steps to challenge the ultimate validity of the order (assuming that the order would not place the employee in a clearly dangerous situation). <span class="Italic">Gragg</span> returned to the Board in <span class="Italic">Gragg v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 24 MSPR 506 (1984), when Gragg was again fired (his prior removal was mitigated to a suspension) after he disobeyed the same order. Between the time of the first and second decisions, the Federal Labor Relations Authority determined, in an order enforced in circuit court, that the basis for the order (a change in agency policy) was imposed in violation of federal labor laws requiring negotiation and that the change was an unfair labor practice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">FLRA v. U.S. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 735 F.2d 1513 (D.C. Cir. 1984). In <span class="Italic">Gragg II,</span> the Board set aside the dismissal. It reasoned that the charge was that Gragg failed to obey a proper order (this concerned an agency requirement that employees shave facial hair when they were required to use respirators), and the order to Gragg was improper as a result of the FLRA and court unfair labor practice determinations, the charge could not be sustained. The Board did not overrule <span class="Italic">Gragg I</span>; it found that the disciplinary charge, as stated, could not be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A decade later, justifiable insubordination was revisited in <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein v. Dept. of Army</span>, 63 MSPR 470, 473-75 (1994), a decision that excluded from the definition of actionable insubordination a refusal to obey a superior's improper order. At issue was the supervisor's demand that the appellant turn over some papers in the appellant's office. The paperwork included some notes by appellant's attorney concerning a response the appellant was preparing to a proposed disciplinary action, although this was probably unknown to the supervisor at the time she gave the order. The Board concluded that the appellant's refusal to turn the materials over to the supervisor did not constitute insubordination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows clearly that the appellant has maintained throughout the adjudication of his appeal that he was not insubordinate because Ms. Conboy's order was not proper. Specifically, he has alleged that the documents in question were rightfully his; that they included his and his attorney's notes regarding his defense to the June 27, 1991, proposal to suspend him; and that he believed Ms. Conboy's retention of these documents could prejudice his defense. In light of these allegations, we find that the charge of insubordination cannot be sustained in the absence of a showing that Ms. Conboy was entitled to have her order obeyed. <span class="Italic">See Bonanova</span>, 49 MSPR at 302.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In sustaining the charge of insubordination, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Gragg v. U.S. Air Force,</span> 11 MSPB 546, 13 MSPR 296, 299 (1982), <span class="Italic">dismissed,</span> 717 F.2d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 1983). In that decision, the Board held that an employee did not have the unfettered right to disregard an order merely because there was substantial reason to believe that the order was not proper, and that the employee was required to comply with the order except in certain limited circumstances where obedience would place him in a clearly dangerous situation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This Opinion is not inconsistent with that holding. We note, however, that the Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Gragg</span> that the employee could be disciplined for his failure to obey an order even though the order was based on a policy that later was found to be improper. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 298-301. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Gragg</span> can be interpreted as indicating that an employee can be disciplined for a refusal to obey an order that the agency is not entitled to have obeyed, we hereby overrule that decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellant notes in his petition for review, the administrative judge did not directly address the issue of whether Ms. Conboy was entitled to have her order obeyed. Although he characterized the order as "valid," this characterization appears to be based on his finding that the appellant had failed to show that Ms. Conboy's retention of the documents would have harmed his defense to the June 27, 1991, suspension proposal. An employee's failure to show that harm would have resulted from compliance with an order does not, however, relieve the agency of its burden of proving that the order was one it was entitled to have obeyed. <span id="Page_2641"></span>We note further that the administrative judge's use of the term "valid" seems inconsistent with his statement that the "appellant's attorney's notes [were] arguably covered under the attorney-client and attorney work-product privilege." In addition, the administrative judge's finding that the appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy concerning the documents because he had left the door of his office open and the documents on the top of his desk does not directly address the issue of whether Ms. Conboy was entitled to have her order obeyed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that under the particular circumstances of this case, Ms. Conboy's order to the appellant was unauthorized. In testimony that the administrative judge found credible, the appellant stated that the papers that Ms. Conboy demanded included "four typed pages from appellant with handwritten notes from his attorney concerning the proposed five-day suspension." These documents would have been protected from disclosure to the agency under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3), governing attorney work product privilege. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., In re Subpoena</span>, 18 MSPR 454, 458-59 (1983). The Board, while not bound by these rules, finds them instructive. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.72(a). Moreover, we find that it would be unreasonable to have expected the appellant to separate out these papers from the other documents while Ms. Conboy was demanding the entire package. Thus, we find that under these limited circumstances, the agency has failed to prove that its order was authorized. Accordingly, we reverse the charge of insubordination and the appellant's suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The rule before and after <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein</span> remains for all but the most unusual situations: obey first, protest later. The Board, anxious to avoid approving refusals to obey directives, limited <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein</span> in <span class="Italic">Cooke v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 401, 407-08 (1995), to permit disobedience to improper directives only when compliance would result in irreparable harm to the employee. Under <span class="Italic">Cooke</span>, involving removal for AWOL of an employee who refused to accept an arguably improper reassignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have found that the agency's action was motivated by legitimate reasons, because we had earlier found that it was not properly effected, we address the agency's next argument, that, even if the assignment was improper, the appellant's recourse was to obey by performing the duties of his new position and then appeal the propriety of the assignment. Citing <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 40 MSPR 106, 112, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 891 F.2d 299 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 494 U.S. 1090, 110 S. Ct. 1832, 108 L. Ed.2d 961 (1990), the agency submits that his failure to do so and the resulting unauthorized absence from his position provide sufficient support for the removal action. In <span class="Italic">Taylor,</span> the Board stated that "[i]f the appellant believed that her reassignment was improper, her recourse was to report for duty and grieve while working." <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, 40 MSPR at 112, citing <span class="Italic">Gragg v. U.S. Air Force,</span> 13 MSPR 296, 299 (1982) (an employee does not have the unfettered right to disregard an order merely because there is substantial reason to believe that the order is <span id="Page_2642"></span>not proper; he must first comply with the order and then register his complaint or grievance, except in certain limited circumstances where obedience would place the employee in a clearly dangerous situation), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 717 F.2d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Again, we agree with the agency's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board recently modified <span class="Italic">Gragg</span> "to the extent that [it] can be interpreted as indicating that an employee can be disciplined for a refusal to obey an order that the agency is not entitled to have obeyed." <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 MSPR 470, 474 n.3 (1994). That holding, we find, does not allow the appellant to disobey the instant assignment order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein</span>, in the course of preparing a reply to the agency's proposal to suspend him, the appellant was ordered to turn over to his supervisor certain documents that constituted his attorney's work product. Based on that refusal, the agency proposed and effected a more severe disciplinary action. On appeal from the latter action, the Board held that the appellant was entitled not to obey. The attorney work product privilege protects such documents from disclosure by Rule 26(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. And, importantly, their disclosure while a proposed disciplinary action was pending against the appellant would have caused him irreparable harm, such as if they contained information related to his culpability in matters other than those already charged. Such harm would not readily be cured during the course of the appeal of any effected disciplinary action because it could have been very broad and deep, and beyond the scope of the pending disciplinary action. To the extent that our decision in <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein</span> did not reflect the significance of the avoidance of irreparable harm as an underpinning for our holding, we hereby clarify it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find here that, unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein,</span> the appellant was not at liberty to disobey the assignment order because of his disagreement with it, despite the Board's ultimate agreement that it had not been effected properly. The appellant's conduct was not protected by either privilege or a legitimate concern that it would cause him irreparable harm. His only proper recourse, therefore, was to obey the order and, as he did, challenge its validity on appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, we find that the agency has proven that the appellant's assignment was based upon legitimate management reasons, and, therefore, his placement in AWOL status for his failure to report for duty in that position was proper.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The rule involved in this case has long been recognized as one that is necessary to an agency's ability to effectively manage the workplace. The rule generally requires an employee to comply with an agency order, even where the employee may have substantial reason to question it, while taking steps to challenge its validity through whatever channels are appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Bigelow v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 962, 965 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Gragg v. United States Air Force</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. 296, 299 (1982). The rule reflects the fundamental management right to expect that its decisions will be obeyed and its instructions carried out. <span class="Italic">See Nagel v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 707 F.2d 1384, 1387 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (permitting employees to refuse to do work because of disagreements with management violates the first law of the work place, namely that it is a place for doing work).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the recognized exceptions to the requirement that agency orders be obeyed apply in extreme or unusual circumstances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gragg v. U.S. Air Force</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. at 299 (order placing employee in dangerous situation); <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 470, 474 (1994) (order to make disclosure that could cause irreparable harm)[4] . In its petition, OPM challenges the Board's determination that an additional exception to the rule should be recognized in the circumstances of this case. OPM contends that there is no support in the case law for the exception created by the Board, and it argues that it will vastly expand the circumstances when the rule will not apply. The appellant counters that the exception here is narrowly tailored to very specific and limited circumstances. The Board made its decision to create the exception after taking into account the two considerations that it found to underlie the rule, harm to the agency and the possibility that the employee is wrong. The Board determined there was no harm to the agency from the appellant's non-cooperation because the investigation that the appellant resisted was not directed at serious misconduct, and it found that the appellant had a legitimate concern that answering the agency's questions might interfere with an IG investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In Fleckenstein, the Board modified Gragg to the extent the decision in <span class="Italic">Gragg</span> could be read to exclude the irreparable harm exception. <span class="Italic">See Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 401, 407-408 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As OPM points out, the Board cited no precedent in the case law for this approach to the applicability of the obey-now-grieve-later rule, which has been applied to a broad range of agency orders. While the decision cited cases in which the rule was invoked to discipline employees for refusing to cooperate with investigations into criminal or other serious misconduct, these cases do not state the limitation inferred by the Board[5] . The rationale for the rule, as noted above, is that an employee's failure to obey supervisory instructions is inherently harmful to the orderly accomplishment of work. There is no requirement in the cases that the agency must demonstrate harm from non-cooperation in a particular case. Similarly, while there is an exception for clearly unlawful orders, <span class="Italic">see Harris v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 524, 529 (1994), the appellant has cited no law or regulation that the agency's investigation on its face violated. Other exceptions to the rule are not based on the correctness of the employee's objections to the order, but apply in situations where there could be a significant adverse impact on the employee from cooperation with an order that may be improper. <span class="Italic">See Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 408 (the appellant was not entitled to disobey a reassignment order, despite the Board's ultimate agreement that it was not effected properly, because his conduct was not protected by a privilege or by a concern that it would cause him irreparable harm). The appellant showed nothing comparable in his situation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The decision also cited <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Justice</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 211 (1986), as support for recognizing a new exception to the rule based on the surrounding circumstances. However, this case did not address the applicability of the rule, but the factors bearing on the appropriate penalty for a violation of it, finding there that the appellant's removal should be mitigated to a 30-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining that the appellant's non-cooperation was based on a legitimate concern, the Board relied on a finding that, after the appellant made an effort to comply by seeking advice from the IG's office, the agency's withholding of information from the appellant about its contacts with the IG was responsible in part for the appellant's non-cooperation. In these contacts, the IG approved the agency investigator's proposed questions as not interfering with the IG investigation and stated that he saw no conflict between the two investigations. We believe the decision erred in finding that the IG failed to give the appellant clear advice. The IG advised the appellant to cooperate and to refer any questions he felt would compromise the IG investigation to the IG. While the appellant was dissatisfied because the IG declined to address the lawfulness of the agency investigator's appointment, he knew that the IG did not tell him that a blanket refusal to answer any of the investigator's questions was necessary to protect the integrity of the IG's investigation. The appellant also must have been aware that the IG himself took no action to prevent the agency from questioning him. The appellant's situation is not distinguishable from that of others who are required to obey a lawful order and challenge it later, even an order they have substantial questions about. It was not the appellant's responsibility or right to take whatever actions he thought appropriate to protect the IG's investigation when the IG himself took no action to prevent the supposed harm. Excusing the appellant from obeying the agency's order here broadens the exception in a way that threatens to make the exception the rule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the Board erred in recognizing an exception to the obey and grieve later principle in the circumstances of this case. In light of the advice that the appellant received from the IG, we cannot find that the agency's withholding of information about its contacts with the IG <span id="Page_2643"></span>was responsible for his refusal to cooperate. The appellant questions the need for the agency's investigation, its authorization, and inconsistencies he perceives in the reasons given for it. However, the purpose of the agency investigation was a legitimate one on its face, and the appellant was required to cooperate with it while raising his objections through appropriate channels. The appellant argues that the agency's actions show that the investigation was a bad faith effort to manipulate his refusal so that he could be disciplined. The only specific impermissible motive advanced by the appellant for this alleged agency action is his claim of reprisal for whistleblowing, which is addressed below.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Mr. Pedeleose argues that he was justified in refusing to cooperate with the investigation, the Board properly found those arguments unavailing. Absent exceptional circumstances, government employees generally cannot refuse to do work simply because they disagree with a superior and, consequently, failing to comply with their duties is done at the risk of insubordination. <span class="Italic">See Nagel v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human &#x0026; Servs.</span>, 707 F.2d 1384, 1387 (Fed. Cir. 1983).

Cir. 1984) (sustaining a disciplinary action for refusing to obey a supervisor because the instruction "was not unlawful on its face [and] not a clear and direct violation of a provision"). In fact, it would be extremely difficult--if not impossible--for Mr. Pedeleose to accurately determine the legality of the investigation, as he did not even give Ms. Scantlebury the opportunity to ask him a single substantive question. As such, Mr. Pedeleose had nothing more than an unsupported subjective belief that the investigation was illegal, which is wholly insufficient for an exception to the general rule above. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 965 ("[T]he orders the petitioners refused to obey were lawful, and the petitioners could not disobey the orders because of their own view of the legality or propriety of the direction."). Moreover, after asking the IG whether the investigation was illegal or in conflict with other ongoing investigations, the IG clearly and explicitly told Mr. Pedeleose to both comply with Colonel Plourde's requests and answer Ms. Scantlebury's questions.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The price of a strong insubordination policy is the unwillingness of employees to express dissent or to challenge improper directives. This point was illustrated by a HUD employee who was directed by higher management to arrive at a predetermined, although not necessarily justified, result concerning the valuation of property. The Board determined that when an employee is directed to reach a particular result, he cannot be disciplined for doing the task in the directed manner. Government employees may not refuse an instruction to do certain work because they challenge its propriety. Failure to perform as directed is undertaken at the risk of being deemed insubordinate. It would be grossly inequitable to suspend an employee for responding to a supervisor's directive, regardless of the employee's perception of the propriety of the order. <span class="Italic">Rose v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's actions in reducing the population were taken under the explicit directions of much more highly placed INS superiors, it serves no useful purpose to examine whether or not these reductions were accomplished in accordance with ordinary agency policies and practices. The new, unambiguous directives from the appellant's superiors obviously superseded existing ordinary policies and practices concerning the movement of alien detainees. The facts that the congressional delegation was a significant factor in establishing that policy, and that Blake was aware that the impending visit influenced the decision, are irrelevant to the appellant's responsibilities to perform the population reduction tasks as ordered. It was never Blake's responsibility or prerogative to determine the rightness or wrongness of Chasse's decision to order specific population reductions at the facility in conjunction with the delegation's visit, or to consider whether the transfers would or would not be deceptive in and of themselves. The intent, if any, to deceive the delegation by these transfers should properly be imputed, not to the appellant, but to the person who issued the order for reductions<span class="Italic">. See Rose v.

<p class="Body-Text">Assessment of a defense on facts suggesting that an individual acted improperly, but at the direction of higher-level authority, includes consideration of the degree of command influence that was actually influenced and the nature of the employee's responsibilities.

Cir. 2011 NP)), a Special Counsel disciplinary case, the respondents were two human relations specialists of the Coast Guard charged with granting a preference to an individual for the purpose of improving his prospects of obtaining promotion to a supervisory position. Of the degree of the responsibility of the respondent employees, the Board determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We acknowledge here that the strongest evidence of intent points not to the respondents, but to CMDR O'Hare. The Special Counsel requested on May 20, 2008, that the Department of Homeland Security impose disciplinary action against CMDR O'Hare, but she retired effective November 30, 2008, before a hearing could be held. Nevertheless, given the rather blatant intention of granting a preference to Woodson that CMDR O'Hare's communications express to the respondents, we also cannot ignore the actions of the respondents, who are HR professionals, in intentionally facilitating an obvious violation of section 2302(b)(6). <span class="Italic">See Byrd,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. at 577, 583-84 (finding that because of respondent Rubenstein's "area of expertise" as a personnelist, "he had the professional responsibility to advise management that using the TLA [(temporary limited appointment authority) to give an improper preference to an applicant for employment]...was illegal" under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(6) and (b)(11)). We therefore interpret 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) to reach conduct that aids and abets another who is violating the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) here may seem at first glance to conflict with another long-standing tenet of civil service law frequently implicated in insubordination cases. Government employees may not refuse to do work merely because of disagreements with management, <span id="Page_2644"></span>and they fail to perform their assigned duties at the risk of being insubordinate. <span class="Italic">Nagel v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 707 F.2d 1384, 1387 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Further, the Board has held that an employee does not have the unfettered right to disregard an order merely because there is a substantial reason to believe that the order is not proper; rather, he must first comply with the order and then register his complaint or grievance, except in certain limited circumstances where obedience would place the employee in a clearly dangerous situation, or when complying with the order would cause him irreparable harm. <span class="Italic">E.g., Bowen v. Department of the Navy,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 15 (2009); <span class="Italic">Pedeleose v. Department of Defense,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 508, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 343 Fed. Appx. 605 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 401, 407-08, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). For the subordinate employee, the "obey now, grieve later" doctrine can be a safety net, because the Board has declined to sustain charges of misconduct where the employee has, despite his own misgivings, met his obligation under <span class="Italic">Nagel</span> to perform as directed, and the order he obeyed is found to be an improper one. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Blake v. Department of Justice,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 394, &#x00B6; 25 (1999) (holding that one specification of a charge could not be sustained where the appellant's actions underlying the specification had been "taken under the explicit directions of much more highly placed...superiors" at the agency); <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 356, 360 (1985) (holding that the appellant, whose actions were directed by his supervisors, "should not be disciplined in this case because Government employees may not refuse an instruction to do certain work merely because they challenge its propriety"). Indeed, where intent is a relevant consideration in the charge, it should "properly be imputed, not to the appellant, but to the person who issued the order," as it is not the appellant's "responsibility or prerogative to determine the rightness or wrongness" of the order. <span class="Italic">Blake,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 394, &#x00B6; 25.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts now before us may be distinguished from a typical "obey now, grieve later" situation. There is no evidence that CMDR O'Hare <span class="Italic">ordered</span> the respondents to take actions that would ensure that Woodson appeared on the certificate of eligibles, nor was either respondent one of CMDR O'Hare's subordinates. Instead, the respondents were part of the Coast Guard's headquarters Civilian Personnel Office. Lee was the Command Staff Advisor for the Los Angeles/Long Beach area in the field, and Beatrez, who is now the West Branch Chief and Lee's direct supervisor, was a Washington, D.C.-based HR Specialist in the West Branch at the time. While Lee may have been "the personal point of contact in [the Civilian Personnel Office] with the management officials and employees that he serviced," and "answer[ed] questions from management officials about any issue related to operational personnel," he was nevertheless in the chain of command for the Civilian Personnel Office, as was Beatrez, and not for the Los Angeles REC. As such, neither respondent was a subordinate to CMDR O'Hare. Even if CMDR O'Hare's questions and requests regarding personnel management matters could be construed as orders, the respondents were responsible to a separate organization. Because he was on-site, Lee may have been more susceptible to the influence of local management; however, in his testimony, Kogut repeatedly characterized Lee's role as <span class="Italic">advisory</span>. Kogut testified that Lee "answers questions" and "gives that face-to-face direct contact with" local management. Lee "advised Commander O'Hare and subsequently Commander Hogan on the recruitment process, the hiring process, the announcement process, answered questions from Commander O'Hare with regard to the recruitment process...a typical command staff advisor role." As HR advisors outside of the local chain of command, the respondents should have exercised their independent judgment and challenged local management's fairly obvious efforts to grant a preference to Woodson for the purpose of improving his prospects for selection as the Supervisory Merchant Marine Evaluation Specialist for the Los Angeles REC. <span class="Italic">See Byrd,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. at 577, 583-84.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful of our obligation to faithfully uphold the merit system principles as set forth by Congress, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301, and to "serve Congress'[s] interest in putting agencies subject to the Civil Service Reform Act...on notice that selections for employment must be made in accordance with law and must not be the result of personal or political favoritism." <span class="Italic">Byrd,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. at 584. In section 2302(b)(6), Congress set forth the plainest of language prohibiting the granting of a preference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or regulation for the purpose of improving or injuring the prospects of any particular person for employment by any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action. Although some may see the respondents as lacking any improper motive or reasonably relying on unquestioned past practices, the Board has spoken before on this issue. In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Ross,</span> for example, the Board affirmed and adopted as modified the recommended decision sustaining charges that a Personnel Officer and a Personnel Management Specialist engaged in prohibited personnel practices in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(4), (5), (6), by manipulating the selection process to place a temporary employee in an open permanent position despite the fact that she was the lowest-ranked candidate on the certificate of eligibles, after management "name-requested" that employee for the position.<span class="Italic"> Special Counsel v. Ross,</span> 34 M.S.P.R. 197, 200-03 (1987). Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Byrd,</span> the Board sustained charges that respondent Rubinstein, a personnelist, had engaged in prohibited personnel practices in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6), (11), when he assisted respondent Byrd, the selecting official, in using TLA authority to grant a hiring preference to a politically-connected candidate for a position that was filled under a merit staffing announcement in the hiring at the agency's other locations, because he "should have known that the use of the TLA authority was inappropriate in this case" and "he had the professional responsibility to advise management that using the TLA in this case was illegal." <span class="Italic">Byrd,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. at 577, 583-84. Accordingly, we find that the Special Counsel has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that both respondents violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) when they intentionally assisted CMDR O'Hare in granting an illegal preference for employment to Woodson.</p>
