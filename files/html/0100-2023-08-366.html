<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-358"><span class="space">g.</span> Manipulation of Appointments; Cancelation of Vacancy</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Decisions of the Board and the Federal Circuit consider veterans' assertions that agencies manipulated appointment process to deny their applications fair consideration. Deliberate manipulation of appointment authorities with the intent of excluding a veteran from consideration appears to be actionable as a VEOA or USERRA appeal and may implicate the anti-reprisal provision of those statutes, as the Board determined, remanding to the AJ in <span class="Italic">Weed v.</span> SSA, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WEED_ALVERN_C_DE_3330_08_0490_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_434353.pdf">112 MSPR 323</a>, 325-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-18, 2009 MSPB 159 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a ten-point compensable preference eligible veteran, filed a 2005 Board appeal alleging that the agency violated veterans' preference rules when it made no selection from a competitive service vacancy announcement for two GS-0105-05/07 Social Insurance Specialist (Claims Representative) positions for which he had applied in the agency's Montana Field Office in Kalispell, Montana, and instead noncompetitively selected in January 2005 two non-preference eligible applicants for those positions under the Outstanding Scholar Program. <span class="Italic">See Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 142, &#x00B6; 2 (2007), <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed</span>, 571 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The administrative judge (AJ) and the Board found that the agency violated the appellant's statutory rights and ordered the agency to reconstruct the hiring for the positions. <span class="Italic">Weed</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 142, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4, 15. The appellant subsequently filed a petition seeking enforcement of the Board's order. <span class="Italic">See Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 450, &#x00B6; 2 (2009); <span class="Italic">Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 3 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed the instant appeal in September 2008 alleging that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b), discriminated against him in violation of USERRA, and retaliated against him for his successful Board appeal and an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission appeal. The appellant asserted that between January 1, 2006, and April 10, 2008, the agency filled vacancies for the same or comparable positions for which he had applied in 2005 under the noncompetitive authority of the Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP) without providing public notice of the vacancies and, despite his pending petition for enforcement in his prior Board appeal, without advising the appellant of the vacancies or otherwise providing him with an opportunity to compete for the vacancies. The appellant claimed that the agency used the FCIP as an "intentional artifice" to exclude him from the opportunity to compete for the positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that although he did not formally apply for the positions in question, his failure to do so was due to the agency's unlawful use of the FCIP to personally deny him public notice of the vacancies and thereby circumvent veterans' preference laws. The appellant claims that the agency therefore denied him an opportunity to compete for vacancies filled outside the agency's workforce under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304, that he nonfrivolously alleged that the agency discriminated against him based on his status as a veteran in violation of USERRA when it used the FCIP to avoid notifying him of the vacancies and hiring him, and that the FCIP is illegal on its face because it circumvents statutory rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first find that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's USERRA appeal. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), a person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation. To establish Board jurisdiction over a USERRA discrimination appeal arising under section 4311(a), the <span id="Page_659"></span>appellant must allege the following: (1) He performed duty or has an obligation to perform duty in a uniformed service of the United States; (2) the agency denied him initial employment, reemployment, retention, promotion, or any benefit of employment; and (3) the denial was due to the performance of duty or obligation to perform duty in the uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Lubert v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 430, &#x00B6; 11 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that a claim of discrimination under USERRA should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether it is nonfrivolous, particularly where, as here, the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of the Army</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 54, &#x00B6; 9 (2009). This approach to Board jurisdiction in USERRA cases has been noted with approval by our reviewing court. <span class="Italic">See Yates v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 145 F.3d 1480, 1484 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">see also</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-65, at 23 (1993), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2456 ("The Committee intends that these anti-discrimination provisions be broadly construed and strictly enforced."). Further the weakness of the assertions in support of a claim is not a basis to dismiss the USERRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction; rather, if the appellant fails to develop his contentions, his USERRA claim should be denied on the merits. <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 54, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that he performed active military duty in the U.S. Army from 1972 to 1976. As the AJ found, the appellant did not apply for the positions in question. Nevertheless, under the particular circumstances of this case, we find that the appellant has still nonfrivolously alleged that the agency denied him initial employment based on his performance of duty in the uniformed service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). The appellant asserted below that because of his prior application for similar positions with the agency, as well as his prior Board appeal, the agency was aware of his military service when it filled the positions at issue in this case, and that the agency "wrongfully and intentionally denied Appellant initial employment when it used the...FCIP...to appoint nonveterans, or veterans in a lower preference category, to positions in its KFO [Kalispell Field Office] in calendar years 2006 and 2007, when the Agency knew that Appellant's veteran's preference category would have placed him above all persons appointed to those positions." The appellant alleged that his prior active military service was a motivating factor in the agency's decision to deny him initial employment through the use of the FCIP. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.[3] In essence, the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that the agency denied him initial employment based on his performance of duty in the uniformed services by deliberately using the FCIP as its method of hiring in order to avoid providing him with public notice of the vacancies and his veterans' preference rights, given the likelihood that he would have applied for these positions. Such a nonfrivolous allegation is enough to establish jurisdiction in this case. <span class="Italic">See Wilson</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 54, &#x00B6; 10 (finding that a claim by the appellant that agency officials "didn't like the fact" of his Army National Guard service was sufficient to establish jurisdiction over the USERRA appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant also alleged that the agency's use of the FCIP to deprive him of initial employment was based on discrimination for a "previous action against the Agency to enforce protections afforded him under USERRA and other statutes relating to veterans rights...." Section 4311(b), however, provides that an employer may not discriminate in employment against any person because such person has, among other things, "taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person <span class="Italic">under this chapter</span>" (emphasis added). The appellant's prior Board appeal against the Social Security Administration involved a VEOA claim, not an action to enforce a protection under chapter 43 of title 38. It is not clear what activity under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b) forms the basis for the appellant's claim. Accordingly, the AJ shall afford the parties an opportunity to address this issue on remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that in <span class="Italic">Jolley v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 299 Fed. Appx. 969, 973 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the court affirmed the Board's dismissal of a USERRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction where the appellant admitted that he did not apply for the position in question because he believed that doing so would have been futile. <span class="Italic">Jolley</span>, however, is distinguishable from this appeal. Mr. Jolley was "interested in" and aware of the vacancy for which he did not apply, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 971, but chose not to apply for it based on his belief that doing so would have been futile. Here, by contrast, the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that he did not apply for the vacancies because he was not aware of them, and that he was not aware of the vacancies because the agency deliberately used the FCIP hiring procedures to avoid having to issue public notice of the vacancies, thereby denying him initial employment.[4] Thus, the appellant has alleged that the agency deliberately took or failed to take some type of action that effectively denied him initial employment. <span class="Italic">See Isabella v. Department of State</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 211, &#x00B6; 9 (2006) (finding no jurisdiction over the appellant's claim that his military service prevented him from applying for a position because the appellant did not allege that the agency took or failed to take any action based upon his military status or obligations). Having found jurisdiction over the appellant's USERRA appeal, we further find that the appellant is entitled to a hearing on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Downs v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;According to the agency's FCIP guide for the Denver Region, the use of recruitment bulletins and vacancy announcements is not required, FCIP vacancies are not posted on OPM's USAJOBS website, and managers are responsible for recruiting external job applicants through "normal recruitment efforts such as paid advertising, on-line job listings, job fairs, college visits, referrals, etc."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's VEOA appeal, VEOA provides redress for preference-eligible individuals whose rights have been violated under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A). Aggrieved individuals may file a complaint seeking relief from the Secretary of Labor. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B). If that remedy proves unavailing, the complainant may appeal to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1). In general, in order to establish jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal, an appellant must: (1) Show that he exhausted his remedy with DOL; and (2) make nonfrivolous allegations that (i) he is a preference eligible within the meaning of VEOA, (ii) the action at issue took place on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of VEOA, and (iii) the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6; 7 (2007). Allegations of a VEOA violation "should be liberally construed" and an allegation, in general terms, that an appellant's veterans' preference rights were violated is sufficient to meet the requirement of a nonfrivolous allegation establishing Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Slater v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2009 MSPB 128, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Elliott v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 364, &#x00B6; 8 (2006). An appellant need not state a claim upon which relief can be granted for the Board to have jurisdiction over a VEOA claim. <span class="Italic">Haasz v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 349, &#x00B6; 6 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ found, the appellant exhausted his administrative remedies with DOL and nonfrivolously alleged that he is a preference eligible and that the selections at issue took place after the October 30, 1998 enactment of VEOA. We further find, contrary to the AJ, that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that the agency violated his rights under a statute relating to veterans' preference, and therefore established Board jurisdiction over his VEOA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Davis</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10. As set forth above, an allegation in general terms that veterans' preference rights were violated meets the requirements of a nonfrivolous allegation. The appellant alleged that the agency's use of the FCIP violated his veterans' preference rights by not affording him an opportunity to compete for the vacancies,[5] and he specifically cited 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b), which provides that if an appointing authority proposes to pass over a preference eligible on a certificate in order to select an individual who is not a preference eligible, it shall file written reasons for passing over the preference eligible with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which shall determine the sufficiency or insufficiency of those reasons. <span class="Italic">See Garcia v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 8 n.2 (2009) (holding that section 3318 is a statute relating to veterans' preference).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In order to establish Board jurisdiction over a "right to compete" VEOA claim under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B), the appellant must (1) show that he exhausted his remedy with DOL and (2) make nonfrivolous allegations that (i) he is a veteran within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), (ii) the actions at issue took place on or after the December 10, 2004 enactment date of the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2004, and (iii) the agency denied him the opportunity to compete under merit promotion procedures for a vacant position for which the agency accepted applications from individuals outside its own workforce in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). <span class="Italic">Styslinger v. Department of the Army,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 31 (2007). To the extent that the appellant may be alleging a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), he must be notified on remand of the proper jurisdictional test for such a claim. <span class="Italic">See Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue). We need not at this time address the merits of such a claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's name did not appear on any certificate used to fill the positions at issue here, the agency did not have occasion to request OPM approval to pass over the appellant in order to select an individual who was not a preference eligible. We find, however, that the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> allegation that the agency improperly used the FCIP to circumvent his veterans' preference rights should be interpreted as a more general challenge to the agency's authority to use the FCIP to fill the positions at issue in this case. In this regard, the appellant alleged that the agency's use of the FCIP circumvented "competitive merit system principles," denied him his "right to compete under the VEOA," and "prejudice[d]...other disabled veterans who were denied the opportunity to compete for those positions due to the SSA's use of the FCIP to circumvent competitive procedures." The appellant further claimed that if the Board were to find that his allegations were frivolous</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_660"></span>such a conclusion would be an open invitation for <span class="Italic">carte blanche</span> use of the FCIP by Federal agencies out of malice, and to the prejudice of a specific person or group of people. Such a conclusion would also promote the use of the FCIP as a subterfuge to engage in prohibited personnel practices as well as mere circumvention of the VEOA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In essence, the appellant appears to be claiming that the Claims Representative and Contact Representative positions should have been advertised to the members of the public as positions in the competitive service, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330(b), (d) (the list of vacant positions in the competitive service shall be available to members of the public), rather than to a narrower group of potential candidates under the FCIP as positions in the excepted service.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The record reflects the following FCIP recruitment efforts for the positions at issue between February 1 and June 10, 2007: The district manager spoke to a few senior seminar classes at the University of Montana about job opportunities at the agency, posted potential jobs on the University of Montana's job opportunity website, and distributed several hundred agency brochures in different locations on campus.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant did not apply for the positions in question, we find that this fact does not deprive the Board of jurisdiction under the circumstances of this appeal. First, we note that there is no requirement in the applicable statute or in the Board's general jurisdictional test that requires a nonfrivolous allegation that an application has been filed in order to nonfrivolously allege a violation of a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Cf. Downs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6; 16 (under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(2), the appellant's discharge from the Army under other than honorable conditions deprived the Board of jurisdiction over his USERRA claim, despite the fact that he met the Board's general USERRA jurisdictional test). In addition, the appellant in this case previously applied for a similar position in the same location and has submitted an affidavit indicating that he would have applied for the vacancies at issue if the agency had advertised and filled them as positions in the competitive service. In this regard, the appellant asserted that the agency's use of the FCIP to fill the positions in the Kalispell Field Office</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">was an intentional artifice to exclude Appellant from the opportunity to compete for those positions, for which Appellant was exceptionally well qualified to fill. Furthermore, the SSA knew full well that Appellant would have applied for all Kalispell positions, and...knew full well it would be hard pressed to support selection of anyone other than the Appellant for at least one of those positions. Consequently, the SSA, at the Kalispell Field Office, the Missoula District Office, and at the Denver Regional Office, separately, or in concert, intentionally used the FCIP to make excepted service appointments to the Kalispell positions expressly for the purpose of intentionally circumventing the VEOA, and intentionally to exclude Appellant, personally, from the opportunity to compete for those positions, and to retaliate against him for his previous VEOA and EEOC appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's statement in <span class="Italic">Letchworth v. Social Security Administration</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 269, &#x00B6; 7 n.5 (2006), that Mr. Letchworth did not raise a nonfrivolous allegation that his veterans' preference rights were violated when he did not apply for certain positions, does not control in this case. In <span class="Italic">Letchworth</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 269, &#x00B6; 6, a vacancy announcement listed numerous locations in which positions would be filled and required applicants to identify the locations for which they sought consideration. The Board held that because the appellant sought to be considered for only three locations, he could not object to the selection of nonveterans in other locations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 7 n.5. Here, by contrast, the appellant did not <span class="Italic">choose</span> not to apply for the positions; instead, he nonfrivolously alleged that he did not apply precisely because the agency violated his veterans' preference rights by using the FCIP instead of competitive hiring procedures, thereby effectively depriving him of notice of the vacancies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FCIP may be used only to fill positions in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 13,162, &#x00A7; 4(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o) (listing FCIP positions among those filled under Schedule B of the excepted service). By electing to fill the Claims Representative and Contact Representative positions under the FCIP, the agency was, in effect, electing to except them from the competitive service. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302, Congress authorized the President to "prescribe rules governing the competitive service," and it stated that those rules were to "provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for...(1) necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service...." Having found that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal, we turn to the merits of this appeal and find that the appellant's argument that the agency should not have been permitted to use the FCIP to circumvent his veterans' preference rights directly implicates section 3302. In fact, the appellant alleges on review that the FCIP is illegal on its face, and cites to the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, 550 F.3d at 1354-56, which includes in Judge Newman's concurring opinion arguments relating to the issue of whether the agency's use of the FCIP met the "necessity" showing set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302. In addition, NTEU specifically argues in its <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> brief that the agency violated section 3302 through its use of the FCIP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, VEOA provides redress for violations under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A). Although the Board has held that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b) is a "statute...relating to veterans' preference" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A),[7] the Board has not squarely addressed the question of whether section 3302 qualifies as such a statute.[8] Accordingly, the AJ shall provide the parties on remand with an opportunity to present evidence and argument on this issue, shall provide OPM with an opportunity to intervene in the appeal, and shall issue a new initial decision addressing that issue and, if the AJ finds that section 3302 relates to veterans' preference under section 3330a(a)(1)(A), the issue of whether the exception of the Claims Representative and Contact Representative positions complied with the "necessity" requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1). <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union v. Horner</span>, 854 F.2d 490, 495 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (provisions of title 5 of the U.S. Code, including 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302, provide a "meaningful--not a rigorous, but neither a meaningless--standard" against which to judge an OPM decision to except positions from the competitive service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Section 3304(b) provides, in relevant part, that an individual may be appointed in the competitive service only if he has passed an examination or is specifically excepted from examination under section 3302 of title 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Deems v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 9 (2005), the Board stated that section 3302 was a "statute which applies to veterans' preference," without providing any supporting analysis. In <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 36 (2005), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 1 (2006), the Board addressed section 3302 within the context of determining whether there was a violation of section 3304(b), noting that "[e]ven assuming that the other requirements of section 3302, discussed above, have been met, there has been no showing that an exception to the examination process, in the form of the Outstanding Scholar Program, was determined by the President or OPM to be necessary and warranted by considerations of good administration." However, the Board repeatedly held that section 3304(b) was a statute "relating to" veterans' preference, and that the agency had violated that statute, not section 3302. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-20, 38. The majority opinion in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, 550 F.3d at 1351 n.1, noted that the Board could address on remand Mr. Gingery's argument "regarding whether the FCIP or the decision to place the auditor positions into the excepted service via the FCIP was lawful," but it did not address the question of whether section 3302 was a statute relating to veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addressing the above issues, the parties should also address, as appropriate, the question of whether the statutory scheme permits the exclusion of particular positions from the competitive service by individual agencies, rather than solely by the President or OPM. <span class="Italic">See Fish v. Department of the Navy</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 595, 597 (1986) (the President has the power to except positions from the competitive service, and OPM, under delegating authorities, exercises the power on behalf of the President). As set forth above, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302 provides that "the President" may prescribe rules that shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service. Moreover, section 3302 provides that "[e]ach officer and individual employed in an agency to which the rules apply shall aid in carrying out the rules." This statement could be regarded as indicating that the rules identifying particular positions as necessary exceptions from the competitive service are to be issued by the President and/or OPM and <span class="Italic">carried out</span> by officers and individuals in agencies, not issued by those officers and individuals. In this regard, we note that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3) provides that the President may prescribe rules which shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for authority for agencies to appoint, without regard to the provision of sections 3309 through 3318, candidates directly to positions for which public notice has been given and OPM has determined that there exists a severe shortage of candidates or there is a critical hiring need. Section 3304(a) further provides that OPM "shall prescribe, by regulation, criteria for identifying such positions and may delegate authority to make determinations under such criteria." These provisions of section 3304(a) arguably support the proposition that Congress knew how to grant OPM the authority to delegate to agencies the responsibility for identifying positions not subject to competitive procedures, and that it did so with respect to section 3304(a), but did not do so with respect to section 3302. OPM, nevertheless, appears to have delegated to agencies, like the agency in this case, the authority to identify positions for the FCIP. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(10)(iii) (each agency must describe in writing how it will use the FCIP, including identifying the positions or occupations that will be covered).[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The record includes the agency's FCIP "Guide for Managers" for the Denver Region, dated April 2007. Assuming that OPM may <span id="Page_661"></span>delegate the authority to identify particular FCIP positions to individual agencies, the parties should address on remand whether the agency in this case prescribed its own rules setting forth "necessary exceptions" of positions from the competitive service under the FCIP.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency solicits applications for two lists, one a competitive list of ranked candidates and the other a noncompetitive list of candidates, a claim may be stated under VEOA if the agency, having established separate lists and using only one list, precludes consideration of an applicant with veterans preference status. <span class="Italic">Dean v. CPSC</span>, No. 2007-3038, 2007 WL 634432 (Fed.

CPSC</span>, 108 MSPR 137, 141-42 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12, 2008 MSPB 33 (2008), determined that an allegation of manipulation of the selection process states a claim with VEOA jurisdiction, but the implication of the Board decision is that the VEOA case must be proved through evidence of manipulation of the process that goes beyond speculation concerning the agency's motivations for posting, recruiting under, and then canceling vacancy announcements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant here argued that the agency issued multiple job announcements and notifications to confuse him based on his veteran status, and to deny him his rights as a preference-eligible veteran. We find, based on the liberal standard we apply to VEOA claims, that the appellant has alleged a violation of his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that the appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction, we proceed to the merits of the appellant's request for corrective action. We are able to decide this appeal on the merits without a hearing because the record on the dispositive issues has been fully developed below and the appellant had a full and fair opportunity to dispute the agency's evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Williamson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the evidence does not show that the appellant's veterans' preference rights were violated. The appellant below challenged the agency's decision to issue both internal merit promotion announcements and external open competitive announcements for a single position, and to make its selection from the merit promotion announcements. We have held that there is nothing preventing an agency from soliciting applications from the general public and from merit promotion applicants simultaneously and that an individual is not entitled to veterans' preference points under merit promotion procedures. <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 684, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 505 F.3d 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The appellant also challenged the agency's decision to cancel some of its vacancy announcements. An agency does not violate a preference-eligible veterans' rights under the VEOA, however, when it cancels a vacancy announcement rather than select him. <span class="Italic">See Abell v. Department of the Navy,</span> 343 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Scharein v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant previously filed VEOA appeals alleging that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights when it failed to select him for Product Safety Investigator positions under earlier vacancy announcements. After the AJ dismissed those appeals and the full Board denied his petition for review, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the Board's decision, finding that we had erred in declining the appellant's request to consider the validity of the procedure of creating multiple lists as practiced by the agency. The court stated that, in view of the impact on the appellant and given his veterans' preference status, the agency's procedure in creating multiple lists and then using only one list as a source of eligible candidates raised questions on its face. <span class="Italic">Dean v. Consumer Product Safety Commission,</span> No. 2007-3038, 2007 WL 634432, at *2 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 28, 2007). The court therefore remanded those appeals to the Board for a determination of whether the agency's procedure was in accordance with law and merit principles. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> There are material distinctions, however, between the facts in that case and the facts here. As noted above, the agency here published two vacancy announcements for each of the four positions, one under competitive procedures and the other under merit promotion procedures. As further noted above, the appellant does not dispute that the agency placed his name on the list of candidates for the competitive and merit promotion announcements and sent the lists to the selecting official. The appellant here therefore was considered under all advertised hiring authorities.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Status candidates and individuals eligible for special hiring authorities, who wish to be considered under both merit promotion or special hiring authority and competitive procedures, MUST submit two (2) complete applications. If one application is received, it will only be considered under the special hiring authority or merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dean's cover letter was accompanied by one application. In his initial appeal to this court, Mr. Dean stated that after the mailing of the initial application letter, he realized his mistake and submitted two additional applications to the agency. The Board found that the Agency received only one application, and although this court affirmed that factual determination, we remanded for further review, as we shall discuss. <span class="Italic">Dean v. Consumer Product Safety Comm'n</span>, No. 2007-3038, 2007 WL 634432 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 28, 2007) (<span class="Italic">Dean I</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his cover letter with the application Mr. Dean identified himself as "a 30% or more preference eligible disabled veteran" and requested "Non-Competitive Appointment." Mr. Dean also stated in the letter: "My request for non-competitive appointment under applicable non-competitive appointment authorities is not intended to be, and is not, a waiver of any other rights, privileges or benefits available to me under any other statute, government-wide regulation, Agency regulations, policies or procedures."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 23, 2004 the Agency issued four separate certificates of eligibles under two hiring authorities: the competitive procedure and the merit promotion program. Mr. Dean was listed only on the merit promotion certificate. The Agency subsequently selected Ms. Ellen Estes for the position; Ms. Estes had the second highest rating (88 points) on the competitive procedure certificate. Mr. Dean filed a complaint for violation of the VEOA and the USERRA. He challenged the Agency's "practice of creating two hiring lists and then using only one list as a source of eligible candidates." <span class="Italic">Dean I</span>, at *2. The administrative judge dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and the Board sustained the dismissal. This court vacated the dismissal, and remanded "for determination of whether the Agency's practice is in accordance with law and merit principles." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, after further development of the record and a telephonic hearing, the administrative judge denied Mr. Dean's request for relief. The administrative judge found that the Agency's practice of requiring the filing of two complete applications "applied equally to veterans and nonveterans, and that the impact of filing a single application would fall equally on all applicants regardless of their military status." The administrative judge also found that Mr. Dean's application received due consideration from the Agency and that his veteran status "played no role in [the Agency's] decision not to interview him for the position." The full Board denied review, and Mr. Dean appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with the competitive process, an applicant is given a numerical score by the agency, and the agency makes its selection based primarily on the score. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2.1 ("Competitive examinations and eligible registers"). A preference eligible veteran is given five or ten additional points. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.01(b). Then, when a veteran has the highest numerical rating, the agency must appoint the veteran unless the agency obtains from the Office of Personnel Management written authority to appoint someone whose score is lower. <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Fed. Trade Comm'n</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b) (1978)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, under the merit promotion process, the position is only open to persons already employed by the agency and to veterans. A preference eligible veteran is not entitled to veterans preference as to selection under the merit promotion process, but receives "a right to apply and an opportunity to compete for [the] position." <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1383 (citing <span class="Italic">Perkins v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 48, 51 (2005)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency can choose to fill a vacant position by either method. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.101 ("An appointment officer may fill a position in the competitive service by any of the methods authorized in this chapter."). An agency's simultaneous use of the competitive process and the merit promotion process is not of itself a violation of veterans preference. <span class="Italic">Cf. Abell</span>, 343 F.3d at 1381 ("The VEOA ensures that a preference eligible veteran,...has the opportunity to apply for...vacancies [under merit promotion procedures]."). In the "merit promotion" process, the veteran gets the advantage of the opportunity to apply for vacancies that are otherwise open only to current agency employees. The issue in this case is whether the Agency violated the VEOA or the USERRA by its procedures and by not selecting Mr. Dean for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA provides that "[p]reference eligibles or veterans...may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures" and that "all merit promotion announcements...shall indicate that preference eligibles and veterans...are eligible to apply." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1),(4). The VEOA also provides that this provision "shall <span id="Page_662"></span>not be construed to confer an entitlement to veterans' preference that is not otherwise required by law." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00A7; 3304(f)(3). The VEOA guarantees the veteran "only a right to apply and an opportunity to compete" under the merit promotion process. <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1383. Mr. Dean was given such an opportunity to compete and be considered by the Agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency found Mr. Dean to be "qualified" for the position. Ms. Helen T. Cash, Supervisory Product Safety Investigator at the Agency, averred that she and another supervisor "did thoroughly review all of the applications for the position." Ms. Cash "considered the information in the applications, the previous history, and the interests of the individuals." Upon reviewing Mr. Dean's application, Ms. Cash found that Mr. Dean "appeared to be a job hopper and a floater." Ms. Cash also stated that "David Dean's application did not state why he wanted the job. His introduction showed no interest in the job, just that he should get the job." Ms. Cash determined that he was "not a good fit" for the job because "[h]e did not show how he would be a good fit" and the application showed "nothing about the specifics of what he had done" in his prior employment. In her affidavit, Ms. Cash also stated that she recommended Ms. Estes for the position because "[s]he gave examples of work she had accomplished that closely resembled the work required in our investigator position" and her application "clearly demonstrated to me that she was performing work that was essentially consistent with the work required of a product safety investigator with our agency."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge concluded that Mr. Dean had the full opportunity to compete for the job, that he did compete for the job, and that the Agency did not select him because it had determined that another candidate was the most suitable candidate for the position. The administrative judge concluded that the Agency satisfied its obligation under the VEOA by allowing Mr. Dean to compete in the merit promotion process. <span class="Italic">See Abell</span>, 343 F.3d at 1383 (while "the VEOA gave Mr. Abell the right to apply for the...vacant positions,...the VEOA did not ensure that his application would be successful."). We discern no reversible error in this conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also considered whether the Agency violated the USERRA in declining to hire Mr. Dean. A person making a USERRA claim bears the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that his or her military service was "a substantial or motivating factor" in the action complained of. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001). "If this requirement is met, the employer then has the opportunity to come forward with evidence to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer would have taken the adverse action anyway, for a valid reason." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, hearing live witnesses and making credibility determinations, found that Mr. Dean had met his initial burden. The Board found that Mr. Dean's cover letter put the Agency on notice of his veteran status and "when the agency did not duplicate [Mr. Dean's] application for inclusion in the competitive procedures packet, nor contact him to bring the fine print in the vacancy announcement to his attention so that he could submit a second copy of his application, these facts permit an inference that the agency discriminated against him because of his status as a disabled veteran." The administrative judge (AJ) found that Mr. Dean established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of the Agency's discriminatory motivation. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014 ("Discriminatory motivation under the USERRA may be reasonably inferred from a variety of factors[.] "); <span class="Italic">see also Kumferman v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 785 F.2d 286, 290 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (intent is a question of fact to be found by the MSPB).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden then shifted to the Agency to establish that it had legitimate reasons to support its action. <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014. The AJ found that the Agency would have required Mr. Dean to follow the same procedure, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, submitting a separate and complete application under each hiring authority, in view of Mr. Dean's veteran status. The AJ heard testimony from Ms. Donna Simpson, Director of Human Resources Management at the Agency, stating that "the agency is required to have applicants submit separate, complete applications for each hiring authority under which they seek consideration in order to ensure that applicants receive appropriate consideration." The AJ found that the Agency required both veterans and non-veterans to follow the same procedure and to submit a separate application under each hiring authority. The AJ found that Mr. Dean submitted only one application to the Agency, by his own choice, and that the Agency placed his application under the merit promotion process as Mr. Dean's cover letter specifically requested and also as the Vacancy Announcement specified. The AJ found that the Agency's practice of requiring the applicant to submit a separate application under each hiring authority "applied equally to veterans and nonveterans, and that the impact of filing a single application would fall equally on all applicants regardless of their military status."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dean argues that the Agency violated USERRA because the Agency pre-selected Ms. Estes for the position and intentionally "discarded" his application; that Ms. Estes falsified her job application; and that all of the Agency's witnesses made false statements at the hearing. Mr. Dean does not proffer any evidence supporting his contentions. The record contains various declarations by Agency witnesses stating that the Agency afforded Mr. Dean full opportunity to compete in the merit promotion process and that the Agency required both veterans and non-veterans to follow the same procedures to apply for the job vacancy. The record does not show, and Mr. Dean does not argue, that had the Agency placed him on the competitive process certificate, his numerical rating would have been the highest and that the Agency would reasonably have selected him for the job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the entirety of the record, substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that the Agency required both veterans and non-veterans to submit a separate application under each hiring authority and that any applicant, veteran or non-veteran, who submitted a single application would have been considered under only one hiring authority, in this case, the merit promotion process. No violation of statute or regulation has been established, and no basis for adjustment or for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Donaldson v. DHS</span>, 495 Fed. Appx. 53, 57-58 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), the appellant, a 30% disabled veterans preference eligible, applied for a job, was rated qualified, the agency sought to pass him over for the position, the agency human relations office declined to grant the passover request, the agency then canceled the vacancy, and appellant was not selected when the agency readvertised the job and selected a non-veteran. The court discerned no VEOA violation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Donaldson's broader VEOA challenge is precluded by the decision of this court in <span class="Italic">Abell v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2003), for the reasons we explain below. Indeed, Mr. Donaldson recognizes as much, as he argues in his brief that <span class="Italic">Abell</span> should be overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like Donaldson, Barry Abell was on a certificate of eligibles for an advertised job as a result of his veterans' preference. The agency interviewed Abell along with others including applicants who did not have veterans' preference. The agency decided that it wanted to pass over Abell in favor of other candidates, because it considered Abell not qualified for the position and lacking necessary experience. As in this case, the agency in <span class="Italic">Abell</span> did not seek OPM approval to pass the veteran over; instead, as here, it sought permission within the agency to do so, and like here, the selecting official was told that the vacancy could be cancelled and readvertised as a way of avoiding selection of Abell. In the end, the agency cancelled the vacancy without selection of Abell, thus effectively passing him over. The facts in Abell do not relate whether the agency subsequently re-advertised the position and selected a non-veteran over a qualified veteran with preference. Abell sought relief under VEOA with his suit to the Board. The Board rejected his claim, and Abell appealed to this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Abell argued first that the agency violated his VEOA rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b) by not notifying him of its intention to pass him over. We held, as we do in this case, that the notification rights only apply when pass over permission is sought from OPM. Abell's broader challenge was that the agency violates VEOA when it cancels a job vacancy announcement for the purpose of passing over a preference eligible veteran who otherwise would get the job. Donaldson finds can be no question that the agency avoided hiring Donaldson on purpose by withdrawing the job vacancy: the same was true in <span class="Italic">Abell.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We held in <span class="Italic">Abell</span> that an agency is "not required to hire a preference eligible veteran, if, as was the case here, it does not believe that the candidate is qualified or possesses the necessary experience." 343 F.3d at 1384. We concluded that the agency's decision not to hire Abell and to cancel the job announcement was based on a good faith reason supported by the record, and did not violate Abell's VEOA rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts in this case are not materially different from those in <span class="Italic">Abell</span>. Here, the agency intentionally passed Donaldson over by refusing to hire him and by cancelling the vacancy for which he had applied. The agency did so, as the Board found, and as the record amply supports, because it deemed Donaldson to lack the experience necessary to do the job. The same good faith reason for the blatant pass over of Donaldson exists here, and we are bound by precedent to conclude that the agency did not violate Donaldson's VEOA rights. The fact that the agency here proceeded to re-advertise the job and again pass Donaldson over does not afford Donaldson a remedy in this case. Indeed, he has challenged the Board's actions on the re-advertisement in two separate appeals to the Board. The consequences of the re-advertisement and job award to Roger Henderson are not before us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus affirm the Board's final decision that on the record before us Donaldson has not sustained his claim to violation of his VEOA and USERRA rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier Board decisions showed more deference to agency selection of appointment processes, even when they were ostensibly manipulated to avoid hiring a veteran or to avoid the use of veterans preference. <span class="Italic">Scharein v. Dept. of Army</span>, 91 MSPR 329, 334-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12 (2002), suggested that VEOA may prohibit violation of veterans preference regulations applicable to a selection, but it does not require that the selection process result in an appointment. <span id="Page_663"></span><span class="Italic">Scharein</span> determined that VEOA is not violated if an agency avoids application of preference when the agency cancels a vacancy and then fills a somewhat different position without following competitive procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a), the selection from a certificate of eligibles for appointment to each vacancy is from the highest three eligibles available. If, however, an appointing authority proposes to pass over a preference eligible to select a non-preference eligible, he must seek authority to do so from OPM. OPM reviews the proposed pass over and sends its findings to the appointing authority and to the preference eligible. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying those statutory provisions to the facts of this case, if the agency filled the position by selecting from the certificate of eligibles, it was required to select the appellant, a preference eligible ranked first on the certificate, and could not pass over him to appoint Brown, a non-preference eligible ranked second, after OPM denied the agency the authority to do so. Nevertheless, nothing in the statute nor OPM's regulations requires the agency to make a selection from the certificate and fill the vacancy. The agency could and did cancel the vacancy announcement. The agency's actions in this regard do not violate the appellant's rights under veterans' preference laws. The VEOA does not guarantee a preference eligible a position but only an opportunity to compete with the other candidates on the certificate of eligibles. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Brown v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 247 F.3d 1222, 1224 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (veterans are not accorded limitless rights and benefits under veterans' preference statutes). Therefore, we find that the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights when it cancelled the vacancy announcement after OPM denied its request to pass over the appellant to appoint Brown.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge reached the same conclusion, she further found that the agency effectively filled the GS-15 position when it appointed Brown under an IPA contract to the Deputy Director position. The appellant argues that the similarity in language describing the duties under the contract for the Deputy Director position and the GS-15 vacancy announcement shows that these positions were identical and that Brown was selected from the certificate and appointed to the GS-15 position. The appellant is correct that the description of the duties of both positions is similar. However, the position description for the GS-15 position indicates that the incumbent works under the general administrative supervision of the Senior Executive Service level Director of the Experiments and Exercises Directorate, which is the Deputy Director position to which Brown was appointed. Thus, although the duties of the two positions are similar, the position descriptions indicate that the Deputy Director position is higher in the supervisory chain than the GS-15 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the agency filled the GS-15 position at all, it did so with Lt. Colonel Bradley Baehr, an active duty military officer to whom the GS-15 Supervisory General Engineer duties were assigned. Neither the agency nor the appellant has submitted an documentation, such as copies of agency regulations regarding its ability to redesignate civilian positions as military positions, in regard to that action. We therefore find that the appellant has not established that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights by redesignating the civilian GS-15 position as a military position and assigning the duties of that position to Lt. Colonel Baehr<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Sherwood v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 208, 210-12 (2001) (the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights by appointing a candidate by reinstatement rather than by competitive examining or direct-hire authority).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gingery v. MSPB</span>, 482 Fed. Appx. 543 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP) (VEOA does not guarantee that a veteran be selected, only that the veteran may compete, citing <span class="Italic">Scharein</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Abell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 92 MSPR 397, 401-03 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11, 12 (2002), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Abell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2003), <span class="Italic">post</span>, provides another example of permissible cancelation of a vacancy announcement, with the effect of avoiding the selection of a preference eligible:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the names of applicants who have qualified in examinations for the competitive service shall be entered on appropriate registers or lists of eligibles in the following order--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;for scientific and professional positions in GS 9 or higher, in the order of their ratings, including points added under section 3309 of this title; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;for all other positions--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;disabled veterans who have a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more, in order of their ratings, including points added under section 3309 of this Title; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;remaining applicants, in the order of their ratings, including points added under section 3309 of this Title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record indicates that the GS-13 General Engineering position is a scientific or professional position in the 801 occupational series covered by the qualification standards for professional and scientific positions and is at a grade higher than GS-9. Therefore subsection (1) above applies. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a), the selection for appointment to each vacancy is from the highest three candidates. Dendorfer and the appellant were among the three highest rated candidates, and the agency could select either of them, with one qualification. If an appointing authority proposes to pass over a preference eligible to select a non-preference eligible, he must seek authority to do so from OPM. OPM reviews the proposed pass over and sends its findings to the appointing authority and to the preference eligible. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1). Because Dendorfer and the appellant were both preference eligibles, the agency could select Dendorfer without requesting pass-over authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights when it selected Dendorfer. The appellant argued that the agency incorrectly awarded him only five points rather than the ten points to which he was entitled as a 30% compensably disabled veteran. Nevertheless, under subsection (1) of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313, even if the appellant's augmented score should have been higher than Dendorfer's, the agency could still select Dendorfer because he was a preference eligible among the top three candidates. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a)-(b). Thus, we need not decide whether the agency incorrectly awarded the appellant a five-point rather than a ten-point preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The certificate indicates that the selecting official, Donald Williams, wanted to select Larry Small and Scott Green, in addition to Dendorfer. Larry Small was subsequently found to have been incorrectly rated qualified and was no longer entitled to consideration. In order to select Green, who is not preference eligible and is lower on the list than the appellant, the agency needed pass-over authority from OPM. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1). Although the record indicates that agency officials were preparing to request such authority, there is no evidence that the agency requested pass-over authority from OPM. We find that the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights by making a tentative proposal to pass him over in favor of Green. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the agency appointed Green to a position. Rather, the undisputed evidence shows that the agency cancelled the vacancy announcement without making a third selection. We find that such action does not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Scharein v. Department of the</span> Army, 91 M.S.P.R. 329 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2002). Accordingly, we DENY the appellant's request for relief under the VEOA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Abell</span> was affirmed on appeal, <span class="Italic">Abell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1383-85 (Fed. Cir. 2003), essentially concluding that the agency does not commit a VEOA violation if, when faced with the choice between appointing a veteran and canceling a vacancy announcement, it cancels the announcement because the agency determines that the veteran is not a good fit for the job although the veteran is technically well-qualified for the position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Mr. Abell contends that the Navy's decision to cancel the vacancy announcement for the third position deprived him of his opportunity to compete for the Public Announcement position under the VEOA. Mr. Abell acknowledges that an agency has discretion to cancel a vacancy announcement, but asserts that it may not cancel an announcement when the cancellation is for the purpose of passing over a preference eligible who would otherwise get the job. Mr. Abell also argues that the Navy's failure to inform him of its efforts to pass him over deprived him of his opportunity to respond under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1)(2). The government counters that the facts found by the Board support its decision and that Mr. Abell has failed to show that the Board's findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the VEOA, certain veterans and preference eligibles "may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). Section 3304(f) further provides, "This subsection shall not be construed to confer an entitlement to veterans' preference that is not otherwise required by law." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(3). Mr. Abell is a veteran who was entitled to compete for the announced vacant positions at the Navy under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f). In addition, the vacant positions were the types of positions that are subject to VEOA requirements because the Navy accepted applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures. The VEOA ensures that a preference eligible veteran, such as Mr. Abell, has the opportunity to apply for such vacancies. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1)<span class="Italic">. See Brown v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs,</span> 247 F.3d 1222, 1224 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Crowley v. United States,</span> 208 Ct. Cl. 415, 527 F.2d 1176, 1182 (Ct. Cl. 1975) ("There can be no dispute that the granting of preferences to veterans in certain aspects of public employment is an established principle in both State and Federal practice. Thus, as plaintiffs correctly point out, the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 387 (codified in scattered sections of Title 5, United States Code), among other things, accords veterans special point and service credit preferences in civil service entrance and other examinations; waives age and physical requirements, wherever possible, <span id="Page_664"></span>for veterans seeking Government appointments and promotions;....") (citations omitted)). In other words, the VEOA gave Mr. Abell the right to apply for the three vacant positions announced by the Navy. However, the VEOA did not ensure that his application would be successful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, Mr. Abell argues on appeal that the Navy's decision to cancel the vacancy announcement for the third position deprived him of his opportunity to compete for the Public Announcement position under the VEOA. An agency, however, has discretion to cancel a vacancy announcement. <span class="Italic">See Scharein v. Dept. of Army</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 329 (2002). In <span class="Italic">Scharein</span>, the Board was asked to decide whether the Department of the Army ("Army") could cancel an announcement for the position of GS-15 Supervisory General Engineer without violating a preference eligible's rights under the VEOA. OPM denied the Army's request to pass over Arthur A. Scharein, a preference eligible who was ranked first on the certificate of eligibles, in favor of a non-preference eligible, who was ranked second on the certificate of eligibles. Rather than select Mr. Scharein, the Army cancelled the vacancy announcement. Mr. Scharein argued that the Army violated his rights under the VEOA when it cancelled the announcement instead of selecting him. The Board held that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">nothing in the statute nor OPM's regulations requires the agency to make a selection from the certificate and fill the vacancy. The agency could and did cancel the vacancy announcement. The agency's actions in this regard do not violate the appellant's rights under veterans' preference laws. The VEOA does not guarantee a preference eligible a position but only an opportunity to compete with the other candidates on the certificate of eligibles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 339. We today follow the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Scharein.</span> Accordingly, we hold that Mr. Abell was not denied his opportunity to compete by virtue of the Navy's decision to cancel the vacancy announcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may cancel a vacancy announcement for any reason that is not contrary to law. In view of the facts of this case as found by the Board, it is not necessary for us to decide whether there could ever be a VEOA claim based upon the cancellation of a vacancy announcement. Instead, we must only determine whether Mr. Abell has a VEOA claim based on the cancellation of the Navy's third GS-13 General Engineer position. Mr. Abell contends that the Navy's process for filling the three announced vacancies was "rife with efforts on the part of the [Navy's] employees to evade the mandates of the VEOA." Mr. Abell, however, does not allege that the Navy withdrew the vacancy announcement in bad faith, except to say that the Navy cancelled the vacancy in an attempt to avoid hiring him. The Navy is not required to hire a preference eligible veteran, if, as was the case here, it does not believe that the candidate is qualified or possesses the necessary experience. The Navy's decision not to hire Mr. Abell and to cancel the vacancy announcement was based on a good faith reason. The record amply supports the Board's finding that Mr. Abell was not selected because he was not the best candidate for the job and lacked the experience necessary to carry out the functions required by the position. Mr. Glagola, the recommending official in the Navy and the head of the panel that reviewed the applications, interviewed and ranked several of the candidates. He testified that only those candidates that were considered the most qualified based on their paper records were invited to interview. He further testified that all of the interviews were conducted in the same manner. Finally, Mr. Glagola testified that the interviews factored into his recommendation as the selecting official and that Mr. Abell had several weaknesses in the areas of the position that were most important to the selecting officials. As a result, Mr. Glagola testified that he did not believe that Mr. Abell was qualified for the vacant position and that therefore he did not recommend that the Navy select Mr. Abell for one of the vacant positions. The VEOA required that the Navy give Mr. Abell the opportunity to compete for the three vacant positions; the VEOA did not require that the Navy give Mr. Abell a position if he scored the most points. The Navy reasonably relied on its interview process to determine that Mr. Abell did not meet the qualifications required for the position. In short, Mr. Abell had the opportunity to compete and did compete; the Navy's decision not to fill the position did not violate Mr. Abell's rights under the VEOA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jones v. VA</span>, 113 MSPR 385, 391 &#x00B6; 12, 2010 MSPB 48 (2010), ascertained no violation of VEOA based on what the Board assessed to be <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> reasons for canceling announcements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Overall, the record shows that the agency's repeated cancellation of the vacancy announcements was to insure that the selecting official would have a sufficient pool of eligible candidates from which to fill the position. Moreover, this justification appears to be consistent with the Office of Personnel Management's regulation requiring that the areas of consideration in merit promotion actions "must be sufficiently broad to ensure the availability of high quality candidates." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(2). Thus, we find that the agency's decision to not make selections under the announcements did not deny the appellant his opportunity to compete for the positions, or otherwise violate his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See Dean v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The authority of an agency to cancel a vacancy in a NAFI is a question of first impression for the Board. However, in the competitive service, "[a]n agency may cancel a vacancy announcement for any reason that is not contrary to law." <span class="Italic">Abell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The Board has held that the cancellation of a competitive service vacancy announcement and placement of an individual in the available position through other authorized means may be permissible under VEOA. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Scharein v. Department of the Army</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 329, &#x00B6; 12 (2002) (holding that VEOA was not violated when the agency redesignated a civilian position as military and filled it with a military officer), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 02-3270, 2008 WL 5753074 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, Marine Corps Order P12000.11A expressly provides that "[t]he head of the local NAFI or designee is authorized to change or cancel a vacancy announcement at any time or nonselect referred candidates." Furthermore, a "[r]eassignment or change to lower grade or level of a current employee to a position with no higher potential than the currently held continuing position" is excluded from the merit staffing procedures. "The head of the local NAFI or designee, at any time, is authorized to appoint individuals non-competitively in all actions excluded from the Merit Staffing Program." Thus, the regulation at issue did not require the agency to make a selection from the referral list, nor did it prohibit the non-competitive reassignment of an employee who was already at that same grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, bad faith in deciding to cancel a vacancy may be a factor in determining if a cancellation affects a veteran's right to compete. <span class="Italic">See Abell</span>, 343 F.3d at 1384. When an administrative judge's credibility findings are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing, the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301-02 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The Board has held that it does not owe deference to the administrative judge's credibility determination where his findings are incomplete, inconsistent with the weight of the evidence, and do not reflect the record as a whole. <span class="Italic">Faucher v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 203, &#x00B6; 8 (2004); <span class="Italic">see Edwards v. Department of Transportation</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 222, &#x00B6; 11 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director and Deputy Director of HRD for MCCS testified that they were interested in selecting Ms. Marshall prior to the issuance of the vacancy announcement. Ms. Marshall testified that management officials spoke with her about the possibility of a reassignment in November 2009, but she informed them that she felt that she could not leave her position because she was needed there at that time. The administrative judge determined that these witnesses were credible because they testified to this issue in a straightforward manner, their testimonies corroborated each other, and their testimonies were consistent with the record. He then determined that the agency had not acted in bad faith for the purpose of depriving the appellant of an opportunity to compete for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant asserts that Ms. Marshall's testimony regarding her reason for not participating in the selection process for the vacancy announcement while later accepting the reassignment was pretextual and made "no sense." He contends that this is evidence that the agency canceled the announcement and selected Ms. Marshall in bad faith. The vacancy announcement opened on November 23, 2009, and closed on December 2, 2009. The interview panel made its recommendation on January 22, 2010, and the announcement was canceled on January 26, 2010. Ms. Marshall testified that the obligations that prevented her from accepting a reassignment in November wrapped up in mid-January and were fully completed by early February 2010. Because the witness's testimony is consistent with the record, we discern no basis to disturb the administrative judge's findings. Therefore, we find that the agency's actions were authorized by its regulation and the appellant has not shown that the agency exercised its discretion in bad faith. Accordingly, the appellant's request for relief is denied.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we find the appellant's argument that the agency acted in bad faith when it did not select any candidate for the financial economist <span id="Page_665"></span>position also fails to establish a VEOA violation. <span class="Italic">See</span> PFR File, Tab 1 at 6-9 (citing <span class="Italic">Willingham v.

Department of the Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The record reflects that the agency conducted a thorough, structured interview of each of the candidates, and that, in the opinion of the selecting official, none of the interviewees possessed the requisite skills and knowledge for the position. Under these facts, where the agency "reasonably relied on its interview process to determine that [the appellant] did not meet the qualifications for the position," the appellant cannot demonstrate that the agency violated his rights under VEOA. <span class="Italic">Abell</span>, 343 F.3d at 1385.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, <span class="Italic">Miller v. FDIC</span>, 818 F.3d 1357, 1358-61 (Fed. Cir. 2016), concluded that no VEOA violation occurred through cancelation of a vacancy announcement after the interview process, although it was noted there was evidence that the agency was concerned about lack of qualified candidates:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Miller served on active duty from June 2003 until July 21, 2007. He has a Veteran's Administration disability rating of 60 percent. Since 2008, Mr. Miller has been employed as an Economic Analyst in the FDIC's Division of Research in San Francisco. He was hired at the GS-9 level and has risen to the GS-12 level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 7, 2012 the FDIC posted vacancy announcements for a CG-13 Financial Economist position in Washington, D.C. The FDIC posted two vacancy announcements, the first open to all U.S. citizens and the second for status candidates. Mr. Miller submitted applications under both hiring procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Miller was one of three applicants selected for an interview. Mr. Kupiec, the selecting official, and two other senior FDIC employees participated in the interviews. Each interviewer rated each candidate's answers to three questions on bank failure prediction models as Outstanding, Good, or Inadequate. On the first question, all three interviewers rated Mr. Miller's response as "Good." On the second question, two interviewers rated his answer as "Inadequate" and one interviewer rated his answer as "Good." On the third question, two interviewers rated his answer as "Inadequate" and one interviewer rated his answer as "Outstanding." The other two candidates also received some "Inadequate" ratings. No candidate was selected, and the vacancy was cancelled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Miller was notified that no one had been chosen for the Financial Economist position. He then filed a complaint with the Department of Labor, stating that the FDIC had cancelled the vacancy in bad faith to avoid hiring a veteran or having to request a "pass over" from the Office of Personnel Management. The Department of Labor denied Mr. Miller's claim, finding no evidence to support the charge of violation of his veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Miller appealed to the MSPB, alleging violation of the VEOA based on bad faith in the cancellation of the position. He cited <span class="Italic">Willingham v. Department of the Navy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 21 (2012), in which the Board held that "bad faith in deciding to cancel a vacancy may be a factor in determining if a cancellation affects a veteran's right to compete." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 31. He also alleged reprisal and discriminatory practices.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge (AJ) dismissed Mr. Miller's appeal for lack of MSPB jurisdiction. The AJ found that the charge of bad faith in cancellation of the position did not raise a non-frivolous allegation of violation of veterans' preference, and thus the Board lacked jurisdiction. The AJ also found the allegation of bad faith to be unsupported.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The full Board found that the MSPB had jurisdiction over the VEOA claim, but found no violation of the VEOA. The Board held that the allegation of non-selection for the Senior Financial Economist position in violation of veterans' preference rights was sufficient to confer jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal. However, the Board held that Mr. Miller had not established a violation of his veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the Board found that the FDIC "conducted a thorough, structured interview of each of the candidates" and "none of the interviewees possessed the requisite skills and knowledge for the position." An agency is "not required to hire a preference eligible veteran, if...it does not believe that the candidate is qualified or possessed the necessary experience." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Abell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We review the Board's decision to ascertain whether it was (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without following the procedures required by law; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c); <span class="Italic">see Barrett v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 309 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Factual findings of the Board are sustained unless they are not supported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Bolton v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 154 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 (VPA), Pub. L. No. 359, ch. 287, 58 Stat. 390, established the principle of veterans' preference, whereby preference eligible veterans receive certain advantages when seeking federal employment. The VPA is codified in scattered sections of Title 5 of the U.S. Code. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lazaro v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 666 F.3d 1316, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (discussing some of the statutes and regulations enacted to provide veterans with their preference rights); <span class="Italic">Joseph v. FTC</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (same). The VEOA provides preference eligible veterans with an administrative challenge for an agency hiring decision violating a veteran's rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Federal agencies generally use two types of selection to fill vacancies: (1) the open 'competitive examination' process and (2) the 'merit promotion' process." <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1381 (citations omitted). The competitive examination process is typically open to the public. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.101. The merit promotion process is used when the position is to be internally filled by a current agency employee or a "status" applicant, such as a preference eligible veteran. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(1). Veterans receive certain advantages under both processes, but the advantages differ.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In merit promotion procedures, preference eligible veterans receive the ability to apply for vacancy announcements otherwise open only to current agency employees. Veterans "may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). When applying under merit promotion procedures, we have held that a preference eligible veteran does not receive any additional advantage beyond the ability to apply. <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1383 ("All that [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1)] entitles veterans to is 'the opportunity to compete for vacant positions' to be filled...."). An agency may accept applications under both procedures and retains "the discretion to fill a vacant position by any authorized method." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1384 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although he does not explicitly invoke 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), Mr. Miller applied under merit promotion procedures and all of his cited authority interprets 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) ("Preference eligibles or veterans...may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce <span class="Italic">under merit promotion procedures</span>.") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Mr. Miller argues that the Board erred by ruling as a matter of law that the FDIC did not violate his right to compete by cancelling the Financial Economist position. He contends that the Board abused its discretion in ruling on his VEOA petition although discovery was not complete. He states that he had raised plausible bad faith rationales for the cancellation of the position, and was denied the opportunity to rebut the declaration of Mr. Kupiec, the selecting official. He argues that the Board incorrectly applied the "no genuine issue of material fact" standard when evaluating the merits of his case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Non-selection for a position is not an appealable action unless certain statutory violations are at issue, such as veterans' preference or whistleblower retaliation. The Board may "determine whether an agency has violated a statutory or regulatory provision relating to veteran preference." <span class="Italic">Ruffin v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 396 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (MSPB. Aug. 29, 2001). This court has explained that such violation requires a relation between the agency's action and a veteran's preference rights. <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1320. When an agency acts under merit promotion procedures, a preference eligible veteran is not entitled any additional veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1383-84; <span class="Italic">see also Abell v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (holding that while the VEOA ensures the right to compete, "the VEOA did not ensure that his application would be successful").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Precedent has established that the opportunity to compete, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), is satisfied by participation in the selection process on the same grounds as other candidates. <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1384 ("The fact that he was not selected does not mean that he did not have a full 'opportunity to compete'; it means only that, after such competition, he was not selected."). Here, Mr. Miller filed his application and was one of three applicants interviewed. The fact that he was not hired does not mean that he was denied the opportunity to compete, merely that "after such competition, he was not selected." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that there was no evidence that the FDIC's cancellation of the vacancy violated a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference, or was otherwise related to Mr. Miller's veteran's status or rights. "The VEOA does not enable veterans to be considered for positions for which they are not qualified." <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1319. Moreover, "an agency may cancel a vacancy announcement for any reason that is not contrary to law." <span class="Italic">Abell,</span> 343 F.3d at 1383-84.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record contains substantial evidence to support the FDIC's position <span id="Page_666"></span>and the Board's finding that the cancellation of the vacancy was predicated on a lack of appropriately qualified candidates. Mr. Miller states that his non-selection was due to a series of lawsuits he pursued against the FDIC and personal animus by supervisors within the FDIC. The Board ruled that non-selection due to personal animus or reprisal for lawsuits, even if substantiated, does not establish a violation of veteran's preference rights, and did not override the agency's right to cancel the vacancy announcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Miller argues that he should have been permitted to raise discrimination and retaliation as affirmative defenses or as evidence of bad faith on the part of the agency. The Board found that the asserted discrimination and retaliation were not related to Mr. Miller's veteran status. This finding is supported, for there was no evidence of any relation between the asserted discrimination and retaliation and Mr. Miller's veteran's preference rights. Furthermore, nothing in the record suggests that additional discovery would change this result because Mr. Miller had the opportunity to compete and did compete, and the FDIC was not required to fill the position. <span class="Italic">See Abell</span>, 343. F.3d at 1384. Although Mr. Miller criticizes the Board's failure to strike evidence of his litigiousness and ongoing grievances, Mr. Miller did not move before the AJ to strike this evidence, and he has not shown that it would change the outcome of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern no reversible error in the Board's ruling that VEOA violation was not shown.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency uses competitive procedures to recruit applicants, it does not violate VEOA by canceling the recruitment action or by selecting an individual through means other than competition, e.g., reassignment, as occurred in <span class="Italic">Villamarzo v. EPA</span>, 92 MSPR 159, 161-64 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-9 (2002), a decision assessing that no prohibited personnel practice involving veterans preference rights resulted from the agency's failure to select the preference-eligible applicant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a GS-14 employee, applied for the GS-15 position of Program Management Officer, and his name appeared on the certificate of eligibles that was sent to the selecting official. Subsequently, however, the agency cancelled the certificate, and filled the position by lateral transfer of a GS-15 agency employee whose name did not appear on the certificate. The appellant filed a claim with the Department of Labor (DOL), alleging that the agency's action violated his veterans' preference rights under the VEOA, and, after DOL closed his file, he timely filed a petition for appeal with the Board. In his appeal, the appellant alleged that the agency's action also violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) and (12).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the parties' written submissions, the administrative judge found that the appellant did not cite any authority that would require the agency to fill the position by using a certificate of eligibles. He also found that neither the failure to use a certificate of eligibles, nor the cancellation of such certificate constitutes a personnel action, and therefore the appellant did not prove a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b). Thus, he found that the appellant was not entitled to redress under the VEOA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition, the appellant contends that the administrative judge erred in failing to determine whether a selection had been made from the certificate prior to its cancellation, and whether the certificate was properly cancelled. Under the VEOA, a preference eligible who alleges that an agency has violated his rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference, and who has exhausted his rights under that section before DOL, may file an appeal with the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1), (d); <span class="Italic">Ruffin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 396 &#x00B6; 11 (2001). The matter at issue in a VEOA appeal, however, is not whether a particular agency action is proper and should be sustained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The VEOA gives the Board no authority to adjudicate the merits of any agency action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Instead, the VEOA authorizes the Board to determine only whether an agency has, in connection with the action that is the subject of an appeal, violated a statutory or regulatory provision relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has failed to show that any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference obligated the agency to fill the GS-15 position of Program Management Officer by competition using a certificate of eligibles, which might have given him an advantage. <span class="Italic">See Scharein v. Department of the Army</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 329 &#x00B6; 10 (2002) (nothing in the VEOA or the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management requires an agency to make a selection from the certificate of eligibles and fill the vacancy; an agency can cancel the vacancy announcement); <span class="Italic">Sherwood v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 208 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10 (2001) (the agency did not violate veterans' preference rules when it appointed a preference-eligible veteran with prior federal service by reinstatement to position instead of appellant who had veterans' preference derived from her husband's 100% service-connected disability; the agency was permitted to make the appointment under direct-hire method or by competitive examining, which might have given the appellant an advantage). In addition, even if the selecting official actually selected the appellant from the certificate, the appellant has not alleged that he was appointed to the position, and he has not shown that any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference prevented the agency from cancelling the selection prior to his appointment and filling the vacancy through another authorized means, which, in this case, involved the lateral transfer of another agency employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant also reasserts his claim that the agency committed prohibited personnel practices set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) and (12) when it cancelled the certificate of eligibles. As noted above, the administrative judge adjudicated the merits of this claim and found that the appellant failed to prove his allegation based on a finding that the agency actions in this case, failure to utilize a certificate of eligibles and the cancellation of such certificate, did not constitute "personnel actions" which could form the basis for a claim of prohibited personnel practices. The appellant, however, claimed that the agency's failure to utilize the certificate and its cancellation resulted in the agency's failure to appoint or promote him to the GS-15 position for which he applied. An appointment and a promotion are each personnel actions the denial of which would support a claim of a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) and (12). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(i), (ii). However, for the reasons set forth below, we find that any error the administrative judge might have made in finding that the appellant did not allege the commission of a "personnel action" that could serve as the basis for a prohibited personnel practice was not prejudicial to the appellant's substantive rights and provides no basis for reversal of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish that the agency committed a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11), the appellant would have had to establish that an agency employee knowingly took, recommended, or approved, or knowingly failed to take, recommend, or approved, a personnel action that violated a veterans' preference requirement.[1] As stated above, however, the appellant failed to show that the agency's actions in this case violated any law or regulation relating to veterans' preference, which would include the specific statutes and regulations cited as "veterans' preference requirements" for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302. Accordingly, we find that the appellant did not show that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;For the purpose of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302, the term "veterans' preference requirement" means any of the following provisions of law:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A) Sections 2108, 3305(b), 3309, 3310, 3311, 3312, 3313, 3314, 3315, 3316, 3317(b), 3318, 3320, 3351, 3352, 3363, 3501, 3502(b), 3504, and 4303(e) and (with respect to a preference eligible referred to in section 7511(a)(1)(B)) subchapter II of chapter 75 and section 7701. (B) Section 943(c)(2) and 1784(c) of title 10. (C) Section 1308(b) of Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. (D) Section 301(c) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980. (E) Section 106(f), 7281(e), and 7802(5) of title 38. (F) Section 1005(a) of title 39. (G) Any other provision of law that the Director of the Office of Personnel Management designates in regulations as being a veterans' preference requirement for the purpose of this subsection. (H) Any regulation prescribed under subsection (b) or (c) of section 1302 and any other regulation that implements a provision of law referred to in any of the preceding subparagraphs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(e)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By the same token, in order to establish that the agency committed a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12), the appellant would have had to establish that an agency employee took or failed to take a personnel action that violated any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301. Again, the appellant failed to show that the agency's actions in this case violated any law, rule, or regulation, and, therefore, it is axiomatic that he also failed to establish that the agency violated a law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles. Because the appellant failed to establish that the agency violated his rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) or (b)(12), we find that he is not entitled to a remedy under the VEOA.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Board is authorized to order a remedy in a VEOA case when it determines that an agency has violated an individual's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c. While we decline to order a remedy in this case due to the fact that the appellant failed to demonstrate that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) or (12), we make no finding concerning the extent of the Board's authority to order a remedy under the VEOA if we were to determine that an agency violated one of these subsections.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the undisputed record shows that Certificate WA-AJ-4-0003S0 was issued for 33 career/career conditional ALJ positions in 21 possible locations, and that the appellant restricted his application for an ALJ position to positions in Jacksonville, Tampa, and Orlando, Florida. After the agency added 5 points to the appellant's score for veterans' preference, the appellant was ranked 18th on a list of eligibles with a rating of 96 (the highest rating given was 105.3). All nonveterans with lower scores were ranked below the appellant. After an interview, the appellant was considered with two other eligibles, respectively, in selection 18 for Tampa, selection 21 for Orlando, and selection 26 for Orlando. The agency selected two 10-point veterans and one 5-point preference eligible veteran for those positions instead of the appellant. Following the appellant's third consideration, the agency, did not further consider the appellant for ALJ positions under Certificate WA-AJ-4-0003S0, and returned his application to OPM so that his name may be restored to the register of candidates for future consideration. Subsequently, in selections 33, 34, and 37, three candidates with scores lower than the appellant, including two nonveterans, were selected for ALJ positions in Tampa under the same certificate. The appellant does not challenge his rating and ranking. Further, the selection of the two 10-point veterans and one 5-point preference eligible veteran, instead of the appellant, in selections 18, 21, and 26 are not violations of his veterans' preference rights because each selectee, like the appellant, was a preference eligible and one of the highest three eligibles on the certificate who were available for appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.404; <span class="Italic">Abell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 11 (2002) (where the preference eligible selectee and the preference eligible appellant were among the three highest rated candidates, the agency could select either of them), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 343 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2003). We thus find that the agency fully complied with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309, 3313, and 3317, and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 337.101, 332.401, 332.402, 332.404, and 332.405, with regard to the appellant's nonselection for those ALJ positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the agency's selection of two lower-scoring nonveterans and a veteran in selections 33, 34, and 37, the appellant has not identified, and we are unaware of, any veterans' preference statute or regulation that requires an agency to make selections consecutively for all positions in a specific geographical location before making a selection in a different geographical location. Nor has the appellant specifically disputed the agency's reasonable proffered explanation for the geographical sequence it used in making selections, i.e., the agency considered "such factors as the relative need for an ALJ at a particular location, whether any incumbent ALJs had requested transfers or reassignments governed by their union contract, and retirements and space availability." Therefore, the appellant has not identified any statutory or regulatory veterans' preference rights that the agency violated in the geographical sequence it used to fill ALJ positions. <span class="Italic">Cf. Abell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (the agency did not violate VEOA when it cancelled a vacancy announcement for a position, rather than fill it with a veteran).</p>
