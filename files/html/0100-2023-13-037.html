<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-38"><span class="space">d.</span> Time Pressure</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A resignation is a removal action within the Board's appellate jurisdiction if it is coerced--if the appellant is given no time to consider her course of action or to consult with anyone, if the resignation is abruptly obtained, and if the agency has reason to believe that the appellant was not of a state of mind to exercise intelligent judgment. <span class="Italic">Vandiver v. GAO</span>, 3 MSPR 38, 41, 3 MSPB 158 (1980). Claims that resignations are coerced due to the short time available for making decisions will be evaluated in resignation cases as in other constructive adverse action appeals. The Board observed in <span class="Italic">Lamb v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 470, 476-77 (1990), finding no coercion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant was informed of his possible removal as early as December 7, 1989, and that the possibility of resigning was raised at that time and at another meeting with agency officials on January 8, 1990. The appellant was also on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation for almost 3 months before he resigned. The appellant and his representative reviewed the December 1989 investigative memorandum the night before the March 22, 1990 meeting. They discussed the merits of the agency's case against the appellant for 2 hours on March 22. The parties negotiated the terms of the "Memorandum For the Record" for about an hour. Additionally, the first draft of the memorandum was changed at the appellant's behest. Finally, on the advice of his representative, the appellant signed the memorandum. Under the circumstances, the administrative judge found, and we agree, that the appellant had ample opportunity to reflect on the consequences of his resignation and to make a decision, even though his resignation was made effective on the day the parties signed the memorandum....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sufficient time pressure was alleged to warrant a hearing when the employee was told by an agency official to resign or retire on the spot or be fired, <span class="Italic">Glenn v. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 76 MSPR 572, 578 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant alleged that Esch told her that she was going to be fired and that pursuant to Esch's instructions, she reported to the Personnel Office on October 1, 1996, to ascertain her options. There, according to the appellant, Essex and Shrader refused to answer her questions concerning her leave status. Instead, Essex allegedly handed the appellant two SF-52 forms and asked her to sign them on the spot, and the appellant did so. We find that these alleged circumstances and undisputed documents raise the issue of whether the appellant had adequate time and information to make an informed decision to resign on October 1, 1996. <span class="Italic">See Barnett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 59 MSPR 125, 129 (1993) (a factor to be weighed in determining whether an employee's retirement was voluntary is whether the employee had adequate time and information to make an informed decision whether or not he should retire); <span class="Italic">Gettings v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 48 MSPR 502, 512 (1991) (one factor to be weighed in determining the voluntariness of an action is whether the individual had adequate time to consider what course of action to take).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the circumstances alleged by the appellant, combined with the undisputed record evidence, are sufficient to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction on the basis of coercion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 68 MSPR 513, 519-20 (1995) (the presumption of voluntariness may be rebutted if the employee can establish that the resignation or retirement was the product of coercion; the determination of whether the employee was effectively deprived of free choice is based on the totality of the circumstances); <span class="Italic">see also Barnett,</span> 59 MSPR at 129; <span class="Italic">Gettings</span>, 48 MSPR at 512. We therefore remand this case to the regional office for a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an appellant is entitled to a hearing on the issue of Board jurisdiction over an appeal of an allegedly involuntary resignation or retirement if he makes a nonfrivolous allegation casting doubt on the presumption of voluntariness).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit found two days sufficient to consider resignation, <span class="Italic">MacAllister v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3628):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Admittedly, in some cases, two days may not be sufficient time to make a decision about whether to resign or to face removal and serious criminal charges. In this case, however, MacAllister knew on October 20, when she was placed on administrative leave, that she was being investigated concerning serious charges. Moreover, MacAllister never suggested to the agency that two days was insufficient for her to make her decision. Under these circumstances, the time provided for her to make this decision was not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson v. VA,</span> 172 Fed. Appx. 1008, 1009-11 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), presents an example of a voluntary resignation choice when a removal is imminent:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In June of 2003, Johnson was informed that she was still failing to meet certain requirements of "Organizational Support." She was given another 35 days to improve performance, and, in July of 2003, the DVA notified her that she did improve but warned that she could be removed if she failed to maintain a satisfactory level of performance. After further unsatisfactory performance from July through October, the DVA proposed her removal on November 3, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1950"></span>Johnson responded to the removal notice on November 17, 2003 taking responsibility for the errors she made but claiming that she had insufficient time and training to learn the position, that her degree negatively impacted her position, and that she was not represented by the union. On January 2, 2004, the deciding official issued a decision to remove Johnson on January 29, 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The day before her scheduled removal, on January 28, 2004, Johnson met with a human resources assistant, Marylin Buzzell, who was responsible for processing actions such as removals and resignations. In Buzzell's declaration, she admitted to meeting with Johnson and summarized the meeting as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;During our meeting, the Appellant asked me what I would do if I had the choice to resign or be terminated. Initially, I responded that the decision was hers and that it was a uniquely individual decision. I gave this response to the Appellant despite her repeated requests. Finally, however, I told the Appellant that personally, I would resign. I did not offer any further explanation as to why I would make that choice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">4.&#x2003;At no time did I advise the Appellant that resignation was a better option than termination. At no time did I discuss any benefits associated with resignation or any other advantages I feel resignation might have as opposed to termination. My comment to the Appellant was limited to the statement that I would resign rather than be terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the end of the meeting, Johnson signed a handwritten note resigning her position as cemetery representative effective January 28, 2004. On the same day, the DVA issued a Form 50-B documenting her resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her <span class="Italic">pro se</span> response to the jurisdictional issue, Johnson claimed that the resignation was involuntary because (1) her grandfather died the week of her removal and the funeral was being held January 30th, (2) the Agency officials urged her to resign rather than be terminated, (3) the deciding official continually asked her employment status, (4) Buzzell advised her to resign in lieu of termination. Taking these facts as true, the AJ found that Johnson failed to allege a claim of involuntary removal because there was no "evidence that the resignation was obtained through duress, coercion, misinformation, or some other condition precluding a voluntary decision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employee removal actions are appealable to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701, 7512. For a removal to be covered by &#x00A7; 7512, however, it must be involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1135-36 (Fed. Cir. 1987). From the outset, resignations are presumed to be voluntary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1136. However, a petitioner may prove her resignation was involuntary if "(1) the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's resignation or retirement; (2) the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire; and (3) the employee's resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency." <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 260 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Essentially, we ask whether, under all the circumstances, an employee has been deprived of free choice. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1342. If, on the other hand, the employee is merely faced with a choice between two unpleasant alternatives, either resign or be removed for cause, then such a choice is not involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Schultz</span>, 810 F.2d at 1136.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have recognized several situations where an employee's resignation may have been involuntary. They include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;an employee resigns under duress brought on by government action, (2) an employee unsuccessfully tries to withdraw his resignation before its effective date, (3) an employee submits a resignation under time pressure,...(4) an employee fails to understand the situation due to mental incompetence,...[and (5) the resignation was] obtained by agency misrepresentation or deception.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Scharf v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (citations omitted). Here, Johnson suggests that her resignation was involuntary due to time pressure, duress, and/or misrepresentation. Taking her allegations as true we may assume that in the last week of work Johnson was repeatedly asked by DVA officers when her last day of work would be, and she was advised by the Human Resources Department to resign. Without more, these actions do not raise a non-frivolous allegation that her decision to resign was involuntary or somehow coerced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts have, on occasion, allowed employees to appeal when faced with insufficient time to make the resignation decision, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Perlman v. United States</span>, 490 F.2d 928 (Ct. Cl. 1974), but these instances usually require that the agency demand an immediate decision. <span class="Italic">See Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1126 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (two weeks to decide whether to resign was not sufficient time pressure to make the choice involuntary). In <span class="Italic">Perlman</span>, the Court of Claims held that an employee's decision to retire was involuntary when he had inadequate time to determine his appeal rights and inadequate assistance to inform him of his rights. The employee was notified that he would be terminated in a RIF on June 24, 1971. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 930. He was later informed by a personnel specialist that he could retire by May 31, 1971 and receive a greater annuity benefit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In an interest to protect his appeal rights, he sought advice from the Civil Service Commission ("CSC"), but he was unable to contact the CSC and determine his appeal rights. Facing the deadline, he was forced to retire in order to preserve the financial benefit of the increased annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 931.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish involuntary removal by misinformation or deception, we do not require intentional misinformation. <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Negligent or innocent misinformation will suffice if the employee relied on the misinformation to his or her detriment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the allegations that she was under time constraints and pressure to make the decision do not overcome the fact that there was a decision to be made. Without more, repeated requests by agency supervisors and officials asking when her last day would be do not rise to the level of no realistic alternative but to resign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, her contention that Bruzzell advised her to resign is no indication that the agency has somehow misled her into believing that her appeal rights would be secure or that the agency misinformed her of the consequences. Johnson had three-and-a-half weeks to make her decision after the deciding official announced her removal. This was sufficient time for her to make an informed decision and her allegations fail to raise any facts of coercion, duress, or deception on the part of the DVA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Pascal v. United States</span>, 543 F.2d 1284, 1288 (Ct. Cl. 1976) (to be an appealable matter, the coercion must actually result in resignation: "Plaintiff...cannot expect to be placed in a better position simply because the alleged coercion failed to gain its objective[.]")</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A different result was reached in <span class="Italic">Gettings v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 48 MSPR 502, 509-12 (1991), when the appellant was essentially told to clear out by day's end:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Voluntary actions taken by an employee are excluded from the adverse action protections of 5 USC 7513. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 752.401(b)(9). An involuntary resignation is tantamount to a removal, however, and may therefore be appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">Spiegel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2 MSPB 307, 2 MSPR 140, 141 (1980). Although a resignation is presumed to be voluntary, that presumption may be rebutted by evidence which shows that the resignation was coerced or otherwise involuntarily submitted. <span class="Italic">Davis v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 268, 270 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 809 F.2d 791 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that on December 5, 1989, the appellant signed and dated Part E of a Request for Personnel Action form, entitled "Employee Resignation/Retirement." It is also undisputed that the typed portions of the SF-52, which had been prepared by agency officials prior to the appellant's execution, indicated that the action being requested was a separation, not a resignation. The circumstances under which the appellant came to sign Part E of the form were the subject of conflicting testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the appellant's testimony, he was advised on the evening of December 4 that his separation was being stayed until the deciding official could respond to his attorney's letter regarding his proposed separation. On December 5, however, the deciding official issued a response affirming the agency's decision to effect the separation that day, and the appellant's supervisor was adamant that the separation be processed that day. The appellant's last stop in clearing the base was the Personnel Office, where he saw Nina White, a Personnel Actions Clerk. He and Ms. White had a discussion about the nature of his leaving the base, in which he told her that he was not resigning. Ms. White then left his presence to consult someone else, and, when she came back, she informed him that the agency would let him resign. The appellant says he then reiterated that he was not resigning, but was being separated, and refused to sign the form. When Ms. White told him that he had to sign the form in order to clear the base, he told her that he disagreed with what was being done, but that he would sign the form because he had been instructed that he had to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. White testified that she processes voluntary resignations and retirements only, and that a large sign attached to a partition by her desk identifies it as the "Resignation Desk." She said she was in doubt whether she should process the SF-52 the appellant brought to her desk on December 5, since it indicated that the appellant was being separated. When she asked the appellant if he was resigning, he did not respond. She then consulted with officials at the office that normally handles separations, and was advised that she should let the appellant resign if he wanted to do so. When she so informed the appellant, he again gave no response. She then asked him to fill out the four blocks at the bottom of Part E of the form, along with the reason for his resignation. He said he did not want to give a reason for the resignation, but completed the other items as requested. She then made a notation on the SF-52, in the appellant's presence, documenting his declination. Ms. White testified that at no time did the appellant say he was not resigning.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1951"></span>A key factor in the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant voluntarily resigned was his finding that the appellant did not at any point tell Ms. White that he was not resigning, but was being separated for cause. In resolving this credibility determination in favor of Ms. White's testimony, the administrative judge properly considered whether she had a motive to slant her testimony against the appellant, but he failed to consider fully the plausibility of her story compared to that of the appellant.... According to Ms. White, the appellant simply stood mute at two critical junctures--when she asked him if he was resigning or being separated for cause, and when she told him that the agency would allow him to resign if he wanted to do so. Such a lack of response appears unlikely in itself; more implausible yet is that Ms. White would proceed with a resignation without insisting on some expression of intent on the appellant's part. We find the appellant's testimony that he told Ms. White that he was not resigning to be inherently more credible than Ms. White's version of events....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge cited several reasons for finding Ms. White's testimony to be more credible than the appellant's: (1) The lack of an agency motive to seek the appellant's resignation when it had already initiated a separation action; (2) the deposition testimony of the appellant's supervisor, who recounted several incidents during the fall of 1989 in which the appellant threatened to resign; (3) the appellant's failure to call his lawyer from the Personnel Office if he felt that his termination was being improperly processed as a resignation rather than as a separation, when the appellant had talked to his lawyer on two previous occasions that day; (4) the fact that the appellant left the base about a half hour before the end of his scheduled shift; and (5) the lack of any showing of misrepresentation on the agency's part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While these factors are relevant, we do not find them persuasive. Although the appellant's supervisor recounted several incidents during the fall of 1989 in which the appellant threatened to resign, none of these incidents occurred after the agency's notice of proposed separation or are temporally proximate to the appellant's intent on December 5, 1989. Regarding the agency's motivation to seek the appellant's resignation when it had already initiated a separation action, the administrative judge acknowledged that a resignation would avoid the necessity of adverse action procedures. And, although the agency was contending that the appellant had only the limited appeal rights of a probationer, it knew that he was contesting this contention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One factor to be weighed in determining the voluntariness of a resignation is whether the individual had adequate time to consider what course of action to take. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vandiver v. GAO</span>, 3 MSPB 158, 3 MSPR 38, 41 (1980). The undisputed testimony here was that the appellant's supervisor told him on December 5 that he must clear the base that day. However, when he got to the Personnel Office, he was told that the agency would allow him to resign, a possibility that had not previously been raised by the agency or by the appellant at any time subsequent to the issuance of the notice of proposed separation. The personnel clerk, Ms. White, insisted that the appellant sign the resignation portion of the separation form to finish processing his separation that day, even though it is undisputed that the appellant at no time said he was resigning. Thus, although the appellant was aware that he was signing the resignation portion, we find that the circumstances of his signing, including the manner in which this option was presented to him and the lack of sufficient time to understand the import of his actions, was coercive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vandiver v. GAO</span>, 3 MSPR at 41. We therefore conclude that the appellant's resignation was involuntary and that he has met his burden of establishing the Board's jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Four hours was, however, enough to consider a resignation, resulting in some benefit to the appellant, and it was determined by the Federal Circuit that a constructive removal was not established in <span class="Italic">Parrott v. MSPB</span>, 519 F.3d 1328, 1331-35 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (reviewing 104 MSPR 171 (2006)). The appellant was assistant federal security director at an airport. An investigation turned up some irregularities concerning some baggage loaded on airplanes. A proposal for removal was prepared and its contents were described to Mr. Parrott, although he was not given a copy of the notice. Mr. Parrott was given four hours to consider a series of options. He chose resignation coupled with avoidance of a bad reference and then he appealed the resignation as a constructive discharge. The court concluded that he was not under undue time pressure when he agreed to retire rather than receive and defend against the proposed removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 27, 2005, at approximately 10:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, Thomas Mulhern, TSA's Program Executive Officer for Employee Relations; Dario Compain, TSA's Southeast Area Director; and Kathleen Connon, a TSA attorney-advisor, met with Mr. Parrott at RDU. Mr. Compain began the meeting by stating that TSA had decided that Mr. Parrott and Mr. Juhl should be relieved of their duties immediately. Mr. Compain also stated that PRB had decided to issue a notice of proposed removal to Mr. Parrott and that he was prepared to present the notice that day. Mr. Compain explained the nature of the charges in the notice and indicated that a security breach in which 200 unscreened bags were placed on airplanes at RDU served as at least partial justification for the proposed removal action. Mr. Parrott asked to read the notice of proposed removal. Mr. Compain refused, however, stating that Mr. Parrott could only read the notice when it was formally served on him. After Mr. Compain left the meeting, Mr. Mulhern explained to Mr. Parrott that he had three options: (a) receive the notice of proposed removal and later resign in lieu of termination; (b) respond to the removal notice before Theresa Bertucci, an Assistant Administrator for TSA, who would be the deciding official; or (c) resign that day for "personal reasons." Ms. Connon explained the PRB process to Mr. Parrott, as well as the process involved in an appeal to the Board. Mr. Parrott then had approximately one hour alone to make phone calls and consider his options. During this period, he unsuccessfully sought to contact his attorney.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Eventually, Mr. Parrott decided to accept the option of resigning for personal reasons. In that regard, Mr. Mulhern reviewed with him a sample agreement and discussed with him the terms of his contemplated resignation (such as effective date, matters relating to annual and administrative leave, and information TSA would provide to prospective employers). Eventually, Mr. Mulhern gave Mr. Parrott a draft agreement to review. After certain changes were made, Mr. Mulhern provided Mr. Parrott with the final agreement, which was titled "SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE." Before Mr. Parrott signed the agreement, Mr. Mulhern asked him if he was sure he wanted to resign. Mr. Parrott responded that he was and signed the agreement. The agreement provided that Mr. Parrott and TSA were voluntarily entering into the agreement in order to settle all claims between them; that Mr. Parrott would resign in lieu of being subject to other administrative action; that the agreement was reached freely and voluntarily; and that Mr. Parrott waived all appellate rights, including the right to appeal to the Board. Mr. Parrott signed the settlement agreement around 2:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> and submitted his letter of resignation. In the letter, Mr. Parrott stated that he was resigning from TSA for personal reasons. Roughly four hours elapsed between Mr. Parrott's being informed of the proposed removal action and the submission of his resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 18, 2005, Mr. Parrott filed an appeal with the Board, alleging that his resignation was involuntary and therefore constituted a constructive removal. The appeal was dismissed as premature, however, because, pursuant to his agreement with TSA, Mr. Parrott's resignation was not effective until September 30, 2005. Mr. Parrott re-filed his appeal on October 27, 2005, again alleging an involuntary resignation and constructive removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Addressing the jurisdictional issue presented by Mr. Parrott's appeal, the AJ determined that Mr. Parrott had made non-frivolous allegations of Board jurisdiction so as to entitle him to a hearing on the voluntariness of his resignation. Thereafter, following a hearing in which he found the facts set forth above, the AJ ruled that Mr. Parrott had failed to establish that his resignation was involuntary. The AJ determined that the TSA did not impose the terms of the settlement agreement upon Mr. Parrott, finding that TSA adequately explained the proposed removal and gave Mr. Parrott sufficient time to make his decision. The AJ also determined that Mr. Parrott possessed reasonable alternatives to resignation for personal reasons insofar as he could have waited to receive the notice of proposed removal and resigned thereafter, or he could have attempted to appeal the proposed termination. Notwithstanding the time constraint placed upon Mr. Parrott, the AJ determined that TSA had not engaged in coercive conduct because it had given Mr. Parrott sufficient time in which to make an informed decision. Thus, the AJ concluded that Mr. Parrott's resignation was voluntary and that the Board therefore did not possess jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In due course, the <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span> became the final decision of the Board when the Board denied Mr. Parrott's petition for review for failure to meet the criteria for review set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(d). <span class="Italic">See generally Final Decision</span>. Board Member Sapin, however, dissented from the denial of the petition for review. In her dissent, Member Sapin focused on the short period of time Mr. Parrott had to consider the three options that Mr. Mulhern presented to him, the fact that TSA refused to allow Mr. Parrott additional time to contact his attorney, and the refusal of TSA to show Mr. Parrott the notice of proposed removal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 178-79, 181 (Sapin, Member, dissenting). In Member Sapin's view, TSA had failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for its decision to limit Mr. Parrott's time for decision to a relatively short period of time on May 27th. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 179. Accordingly, Member Sapin concluded that Mr. Parrott had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that his resignation was involuntary, thereby establishing Board jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 182.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Board Chairman McPhie wrote a concurring opinion responding to Member Sapin's dissent. Chairman McPhie emphasized the email that Mr. Parrott had received, which signaled in advance the possibility of his removal; the fact that TSA need not have given Mr. Parrott the option of resigning for personal reasons, thereby rendering any time pressure <span id="Page_1952"></span>in determining whether to do so irrelevant; and the fact that TSA acted properly in not presenting the notice of proposed removal to Mr. Parrott, inasmuch as doing so would have limited his ability to resign for personal reasons.[4] <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 173-75 (McPhie, Chairman, concurring). Thus, Chairman McPhie concluded that, because Mr. Parrott had failed to prove the involuntariness of his resignation, he had failed to establish Board jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 175-76.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Chairman McPhie wrote: "[The Office of Personnel Management's] instructions to personnel offices provide that when an employee with appeal rights submits a resignation after being notified in writing of a proposed disciplinary action, the<span class="Italic"> circumstances of the resignation must be recorded in the employee's official file."</span> <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. at 175 (McPhie, Chairman, concurring) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Guide to Processing Personnel Actions</span> 31-5, <span class="Italic">available at</span> <a href="http://www.opm.gov/feddata/gppa/gppa31.pdf">http://www.opm.gov/feddata/gppa/gppa31.pdf</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa31.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa31.pdf</a>]. ("Agency findings should be documented...when the employee has appeal rights <span class="Italic">and</span> has been notified <span class="Italic">in writing</span> of an agency action <span class="Italic">BEFORE</span> the resignation was submitted." (emphases in original)). Therefore, had Mr. Parrott received the notice of proposed removal, TSA would have been required to record the reason for his removal in his personnel file, thus limiting Mr. Parrott's ability to state that his resignation was for "personal reasons."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Mr. Parrott challenges the Board's conclusion that his resignation was voluntary. In so doing, he focuses on the short period of time he was given to decide whether to accept the terms of the settlement agreement and resign for personal reasons in lieu of having TSA proceed with its removal action. <span class="Italic">Citing Terban v. Department of Energy,</span> 216 F.3d 1021 (Fed. Cir. 2000), and <span class="Italic">Middleton v. Department of Defense,</span> 185 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1999), Mr. Parrott contends that the Board erred as a matter of law in failing to consider, in connection with the issue of involuntariness, the time pressure that he was under. We do not agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that, in <span class="Italic">Terban,</span> we stated that "the most probative evidence of involuntariness will usually be evidence in which there is a relatively short period of time between the employer's alleged coercive act and the employee's retirement." 216 F.3d at 1024. In this case, however, there was no "coercive act" on the part of TSA. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) and TSA Management Directive No. 1100.75-3 6(H)(3), Mr. Parrott was entitled to receive 30 days' advance notice of a proposed removal, stating the reason for the action; the evidence supporting it; and his rights with respect to representation. Mr. Parrott also was entitled to a reasonable time to respond to the action orally and in writing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2); TSA Management Directive No. 1100.75-3 6(H)(3)(a)(1)(d). To comply with these provisions, TSA could have simply served upon Mr. Parrott the notice of proposed removal, after which the only options available to him would have been a resignation in lieu of termination or a challenge to the proposed action. Instead, as seen, TSA chose to offer Mr. Parrott a third, more attractive option: resignation for personal reasons. By resigning prior to the service of the notice of proposed removal, Mr. Parrott managed to obtain certain concessions on the part of TSA and avoid a negative employment reference that would have arisen had he been removed or had he resigned after service of the removal notice. Thus, rather than just presenting Mr. Parrott with a notice of proposed removal, which is all it was required to do, TSA offered Mr. Parrott an option that it was under no obligation to provide, one that offered benefits to Mr. Parrott. In that setting, giving Mr. Parrott only a short time period within which to accept that option was not coercive, since having an additional, and potentially attractive, choice could only have been of benefit to him, even though he might have preferred to have that choice remain open for a longer period of time. <span class="Italic">See Staats,</span> 99 F.3d at 1126 (Time pressure felt by Staats "was the product of his desire not to forfeit those benefits [early retirement and lump-sum bonus], which the agency was not required to offer in the first place."). We thus agree with Board Chairman McPhie that "[a]lthough [Mr. Parrott] was presented with a difficult choice on May 27, 2005, neither the choice itself not the circumstances under which it was made were the result of improper agency action." <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. at 175 (McPhie, Chairman, concurring).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other words, when, on May 27, 2005, Mr. Mulhern presented Mr. Parrott with the option of resigning that day for personal reasons, he did not engage in a "coercive act." Under these circumstances, the fact that Mr. Parrott had a relatively short period of time to decide whether to sign the settlement agreement and resign in lieu of receiving the notice of proposed removal did not render his resignation involuntary. "[A] choice is not involuntary simply because an employee is faced with an inherently unpleasant situation or his choice is limited to two unpleasant alternatives." <span class="Italic">Terban,</span> 216 F.3d at 1026 <span class="Italic">(citing Covington v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, because TSA did not engage in coercive conduct, this case is entirely different from <span class="Italic">Middleton,</span> upon which Mr. Parrott relies. In that case, Dr. John Middleton was informed that he was being removed from his position as an assistant principal at a high school located on a United States Army base in Turkey. <span class="Italic">Middleton,</span> 185 F.3d at 1378. Prior to the effective date of his removal, Dr. Middleton retired pursuant to a settlement agreement with his employer, the Department of Defense Dependent Schools ("DODDS"). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1377-78. Subsequently, he appealed to the Board, contending that his retirement was involuntary because it was the product of coercion, duress, and misinformation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1378. Upon concluding that Dr. Middleton had failed to make non-frivolous allegations of involuntariness to warrant a hearing, the Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1377. Dr. Middleton then petitioned this court for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, we held that Dr. Middleton had in fact made non-frivolous allegations of involuntariness so as to entitle him to a hearing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1380. We therefore vacated the decision of the Board that it lacked jurisdiction and remanded the case to the Board for a hearing on the issue of voluntariness. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1377. Dr. Middleton alleged that, at a time when he had recently undergone surgery for kidney stones, was recovering from broken ribs and a gallbladder operation, and was suffering from prostate cancer, DODDS put him under extreme time pressure to leave Turkey. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1381-82. He also alleged that he was given incorrect information concerning retention of benefits and Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1381-83. <span class="Italic">Middleton</span> does not help Mr. Parrot because, in this case, the TSA did not engage in coercive acts, let alone the kind of coercive acts alleged in <span class="Italic">Middleton.</span></p>

DOD,</span> PH-315H-16-0437-I-1 (NP 1/24/2023) ("Regarding the appellant's assertion that she resigned under duress because she was provided only 24 hours to decide whether to resign or face removal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has found under similar circumstances that giving an appellant approximately 1 hour to decide whether to resign or face discipline did not make the decision involuntary because the agency was not obligated to make the offer at all. <span class="italic">See Parrott v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 519 F.3d 1328, 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2008)."); <span class="Italic">Blaske v.

Dept. of Interior</span>, 52 MSPR 357, 360 (1992) (a settlement providing for a resignation was not invalid when the appellant sought to change his mind the day after agreement; there was no assertion that appellant did not assent to the agreement, that the agency forced an immediate decision, that the appellant requested time to think it over, or that he was unable to do so); <span class="italic">cf.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Winn v. MSPB</span>, 335 Fed. Appx. 970 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), implied that a probationer might be able to get a hearing based on an involuntary resignation obtained through undue time pressure if the probationer was to be fired for preappointment reasons requiring regulatory due process.
