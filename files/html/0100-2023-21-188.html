<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-187"><span class="space">b.</span> Knowledge of Overpayment; Set-Aside Rule</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If the annuitant should know that he is being overpaid, he should set aside what he reasonably believes to be the overpayment rather than request waiver of that amount. The "set-aside" rule and its exceptions are described in <span class="Italic">Harrison v. OPM</span>, 57 MSPR 89, 92-95 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b), recovery of an annuity overpayment must be <span id="Page_4412"></span>waived when the annuitant "is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience." Guideline I.B.7. of OPM's <span class="Italic">1987 Policy Guidelines on the Disposition of Civil Service Retirement Overpayments (1987 Policy Guidelines)</span> states that recovery of an overpayment generally will be equitable when the overpayment resulted from OPM's untimely processing of an annuitant's voluntary election to change entitlements. Guideline I.C.4., entitled the "set-aside rule," provides that an individual who is found without fault, but who accepts a payment he suspects or knows to be erroneous, is obligated to set aside the overpaid money pending recovery by OPM. Within this class of debtors, the set-aside rule includes annuitants who are found without fault under guideline I.B.7. According to the set-aside rule, recovery in such cases is not against equity and good conscience absent "exceptional circumstances."<span class="Italic">1987 Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.C.4. at 7. The rule states that "[f]inancial hardship is not an exceptional circumstance."[3] <span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Guideline I.C.5.(d) of the <span class="Italic">1987 Policy Guidelines</span> states that OPM will automatically consider recovery of an overpayment not contrary to equity and good conscience if the overpayment is "caused by a nonremedial voluntary election with a retroactive effective date (i.e., an effective date preceding the election)." The guideline gives as an example of a nonremedial voluntary election a "post-retirement alternative annuity election that is retroactive to the annuity commencing date."<span class="Italic">1987 Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.C.5(d) at 7. Although guideline I.C.5.(d) arguably might apply here, we need not consider its probable effect because OPM did not rely on it in its reconsideration decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Slater v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 510 (1989), we found that OPM's set-aside rule was reasonable and that it was appropriately applied to recover that part of an overpayment accruing after the date the annuitant acknowledged receiving notice that his civil service retirement annuity would be reduced for receipt of Social Security benefits. In <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Office of Personnel Management</span> 46 MSPR 521, 522-23 (1990), we determined that financial hardship was unavailable as a basis for waiver under the set-aside rule when the facts showed the employee's awareness, at the time he received back pay due to reinstatement, that receipt of his retirement contributions was erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the inquiry into an annuitant's knowledge should focus on the period before or during the accrual of the overpayment. <span class="Italic">See Slater,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. at 517 (set-aside rule inapplicable to that part of an overpayment accruing before the annuitant knew or suspected that the amount of his annuity payments was improper); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. 352, 357 (1990) (after March 1975, annuitant should have known that remarriage was material in view of OPM's March 17, 1975, letter to him regarding remarriage), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 383 (1991) (Table). In this appeal, all but one month of the overpayment had accrued when OPM sent its June 7, 1990, letter informing the appellant of the reduction in his annuity. We remand for factual findings and credibility determinations regarding what the appellant knew or should have known before and during the period when the overpayment accrued. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v.

In making this determination, the administrative judge should apply the inquiry set forth in the <span class="Italic">1987 Policy Guidelines</span> for determining fault on the part of the overpayment debtor. <span class="Italic">See 1987 Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.B.4. at 3 (in determining fault on the part of the overpayment debtor, an inquiry should be conducted to ascertain the debtor's actual or presumed knowledge, taking into account factors such as the person's age, his mental and physical condition, and information supplied to him by OPM). Because the appellant's May 26, 1990, letter, to which OPM refers in its June 7, 1990, letter, is not in the record and may contain relevant information, the administrative judge should order its production.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Irrespective of whether financial hardship may be available as a ground for waiver or adjustment of the recovery schedule in this case, OPM's regulations also provide that recovery of an overpayment is against equity and good conscience when it is unconscionable under the circumstances.5 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403(a)(3); <span class="Italic">Aguon v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 540, 549-50 (1989). The unconscionability criterion is a high standard, and a waiver based on that criterion will be granted only under exceptional circumstances. <span class="Italic">Aguon,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. at 549. In determining whether recovery would be unconscionable, the Board applies a totality of the circumstances approach. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 550. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, cases where there has been an exceptionally lengthy delay by OPM in adjusting an annuity, OPM failed to act expeditiously to adjust an annuity in the face of specific notice, the annuitant was misinformed by OPM or a Federal agency, or his personal limitations would make collection manifestly unfair. <span class="Italic">See Derrico v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 491, 497 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an annuitant receives an overpayment because of concurrent receipt of Social Security benefits and notifies OPM of the overpayment, then under the "Prompt Notification Exception" in the OPM guidelines the annuitant is without fault in receipt of the overpayment and OPM (and the MSPB) must then consider whether collection of the overpayment is against equity and good conscience rather than whether exceptional circumstances should avoid collection of the overpayment. <span class="Italic">Boyd v.

<p class="Body-Text">Knowledge of overpayment, while it may defeat waiver of the overpayment, does not preclude adjustment of the payment schedule, <span class="Italic">Boone v. OPM</span>, 119 MSPR 53, 56-59 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-12, 2012 MSPB 132 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of establishing her entitlement to a waiver of recovery of the overpayment by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Knox v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 5 (2007). Generally, the recovery of a FERS overpayment should be waived if the recipient is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8470(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.301. Recovery is against equity and good conscience when it would cause financial hardship, the annuitant can show that she relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse, or recovery would be unconscionable under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Knox</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 8; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.303.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM policy also provides that individuals who know or suspect that they are receiving overpayments are expected to set aside the amount overpaid pending recoupment, and that in the absence of exceptional circumstances--which do not include financial hardship--recovery in these cases is not against equity and good conscience. <span class="Italic">Knox</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 8; Policy Guidelines on the Disposition of Overpayments under the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (Policy Guidelines) &#x00A7; I.C.4. In the instant case, the administrative judge found that the appellant did not contend that she was unaware of the set aside rule. On review, the appellant concedes that she knew she was probably receiving an overpayment, but not the extent of it. Thus, the appellant was required to set the overpayment aside in the absence of exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances involve extremely egregious errors or delays by OPM, such as the failure to issue a written decision within 4 years of a request for a waiver. <span class="Italic">Dorrello v. Office <span id="Page_4413"></span>of Personnel Management</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 535, &#x00B6; 7 (2002); Policy Guidelines &#x00A7; I.C.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that she demonstrated exceptional circumstances based on her health-related indebtedness and her financial problems. Among other things, the appellant asserts that she used her credit cards for living expenses and medical bills, resulting in a $52,000 debt, and that she explained her financial situation in the Financial Resources Questionnaires (FRQ) she submitted to OPM on March 7, 2011, and February 14, 2012.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we are sympathetic to the appellant's circumstances, we find that the hardships she describes are primarily financial and, as such, do not constitute exceptional circumstances that would warrant an exception to the set aside rule. <span class="Italic">Knox</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 8; Policy Guidelines &#x00A7; I.C.4. Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to demonstrate the exceptional circumstances necessary to waive collection of the overpayment under the circumstances of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant also argues that recovery of the overpayment would be unconscionable because of her various medical conditions. The unconscionability criterion is a high standard justifying waiver only under exceptional circumstances. <span class="Italic">Spinella v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 185, &#x00B6; 7 (2008); <span class="Italic">Aguon v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 540, 549 (1989). However, because the concept of unconscionability is generally defined in terms of broad, equitable considerations, the Board will consider all relevant factors using a "totality-of-the-circumstances" approach in order to determine whether recovery of an annuity overpayment is unconscionable in a given case. <span class="Italic">Aguon</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 550;109 M.S.P.R. 185, &#x00B6; 7. Thus, in determining whether recovery of a debt would be unconscionable under the circumstances, the Board may consider the appellant's medical condition as support for an allegation that collection of the overpayment would have a negative impact on the appellant because of her medical conditions, or that those medical conditions require expenditure of a portion of the installment amount. <span class="Italic">Thornhill v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 600, 602 (1996); <span class="Italic">see Dixon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 607, 610-11 (1994).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We recognize that <span class="Italic">Aguon</span> involved benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System and not FERS, but we have applied the principles articulated therein to FERS cases as well. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Spinella</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 185, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant provided limited medical evidence below and no such evidence on review. Furthermore, in her petition for review, the appellant asserts that despite her health problems she is still able to run her jewelry business, her administrative business, and her pet sitting business. Thus, we find that the appellant's assertions regarding her health and the limited evidence she provides fail to meet the high standard to establish unconscionability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's repayment schedule should be adjusted further because she has shown by substantial evidence that the current repayment schedule would cause her financial hardship</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant has not met her burden of proving that she is entitled to a waiver of recovery of the overpayment, she has met her burden of showing by substantial evidence that further adjustment of the repayment schedule is warranted. <span class="Italic">See Dorrello</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 535, &#x00B6; 7 (even if waiver of recovery is inappropriate, the repayment schedule may be adjusted based on financial hardship); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.307(b). In her February 14, 2012 FRQ, the appellant claims that her monthly expenses exceed her monthly income by $81 a month. In her initial decision, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant's monthly expenses exceed her monthly income by $31. OPM does not challenge this finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant's monthly expenses exceed her monthly income, the Board has reduced OPM's repayment schedule to $5 a month. <span class="Italic">Knox</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13; <span class="Italic">Dorrello</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 535, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10; <span class="Italic">Matthews v.

<p class="Body-Text">A factor in the analysis of fault in receipt of overpayment is the appellant's mental condition, <span class="Italic">Cordova v. OPM</span>, SF-0845-21-0545-I-1 (NP 2/15/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant argued before the administrative judge that, at the time she was approved for disability retirement under FERS, she was undergoing intense psychiatric treatment that prevented her from understanding the paperwork she had received from OPM; in other words, the appellant contended that her mental condition caused her to accept an erroneous payment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.302(b) (stating that an individual's mental condition may mitigate against finding fault if it contributed to the appellant's acceptance of an erroneous payment). Because resolving the factual question of whether the appellant's mental condition rendered her incapable of knowing or suspecting that she had received an overpayment may require credibility determinations that are best made first by the administrative judge, we remand the matter for further adjudication.</p>
