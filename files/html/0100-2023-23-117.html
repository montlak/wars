<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act Amendments added compensatory damages to the remedies available in whistleblower appeals. 5 CFR 1201.201 (2022) defines the term:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;The Civil Rights Act of 1991 (42 U.S.C. 1981a) authorizes an award of compensatory damages to a prevailing party who is found to have been intentionally discriminated against based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or disability. The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (5 U.S.C. 1221(g)) also authorizes an award of compensatory damages in cases where the Board orders corrective action. Compensatory damages include pecuniary losses, future pecuniary losses, and nonpecuniary losses, such as emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 CFR 1201.202(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/KING_BARBARA_R_DA_0752_09_0604_P_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_883094.pdf">119 MSPR 663</a>, 667-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-31, 2013 MSPB 62 (2013), described the legislative amendment and determined that compensatory damages would not be available in appeals pending on the effective date of the statute, December 27, 2012:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Congress did not expressly provide that the terms of the WPEA would apply retroactively to conduct occurring before its enactment</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recently held that the analytical approach set forth in <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> is the appropriate framework for determining whether the provisions of the WPEA should be given retroactive effect. <span class="Italic">See Day v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 2013 MSPB 49, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9. In <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, the Court addressed the question of retroactive application of section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which provided the right to a jury trial and the right to recover compensatory and punitive damages for violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 247. At the outset of its discussion of that issue, the Court noted the tension between two established canons of statutory interpretation, i.e., the presumption against statutory retroactivity and the principle that courts should apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 263-64 (internal citations omitted). In resolving that tension, the Court identified the following process for determining whether to apply a new statute to pending cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i. e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed. If the statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 280. While recognizing that, in many cases, "retroactive application of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more fully," the Court deemed that consideration insufficient to rebut the presumption against retroactivity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 285-86.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Congress intends for statutory language to apply retroactively, it is capable of doing so very clearly. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Presidio Components, Inc. v. American Technical Ceramics Corp</span>., 702 F.3d 1351, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (giving retroactive effect to amendments enacted in 2011 in light of express statutory language applying the amendments to "all cases, without exception, that are pending on, or commenced on or after, the date of the enactment of this Act"). Here, Congress did not expressly define the temporal reach of section 107(b) of the WPEA. Rather, it provided that, with the exception of provisions not at issue in this appeal, the Act would become effective 30 days after its enactment. WPEA &#x00A7; 202. "A statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date." <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 257. If anything, the fact that the effective date was 30 days after enactment suggests that retroactivity was not intended. <span class="Italic">See AT&#x0026;T Corp. v. Hulteen</span>, 556 U.S. 701, 713 (2009) (citing the fact that the relevant provisions of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act took effect 180 days after enactment as evidence that those provisions were not intended to have retroactive effect).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite clear indication in the legislative history[2] that at least some in Congress were aware of the issue concerning the temporal scope of the <span id="Page_4953"></span>WPEA, Congress did not expressly include language in the Act providing for its retroactive application. Consequently, we must determine, under <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, whether the WPEA impairs the parties' respective rights, increases a party's liability for past conduct, or imposes new duties with respect to past transactions. As discussed below, we find that retroactive application of section 107(b) would be impermissible under <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> because it would alter the parties' respective liabilities as Congress initially contemplated in enacting the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The committee report accompanying the Senate bill that was eventually approved by both houses of Congress and signed into law by the President states in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The Committee expects and intends that the Act's provisions shall be applied in OSC, MSPB, and judicial proceedings initiated by or on behalf of a whistleblower and pending on or after that effective date. Such application is expected and appropriate because the legislation generally corrects erroneous decisions by the MSPB and the courts; removes and compensates for burdens that were wrongfully imposed on individual whistleblowers exercising their rights in the public interest; and improves the rules of administrative and judicial procedure and jurisdiction applicable to the vindication of whistleblowers' rights.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court stated in <span class="Italic">Morissette v. United States</span>, 342 U.S. 246, 263 (1952):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed. In such case, absence of contrary direction may be taken as satisfaction with widely accepted definitions, not as a departure from them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, it is an accepted principle in statutory construction that, absent legislative intent to the contrary, legal terms in a statute are presumed to have their common law meaning. 2A Norman J. Singer, <span class="Italic">Statutes and Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 47:30 (6th ed. 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, determined that the term "consequential changes" in the WPA was "obviously a mistake" and the provision should be construed as providing for recovery of "consequential damages." <span class="Italic">See Bohac v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 239 F.3d 1334, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In interpreting the provision, the court found that "historically there was no uniform common law rule...allowing recovery of non-pecuniary damages, much less an established common law meaning of the term 'consequential damages' that would include non-pecuniary damages in the context of contract law." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1341. The court also noted that, since this damages provision concerns a waiver of sovereign immunity, the waiver must be "unequivocally expressed in the statutory text and will not be implied." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1339 (quoting <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996)) (citation omitted). In addition, the court found that "a waiver of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign." <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, 239 F.3d at 1339 (citation omitted). Accordingly, the court held that the "consequential damages" provision in section 1221(g) was "limited to reimbursement of out of pocket costs and [did] not include non-pecuniary damages." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1343.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court further noted that, if Congress had intended an appellant's recovery to include non-pecuniary damages, it likely would have used the common law term of "compensatory damages." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1341. "'Compensatory damages' are the damages awarded to a person as compensation, indemnity or restitution for harm sustained by him." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Restatement (Second) of Torts</span> &#x00A7; 903 (1979)). They are divided into two categories: pecuniary and non-pecuniary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Restatement</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 905 and 906). Pecuniary damages are awards for injuries that are subject to more or less definite standards of certainty, such as "out of pocket" losses. Restatement &#x00A7; 906. In comparison, non-pecuniary damages are "given for pain and humiliation," and "there can only be a very rough correspondence between the amount awarded as damages and the extent of the suffering." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7; 903. In <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, the court concluded that it is "well-understood that the common law term 'compensatory damages' includes non-pecuniary damages such as pain and suffering." <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, 239 F.3d at 1341.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPEA has now amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii) to provide that, if the Board orders corrective action, such corrective action may include "back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, <span class="Italic">any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages, and compensatory damages (including interest, reasonable expert witness fees, and costs</span>)." WPEA, &#x00A7; 107(b) (emphasis added). Congress thus not only corrected the WPA's mistaken use of the term "consequential changes" but added "compensatory damages" to the relief available to whistleblowers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that section 107(b) is an important change in the law that attaches new legal consequences for events completed before its enactment. Indeed, the issue presented here is nearly indistinguishable from <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>. In <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, the Court examined a similar amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act authorizing the award of compensatory damages for acts of intentional employment discrimination. The Court stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Unlike certain other forms of relief, compensatory damages are quintessentially backward looking. Compensatory damages may be <span class="Italic">intended</span> less to sanction wrongdoers than to make victims whole, but they do so by a mechanism that affects the liabilities of defendants. They do not "compensate" by distributing funds from the public coffers, but by requiring particular employers to pay for harms they caused. The introduction of a right to compensatory damages is also the type of legal change that would have an impact on private parties' planning. In this case, the event to which the new damages provision relates is the discriminatory conduct of respondents' agent John Williams; if applied here, that provision would attach an important new legal burden to that conduct. The new damages remedy in &#x00A7; 102, we conclude, is the kind of provision that does not apply to events antedating its enactment in the absence of clear congressional intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 282-83. Although <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> concerned the liability of a private sector employer, the federal courts subsequently applied its holding on retroactivity to pre-enactment compensatory damages claims brought by federal employees against the United States.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Tomasello v. Rubin</span>, 167 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">DeNovellis v. Shalala</span>, 124 F.3d 298, 306-07 (1st Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Chenault v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 F.3d 535 (9th Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's protected disclosures and the agency's retaliatory personnel actions took place several years before the effective date of the WPEA. The addition of compensatory damages significantly alters the consequences of these relevant past events and would undeniably attach an important new legal burden to the agency's past conduct that did not previously exist.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Federal Circuit has adopted a three-part test to examine the issue of whether a change in the law has an impermissible retroactive effect under <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>. They are: (1) "the nature and extent of the change of the law"; (2) "the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event"; and (3) "familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations." <span class="Italic">See Princess Cruises, Inc. v. United States</span>, 397 F.3d 1358, 1362-63 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Because we find that the Landgraf holding directly controls in this appeal, it is unnecessary to use the <span class="Italic">Princess Cruises</span> test in this appeal. Nevertheless, if we were to apply the test here, we would reach the same result that section 107(b) cannot be applied retroactively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We affirm, therefore, the administrative judge's ruling on retroactivity. However, we note the Court's statement in <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> that "there is no special reason to think that all the diverse provisions of [an] Act must be treated uniformly" for purposes of retroactivity. <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 280. Therefore, our decision in this appeal does not necessarily apply to other provisions of the WPEA, and the question of whether a particular provision of the Act would have an impermissible retroactive effect must be addressed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 107(b) cannot be retroactively applied because Congress did not expressly waive sovereign immunity for pre-enactment conduct</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has held that a "waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text" and "a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed in terms of its scope in favor of the sovereign." <span class="Italic">See Lane</span>, 518 U.S. <span id="Page_4954"></span>at 192. Thus, "when confronted with a purported waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity, the Court will 'construe ambiguities in favor of immunity."' <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 192-93 (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Williams</span>, 514 U.S. 527 (1995)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question presented here is not whether Congress consented to the federal government being sued for compensatory damages under the WPEA. The statute clearly authorizes such recovery in section 107(b). Rather, the question at issue concerns the temporal scope of that waiver, i.e., whether the Act unambiguously expressed that compensatory damages may be awarded for violations of the WPA that preceded the WPEA's enactment. The Supreme Court has recently stated that "the scope of Congress' waiver [must] be clearly discernible from the statutory text in light of traditional interpretative tools. If it is not, then we take the interpretation most favorable to the Government." <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration v. Cooper</span>, 132 S. Ct. 1441, 1448 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is nothing in the express language of the WPEA from which we can discern congressional intent to waive sovereign immunity with regard to compensatory damages for violations of the WPA that preceded the enactment of the WPEA. On the contrary, the fact that Congress established the effective date of most provisions of the WPEA, including section 107(b), to be 30 days from the date of enactment indicates that Congress did not intend the waiver of sovereign immunity in section 107(b) to be applied to conduct that occurred before enactment. <span class="Italic">See Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 257; <span class="Italic">see also Hulteen</span>, 556 U.S. at 713. Absent any basis in the text of the WPEA to suggest that Congress intended the waiver of immunity to attach to remedies awarded based on pre-enactment conduct, we are obliged to interpret the waiver of sovereign immunity in section 107(b) in a way most favorable to the government. <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, 132 S. Ct. at 1448. Consequently, we find that the new provision authorizing the award of compensatory damages only applies to conduct and actions that occurred after the effective date of the WPEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 107(b) of the WPEA does not clarify the WPA</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not dispute that the retroactive application of the compensatory damages provision will attach new legal consequences to events completed before the WPEA's enactment. Instead, she and several amici primarily argue that Congress enacted section 107(b) to clarify prior erroneous interpretations of the term "consequential damages" by the court and the Board. In <span class="Italic">Day</span>, the majority of the Board set out the standards for applying the legal principle of "clarification," stating the following:</p>

Martin Gas Sales</span>, 979 F.2d 887, 890 (1st Cir. 1992). When legislation clarifies existing law, its application to pre-enactment conduct does not raise concerns of retroactivity. <span class="Italic">See Levy v. Sterling Holding Co</span>., 544 F.3d 493, 506 (3d Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Cookeville Regional Medical Center v. Leavitt</span>, 531 F.3d 844, 849 (D.C.

United States</span>, 397 F.3d 1358, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (categorizing rules or applications of rules as "clarifications" or "changes" provides little insight into whether a retroactive effect under <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> would result in a particular case).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In determining whether a new law clarifies existing law, "[t]here is no bright-line test." <span class="Italic">Levy</span>, 544 F.3d at 506 (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Marmolejos</span>, 140 F.3d 488, 491 (3d Cir. 1998)). For example, many courts have deemed significant any declaration by the enacting body of intent to clarify. <span class="Italic">See Cortes</span>, 177 F.3d at 1284 (citing to <span class="Italic">Consumer Product Safety Commission v.

Federal Communications Commission</span>, 395 U.S. 367, 380-81 (1969). In addition, other factors relevant in determining whether legislative enactment clarifies rather than effects a substantive change in existing law are the presence of ambiguity in the preceding statute and the extent to which the new law resolves the ambiguity and comports with both the prior statute and any prior administrative interpretation. <span class="Italic">Levy</span>, 544 F.3d at 507.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Day</span>, 2013 MSPB 49, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11. But see Member Robbins' dissent in <span class="Italic">Day</span>, 2013 MSPB 49 (rejecting application of the "clarification doctrine" in cases before the Board because our reviewing court found, in <span class="Italic">Princess Cruises</span>, that the doctrine is inapplicable to retroactivity analysis).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant relies upon the WPEA's preamble to argue that Congress intended the Act in its entirety to be applied retroactively. The preamble states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An Act</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To amend chapter 23 of title 5, United States Code, to clarify the disclosures of information protected from prohibited personnel practices, require a statement in non-disclosure policies, forms and agreements that such policies, forms, and agreements conform with certain disclosure protections, provide certain authority for the Special Counsel, and for other purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language in the preamble does not support the appellant's contention that the "entire act" is a clarification of pre-existing law. "It is an elementary rule of construction that effect must be given, if possible, to every word, clause and sentence of a statute." <span class="Italic">United States v. Menasche</span>, 348 U.S. 528 (1955). The preamble states that the Act's purpose is "to clarify the disclosures of information" that are protected under the WPA. On its face, the word "clarify" as used here only modifies what is deemed to be a protected disclosure. Moreover, construing the appearance of "clarifying" in the preamble as evidence that the WPEA was generally enacted for the purpose of clarifying pre-existing law renders meaningless the other provisions in the preamble indicating that among the other purposes to be served by enactment of the WPEA is the creation of new requirements for non-disclosure agreements and the expansion of the authority given to the Special Counsel. The appellant's argument that the entire Act is solely to clarify does not give effect to all of the provisions in the preamble.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Day</span>, the Board relied in part upon the foregoing language in the preamble to support its finding that Congress intended section 101 of the WPEA--which addressed the definition of protected disclosure--to be a "clarification" of the term "disclosure" in the WPA. <span class="Italic">Day</span>, 2013 MSPB 49, &#x00B6; 12. However, we also deemed it significant that section 101 was specifically enacted under a heading identifying it as a "clarification" of disclosures covered under the law. <span class="Italic">See</span> WPEA &#x00A7; 101. It is well accepted that "[w]here headings are enacted as part of an act, or as part of a code, or where there has been a revision, the headings may serve as an aid to the legislative intent." <span class="Italic">See</span> Singer<span class="Italic">, supra</span> &#x00A7; 47:14. Both the language in the preamble and the explicit legislative designation of section 101 as a clarifying provision supported our finding in Day that Congress enacted section 101 as a "clarification" of what constitutes a "disclosure" under the WPA. <span class="Italic">Day</span>, 2013 MSPB 49, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, here, there is simply no support in the statutory language for finding that Congress enacted section 107(b) for the purpose of clarifying existing law as it related to remedies. On the contrary, Congress enacted section 107 under the simple heading of "Remedies" without any modifying language indicating that Congress intended thereby to clarify the scope of remedies available under the WPA. WPEA &#x00A7; 107. Since Congress did use the term "clarification" when it enacted section 101, its decision to not similarly label section 107 creates a strong inference that it did not intend the latter provision to be applied retroactively under the "clarification" doctrine. <span class="Italic">See</span> Singer<span class="Italic">, supra</span> &#x00A7; 46:06 ("[w]hen the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another, the court assumes different meanings were intended. In like manner, where the legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her "clarification" argument, the appellant asserts that Congress originally intended the WPA's provision for "consequential damages" to be broadly interpreted to include "compensatory damages" and that the Federal Circuit improperly interpreted the term to be narrowly limited to only pecuniary damages. Some amici also argue that the definition of "consequential" damages in the WPA should have been broadly construed to include all damages, including "compensatory damages," because non-pecuniary pain and suffering injuries are included within the scope of "consequential" damages when they are the result of wrongful conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, the Federal Circuit rejected this argument, finding that "[m]any of the authorities discussing the term 'consequential damages' cited by the parties here do not reflect common law usage at all." 239 F.3d at 1339. We have reviewed the authorities cited by the appellant and amici and agree with the court's determination in <span class="Italic">Bohac</span> that they are "essentially unhelpful" in the context of this case. Furthermore, we agree with the court's well-reasoned analysis that Congress intended the definition of "consequential damages" in the WPA to be limited to the recovery of pecuniary damages. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1340.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we find that, to the extent that the meaning of "consequential damages" could be considered unclear in the WPA, Congress' intent can be determined by reference to its relationship with other words and phrases. Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span>, "where general words follow specific words in a statutory construction, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words." Singer, <span class="Italic">supra</span> &#x00A7; 47:17. Before the enactment of the WPEA, the law provided that, if the Board orders corrective action in an individual right of action appeal, it may include: "back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, <span id="Page_4955"></span>travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential changes." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(ii) (2012). The construction of this provision is a classic example of a general term, i.e., "consequential" damages, following a list of specific terms, which were a list of specific pecuniary injuries. The doctrine of <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span> considers the enumeration of specific terms to provide the definition of the class to which the general term follows. In other words, the use of "consequential" damages in the provision was a catchall reference to insure that other, similar types of pecuniary losses could be recovered. Singer, <span class="Italic">supra</span> &#x00A7; 47:17. Thus, we conclude that the term "consequential damages" did not include non-pecuniary injuries. <span class="Italic">See Bohac</span>, 239 F.3d at 1342.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, if the <span class="Italic">amici's</span> argument was correct, i.e., that "compensatory damages" are a sub-component of the broader concept of "consequential damages," it would mean that the addition of "compensatory damages" to section 107(b) is superfluous with no real meaning or effect. Furthermore, given Congress' express indication that some other provisions in the WPEA are "clarifications" of misinterpreted terms in the WPA, we find that, if Congress had also intended to correct an overly narrow interpretation of the WPA's pre-existing "consequential" damages remedy, it would have identified section 107(b) as a "clarification" and would have expressly re-defined the term to include "compensatory damages." Instead, Congress set out "compensatory damages" and "consequential damages" as two separate, distinct remedies available under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(ii). Therefore, we reject the contention that the definition of "consequential damages" must include "compensatory damages."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The law of the case doctrine does not apply</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge has already applied the WPEA retroactively to this appeal in finding her disclosures protected; therefore, under the law of the case doctrine, the issue of whether compensatory damages are available has already been established in this appeal. Under the law of the case doctrine, a decision on an issue of law made at one stage of a proceeding becomes a binding precedent to be followed in successive stages of the same litigation. <span class="Italic">Pawn v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6; 15 (2001). In <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 545, 552 (1993), the Board thoroughly examined precedent and legal treatises concerning the law of the case doctrine. It stated that the law of the case doctrine refers to the practice of refusing to reopen what has been decided and of following a prior decision in an appeal of the same case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It also noted that the law of the case doctrine "applies not only to matters which were explicitly decided in a prior decision, but also to matters decided by necessary implication" and that consistency derived from application of the law of the case doctrine avoids "the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserves judicial resources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the administrative judge applied the WPEA's clarification of "disclosures" retroactively in this appeal, we find that the law of the case doctrine is not applicable because the issue of whether compensatory damages are available is not an issue directly, or by necessary implication, decided in the administrative judge's prior decision on the merits. As we noted above, the question of whether a particular provision of the Act may be applied retroactively must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. There is no indication in the record that the administrative judge made any prior finding that the appellant was entitled to seek compensatory damages as part of the corrective action in this appeal. Therefore, the law of the case doctrine does not limit the Board's ability to review the issues raised in this interlocutory appeal.</p>

Dept. of Interior</span>, 122 MSPR 290, 292-95 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11, 2015 MSPB 23 (2015), rejected a continuing violation theory to impose damages for an action predating the WPEA that had continuing effects after the effective date of the statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant continues to argue that the significant change in his duties that began on June 30, 2012, was not a discrete act but rather "continuing conduct" because he continued to perform those duties until July 15, 2013. (citing <span class="Italic">National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan</span>, 536 U.S. 101, 115 (2002)). In advancing this argument, the appellant appears to argue that he is entitled to compensatory damages based on the continuing violation doctrine of liability. For the following reasons, we find that the continuing violation doctrine is inapplicable in this context.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, the Supreme Court held that discrete discriminatory or retaliatory acts are not actionable if an employee failed to timely file charges regarding such acts with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as required by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended (Title VII).[2] <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, 536 U.S. at 113-15. In so finding, the Court expressly rejected the view that related discrete acts occurring outside the statutory filing period could be deemed actionable if those discrete acts were part of a continuing violation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 114-15. For hostile work environment claims, however, the Court found that, as long as one of the acts comprising the claim occurred within the appropriate statute of limitations, all of the related acts comprising the claim could be actionable, even if those acts took place outside of the statutory time period. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 115-17. The Court reasoned that hostile work environment claims are different from discrete acts because, by their nature, they involve repeated conduct, a single incident of which may not be actionable on its own. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 115. Here, the appellant claims that he is entitled to compensatory damages because the significant change in his duties that occurred prior to the WPEA's enactment was not a discrete act but part of a continuing violation that extended through the date of the enactment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Court also recognized, however, that its ruling did not preclude the application of equitable doctrines that could toll or preclude application of the time limit in such cases. <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, 536 U.S. at 113.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, however, there is no issue regarding a statute of limitations. Under the WPEA, unlike under Title VII, there is no deadline for an appellant to file an administrative complaint that is associated with the date of the alleged retaliatory act. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a) (setting forth the procedures for filing a complaint of whistleblower retaliation with OSC), <span class="Italic">with</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105 (setting forth the procedures for filing an informal complaint under Title VII). Rather, the deadline to file before the Board attaches once OSC issues its closure letter, after which date the appellant has 65 days to file his appeal with the Board, or, if no closure letter was issued, any time after the expiration of 120 days after seeking corrective action from OSC. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a). Here, there is no dispute that the appellant timely filed his IRA appeal with the Board upon his receipt of OSC's closure letter. Accordingly, the continuing violation doctrine is inapplicable in this appeal because the doctrine relates to a determination regarding the timeliness of a claim rather than the availability of damages associated with that claim, as the appellant appears to assert.[3] <span class="Italic">See Morgan</span>, 536 U.S. at 119-20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;As the Court noted, explicit limitations on damages available under Title VII, including compensatory damages, punitive damages, and back pay, are found elsewhere in the statute. <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, 536 U.S. at 119-20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (the Act), Pub. L. No. 111-2, 123 Stat. 5,[4] does not compel a different result. The Act does not contain any provisions relevant to an agency's liability, an appellant's rights, or the availability of damages under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) or the WPEA. Nor do we find any provisions in the WPA or the WPEA that could be interpreted as contemplating a continuing violation theory of liability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Act, which applies to all claims of discrimination in compensation under Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and Title I and Section 503 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act pending on or after the effective date of the Act (January 29, 2009), clarifies that a discriminatory compensation decision occurs each time compensation is paid pursuant to the discriminatory decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, even if we were to recognize that the principles underlying the continuing violation theory of liability could be applied to expand the scope of damages under the WPEA as the appellant requests, he would not prevail on the facts of this case. The administrative judge properly found that the significant change in the appellant's duties was a discrete act occurring on June 30, 2012, and the appellant has provided no basis to disturb this finding. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iv), (xii); <span class="Italic">see also Morgan</span>, 536 U.S. at 114. Significantly, the appellant has failed to allege that the agency took any retaliatory action against him after the effective date of the WPEA. Rather, he contends that his continued performance of the changed duties through the effective date of the WPEA should constitute a continuing violation to receive the protections of the WPEA. His continued performance of the changed duties, however, is a consequence of the June 30, 2012 discrete act, and we find that these consequences do not constitute separate acts of reprisal or render the June 30, 2012 violation "continuing" under the WPEA. <span class="Italic">See Bosley v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 162 F.3d 665, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (holding that the appellant could not bring a WPA claim under a continuing violation theory regarding the denial of his quality step increase that occurred prior to the enactment of the WPA even though he continued to suffer the effects of the denial with each paycheck).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge properly found that the conduct and actions at issue in this appeal all took place before the effective date of the WPEA, an award of compensatory damages would have an impermissible retroactive effect. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee King</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 663, &#x00B6; 10. Accordingly, having received all of the relief that he could have received if the matter had been adjudicated and he had prevailed, we agree with <span id="Page_4956"></span>the administrative judge's finding that the appeal is moot.

<p class="Block-Quote1">"If the [MSPB] orders corrective action...such corrective action may include," <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "compensatory damages (including interest, reasonable expert witness fees, and costs)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A), (g)(1)(A)(ii).[6] "Compensatory damages include pecuniary losses, future pecuniary losses, and nonpecuniary losses such as emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(c); <span class="Italic">see Bohac v. Dep't of Agric</span>., 239 F.3d 1334, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (stating, in an appeal from the MSPB, that "[c]ompensatory damages are divided into two categories: pecuniary and non-pecuniary"). "Non-pecuniary compensatory damages include compensation for bodily harm and emotional distress and are awarded without proof of pecuniary loss." <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, 239 F.3d at 1341 (citation omitted). However, compensatory damages are designed to compensate the petitioner for actual harm, not to punish the agency. <span class="Italic">See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell</span>, 538 U.S. 408, 416 (2003) (explaining in the context of a Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment case that "[c]ompensatory damages 'are intended to redress the concrete loss that the plaintiff has suffered by reason of the defendant's wrongful conduct'" (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts &#x00A7; 903 (1979))); <span class="Italic">see Reese v. United States</span>, 24 F.3d 228, 231 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (explaining, in a U.S. Court of Federal Claims appeal, that "compensatory damages" simply "compensate the injured party for the <span class="Italic">injury sustained, and nothing more</span>" (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Awards of compensatory damages were introduced as a remedy available to whistleblowers with the enactment of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 ("WPEA"). Pub. L. No. 112-199, &#x00A7; 107, 126 Stat. 1465 (2012). The WPEA took effect on December 27, 2012, and added compensatory damages to the available corrective actions the MSPB is authorized to order in whistleblower retaliation cases. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Not only does it create new liabilities, i.e., compensatory damages, it also does not cap the amount that may be awarded, unlike the similar liabilities associated with findings of intentional discrimination. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Hicks v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 819 F.3d 1318, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (explaining that "[u]nder the WPEA...when an agency retaliates against an employee for filing a previous appeal related to whistleblowing, the [MSPB] is empowered to order such corrective action as it deems appropriate").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Substantial Evidence Supports the MSPB's Determination that Mr. Hickey Is Entitled to an Award of $10,000 in Compensatory Damages</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB determined that Mr. Hickey was entitled to a partial award of the compensatory damages he sought and awarded "$10,000 in compensatory damages." The MSPB explained that "the extent and duration of the emotional and physical harm caused by the agency's actions [were] limited," because Mr. Hickey "failed to provide objective and other evidence linking most of his complaints of mental anguish, and harm to his reputation, health, and familial relationships to the [DHS's] unlawful retaliation," In arriving at the $10,000 award, the MSPB supported its determination with citation to similar cases awarding from $5,000 to $20,000 for limited emotional and reputational harm, in addition to crediting evidence that the assignment to Boston caused Mr. Hickey emotional and reputational harm, as well as time away from his family. Mr. Hickey asserts that he is entitled to a larger "award than what the M[SP]B granted" because "the MSPB's award of $10,000 cannot be reconciled with the evidence proffered by Mr. Hickey and is inconsistent with the amount awarded in similar cases." We agree with the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Substantial evidence supports the MSPB's compensatory damages award. The MSPB credited Mr. Hickey's and his wife's statements that asserted his assignment to Boston led to emotional harm, inconvenience, pain and suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. These statements, however, <span class="Italic">did not connect the emotional harm to</span>, and therefore did not prove that the emotional harm "was actually caused by," the actual harm resulting from the retaliatory activities that the MSPB previously determined were unlawful. <span class="Italic">See Carey v. Piphus</span>, 435 U.S. 247, 264 (1978) (holding, for a claim of "mental and emotional distress," that "neither the likelihood of such injury nor the difficulty of proving it is so great as to justify awarding compensatory damages <span class="Italic">without proof</span> that such injury actually was caused" (emphasis added)). For example, Mr. Hickey did not link the physical and emotional symptoms to the misconduct of the DHS because neither statement provided dates of the symptoms or their duration to demonstrate that the harm resulted from the DHS's actions. J.A. 43 (crediting, by the MSPB, statements of Mr. Hickey and his wife, which explained that Mr. Hickey's "emotional distress...manifested into physical symptoms"). Additionally, Mr. Hickey's request for compensatory damages broadly includes <span class="Italic">all</span> his original claims in his IRA action rather than focusing upon the three instances of misconduct for which the MSPB determined he is entitled to recover. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 110 (explaining that the three instances of unlawful misconduct were (1) the "denial of Mr. Hickey's performance award"; (2) his temporary "reassignment" to Boston; and (3) his "[two prior] suspensions"). Mr. Hickey cannot recover compensatory damages for conduct other than these three instances of misconduct. <span class="Italic">Sloan v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., No. AT-0752-94-0387-P-1, 1997 WL 693605 (M.S.P.B. Oct. 29, 1997) (explaining that "[a]n award of compensatory damages for non-pecuniary losses should reflect the extent to which the agency directly or proximately caused the harm and the extent to which other factors also caused the harm, in addition to reflecting the nature and severity of the harm and its duration or expected duration"). Therefore, substantial evidence supports the MSPB's compensatory damages award.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Mr. Hickey asserts that he is entitled to a higher compensatory damages award because the current award of $10,000 is inconsistent "with amounts awarded in similar cases with similar evidentiary proffers," the MSPB properly evaluated his claim based on similar cases involving limited emotional and reputational harm and applied those cases to the three instances of misconduct that the MSPB based its IRA determination on. The MSPB supported its $10,000 award based on similar MSPB cases and tied the award to the unlawful actions taken. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 43-44 (comparing the award in this case to awards in similar retaliation cases). Because Mr. Hickey submitted evidence of mental anguish and emotional distress unrelated to the retaliatory action for which he was entitled to recover, the MSPB properly held he was not entitled to a higher award of compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See Carey</span>, 435 U.S. at 264; <span class="Italic">see also EEOC v. AutoZone, Inc</span>., 707 F.3d 824, 834 (7th Cir. 2013) (finding, by a sibling circuit, compensatory damages in the amount of $10,000 not excessive, where they were "rationally connected" to pain faced in relation to a back injury).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are few Board decisions on WPA compensatory damages as a result of the Board's inability to issue decisions at the headquarters level from January 2017 through 2022. Although they have no precedential value, a couple recent decisions from AJs demonstrate the ability of successful appellants to recover substantial awards of damages in whistleblower cases. <span class="Italic">Guzman v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-15-0170-P-3 (Sept. 30, 2020), awarded $250,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages for stress and resultant problems, impairment to relationships, and reputational damage, and $12,956 in consequential damages, after appellant's retirement in lieu of removal in 2014. <span class="Italic">Medlin v. DHS</span>, AT-1221-20-0604-P-1 (Feb. 25, 2021), awarded $115,402.48 in consequential damages and $125,000 in compensatory damages for stress and resultant problems, family disruption, and reputational loss following placement of the appellant on administrative leave and a bar order resulting from whistleblower reprisal. [Refer to compensatory damages in civil rights cases earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-23-111.html#sec16-110">Damages; Regulation Governing Recovery</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Acknowledging the paucity of whistleblower compensatory damages decisions, <span class="Italic">Guzman v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-15-0170-P-3, n.9 (NP 1/6/2023), announced an interest in following EEOC damages decisions (although it disallowed as damages TSP investment and related expenses or tax consequences of TSP withdrawals that occurred several years before the removal at issue in the appeal):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly noted that case law regarding compensatory damages in whistleblower reprisal cases is undeveloped, and she stated that it was appropriate to apply the case law pertaining to compensatory damages in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) cases by analogy and to give persuasive authority to the regulatory guidance of the EEOC as it pertains to compensatory damages. Both parties acknowledge that there is sparse case law on compensatory damages awarded pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g). The agency does not challenge the administrative judge's decision to look at EEOC compensatory damages cases by analogy. The appellant acknowledges that the Board's practice of looking at EEOC compensatory damages cases is "apt in many case[s]," but he asserts that it is not appropriate in this case because his damages exceed the EEOC's statutory cap of $300,000. In our analysis of the appellant's entitlement to compensatory damages pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g), we may rely on the EEOC's guidance regarding compensatory damages to the extent we find it persuasive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Guzman</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, determined it was improper to address back pay and related benefits in a damages appeal (they were to be resolved through compliance proceedings), but the Board generally affirmed the AJ's approach to assessment of nonpecuniary damages:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant was entitled to nonpecuniary damages because of the "deleterious effect caused by the agency's retaliation" in the areas of emotional pain, suffering, mental anguish, injury to professional standing, injury to his character and reputation, and loss of enjoyment of life. Importantly, the administrative judge noted that the record was replete with statements, accounts, and recollections from the appellant's children, friends, and colleagues that "make it crystal clear that [he] was harmed as a direct result of the <span id="Page_4957"></span>agency's retaliatory action." The administrative judge considered the testimony of the appellant, his witnesses, and the statements presented, and she found that this evidence was "credible, reliable[,] and useful to assist in ascertaining the damages suffered by the appellant in this matter." She also stated that she gave "great weight" to these statements, declarations, and testimony. Significantly, the administrative judge considered EEOC guidance and concluded that it was appropriate to consider "the entirety of the action"--meaning from the appellant's placement on administrative duties on approximately March 1, 2013, to the November 2014 decision--in considering his entitlement to compensatory damages. AID at 3-4, 22-23 (citing, among other things, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(5)). The administrative judge concluded that, for the areas of severe, lasting injury, and for an injury extending for 5 1/2-6 years, the appellant proved an entitlement to $250,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite these statements, and her finding that an award is warranted "because there is more than adequate causal connection between the agency's retaliatory action and the appellant's injury," we acknowledge the agency's argument that the administrative judge improperly considered agency actions that predated the 2014 removal action as well as the impact of those actions on the appellant....We agree that the administrative judge did not clearly explain her rationale for awarding damages in this regard, particularly where she appeared to rely on agency actions that predated the 2014 removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We wish to briefly discuss one issue that was not raised by the administrative judge or the parties. The WPEA added 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(4), which states that "[a]ny corrective action ordered under this section to correct a prohibited personnel practice may include...damages reasonably incurred due to an agency investigation of the employee, if such investigation was commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation for the disclosure...that formed the basis of the corrective action." According to the legislative history, section 1221(g)(4) "create[d] an additional avenue for financial relief once an employee is able to prove a claim under the [whistleblower protection statutes], if the employee can further demonstrate that an investigation was undertaken in retaliation for the protected disclosure." S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 21 (2012); <span class="Italic">see Sistek v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 955 F.3d 948, 955 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (concluding that retaliatory investigations do not qualify as personnel actions under the whistleblower protection statutes, but they "may provide a basis for additional corrective action if raised in conjunction with one or more of the qualifying personnel actions specified by [5 U.S.C.] &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In analyzing the appellant's whistleblower reprisal claim in the merits appeal, the administrative judge noted that the appellant provided preponderant evidence that his 2010 disclosure prompted the agency to initiate the credentials investigation, which led to the agency reopening the investigation into the 2004 microphone discovery, the culmination of which was the removal action. If an agency investigation was "commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation for" the appellant's whistleblowing disclosure, the appellant may be entitled to "damages reasonably incurred" due to any such investigation--as long as such damages were incurred after the December 27, 2012 effective date of the WPEA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(4); <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 663, &#x00B6; 3 (2013). However, because the applicability of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(4) is an issue of first impression before the Board that was not raised by or before the administrative judge, the parties were not given an opportunity to brief the applicability of this provision or its impact on the appellant's entitlement to compensatory and/or consequential damages. Accordingly, we vacate the administrative judge's analysis and remand the issue of the appellant's entitlement to nonpecuniary compensatory damages for further adjudication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The new addendum initial decision should include a thorough and specific explanation for the administrative judge's award of damages in this regard. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hickey</span>, 766 F. App'x at 978 (noting that Mr. Hickey's request for compensatory damages included all of his original claims in his IRA appeal, instead of the three instances of misconduct for which the Board determined he was entitled to recover, and concluding that he was only entitled to recover compensatory damages for the three instances of unlawful misconduct); <span class="Italic">see generally</span> EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Compensatory and Punitive Damages Available Under &#x00A7; 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 1992 WL 1364354, at *5 (July 14, 1992) (EEOC Guidance) ("An award for emotional harm is warranted only if there is sufficient causal connection between the [agency's] illegal actions and the complaining party's injury.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Guzman</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, also directed the AJ to reevaluate appellant's claimed medical expenses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is also problematic that the administrative judge seems to have automatically credited most of the appellant's medical appointments that postdated the March 7, 2014 notice of proposed removal because the chronology is not necessarily dispositive. Indeed, the appellant's entitlement to damages related to the removal is complicated, in part, because of the protracted litigation between the parties and the fact that the appellant may have suffered from medical conditions due to various agency actions that predated the March 7, 2014 notice of proposed removal.</p>
