<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-243"><span class="space">4.</span> Records of Time, Attendance, Work, and Pay; Negligence</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">False statements concerning work now require an element of material gain. The proof in falsification cases changed as a result of <span class="Italic">Boo v. DHS</span>, 122 MSPR 100, 107-109 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, 2014 MSPB 86 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board previously has stated that it is unaware of any case holding that financial gain is required to prove a falsification charge, <span class="Italic">see Seas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 422, 427 (1997);[2] <span class="Italic">see also Schoeffler v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 80, 84, <span class="Italic">vacated in part</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 143, <span class="Italic">enforcement dismissed</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 20 (1991), in <span class="Italic">Leatherbury</span>, the Federal Circuit subsequently explained that "the intent element [of falsification]...requires two distinct showings: (a) that the employee intended to deceive or mislead the agency; and (b) that he intended to defraud the agency for his own private material gain." <span class="Italic">Leatherbury</span>, 524 F.3d at 1300 (citing <span class="Italic">Bradley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 900 F.2d 233, 237 (Fed. Cir. 1990)). Notwithstanding the Board's suggestions in <span class="Italic">Seas</span> and <span class="Italic">Schoeffler</span>, the vast majority of the Board's cases addressing falsification--including some of its earliest case law discussing the contours of this charge--either expressly or implicitly considered whether an employee's misrepresentation was made for personal gain. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lacapurcia v. Department of the Army</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 514, 519 (1985) (finding that the agency failed to demonstrate that the employee intentionally falsified time records for personal gain); <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 420, 426 (1980) (finding that there was not a scintilla of evidence to suggest that the appellant completed his timecard with the intent to obtain 10 or 15 minutes of undeserved pay).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Seas</span> was last cited by the Board for this specific proposition in <span class="Italic">Gebhardt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 49, &#x00B6; 8 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 180 Fed. Appx. 951 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Each of these decisions predates the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Leatherbury</span>, which was issued in 2008. Although the Board also cited <span class="Italic">Seas</span> in <span class="Italic">Prather v. Department of Justice</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 137, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-21 (2011), and <span class="Italic">Crump v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (2010), in both cases there was no dispute that the appellants had personally benefited from their misrepresentations concerning, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, outside employment activities and educational qualifications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the Federal Circuit's articulation of the elements of falsification in <span class="Italic">Leatherbury</span>, and in keeping with the Board's historical approach to the elements of falsification, we MODIFY <span class="Italic">Seas</span> and <span class="Italic">Schoeffler</span> to the extent that they suggest that an agency does not have to establish that an employee personally benefited or gained from his misrepresentation when assessing the elements of a charge of falsification, misrepresentation, or lying. <span class="Italic">See Leatherbury</span>, 524 F.3d at 1300. Accordingly, we find that in order to establish a charge of falsification, misrepresentation, or lying, the agency must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the employee "intended to defraud the agency for his own private material gain."[3] <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Harrison v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We do not believe that the Federal Circuit intended to develop a unique set of elements for a charge of falsification based only on an allegation of fraud, and we find that the test set forth in <span class="Italic">Leatherbury</span> applies to instances of falsification, misrepresentation, or lying involving an employee's attempt to defraud, deceive, or mislead an agency for his own private material gain. <span class="Italic">See Leatherbury</span>, 524 F.3d at 1300.

<p class="Body-Text">Removal was sustained of a mine inspector who falsified reports of mine inspections.

The actions eroded the trust lodged in the appellant to conduct proper inspections of mines. <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 8 MSPR 257, 259, 7 MSPB 719 (1981). The same result followed for a meat-cutting foreman who, for reasons having nothing to do with personal gain, falsified inventory records involving more than $19,000. The Board considered that because it was incumbent on the appellant to report inventory losses, appellant's special position of trust as a supervisor served as an aggravating factor requiring removal rather than the mitigated demotion ordered by the AJ on the basis of a long and otherwise unblemished service record. <span class="Italic">Pitts v.

Another removal was sustained of an employee who made false statements concerning the employment status of a coworker with the apparent effect of enhancing the coworker's recovery of lost wages for an off-duty auto accident. The appellant occupied a position of trust with the agency. Removal was appropriate because of the agency's loss of trust in the employee after the incident. <span class="Italic">Allison v.

Removal was sustained of lead police officers who either qualified or caused another officer to qualify in firearms tests for other officers who should themselves have taken the tests.

<p class="Body-Text">Proof that an employee intentionally made and asserted as true a statement on timecards known to be false is sufficient to support a charge of falsification of government records.

<p class="Body-Text">A charge of making a false statement may be lodged against a supervisor who, seeking to reward efficient employees, incorrectly credited more hours than they worked. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Whelan v. USPS</span>, 103 MSPR 474, 2006 MSPB 288 (2006).

The offense was not mitigated by the employee's long and otherwise unblemished service. The appellant, a secretary, held a position of "trust and confidence" in an intelligence unit and handled classified information. <span class="Italic">Watson v.

USDA</span>, 7 MSPR 446, 454, 7 MSPB 314 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not every misstatement on a timecard or record is a false or fraudulent statement. The Board set aside the removal of some employees who put certain incorrect entries on their time records because their supervisor wanted their time records to reflect line watch duties regardless of whether the duties were actually performed, i.e., the incorrect entries appeared as a matter of administrative convenience condoned or directed by the supervisor, not as a means of defrauding the government. <span class="Italic">Gray v.

A charge of falsification of time and attendance reports was not made out when a certain portion of the employee's workday was spent commuting. Although the employee may have been AWOL, his supervisor was aware of how he was using his time. There was no intent to defraud the agency. <span class="Italic">Boscoe v. USDA</span>, 54 MSPR 315, 325 (1992) (agency must prove the employee knowingly supplied incorrect information with the intention of defrauding the agency). Some minor discrepancies in recording credit hours did not warrant removal and the penalty was mitigated to a suspension in <span class="Italic">Raco v. SSA</span>, 117 MSPR 1, 4-5 &#x00B6; 7, 2011 MSPB 87 (2011). The Board discounted the agency's argument that the appellant falsified information when falsification was not fairly embraced in the narrative supporting the "conduct unbecoming" charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the charge is in the nature of a fraudulent claim, intent to defraud must be shown; unintentional error is insufficient to show fraud. If fraud is the charge, the penalty cannot be sustained because should have monitored paychecks unless negligence is also explicitly charged. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Skinner v.

The agency bears the burden of proving fraud; it is not for the appellant to prove that he worked the hours claimed, particularly when the agency has not specified the hours it disputes. As to alleged falsification of timecards involving the accounting for time by a subordinate who appeared to have some personal differences with his supervisor, the Board discounted the evidence as unreliable and would not sustain the falsification charge because of the appellant's inability to explain his whereabouts or because he may have made some errors as to his timecards, particularly when the appellant's duties called for him to be at other locations. <span class="Italic">Lacapurcia v.

<p class="Body-Text">There is a distinction between a false claim, negligence in treating matters pertaining to timekeeping, and a violation of regulations.
