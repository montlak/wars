<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-153"><span class="space">b.</span> Reduction in Lifetime Annuity</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee's lifetime annuity is reduced when the employee elects a survivor annuity for a spouse. That reduction occurs as well when the annuity is provided for a former spouse. <span class="Italic">Mugler v. OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 619, 622 (1988), noted the adjustment in the level of the annuity for the employee resulting from the provision for a former spouse annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's former spouse was expressly provided a survivor annuity benefit in the decree of divorce. A survivor benefit payable based on a qualifying court order under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) is not without cost to the annuitant. Section 8339(j)(2) of title 5, United States Code, provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If an employee...has a former spouse who is entitled to a survivor annuity as provided in section 8341(h) of this title, the annuity of the employee...is reduced as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The funding of the former spouse annuity, if elected after retirement of the employee, is possible through either an immediate payment to OPM or through a reduction of the survivor annuity, as <span class="Italic">Ellison v. OPM</span>, 110 MSPR 631, 636-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-22, 2009 MSPB 39 (2009), an overpayment collection case, described:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislation that authorized divorced federal retirees such as the decedent in this case to provide survivor annuities for their former spouses is the Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984 (CSRSEA), Pub. L. No. 98615, &#x00A7; 2(3)(A), 98 Stat. 3195, 3196 (1984) (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3)). That legislation provided that the election to provide such an annuity was "subject to a deposit in the [CSRDF] by the retired employee...of an amount determined by [OPM], as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the annuity of such employee...would have been reduced if the election had been continuously in effect since the date the annuity commenced, plus interest." CSRSEA &#x00A7; 2(3)(A); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3) (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to this legislation, OPM promulgated regulations in 1985 permitting a retiree to elect a reduction in his annuity to provide a survivor annuity for his former spouse. 50 Fed. Reg. 20,064, 20,073 (May 13, 1985) (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.612(a)). Those regulations provided that such an election was "not permitted unless the retiree agree[d] to deposit the amount equal to the difference between the amount of annuity actually paid to the retiree and the amount of annuity that would have been paid if the reduction elected under...this section had been in effect continuously since the time of retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.612(c)). The 1985 regulations also included a provision, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.624(a), with language essentially the same as the current regulatory provision on which OPM relies here, i.e., 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.661(a). That is, they included a section providing that collection of deposits required in connection with the kinds of survivor annuities referenced there was not subject to waiver.4 In addition, the explanatory material accompanying the 1985 regulations included a statement that the reason the deposit requirement for electing a survivor annuity was not subject to waiver was that "the retiree is deemed to consent to the collection" of the deposit. 50 Fed. Reg. at 20,067.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The context in which the regulatory provisions described above were enacted, and the content of those provisions, indicate that the reference in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.661(a) to the waiver provisions of 5 C.F.R. subpart 831N was intended to reflect the statutory provision, quoted above, that made the retiree's right to elect a survivor annuity for his former spouse "subject to" his making the deposit described above. Unless the retiree made such a deposit, or agreed to do so, his election to provide a survivor annuity would be disapproved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that in 1993 Congress replaced the deposit requirement of CSRSEA with a provision for an actuarial reduction in the annuity of the retiree electing a survivor annuity. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the 1993 OBRA), &#x00A7; 11004(a)(2), 107 Stat. 312, 411-12. A retiree electing to provide a survivor annuity for his former spouse after this legislation became effective therefore agreed to a permanent reduction in his annuity to cover the costs that previously were to be covered by the deposit required under CSRSEA. As we have indicated above, the decedent in this case was not divorced from the appellant until 1995. The election of a former spouse survivor annuity that he is deemed to have made therefore is deemed to have included an agreement to any actuarial reduction under the 1993 legislation that was required in his case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1993, OPM promulgated regulations implementing the provisions of the 1993 OBRA. 58 Fed. Reg. 52,877 (Oct. 13, 1993). In the explanatory material accompanying those regulations, it referred to "the regular survivor reduction" that was made in a retirement annuity to finance a survivor annuity, and it stated that the actuarial reduction that replaced the deposit required under the 1985 legislation was "in addition to the regular survivor reduction." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 52,878. In other words, a retiree who elects to provide for a survivor annuity for his former spouse is subject to two separate reductions; one of them is the actuarial reduction that reflects the cost of providing the survivor annuity up to the time of the election, and the other is the "regular survivor reduction," calculated as described in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.632(e)(2), that reflects the subsequent cost of providing that annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has made no specific statement explaining how much of the $11,207 at issue here consists of the "regular survivor reduction" under 5 C.F.R.&#x00A7; 831.632(e)(2), and how much of it consists of the actuarial <span id="Page_4343"></span>reduction that replaced the 1985 "deposit" requirement. Instead, it advised the appellant only that this total amount represented the difference between "the annuity payments the retiree had received in his lifetime" and the amount "he would have received had the necessary deductions been made to reflect a survivor annuity election. That is, he found that, but for OPM's failure to inform the decedent of the need to again elect a survivor annuity for the appellant following his divorce, the decedent would have made a timely election to do so, and no "deposit" therefore would have been required. Initial Decision at 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has not challenged the administrative judge's reasoning regarding this matter. Moreover, we see no error in it. The finding is consistent with the administrative judge's previous conclusion that the appellant was entitled to a survivor annuity. That conclusion was based on evidence that the decedent was unaware that the election he had made at the time he retired was no longer in effect, and that he had continuously exhibited an intention and expectation that the appellant would receive a survivor annuity following his death....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we find that the $11,207 at issue here is attributable entirely to the "regular survivor reduction" that OPM should have made under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.632(e)(2). We therefore need not address the issue of whether overpayments resulting from OPM's failure to make the actuarial reduction mentioned above may, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.661(a), be recovered without regard to the waiver provisions set out in 5 C.F.R. subpart 831N. Even if recovery of such an overpayment is not subject to the provisions of that subpart, we find, for the reasons stated below, that recovery of an overpayment resulting from a failure to make the "regular survivor reduction" is subject to those provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note first that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.661(a), the regulatory paragraph providing that the collection of certain deposits is not subject to waiver, does not refer to debts incurred by OPM's failure to make "regular survivor reductions" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.632(e)(2). Instead, that paragraph refers only to the deposits--or, more accurately, the actuarial reductions--that reflect the cost of providing a survivor annuity up to the time of the election. As we have noted above, no such deposit or actuarial reduction was required here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that an annuitant's consent to a prospective reduction in his annuity is a prerequisite to a number of different kinds of benefits. Those benefits include not only survivor annuities, as in this case, but benefits such as life insurance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 870.401(d)(1) (describing the cost-sharing obligations of an annuitant who elects to continue basic life insurance in retirement). When an annuitant consents to a reduction in his annuity to provide such benefits, and when OPM erroneously fails to reduce the annuitant's annuity payments properly, recovery of the overpayment may be subject to waiver under 5 C.F.R. subpart 831N. <span class="Italic">See Mitchell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 12 (2004). Moreover, the Board has indicated that the statutory basis for such waivers is broad, and limits the recovery of any amounts incorrectly included in annuity payments. <span class="Italic">Id.; see Shannon v. United States Civil Service Commission,</span> 444 F. Supp. 354, 359 (N.D. Cal. 1977) (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b), which prohibits recovery of overpayments under 5 U.S.C. chapter 83, subchapter III, when the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience, "appl[ies] to all attempted recoupments of prior overpayments made to retirees as an annuity"), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds,</span> 621 F.2d 1030 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the language of subpart 831N generally seems to reflect an assumption that the overpayments at issue there are being recovered from the individuals who received them. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1401, 831.1402, 831.1403(a)(2) (referring to "the recipient of an overpayment"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1402(a)(3), (b) (referring to the issue of whether the individual accepting the payment was at fault); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1407(b) (eligibility for a waiver must be shown by the "recipient of an overpayment"). Here, OPM is seeking to recover payments it erroneously made to another individual, i.e., the decedent. The authorities on which the waiver provisions of subpart 831N are based, however, apply generally to OPM's recovery of annuity overpayments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b) (limiting "[r]ecovery of payments under [the Civil Service Retirement] subchapter"); <span class="Italic">Shannon,</span> 444 F. Supp. at 359 (the terms of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b) "clearly apply to all payments under the Civil Service Retirement Act"); 45 Fed. Reg. 23,631, 23,636 (Apr. 8, 1980) (indicating that regulatory provisions for waiving recovery of annuity overpayments were "required by...the final order in the case of <span class="Italic">Shannon v. U.S.C.S.C.").</span> Moreover, construing 5 C.F.R. subpart 831N and the statutory provision on which it is based, i.e., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b), as providing for waiver of recovery from individuals who received erroneous payments, while providing no such waiver with respect to individuals who received no such benefits, would be illogical.</p>
