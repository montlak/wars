<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-292"><span class="space">f.</span> Flexiplace; Telework</h5>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator's disposition of a contract flexiplace dispute was unobjectionable, <span class="Italic">DHHS, CMMS and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 57 FLRA 704, 707 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2261"></span>Where a party files exceptions alleging that an award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority first assesses whether the award affects the rights being relied on. <span class="Italic">See United States</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Coatesville, Pa.,</span> 56 FLRA 966, 971 (2000) (<span class="Italic">VAMC, Coatesville</span>). If the award affects such rights, then the Authority applies the two-prong test set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP, </span>53 FLRA at 151-54. <span class="Italic">See VAMC, Coatesville, </span>56 FLRA at 971. If the award does not affect the rights, then the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>analysis is not required and the exception is denied. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The Right to Determine Mission</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the award violates its right to determine its mission under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. In support, the Agency essentially relies on the supervisor's explanation that she could not grant the grievant flexiplace two days per week because "it was mission critical that the [g]rievant be in the office to work with others through brainstorming and daily interaction in developing a new strategy" for a particular Agency initiative. The Agency's arguments, however, do not relate to what the Agency's mission will be, but rather, relate to how that mission will be carried out. <span class="Italic">See Patent Office Professional Assoc.</span>, 56 FLRA 69, 104 (2000) (proposal that did not address hours the Agency was available to the public, but only addressed hours a system for performing work was available to employees, did not affect right to determine mission). Accordingly, we conclude that the award does not affect the Agency's right to determine its mission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The Right to Assign Work</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the award directing the Agency to grant the grievant's request to perform his duties at the ADS [alternative duty station] two days per week violates its right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute because it precludes management from exercising its right to determine how many man hours an employee needs to spend on formulating, planning, and working on a project, and affects the availability of the grievant to assist in such formulating and planning.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With one exception, the Authority has held that the geographical location where the work of a position will be performed does not involve an assignment of work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R1-109</span>, 53 FLRA 526, 535 (1997) and cases cited therein. With respect to the exception, the Authority has stated that, if management establishes that a relationship exists between the job location and the job duties, then a proposal governing the job location would be found to violate management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award in this case concerns the location where work that has previously been assigned by the Agency to the grievant will be performed.&#x2003;The Arbitrator's findings show that the Agency assigned the grievant, a computer specialist, duties to be performed in this position. The award does not concern the assignment of these duties to the grievant. Rather, the award concerns the location, that is the ADS, where these duties will be performed on two days of the week. Also, the Arbitrator's factual findings show that the duties performed by the grievant at the ADS on Mondays, which were approved by the supervisor, and those performed by the grievant on Friday at the official duty station are basically the same.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the award does not preclude management from exercising its right to determine how many work hours the grievant needs to spend on formulating, planning, and working on a project or prevent the grievant from being available to assist in formulating and planning projects. In this connection, the Arbitrator's factual findings show that the grievant has suspended his use of ADS to attend training programs and to conduct on-site audits and that Article 10, Section 3.D.3, recognizes the Agency's right to require employees to submit day cards showing what work was done at the ADS. Consequentially, the Agency can determine the grievant's activities at the ADS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, the Agency has not established that the nature of the grievant's job would prevent the grievant from performing his duties at the ADS two days per week as determined by the Arbitrator. Accordingly, we conclude that the award does not affect the Agency's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator's interpretation and application of a contract telework provision was unobjectional in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Educ. Fed. Student Aid and AFGE Local 3899</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-222.html">71 FLRA 1166</a>, 1169 (2020) (Member DuBester concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The final question is whether the arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' agreement excessively interferes with a management right.[30] If the answer to that final question is yes, then the arbitrator's award is contrary to law and must be vacated.[31] Here, Article 44, Section 44.01 of the parties' CBA states that "[e]ligible employees may participate in teleworking to the maximum extent possible without diminished employee or organizational performance" and the Arbitrator found that the Agency failed to show that the grievant's performance would be diminished by maintaining her prior telework schedule. While the Authority recently held that determining the frequency of telework is an exercise of management's right to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute,[33] that does not allow an Agency to get out of a lawful provision that it agreed to pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2).[34] Because the Arbitrator's award simply requires the Agency to abide by the procedures to which it agreed in the CBA, it does not excessively interfere with its management rights.[35] Accordingly, we conclude that the answer to the third question is no.[36] We deny the exception.[37]</p>

We note that the Agency does not contend that the telework procedures in the parties' agreement are themselves unlawful. Therefore, as explained further in this section, there is no basis to conclude that directing the Agency to comply with lawfully negotiated procedures excessively interferes with the Agency's management rights.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;In addition, the Agency argues that the award, in allowing the grievant to resume her prior telework schedule, is contrary to the Agency's revised regulation on telework, which became effective after the date of the grievances but before the award was issued. The Union, however, asserts that the Agency's argument is barred because the Agency did not present this argument to the Arbitrator. Under the Authority's Regulations, the Authority will not consider any arguments that could have been, but were not, presented to the arbitrator. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4(c), 2429.5. Although the Agency contends that it presented this argument to the Arbitrator at the hearing through employee testimony about a forthcoming telework policy that would require all employees to report to the office at least four days per week, we find this representation too general to preserve arguments about a subsequently issued policy for review. Accordingly, we find that the Agency could have made this argument to the Arbitrator, but because it did not, we do not consider it here. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't. of VA, Gulf Coast Med.

<p class="noindent-1">The right to determine organization encompasses the right to determine the administrative and functional structure of the agency, including the relationship of personnel through lines of authority and the distribution of responsibilities for delegated and assigned duties. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transp., Fed.

Health Care Sys.; Newington, Conn., </span>57 FLRA 47, 48 (2001). The right also includes the authority to determine how an agency will structure itself to accomplish its mission and functions and the right to determine how the agency will be divided <span id="page_2262"></span>into organizational entities such as sections. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 58 FLRA at 178; <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def., Nat'l Guard Bureau, Wash. Army Nat'l Guard, Tacoma, Wash.,</span> 45 FLRA 782 (1992); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, Chapter 83, 35 FLRA 398, 410 n.5 (1990) (citing Con<span class="Italic">gressional Research Employees Ass'n,</span> 3 FLRA 737, 737-38 (1980)). Finally, the right to determine organization encompasses the right to determine "where organizationally certain functions shall be established and where the duty stations of the positions providing those functions shall be maintained." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529,</span> 55 FLRA 830, 832 (1999) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU, Atlanta, Ga.,</span> 32 FLRA 886, 889-90 (1988)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency alleges that the award affects its organizational and administrative structure because the Arbitrator "permitted all the employees [in the South Bend office] to work at home 9 days out of [10 in each] pay period, thereby effectively eliminating the Agency's ability to maintain a functional operational resident post" and eliminating the Agency's ability to ensure that its facilities are capable of responding to the public. However, the factual finding, to which the Authority defers, does not support the conclusion that the Agency's right to determine its organization is affected because the Arbitrator found that office interaction would not significantly increase as a result of the termination of flexiplace agreements. Based on this finding, we conclude that the award does not affect the Agency's ability to maintain a functional operational post or determine its organizational structure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also alleges that the award violates its right to assign work.&#x2003;According to Authority precedent, the right to assign work includes the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what positions the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health and Human Servs., Health Care Financing Admin.,</span> 57 FLRA 462, 463 (2001) (HHS) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529,</span> 56 FLRA 1049, 1050 (2001)). The Agency argues that its right to assign work in this case includes the right to mandate the location where the work is performed because there is a nexus between the assignment to respond to members of the public and the location where this duty may be performed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that if an agency establishes a relationship between job location and job duties, then a provision addressing job location would violate the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health and Human Servs., Ctrs. for Medicare and Medicaid Servs., Baltimore, Md.,</span> 57 FLRA 704, 707 (2002) (<span class="Italic">HHS Baltimore</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-109</span>, 53 FLRA 526, 535 (1995). However, based on the Arbitrator's finding that employees have satisfactorily responded to the public, even while working under flexiplace agreements, the record does not support the conclusion that there is a nexus between the duties and the job location. Therefore, we find that the award does not affect the Agency's right to assign work in this manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency argues that the award prevents it from assigning the grievants any other duties that would require them to be physically present in the office. Despite the Agency's allegations, there is nothing in the award that would preclude the Agency from assigning an employee duties that could only be performed in the office setting and modifying a flexiplace agreement accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator acknowledged that the Agency could terminate flexiplace agreements if it provided evidence that there was a change in circumstances such that the agreement no longer met the contractual criteria.&#x2003;The Arbitrator found that one of the agreements was properly terminated due to a "significant change in circumstances making it reasonable to conclude...the flexiplace [agreement] no longer met [contractual criteria]...." However, the Arbitrator determined that the Agency did not present evidence of such a change in the flexiplace agreements at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Arbitrator recognized that requests for flexiplace agreements could be denied if, for example, office interaction was required for an employee to successfully perform his/her duties. The Union concedes that the parties' CBA would clearly allow the Agency to cancel or disapprove a flexiplace agreement "due to a change in workload or duties[.]" In these circumstances, we conclude that the award does not preclude the Agency from assigning an employee duties that would require that employee to be physically present in the office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the determination that the award does not affect the Agency's management right to determine organization or the right to assign work, the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis is not applicable. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Coatesville, Pa.</span>, 56 FLRA 966, 971 (2000). Therefore, we dismiss the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Educ. v. AFGE Local 252</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-056.html">61 FLRA 307</a>, 309-12 (2005), permitted an award precluding unilateral modification of a flexiplace arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Award Does Not Violate the Agency's Right to Determine Its Organization</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1), it has the right to determine where official duty stations will be established and maintained and that the award violates that right by requiring the Agency to change the grievant's duty station from Washington, D.C. to South Carolina. However, Authority precedent "does not support the broad and undiscriminating conclusion that, whenever an agency chooses to call the specific location in which employees are assigned to perform their work 'an official duty station,' the choice of that location always constitutes an exercise of the right to determine organization under the Statute." <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 83</span>, 35 FLRA 398, 412 (1990). Rather, in order for its designation of "duty station" to come within the scope of the right to determine organization, the Agency must establish that the "duty station" of the grievant has a direct and substantive relationship to the Agency's administrative or functional structure, including the relationship of personnel through lines of authority and the distribution of responsibilities for delegated and assigned duties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 41 FLRA 1283, 1286, 1287 (1991);<span class="Italic"> NTEU, Chapter 83</span>, 35 FLRA at 413.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award would require the Agency to change the grievant's official duty station upon the reinstatement of her original schedule. However, the award does not require the Agency to change the organizational structure of the Office of Vocational and Adult Education, the organizational unit in which the grievant works, or any other organizational units of the Agency. The award also does not require the Agency to change the lines of authority to carry out the work of the Office of Vocational and Adult Education or dictate the distribution of responsibilities within that organizational unit. The grievant would continue to perform the same duties in the same organizational unit. In addition, the Agency had previously determined that the grievant's work could be performed from her residence in South Carolina and the Arbitrator effectively found that there was no reason the grievant could not continue to do so. Indeed, under the Agency's preferred schedule, the grievant would be present in the office no more (and in some months fewer) days than under the schedule awarded by the Arbitrator. It would be unreasonable to conclude that in this situation--where the sole dispute is which particular days in a month the grievant is working in the office--the Agency's right to determine organization is implicated. As such, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Local 3509</span>, on which the Agency relies, in which the Authority found that proposals requiring the assignment of positions to different offices affected the right to determine organization. In reaching its result in that case, the Authority noted that the agency had not determined that the work of the position could be performed at those locations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that in <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 3805</span>, 5 FLRA 693 (1981) (<span class="Italic">Local 3805</span>), the Authority determined that a proposal requiring the agency to maintain certain official duty stations and, thus, preventing the agency from eliminating those duty stations, conflicted with the agency's right to determine its organization. The proposal in <span class="Italic">Local 3805</span> was subsequently described in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, <span class="Italic">Chapter 83,</span> 35 FLRA at 412, as directly and substantively related to the agency's administrative structure because the designation of official duty stations was "for purposes of implementing administrative matters, such as reimbursement of travel expenses[.]" In this case, by contrast, the award would have the effect of requiring the Agency, upon reinstatement of the grievant's original schedule, to change her official duty station only for location-based pay--not for organizational--purposes. There is no precedent supporting a conclusion that the right to determine organization was intended to be read so broadly as to encompass a designation of duty station made solely for location-based pay reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Award is Not Contrary to the OPM Guidance</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the award is deficient because it is not required by OPM guidance.&#x2003;In this regard, the Agency asserts that the OPM guidance does not require management to approve any particular telework schedule and does not invalidate the Agency's requirement in PMI 368-1 that duty stations will not be changed for flexiplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The OPM guidance addresses the location of official duty stations for location-based pay purposes. As relevant here, the guidance provides that an agency must change an employee's official duty station to the location of telework when the employee does not regularly commute at least once a week into a main or reporting office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency correctly notes that the OPM guidance does not require it to agree to any particular telecommuting schedule.&#x2003;However, the Agency has not demonstrated that this fact renders the award deficient. In this regard, the OPM guidance does not establish any mandatory schedules with which an award might conflict. Further, with respect to the Agency's ability to determine the location of duty stations, the OPM guidance simply provides that if an employee is on a particular schedule, then the employee's duty station for location-based pay purposes is determined by reference to that schedule. In this respect, the Agency acknowledges that the Arbitrator's determination that the Agency was required to change the grievant's official duty station if the grievant is returned to her original schedule is consistent with the guidance. ("This requirement to change [the grievant's] duty station stems from [OPM] policy...that <span id="page_2263"></span>if an employee on telework does not report to his or her office at least once a week, his or her employing agency must change the employee's duty station to the location of the employee's alternate work location. The Arbitrator recognized th[at] fact in his award."). As PMI 368-1 itself provides that employees participating in the flexiplace program shall be treated consistent with applicable OPM regulations, the PMI anticipates that an arbitrator may assess whether the Agency's actions regarding the negotiated flexiplace program comply with the OPM guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the award is deficient as contrary to the OPM guidance. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;The Award Is Not Contrary to P. L. No. 106-346</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 359 of P.L. No. 106-346 requires executive agencies to "establish a policy under which eligible employees...may participate in telecommuting to the maximum extent possible without diminished employee performance." Dep't of Transp. &#x0026; Related Agencies-Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 106-346 &#x00A7; 359, 114 Stat. 1356 (2000). "Telecommuting" is defined in the legislative history of &#x00A7; 359 as "any arrangement in which an employee regularly performs officially assigned duties at home or other work sites geographically convenient to the residence of the employee." <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Nat'l Council of HUD Locals 222, AFL-CIO</span>, 60 FLRA 311, 313 (2004) (<span class="Italic">Nat'l Council of HUD Locals 222</span>); and H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-940, &#x00A7; 359, at 151 (2000), <span class="Italic">reprinted in </span>2000 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1063, 1143 (U.S.C.C.A.N.). The term "eligible employees" is defined in the legislative history as "any satisfactorily performing employee of the agency" whose job can typically performed at least one day per week at an alternate location. U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1143. The Authority has found that Congress intended &#x00A7; 359 of P.L. No. 106-346 to be the sole authority for telecommuting programs. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Council of HUD Locals 222, </span>60 FLRA at 313.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that it is not required under P.L. No. 106-346 to agree to any particular telecommuting schedule, including the one sought by the grievant, or to agree to change official duty stations. The Agency is correct that the law does not specify particular telecommuting schedules or where official duty stations will be located. However, for the reason discussed above with respect to the OPM guidance, this fact does not demonstrate that the award is contrary to P.L. No. 106-346. Stated otherwise, in order for the award to be found deficient as contrary to P.L. No. 106-346, the award must be found to conflict with a requirement set forth in P.L. No. 106-346. However, nothing in the Agency's argument demonstrates that the award conflicts with any requirement set forth in P.L. No. 106-346. Under P.L. No. 106-346, agencies are required only to "develop criteria to be used in implementing such a policy and ensure that managerial, logistical, organizational, or other barriers to full implementation and successful functioning of the policy are removed." U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1143. The Arbitrator found that the Agency essentially violated its own criteria by terminating the grievant's flexiplace work agreement for reasons that were "vague" and "unconvincing."</p>
