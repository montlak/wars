<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-100"><span class="space">4.</span> Union Dues; Insurance; Medicare</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Labor Relations Authority provided its view of the nature of deductions and elections for the various items funded by federal payroll checks in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Northport and AFGE Local 1843</span>, 25 FLRA 523, 526-28 (1987), involving a dispute over the ability of a union to recapture union dues that would have been paid out of the employee's check had the employee not been discharged:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency calculates an employee's backpay award, some payments must be withheld from the award, some payments may not be credited to the employee, and some matters require the exercise of discretion by the affected employee. Thus, the courts have held that an agency must deduct from an employee's backpay award those payments for which the employee is legally obligated, including Federal and state taxes, Federal Insurance Contributions Act ("FICA") payments, retirement and Medicare deductions, annual leave payments, and any withdrawals which were made by the employee from the Civil Service Retirement Fund at the time of his separation. <span class="Italic">Tanaka v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 788 F.2d 1552 (Fed. Cir. 1986)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Some Federal employee benefit programs require the employee to exercise options concerning whether or not to participate in the program and concerning the nature of their participation. When employees who are found to have been wrongfully terminated are reinstated, they are given the option of retroactively participating in these optional programs and paying for them out of their backpay award. Thus, employees may refuse to "purchase" life insurance through the government's program or they may choose varying levels of participation. For employees who are reinstated the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) provides that there will be no life insurance withholdings made from the retroactive pay adjustment of an employee who is retroactively restored to duty with pay after an erroneous separation, suspension or removal. However, if death or accidental dismemberment occurs during the period between the employee's separation, suspension or removal and the finding that the agency action was erroneous, premiums will be withheld from the backpay awarded for the period of separation, suspension or removal and the employee or their estate will be entitled to the benefits which would have accrued to them but for the erroneous agency action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, Federal employees can decide whether or not to participate in the health benefits program, and they have a variety of options regarding the medical insurance they want to choose. An employee who is removed or suspended without pay and whose enrollment in the health benefits program has been terminated is given the option when he is reinstated of having his prior health benefits reinstated retroactively to the date they were terminated or he may enroll in the same program as a new employee. If the employee elects to have the prior enrollment reinstated retroactively, withholdings and contributions must also be made retroactively just as though the erroneous suspension or removal had not taken place and the health benefits coverage is considered to have been continuously in effect, with the employee and any covered family members being entitled to the full benefits of the plan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From the above, we conclude that the Federal Personnel Manual's policy regarding retroactive payments for optional programs by an employee who is reinstated after a finding that the employee's removal was unwarranted or unjustified allows an employee to choose whether or not to have those payments made retroactively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that an employee's decision to become a union member and to pay union dues through checkoff is a voluntary decision like those which an employee makes regarding life insurance and health benefits. Therefore, we conclude, in the absence of any statutory or regulatory constraint requiring a different policy, that the purposes of the Statute are best served by a policy which gives to an employee who is reinstated after a determination that his termination was unwarranted or unjustified the option of having his union membership retroactively restored. If the employee so chooses, he will incur a retroactive obligation for the dues not paid during the period of his termination and the union will be obligated to provide him with any benefits which might have accrued to him as a union member during that period. A reinstated employee should be given the option, alternatively, of joining the union as if he were a newly hired employee and his obligation to the union would then begin only with signing of a new dues authorization form.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board adopted the FLRA's approach in <span class="Italic">Samuels v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 30, 33-36 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (2003), <span class="Italic">reopened as to deduction of union dues</span>, <span class="Italic">Samuels v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 512 (2004), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first address the appellant's claim that the agency improperly deducted union dues from his back pay award. As noted, according to evidence that the appellant does not dispute, he was a member of both APWU and NAPFE at the time of his removal. He argues, however, that he did not have the benefit of union representation during the period following his removal, and that he never signed any document requesting that union dues be taken out of his back pay award.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Back Pay Act provides, in pertinent part, that an employee who is found to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of his pay, allowances, or differentials, is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, to receive for the period for which the personnel action was in effect an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable, which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i).

Those regulations specifically provide that, in computing the net amount of back pay payable under &#x00A7; 5596, an agency must make certain offsets and deductions from the gross back pay award, including authorized deductions of the type that would have been made from the employee's pay (if paid when properly due) in accordance with the normal order of precedence for deductions from pay established by the agency, subject to any applicable law or regulation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(c)(3). Those deductions include, but are not limited to, mandatory employee retirement contributions, social security and Medicare taxes, health benefit and life insurance premiums under certain circumstances, and federal income tax withholdings. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(3)(i)(v); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Tanaka v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In deducting dues payable to both unions from the appellant's back pay award, the agency reasoned that, had he not been removed, it would have continued to automatically deduct dues from his salary pursuant to his own authorizations.

In other words, if the reinstated employee so chooses, he would incur a retroactive obligation for the dues not paid during the period of his removal, and the union would be obligated to provide him with any benefits which might have accrued to him as a union member during that period. Alternatively, he should be given the option of joining the union as if he were a newly hired employee, in which case his obligation to the union would begin with the signing of a new dues authorization form. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

Because the FLRA's interpretation of its statute is reasonable, we find it appropriate to, and do, defer to it.[3] We find, therefore, that the appellant's obligation to pay dues ended on May 9, 1999, when he was removed, and that, because he did not indicate that he wished his prior dues-paying status to be restored retroactively, the obligation did not automatically revive on July 8, 1999, when he was restored to duty. Therefore, the agency's deduction of dues from his back pay award for the back pay period was improper, and this case must be remanded for a determination of the amount to which the appellant is now entitled. The extent of his entitlement may be affected by the provision found in both authorizations of deductions he signed to the effect that the assignment of funds is irrevocable for the period of one year from the date of delivery, unless written notice is provided to the agency within a distinct time frame.

The distinction in the laws governing labor-management relations, as well as a peculiarity in Postal Service employee relations that retains an individual as a nominal employee after a removal and pending an appeal, led the Board to reopen the case, at the request of the Postal Service and reach the result that for preference-eligible employees of the Postal Service, dues deductions remain in effect during a period of termination unless the employee affirmatively discontinues dues deduction during that period in accordance with provisions of the collective bargaining contract, <span class="Italic">Samuels v.

With regard to that issue, the AJ found that, according to the evidence presented, the appellant was a dues-paying member of both the American Postal Workers Union (APWU) and the National Alliance of Postal and Federal Employees (NAPFE) prior to his removal, and that, because of that status, the agency's deduction of the union dues from his back pay award was proper<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the decision in <span class="Italic">Samuels</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 30, suggested that labor-management relations in the Postal Service is wholly subject to the FSLMRS, we hereby modify it to reflect that the U.S. Postal Service back pay issues raised by the parties in <span class="Italic">Samuels</span> are governed by provisions of the PRA and the NLRA<span class="Italic">. See National Labor Relations Board v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 833 F.2d 1195, 1197 (6th Cir. 1987) (the PRA specifically assigns to the NLRB some of the responsibilities that the NLRB exercises under the NLRA). Thus, we find that the FSLMRS is not applicable law to determine whether the agency properly deducted union dues in computing the appellant's back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we find that the FSLMRS does not provide analogous authority to decide whether the agency properly deducted union dues from the appellant's back pay. Under the FSLMRS, a dues allotment with respect to any employee terminates when the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) ceases to be applicable to the employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115. Generally, when a federal employee is terminated, he is removed from the rolls and the CBA ceases to be applicable to him. Thus, under the FSLMRS, an authorization for union dues deduction no longer applies to a terminated employee<span class="Italic">. See American Federation of Government Employees Local 1843 v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 843 F.2d 550, 552 (D.C. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in contrast to federal employees subject to the FSLMRS, preference eligible postal employees remain on the agency rolls during the pendency of a removal appeal before the Board. The Agreement <span id="Page_4907"></span>between the United States Postal Service and the American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, Article 16.5, provides that a preference eligible Postal employee who appeals a discharge to the Board "shall remain on the rolls (non-pay status) until disposition of the case has been had either by settlement or through exhaustion of his/her MSPB appeal." Thus, preference eligible Postal employees, such as the appellant, are not terminated while they appeal agency discharge actions to the Board in the same sense that federal employees subject to the FSLMRS are terminated during the Board appellate process. We find that one effect caused by the fact that Postal employees remain on the agency's rolls, i.e., remain employees, during the pendency of Board discharge appeals is that the CBA between the agency and the exclusive representative does not cease to be applicable to the employees. <span class="Italic">Cf. Vaca v. Sipes</span>, 386 U.S. 171, 176-78 (1967) (under the NLRA, a union has a duty of fair representation to union members to enforce the CBA grievance procedures even after their discharge from employment). Therefore, we reopen our decision in <span class="Italic">Samuels</span> to consider the agency's contention that it properly deducted union dues for the APWU and the NAPFE from the appellant's back pay under the PRA.</p>

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 179, 181-82 (1997). With regard to the issue of whether it properly deducted union dues from the appellant's back pay, the agency submitted the CBA between the Postal Service and the APWU and evidence to establish that the appellant made a written assignment of dues to the APWU on November 11, 1986, and a written assignment of dues to the NAPFE on January 19, 1993. The agency asserts that the appellant never revoked these authorizations. Although, under the Board's regulations, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a), the appellant may rebut these assertions by the agency, he failed to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 1998-2000 CBA between the Postal Service and the APWU provided that a union dues authorization will be irrevocable for a period of up to one year and that it may be automatically renewed. Specifically, the CBA provided:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">B.&#x2003;The authorization of such deductions shall be made in accordance with the terms of Standard Form 1187. Revocation of authorization shall be made in accordance with the terms of Standard Form 1186.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(Agreement between the United States Postal Service and the American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, Article 17.6). We find that, with regard to the appellant's assignment of dues to the APWU, the agency established that its deduction of dues from the appellant's back pay for the entire back pay period, July 8, 1999, through July 15, 2000, was authorized by the PRA, the applicable CBA, and the appellant's unrevoked written Authorization for Deduction of Dues to the APWU.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the appellant's assignment of dues to the NAPFE, we find that the agency established that its deduction of dues from the appellant's back pay for the entire back pay period was authorized by the appellant's unrevoked written Authorization for Deduction of Dues to the NAPFE. That Authorization provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This assignment...shall be irrevocable for a period of one (1) year from the date of delivery hereof to you, and I agree and direct that this assignment...shall be automatically renewed and shall be irrevocable for successive periods of one (1) year, unless written notice is given by me...prior to the expiration of each period of one year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This assignment is freely made pursuant to the provisions of the Postal Reorganization Act and is not contingent upon the existence of any agreement between you, my Union, or any other Union.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this provision in the Authorization allows for the deduction of dues from the appellant's back pay by the agency even without the existence of a CBA provision between the NAPFE and the agency similar to that between APWU and the agency. Moreover, the NAPFE is among the nonexclusive unions whose dues deduction privilege is sheltered by 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1205(b)<span class="Italic">. See National Alliance of Postal and Federal Employees v. Klassen</span>, 514 F.2d 189, 192 (D.C. Cir. 1975).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency established that the deduction of union dues payable to the APWU and the NAPFE was proper under the regulations implementing the Back Pay Act, specifically 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(3), which authorizes an agency to make "[a]uthorized deductions" from the gross back pay award.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In its prior pleadings below, the agency contended that it properly deducted union dues from the back pay award because it was required under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(3) to offset from gross back pay all authorized deductions that would have been made from the appellant's pay if he had continued in pay status. In response to the administrative judge's most recent recommendation, the agency has paid the appellant the amount of dues withheld, and appears to have abandoned its objection that such payment is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(3). Consequently, I agree that the appellant's petition for enforcement is moot. However, I write separately in order to express my view that such payment is not warranted under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Back Pay Act, an employee, on correction of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, is entitled "to receive for the period for which the personnel action was in effect...an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A). Thus, the Board is required, upon correcting a wrongful personnel action, to ensure that the employee is returned, as nearly as possible, to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante. Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) provides for a one-year period during which an employee's written consent to an automatic pay deduction for union dues is not revocable. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115(a); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., In re Margaret Jackson</span>, 59 Comp. Gen. 666, 667 (Aug. 14, 1980) (where an employee signs an allotment form, she may not revoke that authorization before one year). Here, the record does not establish that the appellant lawfully revoked his dues deduction authorization under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115(a) prior to his termination. Rather, it appears that he was in a dues-paying status as of January 18, 2008, the effective date of his removal. Thus, as of the date of his termination, the appellant's pay was subject to a lawful dues deduction authorization under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115(a) that--had he not been terminated--would have been revocable only upon completion of its one-year term. While it is true that the agency appropriately terminated the dues allotment following <span id="Page_4908"></span>his removal pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115(b), the subsequent restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> under the Back Pay Act in this case voided this action and requires that the appellant's back pay award be subject to the one-year term of his irrevocable dues authorization and reduced accordingly.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Apart from its having been vacated, I otherwise do not find the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Samuels I</span> to be persuasive on the question of whether the Back Pay Act mandates reducing a back pay award by the amount of union dues that the employee would have been obligated to pay had he not been terminated. In answering that question, the Board relied entirely on the FLRA's decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1843</span> where the issue was whether the agency's failure to deduct union dues from a back pay award constituted an unfair labor practice (ULP) under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116. 25 F.L.R.A. at 523.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1843</span>, the Authority summarily concluded that an employee's obligation to pay union dues is a voluntary decision analogous to other optional programs, such as life insurance and health benefits, and that the employee, therefore, should be given the option to have his union membership retroactively restored upon reinstatement. 25 F.L.R.A. at 528. However, the FLRA's analysis is devoid of any discussion reconciling its position with the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115(a) creating a legally binding obligation to allot dues for one year after the employee voluntarily assumes membership. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 526-528.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In my view, the restoration of a successful appellant to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> under the Back Pay Act requires that we place him as nearly as possible in the situation that he would have occupied if he had not been wrongfully removed. Thus, if the record shows that the appellant had made an irrevocable election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7115(a) to have union dues withheld from his pay at the time of his removal, then the agency properly withheld the union dues from the back pay award, at least until such time as the appellant could have revoked his election.</p>

The ability of the employee to make an election to have, or not to have, life insurance retroactively applied (and paid for) may depend on whether there is a finding that the employee's separation was erroneous, a finding that is explicit in Board decisions reversing discharges or other separations, but that finding would not ordinarily occur in a settlement, <span class="Italic">Alfonso v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8706(d) the appellant argues that the retroactive deduction for life insurance was improper because he did not suffer a loss during the separation period. Section 8706(d) reads:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the insurance of an employee stops because of separation from the service or suspension without pay, and the separation or suspension is thereafter officially found to have been erroneous, the employee is deemed to have been insured during the period of erroneous separation or suspension. Deductions otherwise required by section 8707 of this chapter shall not be withheld from any backpay awarded for the period of separation or suspension unless death or accidental dismemberment of the employee occurs during such period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's November 7, 2003 submission argues that this section does not apply in the appellant's case. The agency contends that in order for section 8706 to be applicable, the statute requires there to have been an official finding that the appellant's separation was <span class="Italic">erroneous</span> and that there has been no such finding in this case. The agency's position is that the life insurance deduction is required in this back pay award because it agreed to pay back pay and full benefits as part of paragraph 2(b) of the settlement agreement, which states (emphasis added):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The agency agrees] to reinstate Mr. Alfonso as a Border Patrol Agent with such reinstatement to be effective from February 9, 2002, thereby providing back pay and <span class="Italic">full benefits</span> from that date up to and including April 26, 2002.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency agreed to retroactively reinstate the appellant for a designated period of time with full benefits and to allow the appellant to resign from the agency. We find that, because of the settlement agreement, the appellant had the opportunity to bargain for or to reject coverage thus making section 8706(d) inapplicable. Additionally, the settlement agreement at paragraph 4 states (emphasis added):</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we disagree with OPM that the Board is without authority to determine the FEGLI compliance issue in this appeal. It is axiomatic that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204(a)(1)-(2), the Board has a broad grant of enforcement authority to order corrective action in cases of noncompliance pursuant to any matter within its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Kerr <span id="Page_4909"></span>v.

Because this case originates from a petition for enforcement of a Board decision reversing the final decision of OPM that affected the appellant's rights or interests with regard to her retirement, the Board clearly has jurisdiction over issues relating to the proper grant and payment of the appellant's disability retirement annuity. Although the Board has stated that life insurance benefits paid under FEGLI are governed by Chapter 87 of Title 5, and that jurisdiction over claims based on Chapter 87 is expressly placed in the United States district courts and the Court of Federal Claims, <span class="Italic">Richards v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 291, &#x00B6; 6 (2004), here the appellant is not challenging her election under FEGLI.

As in <span class="Italic">Ogden v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the September 30, 2009 Opinion and Order, the Board directed the agency to provide evidence that it had properly restored the appellant's health insurance benefits. <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6; 22. In a November 13, 2009 submission, the agency, without explanation, referred to a document from its finance and accounting service purporting to show that it had deducted $892.32 from the appellant's back pay for health insurance. In response, the appellant asserted that the agency remained in noncompliance because it had failed to enroll him in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program as a new employee following his reinstatement but instead erroneously deducted the cost of health insurance benefits from his back pay award, presumably to fund health insurance benefits during the back pay period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title Five, United States Code, Section 8908(a) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter who is removed or suspended without pay and later reinstated or restored to duty on the ground that the removal or suspension was unjustified or unwarranted may, at his option, enroll as a new employee or have his coverage restored, with appropriate adjustments made in contributions and claims, to the same extent and effect as though the removal or suspension had not taken place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, under this provision, upon his reinstatement the appellant had the option of being enrolled in the health insurance program as a new employee or having his insurance coverage restored, with appropriate adjustments, as if he had not been separated. <span class="Italic">See Fernandez v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has provided a copy of a June 9, 2009 e-mail to an agency human resources employee stating that he did not want to be charged for health insurance during the back pay period. The agency did not challenge the validity of this e-mail. Thus, consistent with the statutory provision set forth above, following the appellant's reinstatement, the agency should have enrolled the appellant in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program as a new employee. Because of the appellant's election, the agency should not have deducted from the appellant's back pay award health insurance premiums for the period prior to the appellant's enrollment as a new employee. <span class="Italic">See Fernandez</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 16 (where an employee elects not to have his health insurance benefits retroactively restored, he is entitled to reimbursement of the premiums improperly deducted from his back pay). Accordingly, the agency is in noncompliance in this regard. To be in compliance, the agency must pay the appellant the amount of health insurance benefits improperly withheld from the back pay award with appropriate interest.

U.S. Postal Service,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 429, 431-32 (1989). Concerning the appellant's LWOP status for the 365-day period from May 24, 2002 to May 24, 2003, the appellant should understand that he is responsible for the full share of the premiums for this period and that his coverage terminated May 24, 2003, resuming upon his return to the agency on March 29, 2004. <span class="Italic">See Raphel v.

It appears the agency has done all that it can to ensure continuation of coverage as requested by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's complaint of duplicate coverage should also be addressed to the insurer. The appellant should realize that before retroactive deductions from back pay were made for insurance benefits, he had the right to make an election as to those benefits, which it appears he d<span class="Italic">id.</span> <span class="Italic">See Kostick v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts on review that he is entitled to reimbursement for the health benefits premiums that the agency withheld from his back pay when it restored his health benefits retroactive to the effective date of his removal because he did not elect to have his health benefits retroactively restored.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The restoration of health benefits for employees who have been removed and are subsequently reinstated is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8908(a) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(3)(iii). Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8908(a) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter who is removed or suspended without pay and later reinstated or restored to duty on the ground that the removal or suspension was unjustified or unwarranted may, <span class="Italic">at his option</span>, enroll as a new employee or have his coverage restored, with appropriate adjustments made in contributions and claims, to the same extent and effect as though removal or suspension had not taken place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis added.) Title 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(3)(iii) requires agencies to deduct health benefits premiums when computing the amount of back pay payable to an employee who has been removed and is later reinstated if coverage is retroactively reinstated <span class="Italic">at the employee's election</span> under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8908(a). <span class="Italic">See Gutkowski v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4910"></span>Thus, the retroactive restoration of an employee's health benefits under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8908(a) is contingent upon the employee's election to have these benefits retroactively restored. In this case, it appears that this condition has not been met. The agency merely stated below that it would retroactively restore the appellant's health benefits. In its response to the PFR, the agency does not rebut the appellant's assertion that he did not elect to have his health benefits retroactively restored, nor is there any evidence in the record that the appellant made such an election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, on remand, the AJ shall direct the agency to afford the appellant the opportunity to elect to have his health benefits retroactively restored under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8908(a). If the appellant does not exercise this option, he is entitled to reimbursement for the health benefits premiums that the agency deducted from his back pay when it retroactively restored his health benefits coverage. Under those circumstances, however, he would not be entitled to reimbursement for the out-of-pocket medical costs he incurred as a result of the cancellation of his health benefits due to his removal, which he requested below. <span class="Italic">See Raymond v. Department of the Army</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 665, &#x00B6; 13 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conversely, if the appellant elects to have his health benefits coverage retroactively restored, he would not be entitled to reimbursement for the health benefits premiums that the agency deducted from his back pay when it retroactively restored his coverage. He would, however, be entitled to reimbursement for the medical expenses he incurred during the period of his removal. As the AJ explained, if the appellant wishes to be reimbursed for medical expenses he incurred during the period of his removal, the proper procedure is to submit any claims for those expenses to his health benefits carrier. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Raymond</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 665, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When settling a case involving an appellant who seeks to continue health insurance benefits, be mindful of 5 CFR 890.1103 (2022), precluding the continuation of health insurance when an employee has been involuntarily separated for gross misconduct, defined as "a flagrant and extreme transgression of law or established rule of action for which an employee is separated and concerning which a judicial or administrative finding of gross misconduct has been made." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 890.1102 (2022). A settlement agreement may need to be structured so that the employing agency affirmatively states that it has and will made no finding of gross misconduct against the appellant and that the agency will avoid any reference to gross misconduct, however characterized, to prejudice the appellant's ability to continue health insurance benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant has a problem with health insurance coverage, but the agency has done all that it can to ensure continuation of coverage, the Board may decide the compliance issue by redirecting the appellant to the insurer or to OPM's procedures, 5 CFR 890.105 (2022), governing appeals of a health care provider's denial of a claim for benefits. If the appellant then discovers that his coverage was terminated due to an improper act or omission of the employer, the appellant may then file another enforcement petition with the regional office. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kolassa v.

The situation could be different in with a successful IRA case, whistleblower reprisal defense, or EEO defense, involving potential consequential or compensatory damages.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Medicare coverage became effective on January 1, 1983, and applies to remuneration paid after December 31, 1982.... Medicare deductions thus relate to the date that income is paid rather than the period for which the wages are earned.... Therefore, because the appellant's back pay award was paid after January 1, 1983, Medicare deductions were properly made.</p>
