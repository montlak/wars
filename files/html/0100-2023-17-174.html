<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-172"><span class="space">d.</span> Expired Contracts; Contracts That Continue After Term Pending Renegotiation</h5>
<p class="noindent">The conditional primacy of the collective bargaining agreement relative to government-wide regulations issued after the effective date of the agreement was explained in <span class="Italic">DOD, DCAA, Cent. Region and AFGE Local 3529</span>, 37 FLRA 1218, 1226-29 (1990) (although that reasoning was seemingly overruled in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 45 F.4th 121 (D.C. Cir. 2022), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the award is contrary to 5 C.F.R. 430.206(c) because the award enforced provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and agency regulation in conflict with the governing provisions of section 430.206(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined that the Activity had violated Article XIX, Section 1(D) (quoted on page 4, <span class="Italic">supra</span>) and PMM chapter 17, before revision, by the procedure it followed for the 1988 performance appraisal ratings because employees were not afforded a chance to comment orally and in writing on their immediate supervisor's rating of their performance before the rating was submitted to the reviewing official. However, in 1986, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued final regulations on the performance management system. One of the changes in the system was the process and procedures for higher-level review of performance ratings of record. Since April 10, 1986, 5 C.F.R. 430.206(c) has provided as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Ratings of record and performance-based personnel actions shall be reviewed and approved by a person(s) at a higher level in the organization than that of the appraising official. Ratings of record may not be communicated to employees prior to approval by the final reviewer. This does not preclude communication about appraisal of performance between a supervisor and an employee prior to the determination of the rating of record. Ratings of record must be approved by the official with the responsibility for managing the performance awards budget within the agency. Agencies may describe exceptions to higher level approval of ratings of record and performance-based personnel actions in their Performance Management Plans.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Activity that the procedure provided by Article XIX, Section 1(D) and PMM chapter 17, before revision, conflicts with the procedure provided by section 430.206(c) because that section prescribes that "[r]atings of record may not be communicated to employees prior to approval by the final reviewer." Section 430.206(c) is part of the regulations OPM has prescribed for performance appraisal systems for General Schedule employees to implement and supplement the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 4301-4305. Accordingly, we find that section 430.206(c) is a Government-wide regulation and is binding on Federal agencies. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Army, Fort Campbell District, Third Region, Fort Campbell, Kentucky and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2022,</span> 37 FLRA 186 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span>); <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 6 and Internal Revenue Service, New Orleans District,</span> 3 FLRA 747 (1980). As a Government-wide regulation, section 430.206(c) governs a matter in dispute to which it applies even if the same matter is covered by an agency regulation or a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See Ft. Campbell,</span> 37 FLRA at 193. Consequently, section 430.206(c) governs in relation to any conflicting provisions of PMM chapter 17.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, as noted by the Union, the only limitation on the supremacy of a Government-wide regulation is set forth in section 7116(a)(7) of the Statute, which makes it an unfair labor practice for an agency "to enforce any rule or regulation (other than a rule or regulation implementing section 2302 of this title) which is in conflict with any applicable collective bargaining agreement if the agreement was in effect before the date the rule or regulation was prescribed." Therefore, under section 7116(a)(7), a Government-wide regulation which does not implement 5 U.S.C. 2302, pertaining to prohibited personnel practices, is not controlling in relation to a conflicting provision of a collective bargaining agreement that was in effect before the date the regulation was prescribed. <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell,</span> 37 FLRA at 193.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Union that section 430.206(c) was not controlling in relation to the conflicting provision of Article XIX on April 10, 1986, the <span id="page_1966"></span>effective date of section 430.206(c), because Article XIX, Section 1(D) was in effect before that date as a result of the 1-year renewal of the agreement on October 19, 1985. However, we disagree with the Union that section 430.206(c) has never become effective with regard to this unit of employees because of the repeated automatic renewals of the collective bargaining agreement. Rather, we conclude that Article XIX was controlling until October 18, 1986, but that, effective October 19, 1986, section 430.206(c) controlled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated by the parties, the collective bargaining agreement was automatically renewed for a 1-year term commencing October 19, 1985. Because Article XIX was in effect on April 10, 1986, when section 430.206(c) was prescribed, section 430.206(c) was not then enforceable under section 7116(a)(7) of the Statute because it did not implement 5 U.S.C. 2302. The 1-year renewal term expired on October 18, 1986, and the agreement was renewed for another 1-year term commencing October 19, 1986. In our view, the automatic 1-year renewal that commenced October 19, 1986, could not preclude the enforcement of section 430.206(c) under section 7116(a)(7). We interpret section 7116(a)(7) to provide that preexisting collective bargaining agreement provisions are to govern for the express term of the collective bargaining agreement of which they are a part, but that provisions of a renewed agreement do not operate to override Government-wide regulations existing on the effective date of the new term of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reach this conclusion on the basis of the status accorded Government-wide regulations. As noted, Government-wide regulations are binding on Federal agencies and Federal officials to which they apply. In addition, under section 7117 of the Statute, Government-wide regulations bar the negotiation of, and agreement on, union proposals that conflict with them. In view of this, we believe that the policies of the Statute are best served by interpreting and applying section 7116(a)(7) narrowly. The policies underlying section 7116(a)(7) of preservation, stability, and certainty of the collective bargaining agreements that exist on the date a Government-wide regulation is prescribed and the policy of the Statute barring negotiations in conflict with Government-wide regulations are all accommodated by preserving the collective bargaining provisions for the express term of the agreement during which the Government-wide regulation was first prescribed, but no longer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, contrary to the argument of the Union, we do not find that the enforceability of Government-wide regulations is dependent on negotiations upon the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement. The enforceability of the Government-wide regulation occurs by operation of law when the agreement expires. Consequently, section 430.206(c) governed resolution of the grievances in relation to the conflicting provisions of Article XIX of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the award is deficient because it enforces provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and PMM chapter 17 that conflict with 5 C.F.R. 430.206(c), a Government-wide regulation that became effective prior to the collective bargaining agreement governing the 1988 ratings. Consequently, we will modify the award to require that the ordered reappraisals be conducted in a manner consistent with 5 C.F.R. 430.206(c).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the argument regarding the new policy's implementation, &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7) of the Statute states, in pertinent part, that it is an unfair labor practice for an agency to "enforce any...regulation...which is in conflict with any applicable collective bargaining agreement if the agreement was in effect before the date the...regulation was prescribed[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7).

In such cases, the Authority has held that an automatically renewed agreement is subject to agency&#8209;head review beginning "the day after the expiration of the contractual window period for requesting renegotiation of the expiring agreement,"[5] and that the automatically renewed agreement must comply with any government&#8209;wide rules or regulations that changed during the agreement's previous term.[6]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;An expiring agreement that remains in force until the parties reach a new agreement is effectively renewed automatically every day, so, for as long as the expiring agreement continues in force during renegotiations, a new agency&#8209;head&#8209;review period begins each day.</p>

Those provisions do not establish a concrete date after which government&#8209;wide regulations that became effective during the agreement's original term will come into force.[24]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;We cannot conclude that Congress intended for time-sensitive actions to be delayed by whatever length of time it takes agencies and unions to renegotiate new agreements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, when the Authority clarified the mechanics for conducting agency&#8209;head review of automatically renewed agreements under &#x00A7; 7114(c), the Authority recognized that predictability would safeguard the role of agency&#8209;head review in "ensur[ing] that collective[&#8209;]bargaining agreements conform to applicable laws and regulations."[25] Thus, unambiguous, knowable effective dates and durations are critical to fulfilling the purposes of both &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7114(c) and 7116(a)(7). And, for the reasons already discussed, continuance provisions of indefinite duration fail to provide parties with such certainty.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_1968"></span>[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Army</span>, 47 FLRA at 942.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a continuance provision of indefinite duration extends an agreement's operation, that newly extended agreement is, in a meaningful sense,[26] no longer the same one that was "in effect" before the extension occurred.[27] Rather than serving as a source of predictable, fixed expectations, an indefinitely extended agreement is merely a "temporary stopgap" that one or both parties are working to change.[28] As such, an indefinitely extended agreement lacks the parties' confidences in a way that an original, renegotiated, or rollover agreement does not. Yet both renegotiated and rollover agreements reset the clock on the &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7) bar for another contract term counter-intuitively, a temporary stopgap does not do either of those things.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;At least as meaningful as the change involved when a rollover agreement becomes effective.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, when an agreement contains a continuance provision, parties that fail to initiate or complete renegotiations in time to reach a new agreement before the existing one expires know that such a failure will trigger the operation of the continuance provision. Therefore, by their course of conduct, those parties effectively execute a new, extended agreement when they allow the continuance provision to go into effect.[29] Treating agreements that are extended pursuant to an indefinite continuance provision in this manner accords with the Authority's treatment of automatically renewed, or rollover, agreements. In the case of rollover agreements, the parties' <span class="Italic">lack of action</span>--namely, their decision not to request renegotiations--confirms the effectiveness of the expiring agreement's provisions for an additional term,[30] and triggers the window for agency-head review of the automatically renewed agreement.[31] Similarly, parties that fail to initiate or complete renegotiations in time to prevent the operation of a continuance provision are executing an extension of their agreement through their lack of action.</p>

Because the parties conduct will trigger the operation of a continuance provision only once--specifically, when it first extends the expiring agreement for an additional, indefinite term that lasts until a new agreement is reached--we reject USDA's suggestion that an indefinitely extended agreement is effectively renewed automatically every day.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For all of the foregoing reasons, we find that when, as a result of one or both parties seeking to renegotiate an existing collective&#8209;bargaining agreement, a continuance provision extends the agreement's operation beyond the originally established, concrete expiration date, the first day of the extension period that is beyond the original expiration date marks the beginning of a new term for the agreement under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7114(c) and 7116(a)(7).[32] On that first day of the extension, all government&#8209;wide regulations that became effective during the previous term of the agreement will, where applicable, govern the parties immediately by operation of law, and the thirty&#8209;day period for agency&#8209;head review will begin.[33]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> note 29. The next opportunity for agency&#8209;head review would occur after the parties execute an agreement that terminates or supersedes the extended agreement that the continuance provision put into effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we grant USDA's request, but we confine our decision to the foregoing analysis, rather than adopting the policy formulations that USDA proposed.</p>
<p class="noindent">On judicial review, FLRA's <span class="Italic">Guidance</span> on the effect of contract continuance clauses was set aside. Continuance of a contract does not open the door for agency-head review; it does not alter the contractual blocking effect on new regulations. <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 45 F.4th 121, 121-27 (D.C. Cir. 2022), determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute grants the heads of federal agencies the right to review collective bargaining agreements before they go into effect. Once an agreement passes such review, the Statute forbids enforcement of new regulations that conflict with the agreement. The question presented is whether the triggering of a continuance clause, which extends a contract pending negotiations of a successor agreement, permits a second round of agency-head review and enforcement of conflicting regulations that became effective after the original agreement. We hold that the operation of a continuance clause does not have either consequence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute permits an agency head to review a collective bargaining agreement before it takes effect. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(1). The agency head must approve the agreement unless it conflicts with applicable federal law. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2). If the agency head fails to act within 30 days of the agreement's execution, the agreement takes effect and binds the parties for its duration. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute generally prohibits agencies from enforcing regulations that conflict with the terms of an existing collective bargaining agreement and that became effective after the agreement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7). This prohibition runs for the life of the agreement. But once a collective bargaining agreement expires, all regulations issued since its effective date become enforceable. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Com. PTO &#x0026; NTEU Chapter 245</span>, 65 F.L.R.A. 817, 819 (2011).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Collective bargaining agreements often specify what happens when the agreement nears its expiration and the parties have not negotiated a successor contract. Relevant terms may include continuance clauses and rollover clauses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A continuance clause allows either party to extend the duration of an expiring agreement until its successor is in place. As the FLRA has explained, a continuance clause provides that, "where renegotiations are requested, the existing agreement continues in force until the parties reach a new one." <span class="Italic">Decision On Request For General Statement Of Policy Or Guidance</span>, 71 F.L.R.A. 986, 986 (2020) (<span class="Italic">Guidance</span>). The following language is illustrative:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If renegotiation of the Agreement is in process but not completed upon the expiration date of this Agreement, this Agreement will be extended until the renegotiations have been completed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Collective Bargaining Agreement between the National Alliance of Postal and Federal Employees (NAPFE) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 42, Art. 40.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A rollover clause, by contrast, automatically renews a collective bargaining agreement when neither party wishes to renegotiate. Such a clause typically specifies a window for either party to give notice of its desire to renegotiate. If neither party does, the agreement "rolls over" for a new term. The following language is illustrative:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This Agreement will remain in full force and effect for 6 years from its effective date and automatically renew itself from year to year thereafter. However, either party may give written or electronic notice of its intent to add, amend, reopen, modify or terminate existing Articles of the Agreement not more than 120 or less than 90 calendar days prior to the expiration date.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">National Agreement between the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the Social Security Administration 33, Art. 7, &#x00A7; 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Department of Agriculture asked the FLRA for guidance on whether an agency head may review a collective bargaining agreement when it is extended under a continuance clause. The Authority concluded that agency heads may do so. <span class="Italic">Guidance</span>, 71 F.L.R.A. at 989. It further concluded that, when an agreement is so extended, the employing agency may begin to enforce regulations that conflict with the agreement and that became effective after the agreement's original effective date. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Member DuBester dissented. In his view, the Authority should not have given general guidance divorced from the precise language of specific continuance clauses. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 990. Further, he concluded that the guidance conflicts with the Statute and with FLRA precedent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 990-91.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We review FLRA orders under the standards set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c). And we review FLRA interpretations of the Statute under the familiar <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> framework. <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 2031 v. FLRA</span>, 878 F.2d 460, 464 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>); <span class="Italic">see Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC</span>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Thus, we defer if the Authority has reasonably construed an ambiguous provision, but we use all available tools of statutory construction to decide whether the provision is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 842-43 &#x0026; n.9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The guidance at issue interpreted two provisions. First, the FLRA read section 7114(c) to permit agency-head review of a collective bargaining agreement when a party has extended it under a continuance clause. Second, the FLRA read section 7116(a)(7) not to bar the employing agency from enforcing later-in-time regulations that conflict with the agreement. We set aside both interpretations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We start with agency-head review. Section 7114(c) permits such review only "30 days from the date the agreement is executed." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2). So the question is whether the extension of an agreement under a <span id="page_1969"></span>continuance clause constitutes the execution of a new agreement. The Statute does not define "executed," so that term presumably derives its meaning from background principles of contract law. <span class="Italic">See FAA v. Cooper</span>, 566 U.S. 284, 292 (2012). Under those principles, a written agreement is executed when the parties complete the formalities necessary to bring the agreement into its final, legally enforceable form. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Housing Auth. of City of Dallas v. Killingsworth</span>, 331 S.W.3d 806, 811 (Tex. Ct. App. 2011); <span class="Italic">Nielsen Constr. Co. v. Int'l Iron Prods</span>., 22 Cal.Rptr.2d 497, 500 (Cal.Ct.App. 1993); <span class="Italic">Execute</span>, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The guidance posits the execution of a new agreement--and thus a second round of agency-head review--whenever an existing agreement is extended under a continuance clause. 71 F.L.R.A. at 988. But a continuance clause takes effect when either party seeks <span class="Italic">unilaterally</span> to renegotiate the terms of an expiring agreement. It manifests the parties' intent to be bound by the terms of their <span class="Italic">original</span> agreement pending further negotiations. And it remains in effect only while the parties continue to <span class="Italic">disagree</span> over the terms of any successor agreement. Thus, a continuance clause "simply lengthens the existing agreement for a new period of time." <span class="Italic">Eastham v. Chesapeake Appalachia, LLC</span>, 754 F.3d 356, 362 (6th Cir. 2014) (applying Ohio law) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Nebo Ventures, LLC v. NovaPro Risk Sols., LP</span>, 752 S.E.2d 18, 27 (Ga.Ct.App. 2013) ("An extension...does not contemplate a new agreement." (cleaned up)); <span class="Italic">Extension</span>, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (providing for the "continuation of the same contract for a specified period"); <span class="Italic">Renewal and Extension of Contracts, Generally</span>, 17B C.J.S. Contracts &#x00A7; 668 (2020) (similar). In other words, an agreement with a continuance clause is simply a contract that expires on the later of a date certain or the adoption of a successor agreement. For these reasons, neither the invocation nor the operation of a continuance clause executes a new agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The guidance relied on administrative precedent addressing the operation of rollover clauses. 71 F.L.R.A. at 988-89 &#x0026; nn.29-30. It cited an order holding that an "automatically renewed agreement is subject to agency-head approval" upon each renewal. <span class="Italic">Kansas Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 47 F.L.R.A. 937, 942 (1993). Whatever the merits of that ruling, it has no applicability to continuance clauses. A rollover clause takes effect when neither party expresses a desire to renegotiate during a specified window, which may plausibly be described as assenting to a new agreement through mutual inaction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Eastham</span>, 754 F.3d at 361-62 (rollover clause specifies how "to execute a new contract" (cleaned up)); <span class="Italic">Distillery Rectifying &#x0026; Wine Workers Int'l Union of Am. v. Brown-Forman Distillers Corp</span>., 213 S.W.2d 610, 613 (Ky. 1948). In contrast, we have found no support for treating the invocation of a continuance clause as executing a new agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA contends that the word "executed" is at least ambiguous enough for its interpretation to warrant <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. Two of the cases it cites merely confirm the uncontroversial principle that the parties themselves may determine what steps should be required to execute-i.e., finalize-their agreement. <span class="Italic">See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians Kentucky</span>, 70 F.L.R.A. 968, 969 (2018); <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg Ass'n of Teachers</span>, 44 F.L.R.A. 852, 857-58 (1992). Its third case held that the agreement subject to agency-head review includes terms imposed by the Federal Service Impasses Panel in binding arbitration. <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 778 F.2d 850, 857 (D.C. Cir. 1985). That holding rests on the statutory definition of the phrase "collective bargaining agreement," which includes terms imposed by the Impasses Panel. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(8); <span class="Italic">see AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 712 F.2d 640, 646 n.24 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Our reasoning on this point does nothing to undercut the default rule that, absent a statutory directive to the contrary, a contractual agreement requires the parties' mutual assent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Northland Capital Corp. v. Silver</span>, 735 F.2d 1421, 1427 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Nor do the AFGE cases say anything about when an agreement is "executed"--a question we did not address. <span class="Italic">See</span> 778 F.2d at 857 ("a Panel-imposed settlement, <span class="Italic">once adopted by the parties</span>, should be regarded as part of a collective bargaining agreement" (emphasis added) (quoting 712 F.2d 640, 646 n.24)). None of these cases bears on the question presented here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because invoking a continuance clause does not execute a new agreement, there is no statutory basis for a second round of agency-head review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(7) forbids employing agencies from enforcing most regulations that conflict with a collective bargaining "agreement" that was "in effect" before the regulation issued. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7). The FLRA concluded that, once an agreement has been extended through a continuance clause, the agency may enforce all conflicting regulations that became effective before the extension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For many of the reasons already discussed, section 7116(a)(7) cannot bear that interpretation. As shown above, contract extensions preserve an existing agreement rather than supplant it with a new one. Thus, an extended contract is the same "agreement" that was "in effect" before the extension. And so long as it remains in effect, the employing agency may not enforce new regulations that conflict with it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's own description of continuance clauses reinforces our conclusion. According to the Authority, a continuance clause provides for an existing agreement to remain "in force" during renegotiations. <span class="Italic">Guidance</span>, 71 F.L.R.A. at 986. Yet section 7116(a)(7) bars enforcement of conflicting regulations while an agreement remains "in effect." And there is no difference between the terms "in force" and "in effect," which are used interchangeably. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v. Akron &#x0026;Barberton Belt R.R. Co</span>., 385 F.2d 581, 611 (D.C. Cir. 1967) (labor agreements "in force continued in effect"); <span class="Italic">Liddell by Liddell v. Bd. of Educ. of St. Louis</span>, 105 F.3d 1208, 1211 (8th Cir. 1997) (similar).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Seeking deference, the FLRA contends that the phrase "in effect" is ambiguous because the terms of expired collective bargaining agreements sometimes continue to have legal force. For support, the Authority cites <span class="Italic">U.S. Border Patrol Livermore Sector</span>, 58 F.L.R.A. 231 (2002), which states "the general principle that parties to an expired agreement continue to be bound by the provisions of that agreement until otherwise agreed or the provisions are modified in a manner consistent with the Statute." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 233. But this case does not involve expired agreements. And the fact that even expired agreements <span class="Italic">may</span> in some sense remain "in effect" hardly supports the FLRA's position that agreements extended under a continuance clause do <span class="Italic">not</span> remain "in effect."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the invocation of a continuance clause extends a collective bargaining agreement pending negotiations over its successor, the existing agreement remains "in effect" until a new agreement is in place. Thus, the employing agency may not enforce regulations that conflict with the agreement and that became effective after it did.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's guidance conflicts with the Statute, so we grant the petitions for review and set aside the guidance.</p>
