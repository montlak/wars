<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-64"><span class="space">h.</span> Post-Removal Conduct or Evidence of Rehabilitation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board defers to an agency penalty determination, the <span class="Italic">de novo</span> quality of its hearing process and that of labor arbitrators requires consideration of evidence of rehabilitation, e.g., changes in medical conditions or stressors, occurring after the removal as a component of assessment of a penalty. <span class="Italic">Norris v. SEC</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/11-3129%20order.pdf">675 F.3d 1349</a>, 1355-57 (Fed. Cir. 2012), reviewing an arbitration award, explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the Board's review is designed to determine whether the agency's action was reasonable, it can be argued that such a determination limits the Board's review to the evidence before the agency at the time of its decision. After all, a court's review of agency action to determine whether it was arbitrary and capricious is typically limited to review of the agency record.[4] But we think that the Board's function is different from that of a reviewing court. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1), Congress required that the Board develop a new record. The Board must review the agency's action based on the new record. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1). In enacting this provision, Congress clearly contemplated that the new record would extend to all aspects of the case. "The Committee amended [&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701(b)-(c)] to make it absolutely clear that an employee would receive a <span class="Italic">full evidentiary hearing</span> in any case where there is a dispute as to any genuine and material issue of fact..." S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 53-54 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2775-76 (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also</span> H.R. Rep. No. 95-1717, at 137 (1978) (Conf. Rep.), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2860, 2871 ("[t]he employee is entitled to a hearing on appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board."). Given the Board's duty to conduct an independent assessment of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine the reasonableness of the penalty, <span class="Italic">see Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.B. at 332-33, we see no reason to distinguish between requiring the Board to consider new evidence relating to the agency's decision on the merits of the underlying misconduct and requiring the Board to consider new evidence regarding the reasonableness of the penalty imposed. Thus, we think new evidence, even on the question of penalty, should be considered by the Board (subject to the employee's right to notice of the basis for the removal described above).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2353"></span>[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.</span>, 435 U.S. 519, 555 (1978) ("[t]he role of a court in reviewing the sufficiency of an agency's consideration of environmental factors is a limited one, limited both by the <span class="Italic">time at which the decision was made</span> and by the statute mandating review." (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">Co-Steel Raritan, Inc. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n</span>, 357 F.3d 1294, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("[I]f litigants could demand rehearing as a matter of law because of new circumstances, new trends or new facts, 'there would be little hope that the administrative process could ever be consummated in an order that would not be subject to reopening.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Vt. Yankee,</span> 435 U.S. at 554-55)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has consistently recognized its obligation to consider new evidence affecting the penalty determination in weighing the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors.[5] And in <span class="Italic">Malloy v. United States Postal Service</span>, 578 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2009), we impliedly decided this very question. <span class="Italic">Malloy</span> involved a United States Postal Service ("USPS") worker who had been removed from service due to a series of inappropriate exchanges with her supervisor. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1354. The USPS issued Malloy a notice of proposed removal on August 29, 2006; and she was ultimately removed effective October 6, 2006. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Malloy appealed her removal to the Board. At the hearing before the Board, Malloy submitted extensive medical evidence, including, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a post-removal report dated December 5, 2006, from Malloy's physician who had treated her for severe recurrent major depression from September 26, 2006, to December 16, 2006. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1355. The report specifically linked Malloy's inappropriate behavior to her medical condition. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In sustaining Malloy's removal, the Board failed to explicitly address the medical evidence submitted by Malloy, though it noted that it had "reviewed her submissions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1356. We held that "when mental impairment or illness is reasonably substantiated, and is shown to be related to the ground of removal, this must be taken into account when taking an adverse action against the employee." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, although the Board stated that all of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors had been considered, because the Board failed to explicitly analyze Malloy's medical evidence, we remanded the case for consideration of Malloy's evidence (including the post-removal report) and "reapplication of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in light of this evidence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1357.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Malloy</span>, the Board is tasked with independently assessing the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine whether the penalty imposed was reasonable. <span class="Italic">See also Lachance</span>, 178 F.3d at 1257 ("That the Board always should have independent balancing authority seems manifest in view of the Reform Act's purpose in creating the Board to determin[e] whether [the civil service] system is free from abuse." (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Thus, we hold that where new evidence in mitigation of the penalty imposed is presented to the Board (or the arbitrator), the evidence must be considered in determining whether the agency's imposed penalty was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the arbitrator erred in holding that "post-removal...good conduct is not relevant to the issue before the arbitrator." In assessing the reasonableness of the penalty imposed, the arbitrator was required to consider post-removal evidence that was brought to his attention. On remand, the arbitrator should consider the post-removal evidence submitted by Norris in evaluating the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. We express no opinion as to the weight to be given such mitigating evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, we leave to the arbitrator to determine whether, in light of all the evidence, the penalty of removal "did strike a responsible balance within tolerable limits of reasonableness." <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.B. at 333.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Koester v. U.S. Park Police</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/17-2613.Opinion.1-3-2019.pdf">758 Fed. Appx. 925, 930-31</a> (Fed. Cir. 2019 NP), relying on <span class="Italic">Norris</span>, noted the obligation of an arbitrator to consider mitigation evidence that was not presented to the deciding official:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Koester argues that the arbitrator abused his discretion when he ignored new evidence that was not presented to the agency because our case law requires arbitrators to consider all evidence when independently assessing the reasonableness of a penalty. Mr. Koester contends that the arbitrator did not consider his ability to demonstrate improvement after completing the Employee Assistance Program, the impact of Hurricane Sandy on his state of mind, the environment of mocking and bullying, and the effect of his wife's poor immigration interview. The Park Police responds that the arbitrator heard all the evidence, considered it, and simply afforded it less weight than Mr. Koester would desire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Arbitrators cannot wholly disregard new evidence when assessing the reasonableness of an agency's penalty. In <span class="Italic">Norris v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, the arbitrator ignored all the facts and circumstances that were not before the agency at the time of its decision. 675 F.3d 1349, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2012). We held "that where new evidence in mitigation of the penalty imposed is presented...to the arbitrator[ ], the evidence must be considered in determining whether the agency's imposed penalty was reasonable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1357. We reasoned that the arbitrator cannot ignore evidence bearing on the reasonableness of the penalty merely because it was not presented to the agency, given that the arbitrator is required to assess independently the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1356.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the arbitrator abused his discretion when, during his independent assessment of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, he refused to consider evidence that he believed was never presented to the agency. He gave no weight to Mr. Koester's ability to demonstrate improvement after completing the Employee Assistance Program, the impact of Hurricane Sandy, the unfriendly work environment, and the effect of Mr. Koester's wife's poor immigration interview because the Union did not refer to that evidence at the agency level in its response to the Park Police's proposed removal. That rationale for disregarding evidence is clearly contrary to our decision in <span class="Italic">Norris</span>. <span class="Italic">See Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Mgmt. Sys., Inc</span>., 572 U.S. 559, 563 n.2 (2014) (indicating that taking an erroneous view of the law necessarily constitutes an abuse of discretion). And the arbitrator's erroneous view of the law is not harmless. He gave no alternative explanation for discounting some of that evidence even if it were in the mix, and we therefore cannot say without impermissibly reweighing the evidence ourselves whether that new body of evidence would alter the arbitrator's evaluation of the reasonableness of the agency's removal penalty.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Norris v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, 675 F.3d 1349, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2012), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that, where new evidence relevant to potential mitigation of the imposed penalty is presented to the Board (or an arbitrator), the evidence must be considered in determining whether the agency's imposed penalty was reasonable. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on the Board's duty to develop a new record and "to conduct an independent assessment of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine the reasonableness of the penalty." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1356 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1); <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06).[3] Although the court concluded that the arbitrator was required to consider post-removal evidence that was brought to his attention and remanded the appeal for further adjudication, it expressed no opinion as to the weight to be given such mitigating evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1357.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In so ruling, the court noted that the Board has consistently recognized its obligation to consider new evidence affecting the penalty determination in weighing the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1356 n.5 (citing <span class="Italic">Sherlock v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this matter, the record reflects that the administrative judge considered the appellant's evidence of her rehabilitation efforts consistent with <span class="Italic">Norris</span>. The administrative judge allowed extensive evidence and testimony regarding the appellant's post-removal rehabilitation, including her subsequent rehabilitation from alcohol addiction, her commencement of divorce proceedings against her abusive husband, and her adoption of healthy lifestyle choices. As to this evidence and testimony, however, the administrative judge stated that "an appellant's mere participation in a rehabilitative program cannot preclude an agency from instituting disciplinary action in every case in which an employee has sought and received assistance," as "[s]uch an interpretation, impermissibly undermines the agency's primary discretion in exercising its managerial obligation to maintain employee discipline and efficiency." The administrative judge recognized that the appellant submitted <span id="Page_2354"></span>evidence of difficult personal circumstances including alcoholism, drug abuse, and an abusive husband and adult daughter. However, although the administrative judge "sympathize[d] with the appellant's [evidence of difficult personal] circumstances," she nonetheless deemed that the penalty of removal was reasonable and advanced the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Norris</span> and <span class="Italic">Hooper</span> were applied in <span class="Italic">Backer v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DE-0752-12-0315-I-1 (NP 7/1/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously noted, the appellant contends on review that she has received treatment for her depression and physical ailments, and that, as a result, she has not experienced any new work-related problems. Where new evidence relevant to potential mitigation of an imposed penalty is presented to the Board, the evidence must be considered in determining whether the agency's imposed penalty was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Norris v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, 675 F.3d 1349, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">Hooper v. Department of Interior</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 12 (2014). Here, in assessing the reasonableness of the penalty, the administrative judge noted that the deciding official considered the appellant's performance after the date of the notice of proposed removal to determine whether she had shown any improvement. The appellant has presented no evidence or argument indicating that the administrative judge disallowed testimony or evidence regarding the appellant's alleged recovery or rehabilitation efforts. Further, the appellant has failed to show that any such evidence was of sufficient weight to warrant mitigation of the penalty of removal in this case. <span class="Italic">See Hooper</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 15. Therefore, the appellant has failed to provide a basis for disturbing the administrative judge's finding that the penalty of removal was within the bounds of reasonableness.</p>
