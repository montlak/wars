<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-131"><span class="space">2.</span> Failure to Follow Instruction</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Management has a fundamental right to expect that its decisions will be obeyed and its instructions carried out. <span class="Italic">Washington v. VA</span>, <span class="Italic"></span> DA-0752-15-0413-I-1 (NP 2/15/2023). "[A] failure to follow instructions affects an agency's ability to carry out its mission and is clearly connected to the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> CH-0752-09-0691-I-1 (NP 12/15/2010) (citing <span class="Italic">Blevins v. Dept. of Army</span>, 26 MSPR 101, 104 (1985)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Mayeske v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 479 Fed. Appx. 345, 347 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP) ("'Failure to follow instructions or abide by requirements affects the agency's ability to carry out its mission.' <span class="Italic">Blevins v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 101, 104 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 790 F.2d 95 (Fed. Cir. 1986).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Powell v. USPS</span>, 122 MSPR 60, 63-64 &#x00B6; 5, 2014 MSPB 89 (2014), refined analysis of the charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove a charge of failure to follow instructions, an agency must establish that the employee: (1) was given proper instructions, and (2) failed to follow the instructions, without regard to whether the failure was intentional or unintentional. <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 547, 555-56 (1996). Here, the agency's charge implicated the standing instruction to ensure that all outgoing mail received during the day is placed onto the last dispatch truck or otherwise taken to the plant, and complete a closeout verifying the same.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Grissom v. VA</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP):</p>
<p class="Body-Text">...To prove a charge of failure to follow an instruction, "an agency must <span id="Page_2607"></span>establish that the employee (1) was given proper instructions, and (2) failed to follow the instructions." <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Dep't of Veterans Affs</span>., 740 F. App'x 710, 713 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 71 M.S.P.R. 547, 555-56 (1996)). "Proof of a failure to follow instructions charge requires the agency to show that an employee failed to follow a proper instruction...." <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 930 F.3d at 1368 (citing <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 556).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Insubordination and failure to follow supervisory instructions are distinct charges. Under current interpretations, "[u]nlike a charge of insubordination, a charge of failure to follow instructions does not require proof that the failure was intentional." <span class="Italic">Parbs v. USPS</span>, 107 MSPR 559, 564-66 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 11, 2007 MSPB 302 (2007) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Parbs v. USPS</span>, 301 Fed. Appx. 923 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP)). "[A] failure to follow instructions affects an agency's ability to carry out its mission and is thus clearly connected to the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 429 Fed. Appx. 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP) ("Each task assigned by Ms. Klajbor to Mr. Johnson related directly to Mr. Johnson's employment with the Agency and was generated while he was working for the Agency. Thus, Mr. Johnson's refusal to follow instructions, by failing to complete these assigned tasks on time, impacted the Agency's ability to carry out its mission and operate efficiently."). Although the appellant may find an instruction intrusive--a directive to avoid workplace contact with another employee--he is not free to disregard it. <span class="Italic">Gilliam v.

<p class="Body-Text">At first the Board determined that "in the absence of a meritorious defense there is no requirement that a charge of refusal to comply with specific instructions be specifically attributed by the agency to insubordinate intent." <span class="Italic">Gatling v. NTSB</span>, 17 MSPR 43, 48 (1983) (citing <span class="Italic">Erenreich v. United States</span>, 164 Ct. Cl. 214 (1964)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 6, 7-8 (1984) (insubordination embraced a failure to follow instructions coupled with taking certain actions contrary to those instructions). The Board then decided that the charge of failing to follow instructions required a direct or circumstantial showing of the appellant's insubordinate intent, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOJ</span>, 61 MSPR 110, 113 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge pointed out during the prehearing conference, a charge of failing to follow a supervisor's instructions is equivalent to a charge of insubordination, <span class="Italic">Bassett v. Department of the Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 66, 69 (1987). In order to prove a charge of insubordination, an agency must show that the employee willfully refused to obey an order entitled to be obeyed. <span class="Italic">Bonanova v. Department of Education</span>, 49 MSPR 294, 302 (1991). A necessary component of this charge is that the agency prove that the order was given to the employee. <span class="Italic">Boscoe v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 54 MSPR 315, 320 (1992). We find that the administrative judge was correct in concluding that the agency failed to prove the charge of insubordination because it failed to prove that the agency gave an order to the appellant that remained in effect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson</span> was partially overruled by <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 547, 555-56 (1996), concluding that proof of intent is not required as to a charge of failure to follow supervisory instructions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Justice</span>, 61 MSPR 110, 113 (1994), the Board held that a charge of failure to follow supervisory instructions was equivalent to a charge of insubordination. A charge of insubordination requires proof of intentional and willful refusal to obey an order entitled to be obeyed, rather than a negligent or otherwise unintentional failure to obey an order. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. General Services Administration</span>, 878 F.2d 370, 373 (Fed. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Forgett,</span> 45 MSPR at 204. We hereby modify <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Insubordination and failure to follow supervisory instructions are separate charges with different standards of proof. Insubordination is defined as a refusal to obey some order that a superior officer is entitled to give and have obeyed. <span class="Italic">Gallagher v. Department of Labor,</span> 10 MSPB 528, 11 MSPR 612, 614 n.3 (1982) (citing <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> (4th ed. 1968)). To sustain a charge of insubordination, the agency must establish that the refusal to obey a proper order was intentional and willful disobedience. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, failure to follow supervisory instructions does not turn on proof of intent. <span class="Italic">Green v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 626, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 36 F.3d 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __U.S.__, 115 S. Ct. 1982, 131 L. Ed.2d 870 (1995). An agency may prove the charge by establishing that proper instructions were given to an employee and that the employee failed to follow them, without regard to whether the failure was intentional or unintentional.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By equating insubordination with failure to follow supervisory instructions, the <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> decision made it unnecessarily difficult for an agency to bring an action against an employee for an unintentional failure to follow supervisory instructions. Thus, under <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, an agency could not make the simple charge of failure to follow supervisory instructions without automatically being faced with establishing intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore overrule the holding in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> that a charge of "failure to follow instructions" is equivalent to a charge of insubordination and thus requires proof of intent.[4] <span class="Italic">Cf. Erenreich v. United States,</span> 164 Ct. Cl. 214, 1964 WL 8593 (the agency's description of the charges of refusal to comply with supervisory instructions in its proposal to separate the employee was not procedurally defective for lack of specificity, even though it did not specifically attribute the misconduct to "insubordinate or other reprehensible intent"), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 379 U.S. 857, 85 S. Ct. 111, 13 L. Ed.2d 60 (1964); <span class="Italic">Green v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 626 (the Board did not require proof of intent in sustaining a charge of failure to follow supervisory instructions), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 36 F.3d 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __U.S.__, 115 S. Ct. 1982, 131 L. Ed.2d 870 (1995). An agency should be able to charge an employee with "failure to follow instructions" and not be required to prove an intent to willfully disobey the instructions.[5] If the agency does prove that the employee's failure to follow instructions was intentional rather than merely negligent, then it is free to use that fact as an aggravating factor in the penalty selection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We similarly modify other Board cases that may be read as explicitly or implicitly equating a charge of failure to follow supervisory instructions with a charge of insubordination. <span class="Italic">E.g., Cowins v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 64 MSPR 551, 554, 557-58 (1994); <span class="Italic">Gatling v. National Transportation Safety Board</span>, 17 MSPR 43, 48 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 758 F.2d 667 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We note that agencies have sometimes charged employees with "Insubordination/Failure to Follow Instructions," or the like. <span class="Italic">Creer v. US Postal Service</span>, 62 MSPR 656, 658 (1994); <span class="Italic">see Gallagher v. Department of Labor,</span> 10 MSPB 528, 11 MSPR 612, 613 (1982). If such a combined charge is based on a single incident of misconduct, the agency generally would be required to prove the requisite intent, as discussed in the text above. <span class="Italic">See Gallagher</span>, 11 MSPR at 614 n.3 (proof of intent was required to prove insubordination in a charge of "insubordination and failure to follow supervisory directions"); <span class="Italic">see also Edwards,</span> 62 MSPR at 178; <span class="Italic">Wolak,</span> 53 MSPR at 258-59; <span class="Italic">Roseberry,</span> 51 MSPR at 175.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Of a failure to follow directions, <span class="Italic">Newsome v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 338 Fed. Appx. 902, 905 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's adverse action should be sustained if the agency establishes a nexus between the misconduct and the efficiency of the agency's service and shows that the penalty is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Allred v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 786 F.2d 1128, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The AJ first determined that a nexus with the Agency's efficiency was established because a failure to follow directions, "by its very nature," affects the efficiency of service. A nexus may be established by showing that the employee's misconduct interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1131. Further, "[f]ailure to follow instructions or abide by requirements affects the agency's ability to carry out its mission. <span class="Italic">Blevins v. Dep't of Army,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 101, 104 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 790 F.2d 95 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Thus, "there is a causal connection between an employee's refusal to comply with what the agency believes are properly promulgated instructions and the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Watson v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. 509, 516 (1991) ("It is well established that refusal to <span id="Page_2608"></span>follow proper instructions adversely affects the efficiency of the service."). As discussed above, because substantial evidence supports the finding that Mr. Newsome failed to follow directions that were promulgated by the Agency and his manager, there was no abuse of discretion in finding a nexus between his misconduct and the efficiency of service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Instructions may be adoptive. If an order is given to an employee in the presence of his supervisor and is not contradicted by the supervisor, the employee should obey the order, even if he believes it is improper as issued by someone outside his chain of command. The employee may later raise his objections through the grievance process. <span class="Italic">Perron v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 382 (1983). The failure of a civilian to follow a military supervisor's orders is insubordination warranting adverse action. <span class="Italic">Nikolaou v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3201).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At least some personal involvement is required of an appellant who is charged with failure to follow instructions. In <span class="Italic">McJunckins v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 3 MSPR 422, 3 MSPB 496 (1980), an internal revenue agent was charged with failure to safeguard a tax return in violation of agency regulations. The agency presented no evidence demonstrating that the loss of the return was attributable to the appellant's negligence. The return was missing, and it was last charged to the appellant, but the appellant testified that he knew of the agency's security procedures and followed them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A charge of "knowingly and deliberately" violating "clear and explicit" instructions suggests that the agency should prove that the instructions were clear. Removal of an SES member was reversed through analysis of hearing testimony that the instructions he allegedly violated, apparently involving expenditure authorizations, were ambiguous. <span class="Italic">Ruch v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 18 MSPR 674, 675-76 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Rackers v. DOJ</span>, 79 MSPR 262, 280 (1998) (charge of failing to follow instructions was not sustained when the record reflected several opinions among agency managers concerning the implementation of the regulation). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 84 MSPR 132, 139 &#x00B6; 13 (1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOJ</span>, 61 MSPR 110 (1994), for the proposition that terminology such as "want" or "need," though equivocal, does not alone support a finding that the appellant was not given an order he was required to obey).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even a workplace dispute that is personal in origin may result in a sustained charge of failing to follow instructions, as in <span class="Italic">Stewart v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 102, 104 (1982), involving a disagreement over the return of some cigarettes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]ppellant urges that a distinction be made between the failure to follow a supervisor's personal instruction and the failure to follow a work-related instruction. Although appellant admitted borrowing his supervisor's cigarettes, he alleged that the employees in his unit had established a practice of borrowing each others' cigarettes. Irrespective of this practice, appellant was asked repeatedly by his supervisor to return her personal property but deliberately refused to do so. We therefore find that this charge was supported by a preponderance of the evidence. In our view, the employees' alleged practice of borrowing and lending cigarettes while on duty carried the potential for disputes and disruption of the workplace. Thus we find that the supervisor's requests were sufficiently work-related and warranted appellant's compliance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant is charged with failing to follow instructions pertaining to the security of an installation, "it is not the Board's role to supplant the agency's security-related decisions, including those involving staffing." <span class="Italic">Gmitro v. Dept. of Army</span>, 95 MSPR 89, 94 &#x00B6; 15 (2003).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Note 5 USC 2302(b)(9) making it a prohibited personnel practice for an agency to:</p>
