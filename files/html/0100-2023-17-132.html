<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-130"><span class="space">d.</span> Examples of Awards Successfully Challenged</h5>
<p class="noindent">An award was set aside because it did not draw its essence from the contract in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Maxwell AFB and AFGE Local 997</span>, 51 FLRA 754, 758-60 (1996) (Grievance 3). The arbitrator required the agency to rerate the employee because the agency failed to justify the employee's rating with a narrative statement. FLRA set aside the award because the parties' agreement specifically exempted the rating level received by the grievant from a requirement that it be supported with a narrative statement. An award was found wanting under the "failure to draw its essence" standard in <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 4 FLRA 98, 102-03 (1980). The question before the arbitrator was whether the grievant, the union president, was required to exhaust an allowance of 90 days of official time for labor-management relations matters before he could request and obtain leave without pay under the contract for that same purpose. The contract provided that the union president would receive 90 days in pay status for labor-management business in each school year. Another provision stated that in addition to the 90 days, the president would be permitted to take LWOP for any remaining portion of the school year. The arbitrator decided that the contract did not require that the 90-day allowance be exhausted before the president of the union had an entitlement to LWOP. As a remedy, the arbitrator directed that time requested and denied for LWOP be converted to allowed official time without charge to the 90 days permitted by the contract. FLRA threw out the remedy because the contract allowed either for the use of time against the 90 days of official time provided or for the use of time to be assessed as LWOP; the creation by the arbitrator of a third type of pay status for labor-management business (neither LWOP nor chargeable against the 90 days' allowance) evidenced "a manifest disregard of the agreement which expressly provides only two options as to pay status." <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul and AFGE Local 1441</span>, 72 FLRA 634 (2022) (setting aside award finding that a "working supervisor" improperly covered unit work, resulting from shift vacancies, that would otherwise have been performed on overtime when neither the contract nor any MOU precluded the practice).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the agreement specifically excludes a matter from arbitration or from a form of review such as expedited arbitration, an award that violates the contract limitation will be set aside as failing to draw its essence from the agreement, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Kansas City and AFGE Local 1336</span>, 51 FLRA 725, 730-32 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To demonstrate that an award fails to draw its essence from the agreement, the appealing party must show that the arbitration award is: (1) so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; or (2) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (3) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Department of Labor (OSHA) and National Council</span> <span class="Italic">of Field Labor Locals</span>, 34 FLRA 573, 575-76 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 25, Section 7 of the parties' agreement lists the matters subject to expedited arbitration. Pursuant to that provision, an arbitrator could not assert jurisdiction over a performance award grievance unless submission to expedited arbitration was "mutually agreed upon." There is no evidence of agreement, express or implied, by the Agency to submit the award grievance to expedited arbitration and the Arbitrator's award does not support a finding of agreement by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that the Agency opposed expedited arbitration of the performance award grievance when it became aware that the Union intended to present it to arbitration with the appraisal grievance.&#x2003;In addition, the award indicates no actions by the Agency before that objection constituting agreement or acquiescence to its addition. The Arbitrator explained his assertion of jurisdiction in terms of unfairness and the commingling and linkage of the two grievances, and the Union contends that these findings support the award. In view of the specified jurisdictional limitations set forth in Article 25, Section 7, unfairness is not a supportable basis for asserting jurisdiction. Likewise, linkage of the two grievances cannot support a finding of mutual agreement in the absence of evidence that the parties agreed to resolve the linked grievances in expedited, rather than regular, arbitration. There is no such evidence in the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator's assertion of jurisdiction over the performance award grievance is deficient because it fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 547 and Tampa Veterans Administration Hospital</span>, 19 FLRA 725, 727 (1985) (award deficient because arbitrator addressed the agency's denial of an incentive award and ordered the grant of an award even though the collective bargaining agreement specifically excluded decisions on incentive awards from coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Department of the Air Force</span>, <span class="Italic">Oklahoma City Air Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base</span>, <span class="Italic">Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">916</span>, 48 FLRA 342, 348 (1993) (award deficient because arbitrator's interpretation of agreement was incompatible with its plain wording); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Hill Air Force Base, Utah and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1592</span>, 39 FLRA 103, 108 (1991) (award deficient because arbitrator's reliance on collective bargaining agreement could not in any rational way be derived from that agreement and manifestly disregarded its terms).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With this case, we inform the federal labor-management relations community that an arbitrator's award resolving only alleged contract violations cannot draw its essence from a collective-bargaining agreement when the award provides a remedy despite having found no violation of the agreement itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case involves a grievant who worked in Virginia, but asked to telework from Kentucky. The grievance alleged that the Agency violated the parties' agreement when it, among other things, denied her telework request. Arbitrator Malcolm L. Pritzker found that the Agency's actions did not violate the parties' agreement and denied the grievance. Despite this finding, he ordered the Agency to reimburse the grievant for moving expenses with seemingly no explanation other than "[the grievant] was led to believe that she would be able to telework three days a week from Lexington which resulted in her...move to Kentucky."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement because the remedy cannot be rationally derived from the parties' agreement if the Arbitrator found no violation. We agree. Accordingly, we grant the Agency's exception and vacate the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant previously worked for the Agency as a General Schedule (GS)-14 in Virginia. In March 2014, the grievant began teleworking once a week with an alternate duty station (ADS), also in Virginia. In June 2014, she began teleworking three days a week. The grievant and her supervisor discussed the possibility of her teleworking from Lexington, Kentucky because her parents, siblings, and extended family live in Lexington. The grievant moved to Kentucky the first week of August 2014. She was subsequently notified by her supervisor via email on August 4, 2014, that having her ADS in Kentucky would not work because the telework agreement required an employee to be able to return to his or her official duty station within two hours' notice. On August 5, 2014, the grievant responded via email stating that she had already moved and would be teleworking from Kentucky three days a week. On September 19, 2014, the Agency formally denied the grievant's telework request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In October 2014, the grievant requested a hardship transfer to Lexington, Kentucky based on her parents' medical conditions. The Agency offered her a GS-12, Step 10 position, which she accepted. The grievant, represented by the Union, filed a grievance alleging a host of missteps by the Agency. The grievance was submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the issue before the Arbitrator was "[d]id the Agency violate the terms of the collective [b]argaining [a]greement cited in the grievance? If so, what shall be the remedy?" The Arbitrator methodically listed each alleged misstep by the Agency, found that the Agency did not violate the parties' agreement in each instance, and denied the grievance. Despite this finding, he ordered the Agency to reimburse the grievant for an unspecified amount of moving expenses finding "[h]ad she been told that she could not telework from Kentucky[, she] might have kept her ADS in Virginia."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On April 24, 2019, the Agency filed exceptions to the Arbitrator's award. On May 14, 2019, the Union filed its opposition to the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' <span id="page_1887"></span>agreement because the remedy cannot be rationally derived from the agreement. Specifically, the Agency argues that because the Arbitrator found no violation of any of the contested provisions of the parties' agreement, including the telework article, the remedy--requiring the Agency to reimburse the grievant for moving expenses--cannot rationally be derived from the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator here methodically considered each of the provisions the grievant alleged were violated by the Agency, and yet, found the Agency's actions did not constitute a violation. The awarded remedy does not reference or even allude to a concept that would provide for the payment of monies to the grievant. While the Authority has held that arbitrators have broad discretion in fashioning remedies,[7] that discretion does not allow an arbitrator to issue an award based solely on his own notion of industrial justice.[8] When parties ask an arbitrator to interpret their agreement, they do not authorize the arbitrator to fabricate new contractual obligations out of whole cloth.[9] Furthermore, the Authority has held that an award that issues a remedy after finding no violation is contrary to law.[10] Similarly, the Authority has also held that an arbitrator exceeds his authority when he issues a remedy after finding no violation of law or the parties' agreement.[11] Because the Authority has vacated awards on exceeds authority and contrary-to-law grounds when an arbitrator issued a remedy after finding no violation of law or contract,[12] we cannot conclude that an award issuing a remedy when there was no violation somehow draws its essence from the parties' agreement. Therefore, we find that where the only issues before the arbitrator are alleged contractual violations, an award that provides a remedy after finding no violation of the parties' agreement fails on essence grounds because it cannot be rationally derived from the agreement.[13]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For an award to be deficient as failing to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, it must be established that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of an arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement<span class="Italic">. United States Dep't of Labor (OSHA),</span> 34 FLRA 573, 575 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-settled that when a collective bargaining agreement incorporates the regulations with which an award allegedly conflicts, the matter becomes one of contract interpretation because the agreement, not the regulation, governs the matter in dispute. <span class="Italic">See United</span> <span class="Italic">States Dep't of Defense, Hale Koa Hotel, </span>55 FLRA 651, 652 (1999); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Fort</span> <span class="Italic">Campbell Dist., Third Reg., Fort Campbell, Ky.,</span> 37 FLRA 186, 194 (1990). In this case, the parties' agreement expressly incorporates the Agency's uniform policy, and accordingly, the Agency's challenge to the Arbitrator's application of the uniform policy presents a question of contract interpretation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties' agreement provides that "[t]he employer will pay [a uniform] allowance each year to each employee who is required by policy to wear a uniform in the performance of their duties." The Arbitrator construed this provision as requiring the Agency to pay a uniform allowance to the employees at issue, even though he acknowledged that they were not required to wear a uniform while performing correctional duties. The Arbitrator reasoned that the Agency's policy required all employees performing these duties to wear a uniform, despite the fact that the Agency did not require this.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Arbitrator's construction of the agreement is implausible and contrary to its purpose. In this regard, it is apparent that the agreement provides a uniform allowance to those employees required by policy to wear uniforms in the performance of their duties, so that such employees may, in fact, purchase uniforms. That is, under the parties' agreement and Agency policy, the requirement to wear a uniform is a precondition to the Agency's obligation to provide employees a uniform allowance. As there is no dispute that non-correctional <span id="page_1888"></span>employees are not required to wear uniforms when temporarily assigned to correctional posts, they are, therefore, not entitled to the allowance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As non-correctional employees are not required to wear a uniform when temporarily staffing correctional posts, Article 28 cannot be interpreted as entitling those employees to a uniform allowance. Accordingly, we conclude that the award fails to draw its essence from the agreement. <span class="Italic">See, United States Small Business</span> <span class="Italic">Admin., </span>55 FLRA 179, 182 (1999); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't</span> <span class="Italic">of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, United States</span> <span class="Italic">Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kan., </span>53 FLRA 29, 33 (1997); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Oklahoma</span> <span class="Italic">City Air Logistics Command, Tinker AFB, Okla.,</span> 48 FLRA 342, 348-49 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was set aside because it failed to draw its essence from the agreement in <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Del Rio Border Patrol Sector and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2366</span>, 45 FLRA 926, 927-28, 932-33 (1992). The arbitrator concluded that misconduct occurred but set aside a disciplinary suspension because he did not agree with the agency's characterization of the offense. The case is unusual because it really did not turn on contract interpretation. What FLRA was really saying was that the arbitrator placed too much weight on the precise wording of a table of penalties, but FLRA could not invoke MSPB law interpreting the "efficiency of the service" standard or "harmful error" doctrine because the case did not involve an adverse action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On April 23, 1990, the grievant, a pilot employed by the Border Patrol, and a Border Patrol agent were sent to investigate a small boat tied up on the United States side of the Rio Grande River for possible smuggling or alien activity. The grievant piloted the agent to the site and left him to inspect the boat on foot. Finding no signs of people, drugs or other contraband, the agent rowed the boat to a clearing. From his helicopter, the grievant determined that the boat needed to be moved to another location in order to be retrieved by vehicle. Unable to communicate with the agent because the latter's walkie-talkie and the helicopter's ground loud speaker system were not operating, the grievant landed the helicopter to provide assistance or instructions to the agent. After providing assistance, the grievant returned to the helicopter while the other agent remained at the site. Shortly after the helicopter lifted off, the agent testified that he heard a noise and saw white smoke coming from the helicopter. The helicopter then crashed into the water. The grievant was not injured, but there was extensive damage to the helicopter. The grievant was charged with inattention to duty under the Agency's "Standard Schedule of Disciplinary Offenses and Penalties of the U.S. Department of Justice" (schedule of offenses) and suspended for 5 days. A grievance was filed contesting the suspension. The grievance was denied and ultimately proceeded to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator framed the issue as follows: "Was the disciplinary action taken against the grievant for just and sufficient cause and only for such reasons as will promote the efficiency of the [S]ervice? If not, what shall be the appropriate remedy?"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the hearing, the parties advanced various theories as to the possible cause of the crash. Initially, the Arbitrator stated that if pilot error was the cause of the helicopter crash, then "the discipline invoked by management appears well within the scope of its discretion considering the seriousness of the property damage involved." Examining the possible causes of the crash, the Arbitrator found that the theories advanced by the Union "[did] not jibe with the facts." Although on examination the Arbitrator acknowledged that he could not consider pilot error as the conclusive cause of the accident, he found that there was "sufficient evidence to support the finding of management that pilot error was the cause of the accident." The Arbitrator added that he would "abuse his discretion if he were to overturn that finding."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator then addressed whether the charge of inattention to duty was an appropriate basis on which to sustain the disciplinary action and concluded that it was not appropriate.&#x2003;In reaching this result, the Arbitrator examined the schedule of offenses and found that the Agency chose the charge of inattention to duty because there was nothing in the schedule of offenses that more closely fit the case. However, the Arbitrator stated that a determination as to what conduct may constitute inattention to duty is open to interpretation. The Arbitrator noted that the offense with which the grievant was charged is defined in the schedule of offenses as "[l]oafing, wasting time, sleeping on the job, or inattention to duty." Applying the principle of <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span>, the Arbitrator explained that where general words follow an enumeration of words of a specific meaning, the general words must be construed to apply only to things of the same general class as those specifically mentioned. Therefore, the Arbitrator determined that the general words "inattention to duty" may only encompass matters in the nature of loafing, wasting time or sleeping on the job and may not be interpreted to have a broader meaning. The Arbitrator found that the charge of inattention to duty was inappropriate because "[i]t simply does not fit the case[.]" Accordingly, the Arbitrator sustained the grievance and ordered that the grievant "be restored his five days pay plus benefits and holidays, if any, without interest."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The matter before the Arbitrator in the instant case involved a contractual dispute over the right of the Agency to discipline an employee.&#x2003;The parties' agreement contains a just cause provision, which states, in relevant part, that "suspensions of 30 days or less will be taken only for just and sufficient cause and only for such reasons as will promote the efficiency of the Service." The Arbitrator formulated the issue to conform to that language of the agreement. The Arbitrator made a number of findings that were tantamount to a conclusion that there was just and sufficient cause for the discipline of the grievant. In particular, the Arbitrator found that there was sufficient evidence to support the Agency's determination that pilot error was the cause of the accident. This finding, coupled with the Arbitrator's statement that if pilot error was the cause of the helicopter crash, then the discipline imposed by the Agency was within the scope of its discretion lead to the inescapable conclusion that the Arbitrator did in fact find just and sufficient cause to sustain the disciplinary action. However, in setting aside the disciplinary action, the Arbitrator looked beyond the provisions of the parties' agreement and, by doing so, reached a conclusion that was contrary to his findings under the just cause provision of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that arbitrators have the authority under the Civil Service Reform Act to resolve grievances over whether disciplinary action was warranted and, if so, whether the penalty assessed was appropriate....&#8197;If an arbitrator finds that all or part of a disciplinary action is not for just and sufficient cause, the arbitrator may set aside or reduce the imposed penalty....&#8197;However, in this case, we find that there was no basis on which to set aside the disciplinary action in its entirety where the Arbitrator found that there was just cause for such discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we stated above, the Arbitrator's findings were tantamount to a conclusion that there was just and sufficient cause under the parties' agreement to sustain the grievant's suspension. This result does not comport with the Arbitrator's subsequent decision to set aside the discipline based on what the Arbitrator viewed as an inappropriate charge. In our view, the award setting aside the discipline cannot be derived rationally from the parties' agreement and evidences a disregard for the agreement. Therefore, we conclude that the award is deficient insofar as it fails to draw its essence from the agreement and the award must be set aside....</p>

Under this standard, the Authority will find that an arbitration award is deficient as failing to draw its essence from the parties' collective bargaining agreement when the appealing party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitration; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Labor (OSHA)</span>, 34 FLRA 573, 575 (1990). The Authority and the courts defer to arbitrators in this context "because it is the arbitrator's construction of the agreement for which the parties have bargained." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 576.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that this case is similar to <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, in which the Authority found an arbitrator's interpretation of the same provision of the parties' agreement failed to draw its essence from the agreement. Exceptions at 4 (citing <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 61 FLRA 92). The Agency contends that, in that case, like the case here, the agency bypassed the minimum sanction provided for in Article 23 and imposed a penalty that was consistent with the Sanctions Policy. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>the Authority determined that the language of the parties' agreement provided the agency with the ultimate authority to determine the appropriate penalty for the grievant's infraction because the agreement provided the agency with the right to "bypass" lesser forms of discipline for "severe" infractions. <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>61 FLRA at 94 (then-Member Pope dissenting). The Authority found that, under Article 23, Section 1, the agency was "solely authorized" to determine the "degree of discipline" for "severe" behavior and held that, when serious conduct is involved, an arbitrator must uphold the agency's choice of discipline. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This interpretation, however, ignores that Article 23 also provides that all disciplinary action--including those assessed pursuant to management's right to bypass progressive discipline--must be for just cause. Moreover, this interpretation also ignores that "the Agency's exercise of authority under Article 23, like its exercise of authority under other contract provisions, is subject to arbitral scrutiny." <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 61 FLRA at 96 (dissenting opinion of then-Member Pope). Accordingly, we find that <span class="Italic">SSA </span>was wrongly decided and overturn that decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator here held that the just cause requirement of Article 23, Section 1 required the Agency to consider employee misconduct in the context in which it occurred, "taking into account factors such as employment record, length of service, intent, and consequences, if any." The Arbitrator further considered the Agency's ability to bypass progressive discipline, and concluded that, because the infraction was inadvertent and not calculated, the purposes of the Agency could have readily been accomplished with less severe discipline. Such an interpretation is consistent with the express wording of the provision and gives full meaning to both parts of Article 23 at issue here--i.e., that "management may bypass progressive discipline when it determines, by the severe nature of the behavior, that a lesser form of discipline would not be appropriate" and that "bargaining unit employees will be subject to disciplinary or adverse action only for just cause." Indeed, the Arbitrator herself ultimately determined that the violation was severe enough to bypass the initial step of progressive discipline provided for in Article 23, ordering that the grievant serve a two-day suspension, rather than simply receive a reprimand.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 3239</span>, 65 FLRA 905, 907 (2011), summarized the most recent state of Article 23 of the SSA contract under FLRA decisions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">St. Paul</span>, which also involved Article 23, is misplaced because the Authority overturned that decision in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, 65 FLRA at 288-89. Finally, in <span class="Italic">Local 3342</span>, the Authority denied an essence exception to an arbitrator's finding that the agency had established that an employee's misconduct warranted bypassing progressive discipline steps. 58 FLRA at 450. However, as discussed above, the Arbitrator here found that the Agency had <span class="Italic">not </span>demonstrated that the grievant's misconduct warranted bypassing a written reprimand.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was plainly contrary to the specific language of the contract in <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 64 FLRA 1119, 1120-22 (2010) (Member DuBester dissenting), when the arbitrator did not apply a contract provision governing progressive discipline:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing an arbitrator's interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement, the Authority applies the deferential standard of review that federal courts use in reviewing arbitration awards in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Council 220</span>, 54 FLRA 156, 159 (1998). Under this standard, the Authority will find that an arbitration award is deficient as failing to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement when the appealing party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Labor </span>(<span class="Italic">OSHA</span>), 34 FLRA 573, 575 (1990). The Authority and the courts defer to arbitrators in this context "because it is the arbitrator's construction of the agreement for which the parties have bargained." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 576.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award fails to draw its essence from Article 23, Section 1 of the parties' agreement. The Agency claims that the two-day suspension was proper, even if relying on the counseling sessions was not, because the grievant already had been officially reprimanded for discourteous conduct a year earlier and the two-day suspension was within the "'common pattern' of progressive discipline" under Article 23.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree that the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. Article 23, Section 1, provides, in relevant part, that the "parties agree to concept of progressive discipline which is designed to correct and improve employee behavior. A common pattern of progressive discipline is reprimand, short term suspension, long term suspension and removal."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the grievant received a written reprimand for discourteous conduct less than a year before this incident.&#x2003;Further, the Arbitrator found that "[t]he Agency had just cause to discipline the [g]rievant" and that "[d]iscipline was warranted" for the grievant's conduct here. Under the terms of the parties' agreement, the next step of discipline was a short term suspension, such as the two-day suspension ordered here. The Agency, accordingly, followed the "common pattern of discipline" set forth in the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result, we find that the Arbitrator's interpretation of the agreement as precluding the Agency from imposing the two-day suspension is in manifest disregard of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin., St. Paul, Minn.</span>, 61 FLRA 92, 93-94 (2005) (holding that arbitrator's interpretation of the agreement as precluding Agency from imposing penalty that Agency had determined was appropriate evidenced manifest disregard of the parties' agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent suggests that our decision is inconsistent with Authority and Supreme Court precedent.&#x2003;We disagree. It is true that, under Supreme Court precedent, the deference given to arbitrators regarding their interpretation of a parties' collective bargaining agreement is broad. Contrary to the dissent's characterization of this precedent, however, this deference "is not the equivalent of a grant of limitless power." <span class="Italic">Leed Architectural Prods., Inc. v. United Steelworkers of Am., Local 6674, </span>916 F.2d 63, 65 (2d Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">see also Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Akron Newspaper Guild, Local Number 7</span>, 114 F.3d 596, 599 (6th Cir. 1997) (noting that, despite great amount of deference accorded an arbitrator's decision, court's "review is not toothless").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent asserts that, under Supreme Court precedent, the only question asked, in determining whether an arbitrator has properly interpreted a parties' agreement, is whether "the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying" the parties' agreement. Under the dissent's standard, as long as an arbitrator mentions a provision of the parties' agreement, his interpretation of that provision will be upheld, regardless of how absurd that interpretation might be. This standard appears to make a court's "power of review a nullity, so long as the arbitrator has the wit to point to some language in the contract as supposedly supporting his decision." <span class="Italic">Lattimer-Stevens v. United Steelworkers of Am., AFL-CIO</span>, 913 F.2d 1166, 1171-72 (6th Cir. 1990) (Boggs, J., dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Yet, applying Supreme Court precedent, many federal courts have determined that an arbitrator's interpretation failed to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022; <span class="Italic">Spero Elec. Corp. v. Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, AFL-CIO</span>, 439 F.3d 324 (6th Cir. 2006) (arbitrator's award failed to draw its essence from the parties' agreement where award permitted modification to the agreement in a manner that was inconsistent with the agreement's "method-of-modification" clause)</p>

The Paper, Allied-Indus., Chem. &#x0026; Energy Workers Int'l Union</span>, 385 F.3d 809, 820 (3d Cir. 2004) (arbitrator's <span id="page_1890"></span>award failed to draw it essence from parties' agreement where arbitrator determined company's zero tolerance drug abuse policy was unreasonable, despite provision of the parties' agreement permitting the company "to make and enforce rules for the maintenance of discipline and safety")</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022; <span class="Italic">United Mine Workers of Am. v. Marrowbone Dev. Co.</span>, 232 F.3d 383 (4th Cir. 2000) (arbitrator's award failed to draw its essence from the parties' agreement where arbitrator issued an award without holding an evidentiary hearing, despite an express provision of the agreement requiring a hearing in such circumstances)</p>

Mich. 2004) (arbitrator's award failed to draw its essence from the parties' agreement where arbitrator construed employer's decision to close plant under provisions of the agreement governing subcontracting, rather than the provisions governing management's rights)</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022; <span class="Italic">Lourdes Med. Ctr. of Burlington County v. JNESO</span>, 2007 WL 1040961 at *11 (D.N.J.) (arbitrator's award failed to draw its essence from the parties' agreement where arbitrator's determination that a small reduction in employees' work hours constituted a "layoff" was inconsistent with the parties' agreement, which defined layoff as "a permanent reduction in force and/or a reduction in force of unlimited duration")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As these cases illustrate, "[r]are though they may be, there will be instances when it is appropriate for a court to vacate the decision of an arbitrator." <span class="Italic">Matteson v. Ryder Sys., Inc.</span>, 99 F.3d 108, 114 (3d Cir. 1996). The same proposition holds true when the Authority reviews arbitral awards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Supreme Court has held repeatedly that, for an arbitrator's award to draw its essence from a parties' agreement, an arbitrator may not ignore the plain language of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc.</span>, 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987). When an arbitrator's award is clearly inconsistent with the terms of the parties' agreement, such as the arbitrator's award here, the award cannot be said to "draw its essence" from the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Haley VA Hospital and AFGE Local 547</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-132.html">71 FLRA 699</a> (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting), set aside an award that mitigated a five-day suspension to a letter of warning. The "essence" exception was successfully invoked because the contract permitted only two forms of discipline below a suspension: admonishment or reprimand. The award did not comport with the provision of the contract that defined actions the agency may take in disciplinary matters. When an arbitrator imposed conditions on a grant of leave for disabled veterans that were extraneous to a settlement agreement between the union and the agency, the award was set aside because it did not draw its essence from the settlement; the parties were free to agree to leave allowances more generous than those defined by Exec. Order 5396). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 906 and VA Member Services, Health Resource Center</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-151.html">72 FLRA 761</a> (2022) (Member Abbott dissenting). An award was set aside because the arbitrator followed another arbitration award between the parties rather than the language of the contract when the arbitrator decided that a certain type of offense could not be treated administratively through disciplinary action if it was susceptible to treatment through criminal charges before a federal magistrate. The other arbitration award was "not precedential," meaning that the contract rather than the arbitration award should have controlled the award. The case was interesting because FLRA essentially required the arbitrator to disregard the award of another arbitrator on a related matter. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Command, Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 48 FLRA 342, 348 (1993). <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 919</span>, 53 FLRA 29, 33 (1997), set aside an award that in turn set aside an agency selection decision. The arbitrator's award flatly misinterpreted a provision of the agency merit promotion plan--incorporated into the parties' contract--that reserved to the agency grievance process rather than to the contract grievance procedure a challenge to a selection for a management position. An arbitrator's award determining that a union was guilty of violating a contract provision concerning the administration of employees' hours of work was set aside because the contract article imposed no duty upon the union that the union could violate. The award failed to draw its essence from the contract language through any plausible or rational basis. <span class="Italic">See NAGE Local R3-32 and Dept. of Air Force, Air Reserve Station Willow Grove</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-025.html">61 FLRA 127</a>, 130-31 (2005); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">DODEA and FEA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-148.html">71 FLRA 765</a> (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting) (when the contract permitted a grievance within a set time after a triggering event, the grievance was premature, and a contrary award was vacated, that protested management's intent to take future action, i.e., an event that had not yet occurred: announcement of intent to change an appraisal program in alleged violation of the current contract's provision on appraisals) (recon. granted, exceptions denied, <span class="Italic">DODDEA and FEA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-76.html">73 FLRA 398</a> (2022) (Member Kiko dissenting)); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Supply Systems Command and NAIL Local 17</span>, 70 FLRA 817 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (setting aside an award, as failing to draw its essence from the contract, of what amounted to overtime that FLRA concluded was not authorized by the contract and that was contrary to an agency regulation); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Coleman and AFGE Local 506</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-198.html">71 FLRA 1013</a> (2020) (award vacated when grievance was either premature or too late, depending on construction of the operative events) (concurrences by Members DuBester and Abbott).</p>
