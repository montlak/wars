<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-112"><span class="space">6.</span> Employees' Names and Home Addresses</h4>
<p class="noindent">Unions seek home addresses of employees for distribution of information and organizing and membership drives. In 1994, the Supreme Court determined that agencies were precluded from releasing the home addresses of unit members in <span class="Italic">DOD v. FLRA</span>, 114 S. Ct. 1006 (1994). That decision brought to an end expenditure of thousands of hours of attorneys' time before FLRA and the courts arguing over disclosure of unit employees' names and addresses.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court intervened to resolve conflicting circuit court decisions. The Court decided that agencies were precluded from releasing home addresses of unit members in <span class="Italic">DOD v. FLRA</span>, 114 S. Ct. 1006 (1994), <span class="Italic">reversing FLRA v. DOD, Dept. of Navy, Navy CBC Exch.</span>, 975 F.2d 1105, 1116 (5th Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">enforcing</span> <span class="Italic">DOD, AAFES and AFGE Local 1345</span>, 37 FLRA 930 (1990), and <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, CBC Exch. and United Food Workers Local 1657</span>, 37 FLRA 652, 652-53 (1990). Although not addressing the matter of a routine use exception to the Privacy Act for names and addresses, the Supreme Court laid the principal controversy to rest, 114 S. Ct. at 1011-16:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e begin our analysis with the terms of the Labor Statute, which governs labor-management relations in the federal civil service. Consistent with the congressional finding that "labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest," 5 USC 7101(a), the Labor Statute requires an agency to accord exclusive recognition to a labor union that is elected by employees to serve as the representative of a bargaining unit. 7111(a). An exclusive representative must represent fairly all employees in the unit, regardless of whether they choose to become union members. 7114(a)(1). The Labor Statute also imposes a duty on the agency and the exclusive representative to negotiate in good faith for the purpose of arriving at a collective-bargaining agreement. 7114(a)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To fulfill its good-faith bargaining obligation, an agency must, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "furnish to the exclusive representative involved, or its authorized representative, upon request and, <span class="Italic">to the extent not prohibited by law</span>, data--(B) which is reasonably available and necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining." 7114(b)(4)(B) (emphasis added). The Authority has determined that the home addresses of bargaining unit employees constitute information that is "necessary" to the collective-bargaining process because through them, unions may communicate with employees more effectively than would otherwise be possible. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Portsmouth</span>, 37 FLRA, at 532 ("In the home environment, the employee has the leisure and the privacy to give the full and thoughtful attention to the union's message that the workplace generally does not permit"); <span class="Italic">Farmers Home Admin. Finance Office</span>, 23 FLRA 788, 796-797 (1986). This determination, which has been upheld by several Courts of Appeals, is not before us. Nor is there any dispute that the addresses are "reasonably available." Therefore, unless disclosure is "prohibited by law," agencies such as petitioners must release home addresses to exclusive representatives upon request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioners contend that the Privacy Act prohibits disclosure.&#x2003;This statute provides in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, unless disclosure of the record would be...(2) required under section 552 of this title [FOIA]." 5 USC 552a(b)(2) (1988 ed. and Supp. IV).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employee addresses sought by the unions are "records" covered by the broad terms of the Privacy Act. Therefore, unless FOIA would require release of the addresses, their disclosure is "prohibited by law," and the agencies may not reveal them to the unions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn, then, to FOIA. As we have recognized previously, FOIA reflects "a general philosophy of full agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force v. Rose</span>, 425 U.S. 352, 360-361, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 1599, 48 L. Ed.2d 11 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). <span class="Italic">See also EPA v. Mink</span>, 410 U.S. 73, 79-80, 93 S. Ct. 827, 832, 35 L. Ed.2d 119 (1973). Thus, while "disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of [FOIA]," there are a number of exemptions from the statute's broad reach. <span class="Italic">Rose, supra</span>, 425 U.S., at 361, 96 S. Ct., at 1599. The exemption potentially applicable to employee addresses is Exemption 6, which provides that FOIA's disclosure requirements do not apply to "personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." 5 USC 552(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, although this case requires us to follow a somewhat convoluted path of statutory cross-references, its proper resolution depends upon a discrete inquiry: whether disclosure of the home addresses "would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of [the] personal privacy" of bargaining unit employees within the meaning of FOIA. For guidance in answering this question, we need look no further than to our decision in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of Press</span>, 489 U.S. 749, 109 S. Ct. 1468, 103 L. Ed.2d 774 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span> involved FOIA requests addressed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation that sought the "rap sheets" of several individuals. In the process of deciding that the FBI was prohibited from disclosing the contents of the rap sheets, we reaffirmed several basic principles that have informed our interpretation of FOIA. First, in evaluating whether a request for information lies within the scope of a FOIA exemption, such as Exemption 6, that bars disclosure when it would amount to an invasion of privacy that is to some degree "unwarranted," "a court must balance the public interest in disclosure against the interest Congress intended the [e]xemption to protect." <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee, supra</span>, at 776, 109 S. Ct., at 1483. <span class="Italic">See also Rose, supra</span>, 425 U.S., at 372, 96 S. Ct., at 1604.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the only relevant "public interest in disclosure" to be weighed in this balance is the extent to which disclosure would serve the "core purpose of the FOIA," which is "contribut[ing] significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government." <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee, supra</span>, 489 U.S., at 775, 109 S. Ct., at 1482 (internal quotation marks omitted). We elaborated on this point at some length:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"[FOIA's] basic policy of 'full agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language,' indeed focuses on the citizens' right to be informed about what their government is up to. Official information that sheds light on an agency's performance of its statutory duties falls squarely within that statutory purpose. That purpose, however, is not fostered by disclosure of information about private citizens that is accumulated in various governmental files but that reveals little or nothing about an agency's own conduct." 489 U.S., at 773, 109 S. Ct., at 1482 (<span class="Italic">quoting Rose, supra</span>, 425 U.S., at 360-361, 96 S. Ct., at 1599) (other internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, "whether an invasion of privacy is warranted cannot turn on the purposes for which the request for information is made." <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span>, 489 U.S., at 771, 109 S. Ct., at 1480. Because "Congress 'clearly intended' the FOIA 'to give any member of the public as much right to disclosure as one with a special interest [in a particular document],'" <span class="Italic">ibid</span>. (<span class="Italic">quoting NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, 421 U.S. 132, 149, 95 S. Ct. 1504, 1516, 44 L. Ed.2d 29 (1975)), except in certain cases involving claims of privilege, "the identity of the requesting party has no bearing on the merits of his or her FOIA request." 489 U.S., at 771, 109 S. Ct., at 1481.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The principles that we followed in <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span> can be applied easily to this case. We must weigh the privacy interest of bargaining unit employees in nondisclosure of their addresses against the only relevant public interest in the FOIA balancing analysis--the extent to which disclosure of the information sought would "she[d] light on an agency's performance of its statutory duties" or otherwise let citizens know "what their government is up to." <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee, supra</span>, 489 U.S., at 773, 109 S. Ct., at 1482 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The relevant public interest supporting disclosure in this case is negligible, at best. Disclosure of the addresses might allow the unions to communicate more effectively with employees, but it would not appreciably further "the citizens' right to be informed about what their government is up to." 489 U.S., at 773, 109 S. Ct., at 1482 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, such disclosure would reveal little or nothing about the employing agencies or their activities....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Apparently realizing that this conclusion follows ineluctably from an application of the FOIA tenets we embraced in <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span>, respondents argue that <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span> is largely inapposite here because it dealt with an information request made directly under FOIA, whereas the unions' requests for home addresses initially were made under the Labor Statute, and implicated FOIA only incidentally through a chain of statutory cross-references. In such a circumstance, contend respondents, to give full effect to the three statutes involved and to allow unions to perform their statutory representational duties, we should import the policy considerations that are made explicit in the Labor <span id="Page_374"></span>Statute into the FOIA Exemption 6 balancing analysis. If we were to do so, respondents are confident we would conclude that the Labor Statute's policy favoring collective bargaining easily outweighs any privacy interest that employees might have in nondisclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We decline to accept respondents' ambitious invitation to rewrite the statutes before us and to disregard the FOIA principles reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span>. The Labor Statute does not...merely "borro[w] the FOIA's disclosure calculus for another purpose."...&#8197;Rather, it allows the disclosure of information necessary for effective collective bargaining only "to the extent not prohibited by law." 5 USC 7114(b)(4). Disclosure of the home addresses is prohibited by the Privacy Act unless an exception to that Act applies. The terms of the Labor Statute in no way suggest that the Privacy Act should be read in light of the purposes of the Labor Statute. If there is an exception, therefore, it must be found within the Privacy Act itself. Congress could have enacted an exception to the Privacy Act's coverage for information "necessary" for collective-bargaining purposes, but it did not do so. In the absence of such a provision, respondents rely on the exception for information the disclosure of which would be "required under [FOIA]." 552a(b)(2). Nowhere, however, does the Labor Statute amend FOIA's disclosure requirements or grant information requestors under the Labor Statute special status under FOIA. Therefore, because all FOIA requestors have an equal, and equally qualified, right to information, the fact that respondents are seeking to vindicate the policies behind the Labor Statute is irrelevant to the FOIA analysis....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Dept. of Treasury, Financial Management Serv.</span>, 884 F.2d 1446 (CADC 1989), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 493 U.S. 1055, 110 S. Ct. 863, 864, 107 L. Ed.2d 947, 948 (1990), then-Judge Ginsburg cogently explained why we must reject respondents' central argument:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Once placed wholly within the FOIA's domain, the union requesting information relevant to collective bargaining stands in no better position than members of the general public. True, unions have a special interest in identifying and communicating with persons in the bargaining unit, an interest initially accommodated by [the Labor Statute]. The bargaining process facilitation interest is ultimately unavailing, however, because it 'falls outside the ambit of the public interest that the FOIA was enacted to serve,' i.e., the interest in advancing 'public understanding of the operation or activities of the government.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 1457 (<span class="Italic">quoting Reporters Committee, supra</span>, at 775, 109 S. Ct., at 1482).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Against the virtually nonexistent FOIA-related public interest in disclosure, we weigh the interest of bargaining unit employees in nondisclosure of their home addresses....&#8197;Because a very slight privacy interest would suffice to outweigh the relevant public interest, we need not be exact in our quantification of the privacy interest. It is enough for present purposes to observe that the employees' interest in nondisclosure is not insubstantial.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is true that home addresses often are publicly available through sources such as telephone directories and voter registration lists, but...[a]n individual's interest in controlling the dissemination of information regarding personal matters does not dissolve simply because that information may be available to the public in some form. Here, for the most part, the unions seek to obtain the addresses of nonunion employees who have decided not to reveal their addresses to their exclusive representative....&#8197;Whatever the reason that these employees have chosen not to become members of the union or to provide the union with their addresses, however, it is clear that they have <span class="Italic">some</span> nontrivial privacy interest in nondisclosure, and in avoiding the influx of union-related mail, and, perhaps, union-related telephone calls or visits, that would follow disclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Many people simply do not want to be disturbed at home by work-related matters. Employees can lessen the chance of such unwanted contacts by not revealing their addresses to their exclusive representative. Even if the direct union/employee communication facilitated by the disclosure of home addresses were limited to mailings, this does not lessen the interest that individuals have in preventing at least some unsolicited, unwanted mail from reaching them at their homes. We are reluctant to disparage the privacy of the home, which is accorded special consideration in our Constitution, laws, and traditions....&#8197;Moreover, when we consider that other parties, such as commercial advertisers and solicitors, must have the same access under FOIA as the unions to the employee address lists sought in this case...it is clear that the individual privacy interest that would be protected by nondisclosure is far from insignificant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the privacy interest of bargaining unit employees in nondisclosure of their home addresses substantially outweighs the negligible FOIA-related public interest in disclosure, we conclude that disclosure would constitute a "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." 5 USC 552(b)(6). FOIA, thus, does not require the agencies to divulge the addresses, and the Privacy Act, therefore, prohibits their release to the unions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondents argue that our decision will have a number of untoward effects.&#x2003;First, they contend that without access to home addresses, public sector unions will be unable to communicate with and represent effectively all bargaining unit employees. Such a result, they believe, thwarts the collective-bargaining policies explicitly embodied in the Labor Statute....&#8197;According to respondents, it is illogical to believe that Congress intended the Privacy Act and FOIA to be interpreted in a manner that hinders the effectuation of the purposes motivating the Labor Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondents, however, place undue emphasis on what they perceive to be the impulses of the Congress that enacted the Labor Statute, and neglect to consider the language in that statute that calls into play the limitations of the Privacy Act. Speculation about the ultimate goals of the Labor Statute is inappropriate here; the statute plainly states that an agency need furnish an exclusive representative with information that is necessary for collective-bargaining purposes only "to the extent not prohibited by law." 5 USC 7114(b)(4)....&#8197;By disallowing disclosure, we do no more than give effect to the clear words of the provisions we construe, including the Labor Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, respondents contend that our decision creates an unnecessary and unintended disparity between public and private sector unions. While private sector unions assertedly are entitled to receive employee home address lists from employers under the National Labor Relations Act, as interpreted by the National Labor Relations Board, respondents claim that federal sector unions now will be needlessly barred from obtaining this information, despite the lack of any indication that Congress intended such a result....&#8197;We do not question that, as a general matter, private sector labor law may provide guidance in parallel public sector matters. This fact has little relevance here, however, for unlike private sector employees, federal employees enjoy the protection of the Privacy Act, and that statute prohibits the disclosure of the address lists sought in this case. To the extent that this prohibition leaves public sector unions in a position different from that of their private sector counterparts, Congress may correct the disparity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Employees' work email addresses may be provided to the union. In the FAQ section of its April 12, 2022, <span class="Italic">Guidance on Implementation of EO 14025: Highlighting Union Rights to Access and Communicate with Bargaining Unit Employees</span>, OPM advised:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">7)&#x2003;Can the union be provided a list of bargaining unit employees, bargaining unit employee email addresses, and their assigned organizations?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are examples of agencies reaching agreements with their unions to provide this type of information. In a random sample of collective bargaining agreements in OPM's Collective Bargaining Agreement database, we identified the following examples:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-&#x2003;"The employer agrees to provide the Union with a Bus Code Listing on a quarterly basis, to include name, position title, and email address, of all bargaining unit employees, in electronic format, for the purposes of communication with the membership."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-&#x2003;"List of Employees: Upon request, Management agrees to furnish to the Union, at the appropriate level:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;usually not more than quarterly, an up-to-date list of employees in the organizational unit showing name, position, title, grade, step, Bargaining Unit Status (BUS) code, Fair Labor Standards Act code, official duty station, and position type.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;usually not more than bi-annually, the list of employees and other information will be provided with the addition of bargaining unit employee Agency email addresses."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies are strongly encouraged to engage their unions with the objective of reaching an agreement on providing similar information on how to communicate with employees at their official duty station, such as through agency email.</p>
