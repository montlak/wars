<p class="noindent">As to settlements reached after a complaint issues, FLRA's regulations provide, 5 CFR 2423.25, 2423.31 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2423.25 <span class="Italic">Post complaint, prehearing settlements</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Informal and formal settlements</span>. Post complaint settlements may be either informal or formal.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Informal settlement agreements provide for withdrawal of the complaint by the Regional Director and are not subject to approval by or an order of the Authority. If the Respondent fails to perform its obligations under the informal settlement agreement, the Regional Director may reinstitute formal proceedings consistent with this subpart.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Formal settlement agreements are subject to approval by the Authority, and include the parties' agreement to waive their right to a hearing and acknowledgment that the Authority may issue an order requiring the Respondent to take action appropriate to the terms of the settlement. The formal settlement agreement shall also contain the Respondent's consent to the Authority's application for the entry of a decree by an appropriate federal court enforcing the Authority's order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Informal settlement procedure</span>. If the Charging Party and the Respondent enter into an informal settlement agreement that is accepted by the Regional Director, the Regional Director shall withdraw the complaint and approve the informal settlement agreement. If the Charging Party fails or refuses to become a party to an informal settlement agreement offered by the Respondent, and the Regional Director concludes that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the Regional Director shall enter into the agreement with the Respondent and shall withdraw the complaint. The Charging Party then may obtain a review of the Regional Director's action by filing an appeal with the General Counsel as provided in subpart A of this part.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Formal settlement procedure</span>. If the Charging Party and the Respondent enter into a formal settlement agreement that is accepted by the Regional Director, the Regional Director shall withdraw the complaint upon approval of the formal settlement agreement by the Authority. If the Charging Party fails or refuses to become a party to a formal settlement agreement offered by the Respondent, and the Regional Director concludes that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the agreement shall be between the Respondent and the Regional Director. The formal settlement agreement together with the Charging Party's objections, if any, shall be submitted to the Authority for approval. The Authority may approve a formal settlement agreement upon a sufficient showing that it will effectuate the policies of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Settlement judge program</span>. The Administrative Law Judge, in the Judge's discretion or upon the request of any party, may assign a judge or other appropriate official, who shall be other than the hearing judge unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties, to conduct negotiations for settlement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;The settlement official shall convene and preside over settlement conferences by telephone or in person.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The settlement official may require that the representative for each party be present at settlement conferences and that the parties or agents with full settlement authority be present or available by telephone.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;The settlement official shall not discuss any aspect of the case with the hearing judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;No evidence regarding statements, conduct, offers of settlement, and concessions of the parties made in proceedings before the settlement official shall be admissible in any proceeding before the Administrative Law Judge or Authority, except by stipulation of the parties.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Informal settlement procedure: Judge's approval of withdrawal</span>. <span id="page_1599"></span>If the Charging Party and the Respondent enter into an informal settlement agreement that is accepted by the Regional Director, the Regional Director may request the Administrative Law Judge for permission to withdraw the complaint and, having been granted such permission, shall withdraw the complaint and approve the informal settlement between the Charging Party and Respondent. If the Charging Party fails or refuses to become a party to an informal settlement agreement offered by the Respondent, and the Regional Director concludes that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the Regional Director shall enter into the agreement with the Respondent and shall, if granted permission by the Administrative Law Judge, withdraw the complaint. The Charging Party then may obtain a review of the Regional Director's decision as provided in subpart A of this part.</p>

If the Charging Party and the Respondent enter into a formal settlement agreement that is accepted by the Regional Director, the Regional Director may request the Administrative Law Judge to approve such formal settlement agreement, and upon such approval, to transmit the agreement to the Authority for approval. If the Charging Party fails or refuses to become a party to a formal settlement agreement offered by the Respondent, and the Regional Director concludes that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the agreement shall be between the Respondent and the Regional Director. After the Charging Party is given an opportunity to state on the record or in writing the reasons for opposing the formal settlement, the Regional Director may request the Administrative Law Judge to approve such formal settlement agreement, and upon such approval, to transmit the agreement to the Authority for approval.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Sheppard AFB and AFGE Local 779</span>, 67 FLRA 509, 509-10 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring), involved the situation of a settlement by the parties, postcomplaint, that the parties did not bring to the attention of FLRA until the ALJ issued a decision against management on the reprisal complaint. FLRA, bureaucratically startled by the parties' oversight, declined to set aside the ALJ decision, although the decision was characterized as nonprecedential:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC issued a complaint alleging that the Respondent violated the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) and committed a ULP by taking certain actions against the complaining witness. The Judge then held a hearing. Four months later, the Respondent and the complaining witness entered into a settlement agreement, which was also signed by the Union president. The settlement agreement provided that it resolved "any and all ULP[s] filed by the [U]nion...on behalf of and/or relating to the [complaining witness]." And the Union "agree[d]...to withdraw any and all ULP[s] filed...on behalf of and/or relating to the [complaining witness]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Later, the Judge issued her decision. The Judge concluded that the Respondent committed a ULP by making statements that tended to interfere with, restrain, or coerce the complaining witness in the exercise of her statutory right to act as a union representative and by discriminating against her for seeking to become a union representative. The decision did not reference the settlement agreement or otherwise indicate that the Judge knew of its existence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: Section 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations bars the Respondent's exception.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that, "in the interest of justice," we should vacate the Judge's decision "to ensure compliance with the" settlement agreement which, according to the Respondent, resolved the underlying ULP complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Authority "allow[s] the private settlement of [ULPs] at all stages of the [ULP] process, [it] will not automatically give effect to settlements reached by the parties and proposed to the Authority for approval."[4] Under &#x00A7; 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority will not consider any evidence, arguments, or issues "that could have been, but were not, presented in the proceedings before the...[a]dministrative [l]aw [j]udge."[5] Section 2423.21(b)(3) of the Authority's Regulations permits a judge to entertain post-hearing motions. Thus, if parties to a ULP proceeding enter into a post-hearing settlement agreement, one or both parties may file a motion with the judge to reopen the record in order to receive their settlement agreement into evidence.[6]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. SEC</span>, 62 FLRA 432, 441 (2008) (ALJ granted GC's motion to reopen hearing, but parties ultimately decided additional testimony unnecessary), <span class="Italic">enforced sub nom. SEC v. FLRA</span>, 568 F.3d 990 (D.C. Cir. 2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Respondent did not inform the Judge that it had entered into a settlement agreement with the Union. As noted above, the Respondent could have filed a motion with the Judge to reopen the hearing in order to consider the parties' settlement agreement. Because the Respondent could have presented this information to the Judge before her decision issued, but failed to do so, we hold that the Respondent may not now ask the Authority to vacate the Judge's decision based on the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent notes that, under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Union was obligated to "withdraw [the] ULP complaint." Be that as it may, the fact remains that neither party informed the Judge prior to the issuance of her decision of the settlement's existence nor sought to move the agreement into evidence, despite having sufficient time to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we dismiss the Respondent's exception. The Respondent has raised no other exceptions. Thus, we adopt, without precedential significance, the Judge's unexcepted-to finding that the Respondent violated the Statute by making statements that tended to interfere with, restrain, or coerce the complaining witness in the exercise of her statutory right to act as a Union representative and by discriminating against her for seeking to become a Union representative.</p>
<p class="noindent">Member Pizzella expressed a measure of displeasure in his concurring opinion, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 511-12:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the very idea that the parties (the U.S. Air Force and AFGE) independently reached a settlement in May 2011, and had been operating under it for almost two years, and then the federal government's Judge issued a separate decision is mind-boggling. It brings up the question that legendary baseball manager Casey Stengel asked during the New York Mets first season, when they lost 120 games: "Can't anybody play this game?" Just a little communication between the three parties via the U.S. Postal Service, email, Twitter, or even the Pony Express, would have prevented the FLRA from even considering this case and would have saved the American taxpayers probably several hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">USDA, FSIS and AFGE Nat'l Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals</span>, 49 FLRA 431, 433-38 (1994) (settlement may be reached after an ALJ has issues a recommended decision and FLRA is considering exceptions), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA considered the implications of violations of informal postcomplaint settlement agreements and concluded in <span class="Italic">FAA, Aviation Standards Nat'l Field Office, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Ctr. and NFFE Local 2097</span>, 43 FLRA 1221, 1231-32 (1992), that the violation did not, in itself, constitute an independent ULP:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Typically, if a respondent does not comply with a settlement agreement that was entered into after a complaint was issued, the Regional Director will reinstate the original complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration and Social Security Administration, Field Operations, New York Region</span>, 24 FLRA 94 (1986) (SSA); <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, United States Customs Service, Region IV, Miami, Florida</span>, 19 FLRA 421, 422 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>). The respondent may then bring the issue to the Authority of whether the settlement agreement was breached, and, if so, whether the respondent violated the Statute as alleged in the original complaint. <span class="Italic">See SSA; Customs Service</span> (Authority found that settlement agreements had not been violated and dismissed the reinstated complaints). There is no Authority precedent that finds the violation of a settlement agreement that has been approved by a Regional Director of the Authority to be an independent violation of the Statute. Such a settlement agreement must conform to the requirements established by the Regional Director, and, therefore, is not wholly a product of negotiations between the parties to the collective bargaining process. Consequently, noncompliance with such an agreement does not give rise to a violation of either section 7116(a)(5) or section 7116(b)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Great Lakes Program Service Center, Social Security Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, Chicago, Illinois</span>, 9 FLRA 499 (1982) (respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute by repudiating a memorandum of understanding negotiated between an authorized representative of the respondent and the charging party in settlement of an unfair labor practice charge). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923, AFL-CIO</span>, 20 FLRA 749 (1985) (union violated section 7116(b)(1) and (5) by repudiating a settlement agreement negotiated with the agency in settlement of a grievance).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our disposition of this allegation should in no way be viewed as condonation of a respondent's failure to comply with a settlement agreement to which it has voluntarily agreed. At the least, such conduct causes Authority regional office personnel to waste the considerable amounts of time required to negotiate and monitor settlement agreements. More significantly, repeated refusals to abide by settlement agreements could constitute an abuse of our processes. If the General Counsel believes that a respondent is unlikely to comply with a settlement agreement, the General Counsel may safeguard the Authority's processes by requiring that the parties enter into a formal settlement agreement <span id="page_1600"></span>that is enforceable in federal court. 5 CFR 2423.11(c). Of course, if the respondent engages in additional violative conduct when it repudiates any settlement agreement, that conduct can form the basis of an additional unfair labor practice allegation. We conclude here today only that the failure to comply with an informal settlement agreement entered into pursuant to section 2423.11 of our Rules and Regulations, without more, does not constitute an independent violation of the Statute.</p>
