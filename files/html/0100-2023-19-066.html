DOD</span>, 119 MSPR 566, 574-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-25, 2013 MSPB 46 (2013) (Member Robbins concurring) (overruling<span class="Italic"> Southerland v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SOUTHERLAND_ROBERT_SF_0752_09_0864_R_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER__649285.pdf">117 MSPR 56</a>, 2011 MSPB 92 (2011)), <span class="Italic">post</span>, concluded that a mixed-motive analysis may be applied to a disability case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">A mixed-motive analysis does apply to disability discrimination claims arising under the ADAAA.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board previously held that a mixed-motive theory cannot be applied to disability discrimination claims under the ADAAA, in light of the following: (1) the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, which held that a mixed-motive analysis did not apply to age discrimination claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; (2) the Seventh Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Serwatka</span>, which applied the Supreme Court's rationale in <span class="Italic">Gross</span> to Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) cases; and (3) the Board's prior decision in <span class="Italic">Brott</span>, in which it agreed with the Seventh Circuit's rationale in <span class="Italic">Serwatka</span> and held that a mixed-motive analysis did not apply in ADA cases. <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6; 29. The Board held that, in order to prove a claim of disability discrimination under the ADAAA, an appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that the agency took an action "on the basis" of his disability, i.e., that the agency would not have taken its action "but for" his actual or perceived disability; thus, the burden of persuasion did not shift to the agency to show that it would have taken the action regardless of disability, even if the appellant produced some evidence that disability was one motivating factor in the adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 29-38. At the time of the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, neither our reviewing court, nor the EEOC, had addressed the applicability of a mixed motive analysis to a disability discrimination claim under the ADAAA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since <span class="Italic">Southerland</span> was issued, the EEOC has applied a mixed-motive analysis in a case involving a claim of reprisal for protected activity (seeking an accommodation) under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Feder v. Holder,</span> Appeal No. 0720110014, 2012 EEOPUB LEXIS 2115, at *50-56 (Jul. 19, 2012). In <span class="Italic">Feder</span>, agency officials sent an electronic submission to the appellant's work unit alleging that Mr. Feder had engaged in unprofessional misconduct and seeking the unit's adjudication of the matter. The communication stated, in part, that Mr. Feder "has had his personal work space moved numerous times in order to avoid the peripheral noise created in the normal course of business." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *7. Mr. Feder had a health condition called hyperacusis, "which made him overly sensitive to certain sounds that caused him pain, distraction, and disruption." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *2. The EEOC found the communication constituted direct evidence of a retaliatory motive by those agency officials because it "prove[d] on its face that [these officials] informed the deciding official...about Complainant's protected activity and asked the deciding official to remove Complainant because of that protected activity." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *6-7, 39-40. Although the EEOC in <span class="Italic">Feder</span> did not mention <span class="Italic">Gross</span> or <span class="Italic">Serwatka</span>, it explicitly held that, in light of its finding that Mr. Feder's removal was motivated by reprisal for protected activity, "this matter should be reviewed under a mixed-motive analysis because the deciding official also provided a non-retaliatory reason for removing Complainant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *50.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board generally defers to the EEOC on issues of substantive discrimination law unless the EEOC's decision rests on civil service law for its support or is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. <span class="Italic">Alvara v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 627, &#x00B6; 8 (2011); <span class="Italic">see Morales v. Department of Justice,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 482, 484 (1998). The EEOC's decision in <span class="Italic">Feder</span> does not rest on civil service law for its support, nor is it so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the EEOC framed Mr. Feder's claim as one of reprisal for engaging in the protected activity of requesting a reasonable accommodation for his disability, not a claim based on his disability, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at *33-34, and the EEOC analyzed the mixed-motive issue in that context,<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at *50-56. In this matter, however, the applicability of a mixed-motive analysis arises in the context of the appellant's disability discrimination claim. These procedural differences do not require a separate analytical framework because the ADA and ADAAA contain a provision prohibiting retaliation for ADA or ADAAA-covered activity at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12203(a), and various circuit courts and the EEOC have concluded that a request for an accommodation constitutes such covered activity. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Cloe v. City of Indianapolis,</span> 712 F.3d 1171, 1180 (7th Cir. 2013) ("[i]n addition to requiring reasonable accommodations, the ADA [at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12203(a)] also protects employees from being retaliated against for asserting their ADA rights," including for requesting accommodation for disabilities); <span class="Italic">Valle-Arce v. Puerto Rico Ports Authority,</span> 651 F.3d 190, 198 (1st Cir. 2011) (explaining that requesting an accommodation and complaining of disability discrimination constitute activity that is protected for purposes of the ADA's anti-retaliation provision); <span class="Italic">see also Hudson v. Donohoe,</span> Appeal No. 0120093843, 2011 EEOPUB LEXIS 1658, at *19 (June 6, 2011) ("Although a person making [a reasonable accommodation] request might not literally 'oppose' discrimination or 'participate' in the administrative complaint process, he is protected against retaliation for making the request."). Because Mr. Feder's request for a reasonable accommodation, like complaining of disability discrimination, is activity that is protected by the ADA, the ADAAA, and the Rehabilitation Act, coupled with the Board's prior finding that there was no meaningful distinction between the text of the ADA and the ADAAA with respect to the applicability of a mixed-motive analysis, <span class="Italic">see Southerland,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 31-35, we find it appropriate to defer to the EEOC's analysis in <span class="Italic">Feder</span> in this regard. Therefore, we overrule the Board's prior finding in <span class="Italic">Southerland</span> that a mixed-motive analysis does not apply in disability discrimination cases arising under the ADAAA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Feder</span>, we further find that Mr. Allen's statements in the decision letter constituted direct evidence of a discriminatory motive. Notably, Mr. Allen "consider[ed] the impact of [the appellant's] inability to fulfill the full range of [his] duties on the efficiency of this organization." Mr. Allen also stated that the appellant occupied a full time position and that his "inability to fulfill the full range of [his] duties has a detrimental impact on the ability of this organization to efficiently accomplish its mission," and it "also causes an unnecessary burden on [his] co-workers who must accomplish [his] duties in addition to their own while [he is] on light duty." Because we find that Mr. Allen's statements in the decision letter constitute direct evidence of a discriminatory motive, this matter should be reviewed under a mixed-motive analysis because the agency also had a nondiscriminatory reason for suspending and removing the appellant, namely his misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Under a mixed-motive analysis, an appellant's remedy is limited if the agency demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action against him absent the discriminatory motive.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Rehabilitation Act, the remedies that are available to a federal employee who proves disability discrimination are defined by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794a.[6] Accordingly, under a mixed motive analysis, an employee is entitled to some relief if he proves that his disability was "a motivating factor" in the decision, "even though other factors also motivated the practice." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(m), 2000e 5(g)(1). An agency, however, may limit the extent of the remedy if it demonstrates that it "would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). If the agency meets this burden, an employee would not be entitled to reinstatement, hiring, promotion, back pay, or damages, but he may be awarded declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees and costs "demonstrated to be directly attributable only to the pursuit of a claim under [42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m)]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3443"></span>[6]&#x2003;The remedies that are available to employees that have proven disability discrimination under the ADA, ADAAA, or Rehabilitation Act are also available to individuals claiming retaliation for protected activity pursuant to the ADA or ADAAA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12203(c) (the ADAAA anti-retaliation statute states that the remedies at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12117, 12133, and 12188 are available for violations therein). Accordingly, we may rely on the EEOC's discussion of the proper burden of proof and available remedies in Feder to resolve those same issues in this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Feder</span>, the EEOC noted that the appellant's remedy would be so limited if the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent the discriminatory motive. <span class="Italic">Feder</span>, 2012 EEOPUB LEXIS 2115, at *50-51 (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(c) (explaining that an employee's remedies are limited upon a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the personnel action absent discrimination). This standard is different than the preponderant evidence standard that the Board previously applied in mixed-motive cases involving disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Caronia v. Department of Justice,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 201, 212 (1998), <span class="Italic">overruled in part by Carter v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because application of a clear and convincing standard does not rest on civil service law and is not so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law, we find it appropriate to defer to the EEOC's judgment on the issue of the applicability of the clear and convincing standard in mixed-motive cases. <span class="Italic">See Alvara,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 627, &#x00B6; 8.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's analysis of the appellant's disability discrimination claim is also problematic because he applied a mixed-motive analysis, and he cited, as support for his analysis, <span class="Italic">Caronia v.

In fact, in our recent opinion in <span class="Italic">Brott v. General Services Administration</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 410 (2011), we agreed with the Seventh Circuit's rationale in <span class="Italic">Serwatka</span> in holding that a mixed-motive analysis does not apply in ADA cases before the Board, and thus, we specifically overruled <span class="Italic">Caronia</span>. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 &#x0026; n*.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant events in this matter occurred after the effective date of the ADAAA, and we are faced with the question--not addressed in either <span class="Italic">Serwatka</span> or <span class="Italic">Brott</span>--whether a mixed-motive analysis is appropriate in cases arising under the ADAAA. For the following reasons, we conclude that a mixed-motive analysis is not appropriate in disability discrimination claims arising under the ADAAA.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We also see no basis for extending the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Caronia</span> to disability discrimination claims arising under the ADAAA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our first task is to determine, by using "traditional tools of statutory construction," if "Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, [and if so,] that intention is the law and must be given effect." <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc., v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 843 n.9 (1984); <span class="Italic">see Delverde SrL v. United States</span>, 202 F.3d 1360, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (explaining that the "traditional tools of statutory construction" include an examination of the statute's text, structure, and legislative history, as well as an application of the relevant canons of interpretation). Thus, we begin our analysis with an examination of the statutory language itself. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 10 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Delong v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 264 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553, 3557, Congress changed the anti-discrimination language in the ADA from "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual <span class="Italic">with a disability because of the disability of such individual</span>" in certain employment decisions to "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual <span class="Italic">on the basis of disability</span>" in certain employment decisions. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a) (2008) (emphasis supplied); 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a) (2009) (emphasis supplied). We did not find any other language in the ADAAA that directly addresses the applicability of a mixed-motive analysis, by either explicitly authorizing or prohibiting such an analysis. Thus, there is nothing in the plain language of the statute that resolves this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, we have considered the legislative history behind the ADAAA. Notably, the legislative record contains broad expressions of intent by both the House and the Senate to make the disability discrimination law consistent with the anti-discrimination language of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[8] However, apart from these general statements, we see no other indication in either the plain language or history of the ADAAA that Congress specifically intended to authorize a mixed-motive approach to disability discrimination claims. Indeed, we find the absence of any explicit reference to mixed-motive particularly relevant, given that Congress was aware of a mixed-motive analysis when it enacted the ADAAA, having revised Title VII in 1991 to codify the Supreme Court's holding regarding the applicability of a mixed-motive analysis to Title VII claims in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989).[9] <span class="Italic">See</span> Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, 1075, codified at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 154 Cong. Rec. S-8840-01, S-8843 (daily ed. Sept. 16, 2008) (Statement of the Managers to Accompany S. 3406, The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008) ("The bill amends Section 102 of the ADA to mirror the structure of nondiscrimination protection provision in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It changes the language from prohibiting discrimination against a qualified individual 'with a disability because of the disability of such individual' to prohibiting discrimination against a qualified individual 'on the basis of disability'"); H.R. Rep. No. 110-730, pt. 1 at 7 (2008) ("Aligning the construction of the [ADA] with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the bill amends the ADA to provide that no covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual 'on the basis of disability'").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Interestingly, the House Committee Report reflected that the Committee was not unaware of the impact of the proposed legislation on the status of current discrimination case law, as it specifically noted that, in response to questions that had been raised during the hearing, "[i]t is the intent of the Committee that the [framework of shifting burdens for plaintiffs and defendants under <span class="Italic">Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248 (1981)] remains intact and is not affected by the amendments...." H.R. Rep. 110-730, pt 1 at 17. The Committee Report further indicated that it did "not intend to alter the burden-shifting analyses in ADA employment cases involving qualification standards, tests, or other selection criteria, or contentions regarding reasonable accommodation. These analyses are intended to remain the same as articulated in existing case law." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, we have considered whether the phrase "on the basis of" in the ADAAA has a different meaning than "because of" in the ADA so as to suggest that in enacting the amendments, Congress intended to incorporate a mixed-motive approach to disability discrimination claims arising under the ADAAA. As a threshold matter, we note that the ADAAA does not define the term "on the basis of." Moreover, unlike in the ADEA,[10] for example, the phrases "because of" and "on the basis of" in the relevant provisions of the ADA and ADAAA appear to modify the same terms and serve the same functions within their respective provisions. Nor is there any evidence in the legislative history to indicate that Congress intended a different meaning to apply to the phrase "on the basis of" in the ADAAA than to "because of" in the ADA, at least with regard to the question of mixed-motive analysis.[11] After an exhaustive review of the language, structure, and history of the ADAAA, we conclude that the phrase "on the basis of" in that statute means the same thing as "because of" in the analogous ADA provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia recently discussed the difference in terminology between the private and federal sector statutory provisions governing age discrimination claims under the ADEA. <span class="Italic">See Ford v. Mabus</span>, 629 F.3d 198, 205-06 (D.C. Cir. 2010). The <span class="Italic">Ford</span> court acknowledged that the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Gross</span> found that the ordinary meaning of the phrase "'because of' age" in the private sector ADEA provision at 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(a) was that age was the reason for the action, and thus, a plaintiff must prove by preponderant evidence that age was the "but-for" cause of the adverse action; however, the <span class="Italic">Ford</span> court rejected the application of a "but-for" test for a plaintiff claiming age discrimination under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a), the federal sector ADEA provision. <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, 629 F.3d at 204-06 (citing <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, 129 S. Ct. 2350-51). Instead, the <span class="Italic">Ford</span> court concluded that a federal employee plaintiff may establish liability by showing that age was a factor in the agency's decision, explaining, among other things, that the phrase "because of" in section 623(a) and "based on" in section 633a(a) serve "very different functions" within their respective provisions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 205-07. We discern no such functional distinction between the phrase "because of," as used in the ADA, and "on the basis of," as used in the ADAAA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3444"></span>[11]&#x2003;In the Appendix to Part 1630, the EEOC explained, among other things, that "revisions have been made to the regulations and...Appendix to refer to 'individual with disability' and 'qualified individual' as separate terms, and to change the prohibition on discrimination to 'on the basis of disability' instead of prohibiting discrimination against a qualified individual 'with a disability because of the disability of such individual.' The EEOC also noted that the revisions to the regulations and Appendix 'ensure[&#8197;] that the emphasis in questions of disability discrimination is properly on the critical inquiry of whether a qualified person has been discriminated against on the basis of disability, and not unduly focused on the preliminary question of whether a particular person is a 'person with a disability.'" Appendix to Part 1630, 76 Fed. Reg. at 17,005. Although the EEOC's discussion is consistent with the legislative history, it provides no guidance regarding the applicability of a mixed-motive analysis under the ADAAA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we note that the Supreme Court has repeatedly expressed the view that, at least in other statutory contexts, the terms "because of" and "on the basis of" have the same meaning. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr</span>, 551 U.S. 47, 63-64 &#x0026; n.14 (2007), the Court stated that, "[i]n common talk, the phrase 'based on' indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a necessary logical condition" and there was no indication that the change from "because of" to "based on" in the relevant statute was intended to be a substantive change. In <span class="Italic">Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 64 (1986), the Court noted that, "[w]ithout question, when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate's sex, that supervisor 'discriminate[s] ' on the basis of sex."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Serwatka</span>, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reasoned that the "importance that the [<span class="Italic">Gross</span>] court attached to the express incorporation of the mixed-motive framework into Title VII suggests that when another anti-discrimination statute lacks comparable language, a mixed-motive claim will not be viable under that statute." <span class="Italic">Serwatka</span>, 591 F.3d at 961. The <span class="Italic">Serwatka</span> court found that the ADA did not contain any provision that was "akin" to Title VII's mixed-motive provision, and it further noted that, in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12117(a), the ADA cross-referenced the remedies set forth in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) for mixed-motive cases under Title VII, but it did not cross-reference the provision of Title VII which held employers liable for mixed-motive employment decisions, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m). <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 962. The <span class="Italic">Serwatka</span> court concluded that, in the absence of any text bringing mixed-motive claims within the reach of the ADA, or any cross-reference to Title VII's mixed-motive liability language, the ADA's "because of" language required a plaintiff to show that his or her employer would not have fired him "but for" his actual or perceived disability and found that a mixed-motive analysis would not apply. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 962.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the <span class="Italic">Serwatka</span> court's reasoning persuasive, even as applied to disability discrimination claims arising under the ADAAA. Specifically, the ADAAA did not change the language in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12117(a), and there is no stand-alone provision that would otherwise make the Title VII mixed-motive analysis applicable to cases under the ADAAA. Nor is there any provision that cross-references the Title VII mixed-motive provision at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m). For these reasons, we find that in enacting the ADAAA, Congress did not intend to authorize a mixed-motive analysis to disability discrimination claims arising thereunder and the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that the agency took an action "on the basis" of his disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language, structure, and legislative history of the ADAAA lead us to conclude that the phrase "on the basis of" in the ADAAA means the same thing as "because of" in the ADA and, therefore, requires application of the same "but for" test discussed in <span class="Italic">Gross</span> and <span class="Italic">Serwatka</span> to disability discrimination claims arising under the ADAAA. The burden of persuasion does not shift to the agency to show that it would have taken the action regardless of disability, even if the appellant produces some evidence on remand that disability was one motivating factor in the adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, 129 S. Ct. at 2352; <span class="Italic">Brott</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 410, &#x00B6; 14. Thus, on remand, the administrative judge shall analyze the appellant's disability discrimination claim without relying on a mixed-motive framework. <span class="Italic">See Brott</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 410, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The mixed-motive analysis was summarized and applied by <span class="Italic">Pace v. Dept. of Army,</span> CH-0432-14-0335-I-1 (NP 6/11/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the appellant failed to establish his affirmative defense of disparate treatment based upon disability. The administrative judge, in applying the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973), found that the appellant had not established disparate treatment based upon disability because she found that he was not treated less favorably, and in fact was even provided more leniency, than other employees. However, in <span class="Italic">Southerland v. Department of Defense,</span> 119 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-22 &#x0026; n.4 (2013), the Board found that a mixed-motive analysis applies to claims of disparate treatment based on disability. Under a mixed-motive analysis, an employee is entitled to some relief if he proves that his disability was "a motivating factor" in the decision, "even though other factors also motivated the practice." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 23 (citing 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(m), 2000e-5(g)(1)). An agency may limit the extent of the remedy if it demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it "would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-25 (citing 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)). Because the record is fully developed on the appellant's affirmative defense, the Board can apply the mixed-motive analysis without remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Discrimination may be established by direct or circumstantial evidence. Direct evidence may be any statement made by an employer that (1) reflects directly the alleged discriminatory attitude, and (2) bears directly on the contested employment decision. <span class="Italic">Arredondo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 113, &#x00B6; 13 (2000). In addition to direct evidence of discrimination, the Board also may consider circumstantial evidence in determining whether an appellant has met his burden. <span class="Italic">Crump v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 12 (2010). Such evidence may include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;evidence of suspicious timing, ambiguous oral or written statements, behavior toward or comments directed at other employees in the protected group, and other bits and pieces from which an inference of retaliatory intent might be drawn; (2) evidence that employees similarly situated to the appellant have been better treated; and (3) evidence that the employer's stated reason for its actions is pretextual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Troupe v. May Department Stores Company,</span> 20 F.3d 734 (7th Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant stated that the proposing official and another agency employee made harassing comments towards him. The appellant cited a statement of a coworker that an agency employee (Ms. S.) would degrade the appellant to a greater degree than she did other employees and would make derogatory comments. He did not, however, elaborate as to what comments were made. Because the appellant has not established that the comments allegedly made by Ms. S bear directly on his removal, those comments do not constitute direct evidence of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Arredondo</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 113, &#x00B6; 13. As to the proposing official, the appellant indicated that he was responsive when he heard rumors that another co-worker bullied the appellant; the proposing official listened to the appellant's complaint concerning the situation and stated that he would talk to the employee. We therefore find that the appellant's bare allegations that the proposing official and coworkers were discriminating against him do not constitute direct evidence of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 32 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also have considered circumstantial evidence in deciding whether the appellant's disability was a motivating factor in his removal. The appellant generally objected to the lack of feedback he received from the proposing official, stated that the proposing official failed to accommodate his disability, and disagreed with the proposing official's criticism of his work. However, the appellant admitted in his testimony that the proposing official treated everyone in the office the same way. We find that the appellant has not shown that others were treated more favorably than him. We also have considered the evidence concerning Ms. S.'s alleged comments. Nonetheless, we find, upon considering all of the evidence, that the appellant has not shown that his disability was a motivating factor in his removal. Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to establish his affirmative defense of disparate treatment.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Separate from its prohibition on disparate treatment disability discrimination, the ADA has an anti-retaliation provision, which prohibits discriminating against any individual "because such individual" has engaged in protected activity. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12203(a); <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 21. Both requesting a reasonable accommodation and opposing disability discrimination are activities protected by the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar</span>, 570 U.S. 338, 351-53 (2013), the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted similar language from Title VII's anti-retaliation provision applicable to private sector claims. The Court determined that the requirement to prove the employer's actions occurred "because" of the employee's protected activity imposed a "but-for" causation standard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (interpreting 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a)). The Court rejected using a mixed-motive analysis, explaining that "but-for" causation "requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer."[13] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 360-62.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Nassar</span>, the U.S. Supreme Court distinguished between the anti-retaliation provisions of Title VII, which it determined required "but-for" causation, and the disparate treatment discrimination provisions of Title VII, for which it found motivating factor causation to be appropriate. 570 U.S. at 343, 360. We follow the Court's findings on these issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3445"></span>We find <span class="Italic">Nassar</span> provides useful guidance in interpreting the provision at issue here. The language in the ADA's anti-retaliation provision is virtually identical to the language analyzed by the Court in <span class="Italic">Nassar</span>, including the prohibition on discrimination "because" of protected activity. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12203(a); <span class="Italic">see Nassar</span>, 570 U.S. at 353-54, 357 (observing that Congress's decision to enact an anti-retaliation subsection in Title VII separate from the subsection prohibiting disparate treatment discrimination required that courts apply the standard of causation for retaliation claims stated in the anti-retaliation provision, and observing that the ADA has a similar structure). Thus, like Federal circuit courts which have considered this issue, we find that the "but-for" standard is applicable to ADA retaliation claims. <span class="Italic">See T.B. ex rel. Brenneise v. San Diego Unified School District</span>, 806 F.3d 451, 473 (9th Cir. 2015) (finding, in light of <span class="Italic">Nassar</span>, that the "but-for" causation standard applies to ADA retaliation claims); <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Ford Motor Company</span>, 782 F.3d 753, 767 (6th Cir. 2015) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Nassar</span> for the requirement that a plaintiff claiming under the ADA retaliation for filing a disability discrimination claim must prove that her protected activity was the "but-for" cause of the adverse employment action); <span class="Italic">Feist v. State of Louisiana, Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General</span>, 730 F.3d 450, 454 (5th Cir. 2013) (explaining that to avoid summary judgment in a retaliation case under the ADA, a plaintiff must raise a factual conflict regarding whether retaliation was the "but-for" cause of the employer's action); <span class="Italic">Palmquist v. Shinseki</span>, 689 F.3d 66, 68, 72-77 (1st Cir. 2012) (concluding that a claim of retaliation for activity protected under the Rehabilitation Act requires proof of "but-for" causation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we overrule the Board's finding in <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, which was issued days before the U.S. Supreme Court issued Nassar, that a lesser standard is appropriate for Rehabilitation Act retaliation claims. <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-22 (finding that a mixed-motive analysis applies to claims of disparate treatment discrimination under the ADA by relying on an EEOC case applying the mixed-motive standard to an ADA retaliation claim). We also overrule the finding that an agency can avoid liability by proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent an improper motive, <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-25, as such a construct would be applicable only for a motivating factor analysis. If prior EEO activity is a "but-for" cause of retaliation, by definition, there is no other proper reason for that action. In making its findings in <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, the Board relied on the EEOC's interpretation of substantive discrimination law. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21, 24-25. However, in light of Nassar, we find that the Supreme Court has effectively overruled the EEOC's interpretation.</p>
