<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-240"><span class="space">7.</span> Failure to Secure Ratification of Agreement</h4>
<p class="noindent">Ratification of a tentative agreement by the union membership may be a precondition to a binding agreement. If ground rules specifically provide for ratification before a substantive agreement becomes effective, it cannot be said that there is any waiver of the right to reopen negotiations should ratification prove unsuccessful. The parties may limit themselves in ground rules to bar negotiation of new matters after a certain period passes during the negotiation process. It appears that ground rules not subject to ratification may limit the scope of negotiation after a ratification vote has rejected substantive provisions. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census and AFGE Local 2782</span>, 17 FLRA 667, 670-71 (1985), explained in the context of the negotiations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint essentially alleges that the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census (the Respondent) violated sections 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) by refusing to reopen contract negotiations after the membership of the Charging Party, American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2782, AFL-CIO (the Union), refused to ratify the tentative agreement reached by the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union is the exclusive representative of two bargaining units of employees of the Respondent who are located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The parties' collective bargaining agreement, which was ratified by the Union's membership and effectuated on June 23, 1977, was in effect at all times material herein. Article 6 of that agreement pertaining to the parties' negotiated ground rules, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">ARTICLE 6--FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.2 Proposals. The initiating party shall submit its proposals, in writing, at least 40 days prior to the scheduled commencement of negotiations. Following receipt of such proposals, the other party shall have no more than 20 days in which to submit, also in writing, any counterproposals or new matter. No new matter will be admitted for negotiation from either party following the first 12 hours of negotiations; either party may at any time submit counterproposals to or modifications of proposals previously admitted....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.3 Signifying Agreement. When agreement is reached upon any proposal, or any part of a proposal, the two chief negotiators shall signify such agreement, either through their initials or through some other device, on the face of the proposal. Such signification shall not, however, preclude the parties from mutually agreeing to reconsider or revise previously approved proposals at any time prior to the formal termination of negotiations....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.7 Effective Date. Any substantive agreement reached shall become effective between the parties on the date of signing, following <span id="page_1506"></span>ratification by the membership and approval by the National President of the Union, and approval by the Director.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On or about June 11, 1980, the Respondent and the Union commenced negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement which after numerous sessions was completed on September 1, 1982. Thereafter, the Respondent and the Union initialed off on a final package of proposals to constitute their tentative collective bargaining agreement. The Respondent was informed by the Union at that time that the tentative agreement would be placed before its membership for a ratification vote. On or about September 23, the Union's membership, after having reviewed the subject agreement, voted against ratification. On or about September 24, the Union notified the Respondent of the outcome of the ratification vote and requested the resumption of negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On or about October 21, the Respondent wrote to the Union noting, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that in light of the vote not to ratify the tentative agreement, it was incumbent on the Union to submit proposals in advance of further negotiations; the Respondent also in such letter, and again on or about November 4, requested the Union to clarify the bargaining authority of its negotiators. The Union submitted 26 proposals on December 29, certain of which concerned matters not previously proposed during the period between June 1980 and December 29, 1982, and whose omission from the tentative contract had been noted by the Union's membership as a reason for its rejection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By letter dated January 19, 1983, the Respondent, noting the Union's proposals, informed the latter that it would, pursuant to Article 6.3 of the ground rules, reconsider only those six provisions which the parties had previously negotiated and embodied in their tentative agreement. Thereafter, on February 1, 1983, the Union filed the unfair labor practice charge herein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons discussed below, the Authority concludes that the Respondent's admitted refusal to reopen negotiations, pursuant to the Union's request, except for the six items listed in its memorandum of January 19, 1983, constitutes a violation of sections 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sections 7114(a)(4) and (b)(2) of the Statute provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Section 7114. Representation rights and duties</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)(4) Any agency and any exclusive representative in any appropriate unit in the agency, through appropriate representatives, shall meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;The duty of an agency and an exclusive representative to negotiate in good faith under subsection (a) of this section shall include the obligation--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;to...discuss and negotiate on any condition of employment[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is apparent from the specific language of the aforementioned provisions of the Statute that an agency and the exclusive representative of its unit employees have an obligation to negotiate in good faith with respect to any condition of employment affecting unit employees in an effort to arrive at a collective bargaining agreement.&#x2003;The exclusive representative may, however, waive its statutory right to negotiate on such matters by clear and unmistakable conduct. <span class="Italic">Library of Congress,</span> 9 FLRA 427 (1982);<span class="Italic"> Department of the Air Force, U.S. Air Force Academy,</span> 6 FLRA 548 (1981);<span class="Italic"> Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois,</span> 5 FLRA 9 (1981). Further, with respect to the bargaining process, the Authority has found that ratification of a tentative agreement by a union's membership may be a precondition to a binding agreement. <span class="Italic">Department of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia,</span> 13 FLRA 571 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that by virtue of Article 6.3 of the parties' ground rules, which precludes the reconsideration or revision of proposals previously approved by the parties absent mutual agreement, the Union waived its right to reopen contract negotiations in the wake of the ratification vote. The Authority disagrees. In so concluding, the Authority finds that the Union did not clearly and unmistakably waive its right to reopen contract negotiations. In this regard, Article 6.7 of the parties' ground rules on its face specifically provides for "ratification by the membership" prior to any substantive agreement becoming effective. Also, the stipulated record reveals that the parties' existing collective bargaining agreement had been ratified by the Union's membership prior to its effectuation, and that on the date the parties initialed off on their final package of proposals herein, the Union informed the Respondent that such proposals would be placed before its membership for a ratification vote. Therefore, under these circumstances, the Authority finds that ratification by the Union's membership was a precondition to a binding agreement, and that neither the language of Article 6 of the parties' ground rules nor the record evidence establishes that the Union clearly and unmistakably waived its right to reopen contract negotiations following a failure to ratify the tentative agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the same time, the Respondent's obligation to bargain is not without limits under the facts presented. Irrespective of ratification procedures, Article 6.2 clearly limits the rights of the parties to raise new matters after the first twelve hours of negotiations. Pursuant to that contractual provision, the Respondent is not obligated to negotiate on proposals which are entirely new or which are not "counterproposals to or modifications of proposals previously admitted...." Examples of new matters raised by the Union in its proposals submitted after the ratification vote include a Mini-Arbitration procedure and the contemplated establishment of a Day Care Center rather than a Task Force to study the feasibility of such a center.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the record reveals that the Respondent refused to negotiate over certain Union proposals dated December 29, 1982, which were not entirely new matter, the Authority finds that the Respondent violated sections 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute when it refused to reopen contract negotiations on such proposals after the Union's membership refused to ratify the tentative agreement reached by the parties. <span class="Italic">See Norfolk Naval Shipyard,</span> 9 FLRA 36 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Tidewater Virginia Federal Employees Metal Trades Council v. FLRA. </span>No. 82-1876 (D.C. Cir. May 4, 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, in view of the foregoing, the Authority concludes that the Respondent violated sections 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute by refusing to reopen contract negotiations after the Union's membership refused to ratify the tentative agreement reached by the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agency head review of an agreement does not occur until after ratification makes the agreement effective. The union's right to ratification as a condition to agreement need not be expressed in ground rules, it need simply be reserved and that reservation must be communicated to the employer. If the agreement does not survive ratification, the employer commits a ULP by then refusing to reopen negotiations. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Council 220</span>, 46 FLRA 1404, 1405-06 (1993), stated at n.4:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's argument that the Union's failure to ratify the MOU was of no effect because it occurred subsequent to the Respondent's review and approval of the MOU under section 7114(c) of the Statute is misplaced. As the Union properly had conditioned execution of the MOU on ratification, the section 7114 review, which is triggered by execution of an agreement, was not effective. <span class="Italic">See Patent Office Professional Association and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 41 FLRA 795, 803 (1991) ("the date of execution that triggers the time limits for...review under section 7114(c)(2) relates to the date on which no further action is necessary to finalize a complete agreement[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent">The ALJ decision accompanying <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Council 220, supra</span>, at 1412-16 (adopted by FLRA as to legal analysis), said of the ratification process:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent argues, in essence that section 7114(c) of the Statute requires that a relevant collective bargaining agreement becomes effective and binding on both the agency and exclusive representative upon approval of the agency head, or in the absence of either approval or disapproval within the 30-day period of agency head review, in the 31st day. <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1263 and Defense Language Institute,</span> 14 FLRA 761 (1984). Respondent points out that in <span class="Italic">Federal Employees Metal Trades Council of and U.S. Department of the Navy,</span> <span class="Italic">Charleston Shipyard, Charleston, South Carolina,</span> 35 FLRA 1091 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Charleston</span>) the Authority found a negotiability proposal which allowed ratification after the agency head review was found inconsistent with section 7114(c) as the agreement was already binding of the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent also contrasts Federal sector ratification with that of the private sector.&#x2003;In this regard, Respondent asserts that recurring impact and implementation bargaining does not occur in the private sector causing "unending possibilities for disagreement and conflict" which do not apply in the private sector because there the only formal bargaining is for the term agreement. This of course depends on what one considers "formal" bargaining for there is no doubt that same type bargaining occurs on a daily basis in the private sector as well. Respondent however, would differentiate between term bargaining and impact and implementation bargaining in asserting that formal impact and implementation bargaining does not comply with Congress's directive to conduct labor relations in a manner consistent with the requirements of effective and efficient government. Furthermore, Respondent urges that section 7114(b)(2) of the Statute requires that parties provide representatives who are empowered to negotiate and enter into agreements and that membership ratification may not be used to reject an agreement reached by duly authorized union negotiators. Finally, Respondent urges that the Authority should not permit an agent to conduct negotiations with the express, as well as implied, understanding that they have authority to negotiate an agreement without it having to be accepted by the union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to Respondent's position that absent bilateral agreement, there <span id="page_1507"></span>can be no union ratification of labor agreements, the General Counsel contends that, even in the absence of a bilateral agreement, a union may seek ratification of a labor agreement pursuant to its constitution so long as (1) the employer has notice of the ratification requirement and (2) there is no waiver of the right by the union. In <span class="Italic">Hiney Printing Co.,</span> 262 NLRB 157, 164 (1982), the administrative law judge stated with regard to "notice":</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A union is entitled to condition the execution of an agreement arrived at during collective bargaining upon ratification by its membership, <span class="Italic">Houchens Market v. N.L.R.B.,</span> 375 F.2d 208 (6th Cir. 1967), but such a condition precedent must be known to employer's representatives during the bargaining sessions. Indeed, ratification votes as a prerequisite to final and binding agreements are a commonplace feature of labor relations and have been a regular feature of the relations between Hiney and Respondent Union as long as they have maintained a collective-bargaining relationship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, in <span class="Italic">Houchens Market, supra</span> at 212, the Court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Company, by insisting after all the other terms of the contract were agreed upon, that the contract be approved or ratified by a majority of the employees, was attempting to bargain, not with respect to "wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment," but with respect to a matter which was exclusively within the internal domain of the Union. Members of a Union have the right to determine the extent of authority delegated to their bargaining unit. It is within their province to determine whether or not their bargaining unit may enter into a binding contract with or without membership ratification. It is not an issue which the company can insist upon without mutual agreement by the Union, any more than the Union can insist that the contract be submitted to the Board of Directors or stockholders of the Company. The Union, by virtue of its certification as exclusive bargaining agent, was empowered by its members to make agreements on behalf of the employees it represented without securing the approval of those employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">North Country Motors, Ltd.,</span> 146 NLRB 671 (1964), the NLRB, found that the Employer had to accept the ratification procedure despite no preconditioned agreement to that effect. <span class="Italic">See also International Union of Elevator Constructors, Local No. 8, AFL-CIO and National Elevator Industry,</span> 185 NLRB 769, 773 (1970); <span class="Italic">enf'd, NLRB v. International Union of Elevator Constructors, Local No. 8, AFL-CIO</span>, 465 F.2d 974 (1982), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Houchens Market, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As already noted, the Authority, on several occasions, has recognized a union's right to ratification of a labor agreement. In <span class="Italic">Charleston,</span> the Authority made it clear that its "...disposition of this proposal does not preclude the Union from subjecting an agreement to ratification by the Union's membership."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Griffiss Air Force Base Rome, New York,</span> 25 FLRA 579 (1987), the Authority adopted the administrative law judge decision concerning ratification, where it stated, at 592 that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Authority has recognized that the ratification of a tentative contract by an exclusive representative's membership may be a precondition to a final and binding agreement between the parties to a bargaining relationship. [Citations omitted] Where the membership rejects a tentative contract, an agency is obligated to resume negotiations absent a showing that the exclusive representative clearly and unmistakably waived its right to reopen contract negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See also U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census,</span> 17 FLRA 667 (1985) and <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia,</span> 13 FLRA 571, 573 (1984), where Chief Judge Fenton noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">While there is much dispute on the question whether the parties intended that ratification would be a requirement of a full and binding agreement, there is no evidence whatever that Union negotiators ever explicitly yielded on this point. Given the past practice and the language of the ground rules, I find that ratification was essential to a binding agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The foregoing findings cast doubt on Respondent's argument that no statutory right exists for a union to ratify a labor agreement, absent the existence of a bilateral agreement. In essence, Respondent argues that it must accept or agree when the union insists on ratification before final agreement. I find no case law support for this position and Respondent cites me to none. Furthering the right of employees to ratify labor agreements implicitly and logically flows from section 7102 of the Statute where employees have the right "to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees under this chapter."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notice to an employer is obviously an essential element in establishing that a union properly exercise its ratification procedures and is thus entitled to reopen negotiations upon rejection of the labor agreement.&#x2003;On the other hand, whether a union must provide representatives empowered to negotiate and enter agreements is not an issue since it is within a union's province to determine whether its delegated representatives need seek ratification. <span class="Italic">Houchens Market, supra</span>. In this case, AFGE advised Respondent, in writing in 1985, that it retained the right to ratify agreements at the Council level. Indeed, then Branch Chief Whitlock acknowledges receiving and reading a January 15, 1985 letter from President Skwierczynski regarding union ratification. Even SSA Chief Negotiator Paul Arca conceded that he was aware of the letter. Finally, not only did Whitlock acknowledge that he received the letter, but he also testified that he was aware of the AFGE constitution provision providing for union ratification. Although ratification was not mentioned during negotiations, SSA had sufficient notice that it could be a requirement for a binding agreement here. Accordingly, it is found that Respondent had notice and that it was not necessary that it agree that matters negotiated by delegated representatives of the union were not binding until submitted to union ratification procedures.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Absent a clear and unequivocal waiver, Respondent's obligation under the Statute remains, as it has always been, to return to the bargaining table with a sincere resolve to reach agreement with the Union....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent's argument that it needed an explanation from the Union as to what articles needed to be discussed before it could resume negotiations pursuant to the Union's request is without merit. The Union notified Respondent that the membership had failed to ratify the contract, and that it was "willing to meet and discuss this in order to complete our contract negotiations." In reply, the Union was requested, among other things, to send another letter updating which articles the membership did not like. The Statute provides for <span class="Italic">meetings</span> to take place between the parties as part of the collective bargaining process....&#8197;There is no requirement in the Statute that all proposals must be in writing....&#8197;The only restriction upon the scope of negotiations imposed by the ground rules...was that bargaining was not required on any subject not included in the parties' original proposals. It is also noted that Respondent never agreed to resume negotiations <span class="Italic">per se</span> and instructed the Union to leave out the word "negotiate" or the letter would not be answered. Good faith bargaining can scarcely be conducted within the framework of a stated position which asserts in effect that the employer is not obliged to bargain....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming that the Union's ratification process is subject to a good faith standard, as urged by Respondent [3], Respondent has not shown that the Union acted in bad faith in conducting the ratification proceedings. The Union negotiators discussed the contract at the Union meetings and stated it was a good contract. The abstentions from voting of the negotiators and the Union president under the circumstances do not demonstrate that they "torpedoed the agreement they made"...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Respondent subpoenaed documents concerning the Union meetings held for the purpose of ratification as well as internal Union documents concerning the ratification procedure. The Charging Party's motion to revoke was denied. Respondent offered the minutes of the Union meetings and the Union's constitution and bylaws into evidence, and they were received. Respondent was also permitted to question witnesses, over the General Counsel's objection, concerning what transpired at the crucial Union meetings. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">NLRB v.
