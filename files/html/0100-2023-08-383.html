<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-375"><span class="space">12.</span> Remedial Structure; Reconstruction of Selection Process; Removal of Selectee</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Remedial issues arise during reconstruction of a selection process. The Board lacks jurisdiction to enforce resolutions directed by DOL. <span class="Italic">See Finch v. USPS</span>, AT-3330-13-0870-I-1 (NP 8/6/2014) ("In any event, although DOL's resolution of a veterans' preference complaint does not divest the Board of jurisdiction over an appellant's VEOA appeal, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 20, the appellant has cited no authority for the proposition that the Board has the authority to enforce the alleged terms upon which a VEOA complaint has been resolved or to reopen such a complaint and remand it to DOL for further investigation. Rather, the question of an appellant's entitlement to such relief is properly addressed through enforcement proceedings once the Board has ordered corrective action under VEOA. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 567, &#x00B6; 11 (2008) (finding that if, after the agency reconstructs the hiring process as ordered by the Board, the appellant is placed at a grade level with which he disagrees, he may raise the matter in a petition for enforcement).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Turning to Board enforcement procedures, <span class="Italic">Russell v. DHHS</span>, 120 MSPR 42, 49-50 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14, 2013 MSPB 57 (2013) (Member Robbins dissenting), discussing the reconstruction process, stated that the agency should take the original selectee out of the position, conduct and evaluate interviews so that they are meaningfully comparable with the original selectee's interview, and fill the same number of vacancies as before:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to properly reconstruct a selection, an agency must conduct an actual selection process based on the same circumstances surrounding the original faulty selection. <span class="Italic">Washburn v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 14 (2013). This includes taking the original selectee out of the position, conducting and evaluating interviews so that they are meaningfully comparable with the original selectee's interview, and filling the same number of vacancies as before. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Phillips</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 19, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-19. Based on the record before us, we are unable to determine whether the agency removed the original selectee from the position, whether the agency employed the same criteria for selection during the reconstructed selection process that it employed during the original selection process, or whether the agency changed the selection process when it reconstructed the original selection. Indeed, although the agency claims that the appellant's score of 94.69 during the original selection process was only a "preliminary" score based upon his "self-assessment," the record shows that the three top-ranked applicants from the original selection process were forwarded to the selecting official based upon those same, so-called "preliminary" scores. Further, while we recognize that VEOA does not enable veterans to be considered for positions for which they are not qualified, <span class="Italic">see Ramsey</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 9, the agency has not set forth any explanation for its apparent change in its assessment of the appellant's qualifications since its January 20, 2011 letter to DOL, or how this apparent change is consistent with an appropriate and lawful reconstruction of the selection process. Therefore, we are unable to find the agency in compliance with our Opinion and Order. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 15 (2009) (finding the agency not in compliance with the Board's order to reconstruct the selection process when the agency previously stipulated that it would have selected the appellant in the absence of the veterans' preference violation, but it failed to select him in the reconstructed selection process without adequate explanation for the inconsistency). Accordingly, we remand the appeal for further development of the record. <span class="Italic">See Deems v.

<p class="Body-Text">Reconstruction of the selection process involves removal of the selectee from the position pending reconstruction and a new selection, but it does not bar ultimate appointment of the original selectee, <span class="Italic">Graves v. VA</span>, SF-3330-09-0570-X-1 (NP 7/15/2014) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Graves v. VA</span>, 618 Fed. Appx. 1016 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency provided evidence that it removed the selectee from the MRT position and appointed her to a temporary special needs position. This action satisfies the Board's instruction to remove the selectee from the position to permit a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> reconstruction of the selection process. In reconstructing the hiring process under VEOA, the agency "must remove the improperly appointed incumbent from the position." <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 19, &#x00B6; 15 (2010). However, the agency "need not remove the individual from the federal service but need only remove the individual from the position he or she holds as the result of the improper appointment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 13 (2009)). The agency therefore was not obligated to remove the selectee from service altogether, as the appellant seems to believe.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor does the agency's subsequent reappointment of the selectee to the MRT position at the GS-8 level invalidate the reconstructed selection process. As explained below, the agency determined, upon reconstructing the hiring process, that the appellant was not qualified for the position at any level above GS-4. Because the selectee was reappointed at the GS-8 level, she was not in direct competition with the appellant and was not appointed "over" him, as he alleges. The agency's imprecise language does give this impression, <span class="Italic">see</span> CRF, Tab 25 at 5 (expounding on the agency's concerns about removing the selectee, which are irrelevant). However, our review of the agency's actions reveals that despite its confusing narrative, the agency complied with the requirement to remove the selectee in order to reconstruct the hiring process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Goins v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-3330-21-0214-X-1 (NP 9/23/2022), gives an example of agency compliance with an order to reconstruct a selection process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under VEOA, an appellant whose veterans' preference rights were violated with respect to a selection process is entitled to a selection process consistent with law. <span class="Italic">Weed</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 6. To properly reconstruct a selection, an agency must conduct an actual selection process based on the same circumstances surrounding the original faulty selection. <span class="Italic">Washburn v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 14 (2013). This includes taking the original selectee out of the position, conducting and evaluating an interview of the appellant that can be meaningfully compared with the original selectee's interview, and filling the same number of vacancies as before. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency argues that it has now properly reconstructed the hiring process and has provided evidence showing that it removed the original selectee from the position for the reconstruction, reinterviewed the appellant with a hiring board that included one of the same members of the original hiring board, and filled the same number of vacancies. In support, the agency provided: (1) a Certificate of Eligibles, dated October 7, 2021, containing the names and preference entitlements for each candidate, including the appellant and the original selectee; (2) a <span id="Page_724"></span>Candidate Scoring Matrix, containing the reconstructed hiring board's ratings for each candidate and identifying the original selectee as its fourth overall pick and the appellant as its fifth overall pick; and (3) copies of the appellant's and original selectee's resumes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the agency provided the hiring official's March 25, 2022 affidavit in which he attested that "[u]pon completion of the reconstructed hiring process, [he] affirmed that [the original selectee] should be recommended for the [position at issue]" for the following reasons: (1) the original selectee's pre-interview scores were higher than the appellant's scores; (2) both the original selectee and the appellant were entitled to veterans' preference; (3) upon comparison of their resumes, the original selectee's prior work experience was a better fit for the position compared to the appellant's "due to skill sets required to operate in Global Command Support System--Army programs and fulfilling related Property Book Office duties and responsibilities"; (4) the hiring board had determined that the original selectee was more qualified for the position; and (5) the original selectee hypothetically would have accepted the position at issue, as demonstrated by the fact that the original selectee accepted the position. Also attached to the hiring official's affidavit were four "Memorandum [sic] for Record," including three documenting his directives to the reconstructed hiring board and one signed by a member of the hiring board documenting the hiring board's reconstructed interview of the appellant on March 22, 2022, and its unanimous post-interview recommendation that, based on its review of pre- and post-interview documentation and candidate scores, the hiring official should hire the original selectee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his response to the agency's compliance submission, however, the appellant argues that the agency did not provide him a lawful selection process. For the reasons that follow, we find no merit to the appellant's arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the appellant argues that the agency did not provide him a lawful selection process because he was not asked the same interview questions as the original selectee during his reconstructed interview. Although the Board ordered the agency to submit evidence showing that the appellant was asked the same interview questions as the original selectee during his reconstructed interview, it is not necessary to a lawful reconstructed selection process as long as the agency can otherwise show that it conducted and evaluated an interview of the appellant that is meaningfully comparable with the original selectee's interview. <span class="Italic">See Washburn</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 14. Here, the agency asserts that, although no record of the exact questions asked by the original board was retained, the hiring official directed the reconstructed hiring board to make all efforts to ask the appellant the same interview questions as the original selectee. To that end, the reconstructed hiring board member who served on the original hiring board advised the other members regarding the original hiring board's interview practices, subject matter of interview questions asked, and the reasons for its decision to hire the original selectee. The agency further asserts that the appellant was asked questions of the same subject matter and that his reconstructed interview lasted roughly the same duration of time as the selected candidate's interview. In light of these circumstances, we find that the agency satisfied its obligation to conduct and evaluate an interview of the appellant that was meaningfully comparable with the original selectee's interview, even though it was unable to ask the appellant identical questions to those asked during the original hiring process[3] <span class="Italic">See Washburn</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant claims that the agency's failure to maintain the original selectee's interview questions is a violation of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1602.14, which requires employers to maintain personnel or employment records related to hiring for 1 year. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1602.14 is applicable here, the agency's compliance (or lack thereof) with this records management provision does not affect the dispositive issue before us of whether the agency provided the appellant a lawful selection process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the appellant argues that the reconstructed selection process was not lawful because his status as a preference eligible under VEOA and his family member preference should have placed him "at the top of the listing for consideration" by the agency. However, the appellant's belief that he should have been ranked higher than the other applicants does not establish that the agency failed to provide him a lawful selection process. The agency has provided as evidence a copy of the full, ranked list of candidates that it considered during the reconstruction, accompanied by the candidates' scores and preference entitlements. This evidence shows that both the appellant and the selected candidate are entitled to veterans' preference, as they are both preference eligibles,[4] and that the agency considered the preference entitlements of each candidate during the reconstruction, including the appellant's family member preference. Accordingly, we find that the agency properly applied and considered the appellant's veterans' preference and family member preference in reconstructing the hiring process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;As both the selected candidate and the appellant are preference eligibles under VEOA, the agency was not required to seek preapproval from the Office of Personnel Management before passing over the appellant, regardless of any compensable service-connected disability he may have. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(c)(1)-(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also appears to argue that the reconstructed hiring process was not lawful because the agency may not have considered his eligibility for Schedule A hiring or reinstatement under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401. However, Schedule A hiring may be used only in a noncompetitive hiring process; therefore, it was unavailable in the reconstructed hiring process here for a competitive service position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(u). In addition, while "an agency <span class="Italic">may</span> appoint by reinstatement to a competitive service position a person who previously was employed under career or career-conditional appointment (or equivalent)," reinstatement eligibility is not a guarantee that an employee will be considered for a specific position or be appointed to it. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401(a) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Hicks v. Department of the Navy</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 511 (1987) (the Board lacks jurisdiction over an agency's decision not to reinstate an employee pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401). Accordingly, the appellant's arguments do not demonstrate any error in the reconstructed hiring process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant argues, without evidence, that it is his belief that the agency never conducted interviews of the candidates during the original hiring process. However, the agency's evidence reflects otherwise. In particular, the agency provided a scoring matrix showing the dates that the original hiring board conducted these interviews and its interview remarks for each candidate. The agency's evidence also shows that one of the three members of the reconstructed hiring board served on the original hiring board and advised the other members regarding the original hiring board's interview practices, subject matter of interview questions asked, and the reasons for its decision to hire the original selectee.[5] Therefore, we find that the agency's evidence outweighs the appellant's cursory and unsupported allegation and provides no basis to find that the agency did not conduct interviews during the original hiring process or otherwise provide him a lawful reconstructed selection process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;As one of the members of the original hiring board served on the reconstructed hiring board, only the appellant was required to be interviewed during the reconstruction. The agency was not required to re-interview the other candidates. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 19, &#x00B6; 18 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the appellant's myriad other challenges to the agency's compliance and find them unpersuasive. 
In consideration of the agency's evidence of compliance, and all arguments put forward by the appellant, we find that the agency's reconstruction of its hiring process is consistent with law and provided the appellant an opportunity to compete for the position at issue, with his veterans' preference rights and family member preference properly applied and considered. Specifically, we find that the agency's reconstruction was based on the same circumstances surrounding the original faulty selection and involved taking the original selectee out of the position, conducting and evaluating an interview of the appellant that was meaningfully comparable with the original selectee's interview, and filling the same number of vacancies. <span class="Italic">See Washburn</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 14. As the lawful reconstructed hiring process demonstrated that, in the absence of a violation of the appellant's veterans' preference rights, the agency would not have selected him for the position because he was not the best candidate, he has not suffered any lost wages or benefits that would entitle him to an award under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a). <span class="Italic">See Lodge v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 15 (2007). Accordingly, his requests to be issued such an award are denied. [6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;We additionally deny the appellant's request for sanctions or other "follow-up action[s]." The Board's ability to impose sanctions is a means to enforce compliance. <span class="Italic">Eikenberry v. Department of the Interior</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 119, 121 (1988). Here, the agency has submitted evidence of compliance, and therefore, it would be inappropriate for the Board to impose sanctions at this time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reconstruction should be for the vacancy that the appellant was denied proper consideration and not for a subsequently announced position, <span class="Italic">Schultz v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 23But, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency concedes that it violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights when it considered his application under Vacancy Announcement IC-16-339-JRS-1747909-BU. It is not clear, however, whether the appellant would have been selected absent the violation. Thus, the proper remedy under VEOA is to reconstruct the selection process for the position. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 19, &#x00B6; 21 (2010); <span class="Italic">Walker v.

To properly reconstruct a selection, an agency must conduct an actual selection process based on the same circumstances surrounding the original faulty selection. <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 42, &#x00B6; 13 (2013). This includes taking the original selectee out of the position, conducting and evaluating interviews so that they are meaningfully comparable with the original selectee's interview, and filling the same number of vacancies as before. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, although the agency attempted to comply with one of the remedies proffered by the DOL investigator, it did not conduct a selection process based on the same circumstances surrounding the original selection and, therefore, it never remedied its original faulty selection process. Accordingly, we find that the agency's efforts to remedy its violation fell short of the law's requirements.[1] <span class="Italic">See Phillips</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 19, &#x00B6; 21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Even if DOL had found that the agency's reannouncement of the vacancy was a sufficient remedy under VEOA, which it did not, the Board has held that Congress did not intend for DOL to have the final word as to what constitutes an appropriate remedy for a violation of veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Gingery v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 17 (2008).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But removal of the incumbent from the contested position is not always required as part of the reconstruction process under <span class="Italic">Kerner v. Dept. of Interior,</span> CH-4324-11-0568-C-1 (NP 5/28/2015), distinguishing <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, when the agency essentially duplicates the original selection process in the reconstruction during a period when vacancies are still available:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant challenges the agency's reconstruction process because the agency acknowledges that, in reconstructing the hiring process, it did not remove the selectees from their positions. Citing the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Washburn v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 14 (2013), and <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 19, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-19 (2010), the appellant argues that the agency's actions were insufficient because an actual selection process based on the same circumstances includes removing the improperly appointed incumbents from the positions at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, the Board examined the agency's reconstructed selection process and found that, in addition to the fact that the agency did not remove the original selectees from the positions at issue, the members of the reconstructed selection board were not the original selection board members, and it was not clear how many positions had been filled. <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 19, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15, 18-19. The Board concluded that the reconstructed selection process was hypothetical and that the agency therefore violated the appellant's right to compete under merit promotion procedures. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In examining the agency's reconstructed process in <span class="Italic">Washburn</span>, the Board found that, on the record before it, it was unable to determine how many vacancies were filled pursuant to the announcement at issue, whether a priority placement candidate was ever actually appointed, or whether the appellant was competing against the same pool of candidates with whom he would have competed had the agency not improperly found him ineligible prior to opening the vacancy to external candidates. <span class="Italic">Washburn</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 14. Concluding that the appeal might be moot in light of the agency's reconstructed selection process, the Board remanded the appeal, directing the administrative judge to require the agency to submit evidence sufficient to explain the history of the vacancy announcement so that he could determine what actually happened. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the case at bar is more factually similar to <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Department of Defense</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 376, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). There, as here, the agency reconstructed the selection process while the appellant's VEOA appeal was pending. The agency submitted evidence that the selecting official requested that the original selection panel members reconvene to evaluate the appellant as part of the reconstructed selection process and that the appellant's application was evaluated by the same panel members using the same criteria as in the original evaluation of candidates, although his name was not included on the list of candidates referred to the selecting official because his score was too low. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 16. The Board found that the agency did not err in its reconstructed selection process and that it did not violate the appellant's right to compete. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16, 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, unlike <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> and <span class="Italic">Washburn</span>, the agency's reconstructed selection process occurred while there were still vacancies available. Moreover, as in <span class="Italic">Wheeler,</span> the agency forwarded the appellant's application to the same rating panels and directed them to review his qualifications against the same rating plan criteria as in the original selection process. It appears that the appellant would have been selected had he scored higher than any of the selectees. Because there is no indication that this process was hypothetical, he obtained all the relief to which he was entitled under VEOA.[3] Under these circumstances, no purpose would be served by requiring the agency to remove the selectees and to repeat the selection process. We therefore find, under the circumstances of this case, that, as to the reconstructed process for the positions filled at the GS-7 and GS-9 levels, the agency demonstrated compliance with the Board's Final Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Unlike <span class="Italic">Wheeler</span>, <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, and <span class="Italic">Washburn</span>, the instant matter was not a "right to compete" VEOA appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f). Rather, the Board previously held that the agency had violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency issued a September 23, 2002 Merit Promotion Vacancy Announcement No. 02-RCBB-204 to fill three GS-0305-03 File Clerk (Searcher) positions with the agency's Bureau of the Public Debt. Merit Promotion Vacancy Announcement No. 02-RCBB-204 stated that the agency would make its hiring decision from the following categories: (1) Department of the Treasury Career Transition Assistance Program eligibles from the local commuting area; (2) Interagency Career Transition Assistance Program eligibles from the local commuting area; (3) District of Columbia Department of Corrections Program eligibles; (4) current non-temporary Department of the Treasury employees; (5) individuals eligible for transfer, reinstatement, or "under special appointment" authority; or (6) individuals who were eligible for veterans' preference or individuals separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after three years or more of continuous active service. The position description for the GS-3 position of File Clerk (Searcher) indicates that the position is in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant applied for one of the three GS 0305-03 positions in response to Merit Promotion Vacancy Announcement No. 02 RCBB 204. The appellant submitted a copy of his DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release on Discharge from Active Duty) documenting that he retired in 1996 after performing twenty years of honorable service in the United States Air Force. According to a November 5, 2002 letter from the Department of Veterans Affairs, the appellant is a veteran with a service connected disability rating of sixty percent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency filled three positions from Merit Promotion Vacancy Announcement No. 02-RCBB-204. The agency found that the appellant was qualified for the positions and it awarded him ten veterans' preference points, but it did not select him for any of the three positions. Instead, the agency selected three non-veterans for the positions. They were Amy D. DeBarr, Stephanie Gail Pitts, and Melissa K. Carpenter. Ms. Barr was listed as an "external" hire, while Ms. Pitts and Ms. Carpenter were hired under a program for Clerical and Administrative Support Positions, known as "CASP" appointments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency does not deny that the appellant is a preference eligible with veterans' preference rights, and that the persons it appointed to the three positions at issue were non-preference eligibles. The appellant filed a complaint with the Department of Labor under the Veterans Employment Opportunity Act (VEOA), alleging a violation of his veterans' preference rights. The Department of Labor sent the appellant a December 31, 2002 letter informing him that "[w]hen filling a GS-305 [sic] File Clerk position at grade three, agencies have the option of selecting candidates that have been evaluated using the Office of Personnel Management's [(OPM's)] Clerical and Administrative Support Positions (CASP) assessment tool which establishes a standing register of applicants. A separate vacancy announcement is not required." After receiving the Department of Labor letter, the appellant filed this Board appeal claiming that his nonselection violated his veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not request a hearing. The administrative judge therefore decided the case based on the written submissions. The administrative judge found that the appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction under VEOA but concluded that the vacancy announcement allowed the agency to fill the positions as competitive or under "noncompetitive appointment." The administrative judge found that the agency did not violate the appellant's preference eligible rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant argues that he was entitled to compete for the vacancies under merit promotion procedures. He asserts that he was not allowed to compete with candidates on the other lists of eligibles. In its response to the appellant's petition for review, the agency contends that the appellant competed for the positions because he was on at least one certificate of eligibles, he "was given the opportunity to apply," but that he "was "not entitled to veterans' preference." The agency argues that "[a]ll individuals on the certificate are 'competing' for the position. The fact that the [a]ppellant was placed on the certificate <span id="Page_726"></span>afforded him the opportunity to compete and receive consideration."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The history of the civil service laws and the legislative history of VEOA are explained in <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 55 (2005). As discussed in <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, "[t]oday's civil service laws trace their origin to the Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883, 22 Stat. 403, which 'provided for the creation of a classified civil service and required competitive examination for entry into that service.'" <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. at 539 (quoting <span class="Italic">Arnett v.

Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302, a statute which applies to veterans' preference, provides in relevant part that the President may prescribe rules that make, "as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for...necessary exceptions from the provisions of section[ ] 3304(a)."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following these statutory provisions, both Congress and OPM have determined that an integral part of the competitive examining process is the assignment of numerical scores, followed by the rating and ranking of candidates according to those scores. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(a) (OPM, or an agency operating under a delegation of authority from OPM pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104(a)(2), "shall assign numerical ratings" to candidates). Specific statutory provisions apply to the rating and ranking of preference eligible individuals. Preference eligibles have points added to their passing scores on examinations. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(b). Preference eligible veterans are entitled to five additional points, and disabled veterans, like the appellant, are entitled to ten additional points. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(b). Once the scores of the candidates for a position are adjusted to include any additional points, the names of applicants who have qualified for appointment to the competitive service are entered onto "registers or lists of eligibles," in rank order, with preference eligibles ranked ahead of others with the same rating. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.401.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Commission (the predecessor to OPM) was to certify, from the top of the appointment register of eligibles, a sufficient number of names to allow the appointing official to consider at least three names for each vacancy.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In hearings on VEOA, Congress expressed concern that veterans' preference in the federal workplace "is often ignored or circumvented and that its continued viability is threatened on several fronts." H.R. Rep. No. 105-40 (1997). In <span class="Italic">Young v. Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 99 &#x00B6; 6 (2002), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 66 Fed.

Following <span class="Italic">Young</span>, the Board in its <span class="Italic">Dean</span> decision found that the manner in which the agency there conducted its hiring for the Personnel Management Specialist position violated Mr. Dean's rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b), a statute relating to veterans' preference, when it appointed to that position an individual who had not passed an examination and who had not been specifically excepted from examination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302. <span class="Italic">Dean,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. at 550. The same is true here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Merit Promotion Vacancy Announcement No. 02-RCBB-03 for the GS-3 positions of File Clerk (Searcher) with the Bureau of Public Debt did not mention selecting any candidates using OPM's CASP assessment tool. We are unaware of any regulation or case law describing that assessment tool, and the agency has not mentioned any case law on the subject. Thus, there is no basis for finding that the CASP assessment tool constitutes an exception to the examination process under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no indication that the method of selecting Ms. Pitts and Ms. Carpenter as CASP hires was competitive and took into account veterans' preference. This, coupled with the undisputed fact that Ms. Barr was an "external" hire selected without any competitive examination or consideration of veterans' preference leads us to conclude, consistent with <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, that the agency violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights in making its selections for the S-0305-03 File Clerk positions with the Bureau of the Public Debt under Merit Promotion Vacancy Announcement No. 02-RCBB-204.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the agency in its response to the appellant's petition for review and the initial decision, rely on <span class="Italic">Scharein</span>, cited above, to support the proposition that the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights. The facts in <span class="Italic">Scharein</span> are distinguishable from the facts in this case. The agency in <span class="Italic">Scharein</span> canceled the vacancy announcement after OPM denied its request to pass over the appellant, a preference eligible ranked first on the certificate of eligibles, to appoint a non-preference eligible ranked second on the certificate. 91 M.S.P.R. 329 &#x00B6; 10. In this case, however, the agency filled three positions with non-veterans without evidence showing that it considered the appellant's status as a sixty percent disabled veteran when rating and ranking him with the non-veterans who were appointed. There is also no evidence that the agency sought OPM pass-over authority not to appoint the appellant, or that the agency canceled Merit Promotion Vacancy Announcement No. 02-RCBB-204. To the contrary, as explained above, the agency filled three positions from that vacancy announcement with three non-veterans.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the record shows no indication that the individuals selected by the agency and appointed in the competitive service took or passed an approved examination, or that the agency provided the appellant with preference as a sixty percent disabled veteran on a list with the ultimate selectees. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, we find that the noncompetitive appointment of Ms. DeBarr, Ms. Pitts, and Ms. Carpenter to positions in the competitive service did not comply with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3302 and 3304(b). Thus, we find that the agency violated the appellant's rights under a statute relating to veterans' preference, namely, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b), when it appointed persons who had not passed an examination and who had not been specifically excepted from examination by the President under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302 to the GS-3 File Clerk (Searcher) positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are aware of no provisions within VEOA stating that an individual whose rights have been violated is automatically entitled to the position sought. Rather, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c reflects that such an individual is entitled to a selection process consistent with law. This reading of the statute comports with the holding of our reviewing court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, that the Board is not authorized to supplant remedies Congress expressly provided or to create new remedies which it believes Congress overlooked. <span class="Italic">See King v. Jerome</span>, 42 F.3d 1371, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Moreover, this approach is consistent with the statutory provision regarding the award of compensation for "any" loss of wages or benefits suffered by reason of a violation of a veterans' preference right. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c. An individual can suffer such losses only if he would have been hired by the agency in the absence of a violation of his rights. <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. at 551.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the relief for the appellant, as required by statute, is an order from the Board requiring the agency to comply with the violated provisions of a statute relating to veterans' preference, and an award of compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by reason of any violation that is found. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 551-52. Following <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, we find that while the Board can order the agency to comply with the violated law, it is unclear whether the appellant is entitled to an award of compensation because it is unknown whether he would have been selected for the position if the proper procedures had been followed. Moreover, there is no basis for rejecting the statutorily-mandated remedy based on a concern as to how a Board order in this case may affect persons who are not parties in this proceeding. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The impact, if any, of this order on non-parties is subject to any future case that may involve such an issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appropriate remedy in this case, therefore, is not an automatic and retroactive appointment of the appellant. Rather, the agency must comply with the applicable law. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. VEOA provides that, if the Board determines that an agency has violated a statute or regulation relating to veterans' <span id="Page_727"></span>preference, it "shall order the agency to comply with such provisions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c; <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. at 551. The Board's regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.25 reiterate these statutory provisions. Therefore, consistent with <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, we find that the agency must reconstruct the hiring for the File Clerk (Searcher) positions and follow 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Patterson v. OPM,</span> 168 Fed. Appx. 947, 950 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), noted that the remedy for a VEOA violation is consideration (not necessarily selection) for a position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...According to Mr. Patterson, once the Board determined that OPM had violated his VEOA rights and thereby discriminated against him by not allowing him to compete under merit promotion procedures, it should have awarded him what he says is "the statutorily prescribed remedy" of placement in the FOIA Specialist position and back pay. We do not agree. What Mr. Patterson overlooks is the fact that the VEOA violation that the Board found was failure to <span class="Italic">consider</span> Mr. Patterson for the FOIA Specialist position under merit promotion procedures. Under these circumstances, it was entirely proper for the Board remand the matter to the agency so that Mr. Patterson could be considered under those procedures--especially since the Board found that there was no evidence in the record to indicate that Mr. Patterson's qualifications were superior to those of the individual who was selected for the position. The Board's order addressed the harm that it had found. In short, we see no error in the Board's December 4, 2003 order.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We wish to make one point of clarification if the administrative judge finds that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal on remand. The administrative judge stated in the initial decision that "the only remaining issue is whether the [agency] has fully complied with its obligations under the reconstruction remedy agreed upon by all parties." Even if the agency complied with each of the terms of the parties' agreed-upon reconstruction remedy, the administrative judge must still determine whether, through the agency's reconstructed selection process, the appellant received all the relief to which he would have been entitled if he had prevailed on his VEOA claim before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Department of the Navy,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 19, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-20 (2010) (concluding that the agency's "hypothetical" reconstructed selection process did not give the appellant an opportunity to compete because the agency did not remove the original selectees, the members of the reconstructed selection board were not the original selection board members, and it was not clear how many positions had been filled); <span class="Italic">see also Wheeler v. Department of Defense,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 376, &#x00B6; 18 (2010) (finding that, because the appellant's assertions that the agency violated his right to compete during the reconstructed hiring process were without merit, he had obtained all of the relief he could have obtained had he prevailed on his VEOA claim before the Board).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Graves v. VA</span>, SF-3330-09-0570-X-1 (NP 7/15/2014) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Graves v. VA</span>, 618 Fed. Appx. 1016 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP)), provides an example of the evidence produced by an agency during enforcement proceedings to demonstrate legitimate consideration of the appellant during a reconstructed selection:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency provided evidence that upon reconstructing the hiring process, it assessed the appellant's qualifications for the position and determined that he was not qualified above the GS-4 level. The agency provided a sworn statement from the Chief of Health Information Management Service (HIMS) at VA Long Beach Healthcare System, who has been responsible for supervising and directing "professional, technical, and other support staff in medical health information work" since 2008. She compared the appellant's application with the position requirements and determined that he did not qualify above the GS-4 level. Specifically, she determined that the appellant lacked the two years of experience required to qualify for the GS-5 level; lacked sufficient practical knowledge of laws and regulations related to confidentiality of health information, medical record-keeping, and health information software; and did not complete the continuing education courses required to maintain his 2002 Certified Coding Specialist-Physician-Based Certificate from the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 10 (listing requirements for the MRT position); IAF, Tab 6 at 11 (vacancy announcement). She also noted that the AHIMA certificate was designed for individuals who work primarily in a physician's office, not in a medical center such as the one at issue. Finally, she stated that she considered the rest of the experience listed by the appellant and determined that it was not relevant to the work of a medical records coder and therefore did not qualify him for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant challenges this determination, contending that he is a "qualified expert (certified coder)" and meets the qualifications of the position up to and including the GS-8 level. He also contends that the Chief of HIMS is not an expert in the medical coding field and that she is "biased" and "not credible" because she made the original decision that appointed the original selectee to the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with these contentions. According to her statement, the Chief of HIMS has at least six years of experience supervising various professionals in medical health information work. She need not perform every aspect of the work herself in order to supervise employees or determine qualifications for the positions under her supervision. The fact that she made the original appointment decision does not demonstrate bias or lack of credibility. On the contrary, it demonstrates that the reconstruction process was genuine, because she would be able to apply the same criteria to the reconstructed process that she used in making the original appointment. <span class="Italic">See Phillips</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 19, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11, 18 (noting that it is preferable for the selecting officials to be the same during the original and reconstructed hiring processes to ensure comparable consideration).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's own assessment of his qualifications is not dispositive. Nor will we override an agency determination that was based on consideration of the relevant factors. As we recently explained[3] in <span class="Italic">Miller v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 12 (2014), "VEOA does not empower the Board to reevaluate the merits of an agency's ultimate determination that a preference-eligible veteran is not qualified for a position with the agency." Where, as here, it is evident that the agency considered an appellant's relevant education, experience, and other qualifications, we will not engage in a fact-based review of how an agency weighed and assessed a preference-eligible's qualifications for a position of employment. Rather, the Board's role is limited to determining whether the hiring agency improperly omitted, overlooked, or excluded a portion of the appellant's experiences or work history in assessing his qualifications for the vacancy, and the Board will not reevaluate the weight the agency accorded those experiences in reaching its decision that the appellant was not qualified for a given position of employment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Because <span class="Italic">Miller</span> clarified the existing law set forth in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 573 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2009), and <span class="Italic">Lazaro v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 666 F.3d 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2012), it is not a new rule of law. Even if it were, however, it would still apply retroactively here because this case was open on direct review at the time <span class="Italic">Miller</span> was decided. <span class="Italic">See Porter v. Department of Defense</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the agency failed to give proper weight to his various qualifications and experience. However, the statement of the Chief of HIMS addresses the appellant's qualifications, including his coding certificate, as well as his coding and non-coding experience. The Board "will not reevaluate the weight the agency accorded those experiences" and qualifications. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 12. The appellant has not specifically identified other qualifying education or experiences that he provided to the agency but that the agency failed to consider. The appellant relies primarily on his AHIMA certification, which the agency discounted because his r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; submitted at the time of his application showed that he had not maintained this certification. The appellant's blanket assertions that he is qualified and that the agency erred in finding otherwise do not constitute specific allegations of error in the compliance process. Accordingly, we will not disturb the agency's finding that the appellant was not qualified above the GS-4 level.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. DHS</span>, 110 MSPR 567, 2009 MSPB 28 (2009) (the agency could, in reconstructing an action challenged under VEOA, decide to wait a reasonable period of time for the person who was selected to qualify under agency regulations for appointment to the position following termination of his active military service); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Weed v.

<p class="Body-Text">Priority consideration for a future vacancy may be a remedy under VEOA if the appellant is improperly excluded from consideration, although it is not a proper remedy if the appellant is considered for a position after the agency corrects an administrative error in the selection process, <span class="Italic">Jones v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's argument on review, we agree with the administrative judge that he was not entitled to priority consideration. The administrative judge noted the appellant's argument that he was entitled to priority consideration because of the agency's initial mistake in finding that he was not a preference eligible and characterized this argument as relying on the OPM's Delegated Examining Operations Handbook (DEOH). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing OPM, DEOH, 2007: A Guide for Federal <span id="Page_728"></span>Agency Examining Offices (May 2007), Chapter 6, Subsection E...). The DEOH, Chapter 6, Subsection E defines priority consideration as "a special placement priority that is given to an eligible [veteran], who was previously denied consideration due to an administrative error or law or regulatory violation." However, the administrative judge found that this provision did not apply to this case because: (1) the DEOH does not apply to merit promotions; and (2) the instant case does not involve the "denial of consideration" as the agency's error in finding that the appellant was not a preference eligible was corrected in time for him to be considered and interviewed for the position. We see no reason to disturb this finding. <span class="Italic">See</span> DEOH, Introduction, Chapter 6, Subsection E.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Previously, when an agency has improperly denied an appellant consideration for a position, the Board has generally stated that the appropriate remedy is to provide the appellant with priority consideration for a future vacancy, as the agency agreed to do in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00B6; 2 <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Azdell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 133, &#x00B6; 52 (2000) (priority consideration for future vacancies is the proper remedy for an appellant who was denied consideration for a position for which he was qualified), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 88 (2001), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 319 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Yet, priority consideration for a future vacancy is a remedy that provides prospective relief for the denial of the opportunity to compete, but it does not correct the agency's error with respect to the actual position for which the agency denied the appellant consideration. In the context of a VEOA appeal, such relief would be inappropriate because VEOA requires the Board to do more than merely provide a remedy for a past wrong; it mandates that the Board "shall order the agency to comply with" the violated provisions and award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 44 (under VEOA, an appellant whose veterans' preference rights were violated with respect to a selection process is entitled to a selection process consistent with law). In addition, VEOA provides that the Board shall award an amount equal to back-pay as liquidated damages if it determines that the violation was willful. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a). Therefore, where an agency violates a statute related to veterans' preference by denying an appellant the right to compete for a particular position, the Board must craft a remedy that allows the appellant to compete for that position, allows the Board to determine whether the appellant suffered any loss of wages or benefits by reason of the violation, and, assuming that the Board finds that the violation was willful, allows the Board to determine whether the appellant might be entitled to backpay for the purposes of awarding liquidated damages. Reconstruction of the selection process requires the agency to comply with the provisions it violated, allows the Board to make the determinations necessary to award the appropriate relief, and, at the same time, is consistent with the principle that &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) requires that agencies give preference eligibles the right to compete for particular positions but does not guarantee these preference eligibles a position. <span class="Italic">See Abell</span>, 343 F.3d at 1384-85. Therefore, contrary to the agency's argument, we reaffirm our determination in <span class="Italic">Dean</span> that &#x00A7; 3330c authorizes the Board to require agencies to reconstruct a selection process when it has improperly prevented an appellant from competing for a position by violating such appellant's rights with respect to a statute or regulation related to veterans' preference. Accordingly, we find that the agency failed to establish that the administrative judge erred in ordering the agency to reconstruct the selection process under the circumstances of this case.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Veterans' preference in hiring for competitive service positions takes various forms. In this case, the agency considered the appellant's application under competitive examining procedures. As it applies to selection for a competitive service position under competitive examining procedures, veterans' preference provides that preference-eligible veterans have additional points added to their passing examination scores. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a), the selection for appointment to each vacancy is from the highest three candidates. If an agency proposes to pass over a preference eligible to select a non-preference eligible, it first must seek authority to do so from OPM. OPM reviews the proposed pass over and sends its findings to the appointing authority and to the preference eligible. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1). When an agency requests authority from OPM to pass over a preference eligible with a 30% compensable service-connected disability, it also must notify the preference eligible of its reasons for doing so and afford him an opportunity to respond to the request to OPM. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(2). The appointing authority may not pass over a preference eligible to select the non-preference eligible unless an objection has been sustained by OPM. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.406(b). OPM's Handbook states that if a pass-over application is not sustained, an agency has two options: (1) Challenge the decision by submitting additional information to obtain a favorable decision from OPM; or (2) consider/select the preference-eligible for a job. <span class="Italic">Delegated Examining Operations Handbook</span>, May 2007.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant applied for a GS-07 Internal Revenue Officer position at five locations in Florida. The locations were: Port St. Lucie, Panama City, Pensacola, Plantation, and St. Petersburg, Florida. The agency has acknowledged that the appellant's name was listed as the seventh highest ranked applicant on a certificate of eligibles with 1167 total applicants, and that the certificate has been used to hire a total of 83 employees at numerous locations throughout the United States. The agency has also acknowledged that positions were filled at all of the appellant's preferred locations, the first three selections for these locations were preference-eligible applicants, and the fourth selection was a non-veteran candidate for a position in St. Petersburg, Florida.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the agency does not contend that the AJ erred on the merits in finding that it violated the appellant's right to veterans' preference. Instead, it argues that the AJ erred in ordering as the remedy for its violation that it retroactively offer the appellant an Internal Revenue Officer position. It asserts that, under <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 42-45 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd on recons</span>., 104 M.S.P.R. 1 (2006), the appropriate relief should have been an order directing the agency to reconstruct the selection process. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The agency further contends that the remedy must be prospective only, and cannot be retroactive with the award of back pay and benefits. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We agree, in part, with the agency's argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reconstruction of the hiring process is the appropriate remedy in this case. In <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 18 (2006), we considered the appropriate remedy for a denial of veterans' preference under VEOA. After reviewing the pertinent statutes and legislative history, we determined that, where an agency violates a statute related to veterans' preference by denying an appellant the right to compete for a particular position, the Board must craft a remedy that: (1) Allows the appellant to compete under merit system principles for the position; (2) allows the Board to determine whether the appellant suffered any loss of wages or benefits by reason of the violation; and (3) assuming that the Board finds that the violation was willful, allows the Board to determine whether the appellant might be entitled to back pay for the purposes of awarding liquidated damages. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We specifically found in <span class="Italic">Walker</span> that reconstruction of the selection process allows the Board to make the determinations necessary to award appropriate relief, and is consistent with the principle in the applicable statutes that requires agencies to give preference eligibles the opportunity to compete for particular positions, but does not guarantee them a position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, we concluded that VEOA authorizes the Board to require agencies to reconstruct the selection process when it has improperly prevented a preference eligible appellant from competing for a position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Further, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has found that reconstruction of the selection process is the appropriate remedy under VEOA for a denial of veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See Patterson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 168 Fed. Appx. 947 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (unpublished).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree, however, with the agency's argument that the remedy for a VEOA violation may only be prospective, and not retroactive, in nature. The plain language of the statute authorizes the Board to award a retroactive remedy of back pay and benefits when an agency has violated a preference eligible's rights. The statute states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_729"></span>If the Merit Systems Protection Board (in a proceeding under section 3330a) or a court (in a proceeding under section 3330b) determines that an agency has violated a right described in section 3330a, the Board or court (as the case may be) shall order the agency to comply with such provisions and award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, the Board will not order a retroactive appointment as a remedy. <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 42-45. However, an individual may be entitled to the retroactive remedies of back pay and compensation for loss of benefits if it is determined that he would have been hired by the agency in the absence of a violation of his rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the AJ's order of a retroactive appointment was proper on the basis that <span class="Italic">Dean</span> does not apply in this case because the agency failed to properly follow procedures for seeking and obtaining pass-over authority from OPM before it selected a non-veteran from the certificate of eligibles. However, even if the agency failed to properly follow procedures in seeking to pass over the appellant, which the appellant has not shown, our determination in <span class="Italic">Dean</span> on the appropriate remedy for a violation of an individual's veterans' preference rights remains applicable. The basic proposition underlying our decision in <span class="Italic">Dean</span> is that the remedy for a violation of VEOA is an order from the Board requiring the agency to fully comply with the violated provisions of a statute relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 45. In other words, our authority under the statute is to order the agency to restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, in which he is in the same position that he would have been if the agency's violation of the statute had not occurred. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1984). We have determined that reconstruction of the hiring process is the appropriate means for achieving this end.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we grant the agency's petition for review, and modify the initial decision to the extent it determined, prior to reconstruction of the selection process, that the appellant would have been hired had not the agency erroneously passed over him. Although an agency's unsuccessful request for pass-over authorization coupled with the appointment of a non-preference eligible is strong evidence that an agency is obligated to appoint the appellant to a position under OPM's rules and procedures, it is still necessary to reconstruct the selection process to determine the position for which the appellant would have been selected, if the violation had not occurred. Thus, to determine if the appellant is entitled to appointment to a position, back pay, and other relief, the agency must reconstruct the hiring for the Internal Revenue Officer positions at the appellant's five selected locations in conformance with the appellant's rights to veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, in <span class="Italic">Lodge</span> the Board explained that as part of the reconstruction process the agency may seek a passover authorization from OPM, <span class="Italic">Lodge v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 109 MSPR 614, 616-18 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11, 2008 MSPB 175 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency asserts that subsequent to the administrative judge's compliance recommendation (of February 8, 2008) it reconstructed the hiring process and placed the appellant's name above the names of non-preference eligible applicants but, because of OPM's September 14, 2007 pass-over decision, it could not offer the appellant a position. In support of its position, the agency argues that it is bound by OPM's decision regarding the appellant's lack of qualifications and that "[t]he fact that the passover approval in this case occurred subsequent to the instant appeal is immaterial; the agency cannot disregard its statutory obligation to comply with OPM's decision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its position, the agency also cites the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Endres v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 455 (2007). In that case, the Board considered an administrative judge's recommendation that the Department of Veterans Affairs be ordered to reconstruct its 2005 hiring process for a position with that agency after Mr. Endres, a preference eligible, filed a VEOA appeal complaining about the selection of a non-preference eligible for the position. In its decision, the Board noted that the agency had "as much as admitted" that it had not properly reconstructed the selection process and the Board ordered the agency to reconstruct the process in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13, 20. The Board noted, however, that "if the agency wishes to select an applicant who was a non-preference eligible as of June 12, 2005 [the date of the initial selection] over the appellant...the agency must obtain evidence of OPM's approval under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00B6; 20. That statutory provision contains the pass-over provisions under which OPM may approve an agency's non-selection of a preference eligible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As observed by the agency in its discussion of the <span class="Italic">Endres</span> case, after the decision discussed above, the Department of Veterans Affairs submitted evidence that it had requested pass-over authority from OPM. <span class="Italic">Endres v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, MSPB Docket No. DE-3443-06-0055-X-1, 107 M.S.P.R. 455, &#x00B6; 2 (Feb. 14, 2008). The Board found that the Department of Veterans Affairs was in compliance and that its selection process was consistent with law. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his response to the agency's submission, the appellant asserts, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the agency's previous pass-over requests were denied and that the September 14, 2007 pass-over decision should not preclude his selection because, at the time of the agency's original selections for the revenue officer position, OPM had not granted pass-over authority. The appellant does not, however, address the two <span class="Italic">Endres</span> decisions and the finding in those cases that an agency ordered to reconstruct its hiring process may seek pass-over authority to avoid selecting a preference eligible applicant. Nor does the appellant explain why the agency is not bound by OPM's determination in the pass-over decision that he lacks the competencies needed to successfully perform the revenue officer position. While the appellant attacks OPM's pass-over decision, questions the agency's assertions that OPM's decision was final, and cites the Board's authority to "redress a grievance under VEOA," he cites nothing establishing Board jurisdiction to review a pass-over determination. We are unaware of a basis for the Board to exercise such authority.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary, however, but rather is limited to those actions specifically made appealable to it by statute or regulation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701(a), 1204(a); <span class="Italic">Saunders v.

VA</span>, 108 MSPR 606, 2008 MSPB 34 (2008)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 18, 2005, the agency opened three separate vacancy announcements for the position of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in its Veterans Affairs Health Administration Center in Denver, Colorado. Two of the announcements were external competitive announcements under the agency's competitive examining process via the Delegated Examining Unit (DEU) that advertised for the position at grade levels 13 and 14. The third announcement presented the position as an internal merit promotion at grade level 13 or 14. The appellant applied for the position under announcement number "VA-1-DN-5-0076," the external competitive announcement for the GS-14 position. A certificate of eligibles under that announcement included the name of the appellant with the notation that he is a compensably disabled veteran. The certificate also noted that the appellant received a score of 92 points. The agency arrived at this score by adding 10 points for disabled veterans' preference to the 82 points the appellant achieved through the application process. The certificate of eligibles also included the names of James McCorvey, and Grahm Innis with the notation of "TP" attached to their names, connoting that they had received the status of tentative (veterans') preference. Mr. McCorvey and Mr. Innis both received 5 veterans' preference points added onto their scores resulting in scores of 97 and 94 points, respectively. Although the certificate of eligibles form (Standard Form (SF)-39) forewarned that a selection may not occur without verifying the preference status of all the candidates, the agency nevertheless selected Mr. McCorvey for the position on June 12, 2005, before any veterans' preference verification took place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Mr. McCorvey had retired from the military as a Lieutenant Colonel and therefore was not entitled, during the selection process, to veterans' preference under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(4)(B), the appellant questioned the selection. The agency acknowledged that it had appointed Mr. McCorvey, a non-preference eligible, without seeking "pass over" authority from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and without giving the appellant an opportunity to respond to the "pass over" in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 7, 2005, the appellant filed an appeal with the MSPB under <span id="Page_730"></span>VEOA maintaining that his nonselection for the CFO position under announcement number VA-1-DN-5-0076 was in violation of his veterans' preference rights. On July 7, 2006, the administrative judge issued an initial decision finding that the agency had denied the appellant his statutory right to compete when it selected a non-preference candidate for the CFO position from the same DEU list containing the appellant's name. Moreover, the administrative judge found that the agency's violation of the appellant's veterans' preference rights was willful because it had neglected to verify whether the selectee was actually entitled to preference status despite having been given instructions to do so. The administrative judge duly noted that given the Department of Veterans Affairs' mission, it had a special responsibility to verify preference rights and to ensure that disabled veterans, like the appellant, are not passed over without regard to statutory and regulatory requirements. The administrative judge determined that the remedy under VEOA for the agency's violation was to provide the appellant with a selection process consistent with law. Therefore, the administrative judge ordered the agency to "appropriately" reconstruct its selection process consistent with the appellant's rights as a compensably disabled veteran. The initial decision became the final decision of the Board on August 11, 2006, when neither party filed a petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 15, 2006, the appellant filed a petition for enforcement after the DVA sent him a document entitled "Agency's Compliance with Order." The appellant contended that the agency's submission, indicating that its most recent reconstruction of its selection process for the CFO position enabling the agency to place Mr. McCorvey in the CFO position under a "legal appointment," did not constitute compliance with the Board's order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency responded that Mr. McCorvey's name was eliminated from all its reconstructed certificates for the CFO position, including the certificate of eligibles under the relevant vacancy announcement. The agency further explained that Mr. McCorvey still held the CFO, GS-14, position through a "regularization" of his appointment based on obtaining a variation under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.1 to correct the administrative error that led to Mr. McCorvey's original selection. The agency stated that the reconstructed certificate of eligibles under the relevant announcement contained only the appellant's name, and argued that it was within its authority not to make any selection from the certificate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following a hearing on the compliance issue and submission of post-hearing briefs by both parties, the administrative judge issued a Recommendation that the appellant's petition for enforcement be granted by the Board. The administrative judge found that the agency had reconstructed the hiring for the position of CFO, GS-0505-14, under the competitive examining process provided for in announcement number VA-1-DN-5-0076, as ordered by the initial decision of July 7, 2006. However, the administrative judge concluded that the agency's reconstruction and its alleged decision to make no selection from the certificate of eligibles under the above vacancy announcement was contrary to the facts and did not constitute a selection process consistent with law. Specifically, the administrative judge found that "[t]he agency cannot in good faith show that it made no selection for the GS-14 CFO position." The administrative judge concluded that Mr. McCorvey's non-competitive appointment through an alleged "regularization" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.1 effectively circumvented the veterans' preference laws, including the requirement that it seek authority from OPM to pass over the appellant in order to hire a candidate that did not have preference eligibility at the time of the selection. The administrative judge therefore recommended that the agency again reconstruct the hiring process for the position of CFO, GS-14, under the competitive examining process pursuant to the DEU's announcement number VA-1-DN-5-0076 consistent with the law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and the agency have responded to the Recommendation. The agency asserts that it made good faith efforts to comply with the Board's order by reconstructing the selection process in order to provide the appellant with proper consideration for the CFO position. The agency argues that its regularization of Mr. McCorvey's appointment is a different matter from its reconstruction of the selection process as ordered by the Board. The agency concludes that it has therefore complied with the Recommendation. On the other hand, the appellant claims that the agency has not complied with its obligations under VEOA and that the pertinent question the Board should address in this compliance case is whether the appellant would have been hired by the agency in the absence of violations of his veterans' preference rights. The appellant argues that the Board's compliance authority to fashion a "make whole" remedy to an applicant for employment or employee injured by a wrongful agency action may include ordering the agency to place the appellant in the position to which he or she was deprived by reason of the wrongful action. Indeed, the appellant urges that the Board find that the agency would have selected him for the CFO position had it not violated his veterans preference rights in the summer of 2005, and requests that the Board direct the agency to appoint him to the CFO position on a retroactive basis, with back pay and liquidated damages for its willful violations of VEOA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to consider an appellant's claim of agency noncompliance with a Board order. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts,</span> 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The Board's authority to remedy noncompliance is broad and far-reaching and functions to ensure that employees or applicants for employment are returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> or the position that they would have been in had the unlawful agency action not occurred. <span class="Italic">Id.; Smith v. Department of the Army,</span> 458 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The agency bears the burden of proving that it has fully complied with a Board final decision. <span class="Italic">See Hill v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 498, 501 (1994). Thus, here, the agency must show, pursuant to the Board's order, that its reconstruction of the competitive process under announcement number VA-1-DN-5-0076 was in accordance with veterans' preference laws and that any subsequent appointment to the CFO position was the result of its fair and lawful consideration of the pool of candidates (including the appellant) under the appropriate and lawful reconstruction. <span class="Italic">See Walker v. Department of the Army,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 96 &#x00B6; 18 (2006) (VEOA requires the Board do more than merely provide a remedy for a past wrong; it mandates that the Board order the agency to comply with the violated provisions and award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reconstructing the selection process, the agency must rely on the circumstances at the time of the original selection. <span class="Italic">Cf. Haskins v. Department of the Navy,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 357 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3 and 11 (2000) (in reconstructing the selection process, the Board found that the successful candidate would still have been chosen over the appellant based on information as of the date of the original selection). With this in mind, in reconstructing the selection process, the agency must enter qualified candidates for a job in the competitive service into registers or lists of eligibles in rank order derived from scores based on qualifications and examinations and any additional points for preference eligible status (as of the time of the original invalid selection process). <span class="Italic">See Dean v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 14 (2005), <span class="Italic">reaffirmed on reconsideration,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 1 (2006); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(b). Preference eligibles who hold the same score as non-preference eligibles are placed ahead of the non-preference eligibles. <span class="Italic">Id.;</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.401. Except for scientific and professional positions in grades GS-9 or higher, disabled veterans who have a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more are entered onto registers in order of their ratings ahead of all remaining applicants. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313(2)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.401. The appointing authority must "consider at least three names for appointment to each vacancy in the competitive service" from a certified list obtained by the examining authority from the top of the appropriate register. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3317(a). The appointing authority "shall select for appointment to each vacancy from the highest three eligibles available for appointment on the certificate furnished under section 3317(a)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a). However, if an appointing authority wishes to select a non-preference eligible rather than a preference eligible on the certificate, the appointing authority may not do so unless he or she files written reasons with OPM for passing over the preference eligible and obtains OPM's approval. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1). In addition, should the preference eligible be a veteran with a 30 percent or more disability, he or she is statutorily entitled to notice of the proposed "pass over" and an opportunity to respond to OPM. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 (b)(2). The agency has not shown that it reconstructed its selection process under announcement number VA-1-DN-5-0076 in accordance with the above legal requirements as ordered by the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is indisputable that Mr. McCorvey was chosen for the CFO position in question on June 12, 2005, in violation of the appellant's veterans' preference rights. Indeed, even after the alleged reconstruction of the selection process under announcement number VA-1-DN-5-0076, from which Mr. McCorvey was originally selected, he still holds that position because of what the agency alleges is a "regularization" of his appointment. The problem with the agency's position, however, is that neither its alleged reconstruction, nor its "regularization" of Mr. McCorvey's appointment is in compliance with law or the Board's Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time the agency first initiated the process to select a candidate under announcement number VA-1-DN-5-0076 in 2005, the appellant's name was forwarded to the agency's appointment authority along with the notation that he had received a score of 92 points (which included 10 points for disabled veterans' preference) and that he was a compensably disabled veteran. Moreover, Mr. McCorvey's and Mr. Innis's names were also forwarded on the certified list of eligibles to the appointing authority during that time, with respective scores of 97 and 94 points. Both these men were tentatively given the status of 5-point preference eligibles. However, verification of Mr. McCorvey's preference-eligible status at that time revealed that, because he had retired from the military as a Lieutenant Colonel, he was not entitled to veterans' preference under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(4)(B). Thus, under a reconstructed <span id="Page_731"></span>selection process, the appellant, as a preference eligible would have had to be entered onto the register ahead of Mr. McCorvey, who, without the 5-point preference, would have had the same score as the appellant or 92 points. Additionally, the agency would have to reconstruct the list and verify Mr. Innis's preference eligibility and list him on the certificate of eligibles with either 89 points as a non-preference eligible or 94 points as a preference eligible. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.401. Rather than just have the appellant's name on the list of eligibles as the agency "reconstructed," the law requires that the certificate of eligibles list at least three names for appointment consideration. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3317(a). Thus, under a reconstruction in accordance with law, in order to select Mr. McCorvey for the position, the appointing authority must have received OPM's approval to do so after filing written reasons with OPM for passing over the appellant, a preference eligible. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1). Additionally, in such a reconstruction, the agency must have given the appellant notice of the agency's intent to pass over his candidacy and the opportunity to respond to the agency's reasons. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we find that the agency has as much as admitted that it has not reconstructed its selection process in accordance with these laws. As noted above, in its alleged reconstruction, the agency inexplicably removed Mr. McCorvey's name from its certificate of eligibles, yet kept him as the selectee in the disputed position without requesting that OPM approve a "pass over." The agency's only explanation for not seeking "pass over" authority from OPM was that in the original certificate of eligibles, Mr. McCorvey was listed as a preference eligible. This explanation, however, is untenable because the original certificate listed Mr. McCorvey as only tentatively being a preference eligible and the agency selected him before any verification of his status as required by OPM procedures. Thus, the agency has failed in its burden to show that it has complied with the Board's order to "appropriately" reconstruct the selection process in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor can we agree with the agency that its selection process in "regularizing" Mr. McCorvey's selection to the CFO position was in accordance with law. The agency's contention that it "regularized" Mr. McCorvey's appointment by obtaining a variation pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.1 to correct the "administrative error" that led to Mr. McCorvey's original selection is indefensible and not borne out by the evidence of record. First, Mr. McCorvey's selection cannot be called an "administrative error" because the agency did not verify Mr. McCorvey's preference eligibility status prior to his selection as required.[3] Moreover, because Mr. McCorvey did not have preference eligibility status at the time of his selection, his selection involved a violation of law, rather than an administrative error, when the agency failed to request pass over authority from OPM and give the appellant notice and the opportunity to respond.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Unlike this case where an agency neglects to verify status information as required by OPM, an administrative error has been described as an inadvertent clerical error without the approval or ratification of an authorized agency official. <span class="Italic">See White v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 590, 593 (1987). We also note here that a mistake in certification by the appointing official will not ordinarily validate an otherwise unlawful appointment. <span class="Italic">See Travaglini v. Department of Education,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. 127, 138 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, there is no evidence that the agency obtained a variation to regularize the appointment. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5.1,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]&#x2003;valid variation requires an official record showing (1) the particular practical difficulty or hardship involved, (2) what is permitted in place of what is required by the regulations, (3) the circumstances that protect the integrity of the competitive service, and (4) a statement limiting the application of the variation to the continuation of the conditions which give rise to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 319 F.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2003), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 540 U.S. 1218 (2004). The agency has not shown that a variation in this case would be within the spirit of OPM's regulations and that the efficiency of the government and the integrity of the competitive service would be protected has not and promoted as required under section 5.1. Further, the agency established that the Director of OPM granted such a variation as also mandated by section 5.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, case law has described regularizing an appointment as correcting the illegal component of the appointment. For example, in <span class="Italic">Filiberti v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 804 F.2d 1504 (9th Cir. 1986), a non-veteran was appointed to a position ahead of a preference eligible from a certificate of eligibles. The court explained that the non-veteran could only be retained in the position if the appointment was "regularized" by obtaining OPM's authorization to pass over the preference eligible or if the preference eligible withdrew his application. <span class="Italic">See Filiberti,</span> 804 F.2d at 1507. Further, in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Brown,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 559 (1994), the Board found that the agency violated its displaced employee regulations by an appointment, but that the agency could "regularize" the appointment by either requiring the appointing official to select a priority referral from the agency's displaced employee program or by separating the person who had been selected. <span class="Italic">See Brown,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. at 568. Thus, because the agency has not shown that Mr. McCorvey's appointment was regularized by either a variation or by correcting the illegal component of the appointment, Mr. McCorvey's appointment to the CFO position is not valid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Dean,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 19, the Board citing to <span class="Italic">Williams v.

Department of the Treasury,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 17 (2005) the Board made it clear that an individual whose veterans' preference rights were violated is not "automatically" entitled to the position to which he or she applied. Rather, in <span class="Italic">Walker, Dean, Deems</span>, and <span class="Italic">Olson v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 322 (2005), the Board found that the proper remedy for veterans' preference violations is to order the agency to comply with the violated provisions of the statute by reconstructing the hiring process for the position in question. Indeed, more recently, the Board has stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although an agency's unsuccessful request for pass-over authorization coupled with the appointment of a non-preference eligible is strong evidence that an agency is obligated to appoint the appellant to a position under OPM's rules and procedures, it is still necessary to reconstruct the selection process to determine the position for which the appellant would have been selected, if the violation had not occurred. Thus, to determine if the appellant is entitled to appointment to a position, back pay, and other relief, the agency must reconstruct the hiring [for the positions to which the appellant applied] ...in conformance with the appellant's rights to veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Lodge v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 17 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Concern for a non-party to the proceeding is not a basis to deny a remedy to a preference eligible harmed by a veterans' preference violation. <span class="Italic">See Deems,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 18. Indeed, the Board found that "reconstruction of the selection process...allows the Board to make the determinations necessary to award the appropriate relief...." <span class="Italic">Walker,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 18. This case presents the novel situation of providing a remedy when an agency's reconstruction of the selection process still results in the appointment of a non-veteran to the contested position in violation of the appellant's veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency is correct that neither VEOA nor OPM's regulations mandate that the agency make a selection from a certificate to fill a vacancy, <span class="Italic">see Abell v. Department of the Navy,</span> 343 F. 3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the fact remains that the agency did select a non-preference eligible, instead of the appellant, from the certificate that should have been reconstructed by the agency in the manner that this opinion describes above. The agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 as to the appellant when the appointing authority selected and appointed a non-preference eligible after allegedly reconstructing the register without asking OPM for pass over authority or giving the appellant notice and an opportunity to respond. Thus, we find that the agency is in non-compliance with the Board's order as well as the administrative judge's Recommendation to "appropriately" reconstruct the selection process under announcement number VA-1-DN-5-0076.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Order</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency failed to reconstruct the selection process in accordance with the Board's order and the Recommendation, we ORDER the agency to reconstruct the selection process under announcement number VA-1-DN-5-0076 and in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 by following these instructions: (1) Mr. McCorvey must be removed as the selectee for the CFO position in question, because his placement in that position is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318; (2) the certificate of eligibles under announcement number VA-1-DN-5-0076 must contain at least three names for appointment in order for the appointing authority to validly make a selection for the CFO position under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3317 and 3318; (3) the tentative preference for Mr. Innis must be verified in order to place his name ahead of the appellant's name and/or to select him to the position; (4) if the agency wishes to select an applicant who was a non-preference eligible as of June 12, 2005, over the appellant for the CFO position, the agency must obtain evidence of OPM's approval under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1); and (5) if the agency does select a non-preference eligible with OPM's approval, the agency must submit evidence that it gave the appellant notice and an opportunity to respond to OPM under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">VA sought a passover determination from OPM after the Board's decision, and the agency also reassigned the incumbent of the position sought by the appellant. By those actions the agency brought itself into compliance with the Board order directing reconstruction of the selection process, <span class="Italic">Endres v. VA</span>, 108 MSPR 606, 607-08 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-3, 2008 MSPB 34 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is before the Board on the issue of compliance. On December 12, 2007, the Board found the Department of Veterans Affairs ("DVA" or <span id="Page_732"></span>"agency") in noncompliance with the Board's underlying final order in this appeal. <span class="Italic">Endres v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> MSPB Docket No. DE-3443-06-0055-X-1 (Dec. 12, 2007). The Board's final order in the underlying appeal directed the agency to reconstruct its selection process for the position of Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") in accordance with the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 ("VEOA"), and, in particular, with veterans' preference requirements set forth by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3317-3318, in order to afford the appellant his lawful right to compete for that position. <span class="Italic">Endres v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> MSPB Docket No. DE-3443-06-0055-I-1 (Aug. 11, 2006). In spite of the Board's order, the agency persisted in the appointment of an applicant for the CFO position in contravention of the requirements of section 3318, and failed to reconstruct its selection process under announcement number VA-1-DN-5-0076, in accordance with law. Therefore, in the Opinion and Order of December 12, 2007, the Board ordered the agency to again reconstruct the selection process under announcement number VA-1-DN-5-0076, remove the selectee for the CFO position, and otherwise comply with the requirements of competitive service certification from registers and selection set forth by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3317 and 3318. The Board further ordered the agency to submit proof of compliance with these instructions no later than 15 days after the date of its decision unless the agency was unable to comply with this deadline because it wished to obtain approval from the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") to pass over the appellant. In the event the agency decided to request a pass over, the Board ordered the agency to submit evidence that it petitioned OPM for "pass-over" authority, notified the appellant, and had given him the opportunity to respond to OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the Board's Opinion and Order, the agency timely submitted evidence of compliance with the Board's order including DVA's request for pass-over authority from OPM. The appellant submitted for the Board's records a copy of his response to the agency's petition for pass over authority that he sent to OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under VEOA, an appellant whose veterans' preference rights were violated with respect to a selection process is entitled to a selection process consistent with law. In other words, the agency must fully comply with the violated provisions of the statute or statutes relating to veterans' preference to restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante.</span> <span class="Italic">See Lodge v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16 (2007). The Board will not order a retroactive appointment as a remedy for VEOA violations pertaining to a selection process. <span class="Italic">See Dean v.

The Board finds that the agency has now complied with the Board's order. As ordered by the Board, the agency has submitted evidence that the selectee has been removed from the CFO position and reassigned to another position. The agency also submitted evidence that it has asked OPM for pass-over authority. The narrative that the agency attached to its request for OPM pass-over authority explained that there were three names on the certification, and that only the appellant had been accurately awarded a 10-point preference for the position. The agency submitted evidence that it notified the appellant and his counsel regarding the appellant's rights to respond to OPM. DVA further indicated that it sent OPM the Board's Opinion and Order of December 12, 2007. Therefore, it is apparent that the agency's selection process is now consistent with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3317-3318. Accordingly, we find the agency in compliance with VEOA and DISMISS the appellant's petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board evaluated the agency's reconstruction efforts in <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. DOD</span>, 113 MSPR 376, 383-84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17, 2010 MSPB 47 (2010) (USERRA challenge discussed in <span class="Italic">Wheeler v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant, relying on the declarations and the deposition testimony of the selecting official and the head of the selection panel, asserted that the agency did not fully reconstruct the hiring process and instead simply "panel[ed] " his resume.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency submitted evidence demonstrating that during the reconstructed selection process the appellant's name was added to the referral list for Vacancy Announcement NS-0091-07 as a 30% disabled veteran. It also submitted evidence that the appellant's application "was rated by the [selection] panel against the same criteria used to evaluate the other candidates." The selecting official stated in a sworn declaration that she requested that the original selection panel members reconvene to evaluate the appellant as part of the reconstructed selection process. The head of the selection panel stated in a sworn declaration that the appellant's application was "evaluated by the same panel members and against the...[c]riteria" used in the original evaluation of candidates but that his name was not included on the list of candidates referred to the selecting official because his score was too low. In his deposition testimony, the panel head did indicate that the selection panel had not "reconstructed the whole process" but rather "evaluated [the appellant's] resume" using the same criteria under which the other applicants were evaluated. The evidence submitted demonstrates that the appellant's application was evaluated by the same individuals and under the same criteria as the original candidates. The appellant failed to demonstrate that the agency was required to reconstruct each step of the selection process, including reevaluating and rescoring the other applications. Rather, the record establishes that the agency provided the appellant with the right to compete for the Supervisory Accountant position as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), and thus the appellant's assertion on this issue is without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that the agency's reconstructed selection process violated various merit system principles and constituted prohibited personnel practices because it awarded points based on previous performance ratings to internal candidates but not to external candidates. He further asserts that by violating merit system principles and engaging in prohibited personnel practices, the agency did not reconstruct the selection process in accordance with the law. The panel head stated during his deposition that points based on previous performance ratings were assigned to any applicant who provided the relevant information. He explained that the agency's Human Resources department provided the last two performance ratings for all internal candidates and that a fully successful rating was assumed for any external candidate who did not provide his two most recent performance ratings in the application. He further explained that no requirement was in place for the panel to solicit prior performance ratings from external candidates and that there had been no such practice established in past panels in which he participated. Because the agency applied its scoring method consistently to all external candidates, regardless of veteran status, the appellant has failed to demonstrate that the agency's scoring method in the reconstructed hiring process violated his right to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). In this connection, the appellant, who bears the burden of proof on the merits of this appeal, <span class="Italic">Dale v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 10, <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 199 Fed. Appx. 948 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Marshall v. DHHS</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/09-3086.pdf">587 F.3d 1310</a>, 1311-18 (Fed. Cir. 2009), the court took the Board to task for ordering a "reconstruction" remedy, causing ensuing enforcement litigation, when the facts warranted the entry of an order simply directing the appellant's placement into the position on the basis that the appellant was qualified, would have been selected, and when the agency decided that it would not fill the job after the person who was hired for the job was removed from it as a result of the appellant's case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the lengthy, tortured procedure due to disagreements between HHS and the MSPB over how to remedy the government's error, this is a simple case. HHS violated the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA) of 1998 when HHS selected a non-veteran over Mr. Marshall without obtaining approval from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). HHS conceded that it would have selected Mr. Marshall for the position had it not erroneously removed his name from the list of candidates. Another applicant, Ms. Roberta Beach, was hired and worked in this position for several years. There was no dispute that HHS violated Mr. Marshall's VEOA preference rights, but there was considerable disagreement between the agency, the administrative judge (AJ), and the MSPB over how this violation ought to be remedied. The MSPB ultimately ordered HHS to reconstruct the selection process and subsequently held that HHS properly remedied the VEOA violation by cancelling Ms. Beach's appointment (it moved her to another job) and deciding not to make any selection from the certificate (not hiring anyone for the position). We conclude that the MSPB erred in this case by failing to award the proper remedies pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2004, Mr. Marshall, a veteran rated 20% disabled, applied for a Budget Analyst GS-560-13 position with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), an operating division of HHS. CDC interviewed Mr. Marshall for the position and considered him a "strong candidate," but CDC was unable to make a selection at that time, purportedly because of a hiring freeze. While selection for this position was pending, Mr. Marshall contacted CDC to explain that the U.S. Coast Guard had offered him a lower-grade position that he would accept if CDC could not offer him the higher-grade, Budget Analyst position. Because CDC still could not proceed with the selection process, Mr. Marshall accepted the lower-grade position with the U.S. Coast Guard. Mr. Marshall remained interested in the higher-grade CDC position though, and as the MSPB later found, Mr. Marshall's acceptance of the lower-grade position did not constitute a withdrawal from consideration for the higher-grade position. Nevertheless, CDC removed Mr. Marshall's name from consideration and, in June 2004, selected Ms. Roberta Beach, who was listed below Mr. Marshall on the certificate of eligibles, for the Budget Analyst position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An OPM audit later revealed that CDC improperly removed Mr. Marshall's name from consideration. To remedy its error, CDC subsequently offered Mr. Marshall a GS-13 Budget Analyst position on May 24, 2006 that the CDC contact person described as "somewhere in Budget Execution...<span id="Page_733"></span>at some division...that could be anywhere across [Atlanta]." On May 31, 2006, Mr. Marshall declined CDC's offer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 25, 2006, Mr. Marshall filed an appeal with the MSPB, alleging that his veterans' preference rights had been violated. HHS agreed that it had considered Mr. Marshall qualified for the position and that its failure to seek and obtain OPM approval for passing over Mr. Marshall violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See Marshall v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> No. AT-3443-06-0811-X-1, slip op. at 6 (M.S.P.B. May 10, 2007) (<span class="Italic">Marshall I</span>). As for the appropriate remedy, the AJ noted in an initial decision that the VEOA requires only a selection process consistent with law not automatic retroactive reinstatement. Importantly, however, the AJ explained that "[HHS] has not claimed that it would have not selected [Mr. Marshall] for the position at issue." Thus the AJ ordered Mr. Marshall's retroactive reinstatement with the payment of compensation for lost wages or benefits up until May 31, 2006 i.e., when Mr. Marshall declined the subsequent offer of a new position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 14, 2007, the MSPB granted HHS's petition for review. <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 241 (2007) (<span class="Italic">Marshall II</span>). HHS argued that the AJ erred by ordering reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 244. Specifically, HHS maintained that it already provided the appropriate remedy when it offered a position to Mr. Marshall on May 24, 2006. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 245 n.4. The MSPB concluded that the appropriate remedy was reconstruction of the selection process not reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 244-45 &#x0026; n.4. The MSPB reasoned that when an agency violates a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference, the proper remedy is to "order the agency to comply with such provisions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 244-45 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.25; <span class="Italic">Dean v. Dep't of Agric.,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 533 (2005)). Accordingly, the MSPB ordered HHS to reconstruct the selection process for the original Budget Analyst position no later than 30 days after the date of the decision.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 245. The MSPB also ordered HHS to notify Mr. Marshall when it believed that it had complied with the MSPB's reconstruction order and to describe the actions HHS took to do so. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If Mr. Marshall believed that HHS had failed to comply with the MSPB's order, the MSPB stated that Mr. Marshall would have 30 days to petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated December 14, 2007, HHS informed Mr. Marshall that it complied with the MSPB's reconstruction order. HHS stated that governing regulations required HHS to reconstruct a corrected certificate and to provide documentation to OPM. According to HHS, because OPM treated this requirement as having been satisfied when HHS offered an equivalent position to Mr. Marshall on May 24, 2006, this subsequent offer "should be found adequate for the purposes of this appeal as well."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the MSPB's suggestion that this subsequent offer was inadequate, HHS was "at a loss to understand what" more could be done.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Marshall filed a petition for enforcement on January 10, 2008. He alleged that HHS had failed to comply with the MSPB's reconstruction order. Referencing the MSPB's November 14, 2007 order, Mr. Marshall also noted that if HHS's violation was found willful, the MSPB could order HHS to pay an amount equal to backpay as liquidated damages. HHS filed a response, expressing confusion as to what else it could do to reconstruct the selection process and how it could compensate Mr. Marshall for lost wages "without violating the law against dual appointments" arising from his employment with the U.S. Coast Guard. In a written reply, Mr. Marshall argued, among other things, that "in view of [HHS's] refusal to provide the reconstructed files and the information necessary for [Mr. Marshall] to prove an intentional and willful violation of the VEOA law, that an additional liquidated damages award be entered in an amount of the awarded wage."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 17, 2008, the AJ recommended that Mr. Marshall's petition for enforcement be granted. <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> No. AT-3443-060811-X-1 (M.S.P.B. Mar. 17, 2008) (<span class="Italic">Marshall III</span>). Responding that it still did not know what more it could do to comply with the MSPB's reconstruction order, HHS stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is the agency's understanding that the appellant does not seek to actually be placed with this agency, nor can the agency (as pointed out in its original appeal) "reinstate" him for the purposes of awarding him back pay when he has at all times held another federal appointment. However, if the Board has in mind some other specific action which the agency could perform to be in compliance, the agency respectfully requests the Board's assistance in providing the agency with guidance as to what that action would be.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 19, 2008, the MSPB held that HHS was not in compliance with the earlier MSPB order because HHS had not reconstructed the selection process. <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 114 (2008) (<span class="Italic">Marshall IV</span>). More specifically, the MSPB ordered HHS to comply with the following instructions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1) Ms. Roberta Beach must be removed as the selectee for the GS-13 Budget Analyst position in question, because her placement in that position is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318; (2) the reconstructed certificate of eligibles must contain at least three names for appointment in order for the appointing authority to validly make a selection for the GS-13 Budget Analyst position under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3317 and 3318; and (3) if the agency wishes to select an applicant who is a non-preference eligible over the appellant for the GS-13 Budget Analyst position, the agency must obtain evidence of OPM's approval under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">HHS submitted a statement of compliance on October 1, 2008. HHS attached a copy of the SF-50 canceling Ms. Beach's selection and appointment under the relevant vacancy announcement for the Budget Analyst position. HHS also attached a reconstructed certificate of eligibles with Mr. Marshall rated the highest of four people. Nevertheless, HHS decided not to make any selection from the certificate, "thereby closing out the case with no selection made."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the MSPB decision now on appeal, the MSPB determined that HHS complied with the MSPB's reconstruction order and, accordingly, dismissed Mr. Marshall's petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Marshall V,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 1. The MSPB explained that HHS was in compliance with both the VEOA and the MSPB's reconstruction order because "[t]he fact that [HHS] decided not to fill the position did not deny [Mr. Marshall] his opportunity to compete for the position, or otherwise violate his VEOA rights." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 3-4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB therefore dismissed Mr. Marshall's petition for enforcement. Mr. Marshall appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before turning to the merits of Mr. Marshall's appeal, we first address HHS's argument regarding waiver. According to HHS, Mr. Marshall waived his challenge to the MSPB's reconstruction order for three reasons: (1) he did not challenge HHS's last statement of compliance; (2) he did not appeal the MSPB's first reconstruction order on November 14, 2007; and (3) he filed a petition for enforcement of the MSPB reconstruction order. For the following reasons, <span id="Page_734"></span>we conclude that Mr. Marshall has not waived his challenge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, HHS points out that Mr. Marshall failed to challenge HHS's last statement of compliance. We agree with Mr. Marshall that this argument is without merit. The MSPB's decision did not inform Mr. Marshall, then proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, that he could file a response. <span class="Italic">See Marshall IV,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. at 118-19. In addition, the regulation pertaining to the procedures for processing a petition for enforcement mentions a response in the context of initial processing, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(1), but not in the context of consideration by the MSPB, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 1201.183(b). Even the former states merely that "[t]he party that filed the petition may respond to [a statement of compliance]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mr. Marshall could not have appealed the MSPB's first reconstruction order. Our review of MSPB decisions is limited to final orders or final decisions. <span class="Italic">See Weed v. Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> 571 F.3d 1359, 1361-63 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9). In <span class="Italic">Cabot Corp. v. United States,</span> 788 F.2d 1539, 1542 (Fed. Cir. 1986), we stated the uncontroversial rule that "an order remanding a matter to an administrative agency for further findings and proceedings is not final." <span class="Italic">See also Patterson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 111 Fed. Appx. 590 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (request for retroactive appointment and backpay is not ripe for appellate review when the MSPB has remanded to the agency for reconstruction because these items may still be granted on remand). Like these cases, Mr. Marshall's claim would not have been ripe at the time of the MSPB's first reconstruction order, which remanded to HHS to reconstruct the selection process. As this remand could have resulted in a decision to hire Mr. Marshall and award him lost wages and benefits, his appeal at that time would have been premature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, Mr. Marshall's filing of a petition for enforcement of the MSPB's reconstruction order does not judicially estop him from now challenging that order. Judicial estoppel "generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase." <span class="Italic">New Hampshire v. Maine,</span> 532 U.S. 742, 749 (2001) (quoting <span class="Italic">Pegram v. Herdrich,</span> 530 U.S. 211, 227 n.8 (2000)). It would be a stretch to conclude that Mr. Marshall "prevailed" on his petition for enforcement. He was awarded neither the job for which he applied nor the lost wages, lost benefits, and backpay that he sought. The Supreme Court articulated three nonexclusive factors that should inform a decision of whether to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel: (1) "a party's later position must be 'clearly inconsistent' with its earlier position"; (2) whether judicial acceptance of the party's later, inconsistent position "would create 'the perception that either the first or the second court was misled"; and (3) whether the party asserting an inconsistent position "would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 750-51 (citations omitted). Mr. Marshall has at all times contended that he is entitled to compensation for lost wages or benefits, and it would be unfair to penalize him for continuing to pursue this award. There is no inconsistency in Mr. Marshall's position in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that Mr. Marshall has not waived his challenge to the MSPB's reconstruction order. Under the circumstances of Mr. Marshall's case, the government's waiver arguments are entirely without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue in this case is whether reconstruction is the proper remedy under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c when (1) an agency violates a veteran's preference rights during selection in the competitive service and (2) it is undisputed that the agency would have selected the veteran. Title 5 of the United States Code sets forth a statutory remedy for when an agency has violated a preference eligible's veterans' preference rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the [MSPB] (in a proceeding under section 3330a) or a court (in a proceeding under section 3330b) determines that an agency has violated a right described in section 3330a, the Board or court (as the case may be) shall order the agency to comply with such provisions and award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation involved. If the Board or court determines that such violation was willful, it shall award an amount equal to backpay as liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c (2006). The applicable regulation--5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.25(a) restates the statutory language using substantially the same words.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB interpreted the statutory mandate that it "shall order the agency to comply with such provisions" to require reconstruction of the selection process. <span class="Italic">Marshall II,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. at 244-45 (citing <span class="Italic">Dean v. Dep't of Agric.,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 533 (2005)). In <span class="Italic">Dean,</span> the MSPB granted an agency's petition to review an initial decision ordering retroactive appointment as a remedy for the agency's VEOA violation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 536. The MSPB determined that the agency violated the veteran's preference rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 550. But with respect to an appropriate remedy, the MSPB explained that it was "aware of no provisions within VEOA stating that an individual whose rights have been violated is automatically entitled to the position sought. Rather, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c reflects that such an individual is entitled to a selection process consistent with law." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 551. Furthermore, according to the MSPB, "it is unclear whether the appellant is entitled to an award of compensation because it is unknown whether he would have been selected for the position if the proper procedures had been followed." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 552.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Dean,</span> the MSPB, in this case, concluded that &#x00A7; 3330c required HHS to reconstruct the selection process. The MSPB rejected the agency's argument that it satisfied &#x00A7; 3330c when it offered Mr. Marshall an alternative position. It likewise rejected the AJ's determination that &#x00A7; 3330c required retroactive reinstatement with the payment of compensation and lost wages and benefits. Mr. Marshall contends that because HHS conceded (1) that it violated his veterans' preference rights and (2) that it would have selected him for the Budget Analyst position but for this violation, the MSPB should have awarded compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by Mr. Marshall. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3330c states that the MSPB "shall order the agency to comply with [the violated] provisions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c. The MSPB interpreted this language as requiring HHS to reconstruct the selection process. Although reconstruction may be an appropriate way to comply in situations where it is unknown whether a veteran would have been selected for a position, the record here is clear regarding what would have occurred absent the violation. HHS would have selected Mr. Marshall for the Budget Analyst position. Thus, there is no need for a manufactured reconstruction process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, HHS's purported reconstruction of the selection process resulted in a determination that HHS would have made no selection from the reconstructed certificate of eligibles and would have cancelled the vacancy announcement. This manufactured result has no basis in reality. Reconstruction seeks to determine whether the agency would have selected the veteran at the time of the original selection process; reconstruction does not allow an agency to conduct a new selection process under new circumstances. The agency admitted that it would have hired Mr. Marshall and that it did, in fact, fill the Budget Analyst position. If the agency complied with the statutory provisions in this case, Mr. Marshall would have been awarded this job. The offer of a different position "somewhere in Budget Execution...at some division...that could be anywhere across [Atlanta] " cannot adequately remedy Mr. Marshall. We therefore hold that the appropriate remedy is for Mr. Marshall to be placed in the job for which he applied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that in some cases appointment to the position at issue may not be possible because the particular position may have substantially changed or may no longer exist. On this point, our decision in <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts,</span> 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984), is instructive. <span class="Italic">See also Wainwright v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 28 Fed. Appx. 952 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 10, 2002) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (unpublished) (applying <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>). In <span class="Italic">Kerr,</span> following an MSPB reinstatement order, Mr. Kerr alleged that the agency reinstated him to a "sham position" because the agency "shifted all the duties and responsibilities of his previously held position to another position." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 731-32. The MSPB held that the agency complied with the reinstatement order because "[a]bsent a reduction in grade or pay, a reassignment of positions or duties is not an action appealable to the Board." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 732 (alteration in original). We vacated this portion of the MSPB's decision and instructed the MSPB to "make a substantive assessment of whether the actual duties and responsibilities to which the employee was returned are either the same as or substantially equivalent in scope and status to the duties and responsibilities held prior to the wrongful discharge." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 733. In doing so, we explained that the injured party should be placed "as near[ ] as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante.</span>" <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the facts of this case, &#x00A7; 3330c requires that Mr. Marshall be offered the Budget Analyst position for which he applied. The government has acknowledged that the position continues to exist (Ms. Beach was doing the job); hence the appropriate remedy is for Mr. Marshall to be awarded this position. The fact that the agency filled the position with another employee in violation of the VEOA preferences is not an adequate reason to force the aggrieved veteran into a different position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Marshall is entitled to compensation for any loss of wages or benefits that he suffered by reason of HHS's VEOA violation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c. Compliance with veterans' preference rights in this case would have resulted in Mr. Marshall's selection for this Budget Analyst job. Mr. Marshall accepted a lower-grade position with the U.S. Coast Guard. The mere fact that he was employed by the federal government during the relevant time period does not prevent him from obtaining the lost wages or benefits to which he is entitled. It is undisputed that the position Mr. Marshall accepted with the U.S. Coast Guard was a lower-grade position. Mr. Marshall is therefore entitled to the difference between the pay and benefits he would have been earning in the Budget Analyst job and those he received in the U.S. Coast Guard job. Mr. Marshall is not to be penalized for mitigating the government's damages by maintaining employment during the relevant time period. Mr. Marshall is entitled to the lost wages or benefits pursuant to &#x00A7; 3330c from the June 2004 selection date that violated his veterans' preference rights until such time as he is placed in the position at issue or declines the position at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, HHS argues that Mr. Marshall has waived any argument regarding whether its VEOA violation was willful, which would entitle Mr. Marshall to liquidated damages under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c. Notably, HHS cites the following language from the AJ's May 10, 2007 initial decision ordering reinstatement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the appellant believes he is entitled to liquidated damages, he may petition for damages in accordance with the instructions below. However, the appellant has not shown that the failure to afford the appellant his preference rights was willful. Indeed, it appears that the only reason that the appellant was passed over for the position was because the agency mistakenly believed that he was no longer interested in the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Marshall I</span>. According to HHS, Mr. Marshall waived any argument regarding willfulness when he "failed to appeal the Board's May 2007 decision finding that he had not shown that the agency's failure to afford him his VEOA rights was willful." Mr. Marshall responds that, among other things, (1) the MSPB vacated the damages portion of the initial decision when it ordered reconstruction rather than reinstatement and (2) the MSPB explicitly contemplated that liquidated damages might be available. <span class="Italic">See Marshall II,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. at 246.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Marshall continually raised the issue of willfulness throughout this case. Without commenting on the merits of his claim, we conclude that Mr. Marshall is not precluded on remand from renewing his claim that HHS's VEOA violation i.e., the initial passover was willful. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c, "[i]f the [MSPB] determines that such violation was willful, it shall award an amount equal to backpay as liquidated damages." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the MSPB abused its discretion in dismissing Mr. Marshall's petition for enforcement because the MSPB's decision was based on an erroneous interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c. When an agency violates a veteran's preference rights during selection in the competitive service and when it is undisputed that the agency would have selected the veteran for the position sought but for the violation, &#x00A7; 3330c requires the agency to offer the same or, as near as possible, a substantially equivalent position to the veteran. Under &#x00A7; 3330c, the veteran is also entitled to receive compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by reason of the veterans' preference rights violation involved. Accordingly, the final decision of the MSPB is REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marshall v. DHHS</span>, 110 MSPR 114, 2008 MSPB 215 (2008) (following the reconstruction order<span class="Italic">,</span> including removal of the incumbent from the position before the selection was rerun), following remand, <span class="Italic">Marshall v. DHHS,</span> 111 MSPR 1, 3 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4, 2008 MSPB 245 (2008) (agency canceled the appointment of the initial selectee and stated it was not going to make any selection for the position; "an agency's decision not to fill a position does not violate the veteran's VEOA rights).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But in <span class="Italic">Jones v. DHHS</span>, 542 Fed. Appx. 912, 917 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP), the court <span id="Page_735"></span>declined to upset a reconstruction affirmed by the Board and the court gave considerable deference to the efforts of management to reconstruct the selection:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[T]here is a presumption that public officers perform their duties correctly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with law and governing regulations and the burden is on the plaintiff to prove otherwise." <span class="Italic">Haley v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 977 F.2d 553, 558 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). "[A]challenger seeking to prove that a government official acted in bad faith in the discharge of his or her duties must show a specific intent to injure the plaintiff by clear and convincing evidence." <span class="Italic">Rd. &#x0026; Highway Builders, LLC v. United States</span>, 702 F.3d 1365, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). We see no error in the Board's determination that there is insufficient evidence to overcome this presumption to show that the Department's personnel engaged in wrongful conduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marshall</span> was distinguished from the facts of <span class="Italic">Gingery v. DOD,</span> CH-3330-08-0695-I-3 (NP 4/27/2011), the Board concluding that there was a factual dispute over whether the appellant would have been selected for a position, meaning that a reconstruction remedy was appropriate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision in this Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA) appeal granted the appellant's request for corrective action and ordered the agency to reconstruct the hiring process. On review, the appellant asserts that the appropriate remedy in this case is his placement in the position for which he applied. Generally, the proper remedy for veterans' preference violations is to order the agency to comply with the violated provisions of the statute by reconstructing the hiring process for the position in question. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 44-46 (2005). In <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 587 F.3d 1310, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2009), however, the Federal Circuit held that when an agency violates a veteran's preference rights during selection in the competitive service and when it is undisputed that the agency would have selected the veteran for the position sought but for the violation, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c requires the agency to offer the veteran the same--or, as near as possible, a substantially equivalent--position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Marshall</span>, the agency conceded that: (1) it violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights when it selected a non-veteran over the appellant without obtaining approval from the Office of Personnel Management for passing over the appellant under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1); and (2) it would have selected the appellant for the position at issue but for this violation or had it not erroneously removed his name from the list of candidates. <span class="Italic">Marshall</span>, 587 F.3d at 1316. By contrast, the agency in this case does not concede that it violated VEOA, nor is it clear from the record that the agency would have hired the appellant but for the VEOA violation. In that regard, we note that the agency official who interviewed the appellant for the Auditor position for which he applied under NER-08-03, recommended against hiring the appellant based on his resume, interview, and employment reference checks. In particular, he questioned the appellant's employment history, specifically his terminations from other permanent public accounting positions and failure to obtain a permanent position when he was hired into a Temporary Position that had the potential to turn permanent. He also noted that the appellant's employment references did not provide any positive comments about the appellant's work performance. Thus, it is unknown whether the appellant would have been selected for the position if the proper procedures had been followed. Consequently, the appropriate remedy in this case is reconstruction of the selection process for the position in question.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reconstruction process requires removal of incumbents from the contested positions (not necessarily firing them) and the process also requires an actual (rather than hypothetical) selection process--as it is reconstituted--to ensure competitors are evaluated under equivalent conditions, the situation addressed in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 114 MSPR 19, 25-29 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-22, 2010 MSPB 75 (2010), when selecting officials and selection board members had to be replaced:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the vacancy was announced under merit promotion procedures, preference eligibles or veterans, like the appellant, "may not be denied the <span class="Italic">opportunity to compete</span> for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) (emphasis supplied). For the following reasons, we are not persuaded that the appellant was given an opportunity to compete, consistent with VEOA, during the reconstructed selection process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the agency did not remove the original selectees from their respective GS-7 police officer positions during the reconstructed selection process. When questioned about why he did not remove the original selectees from their positions during the reconstructed selection process, Commander Quick explained that he was not instructed to fire any of the selectees. In <span class="Italic">Weed v. Social Security Administration,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 10 (2009), the Board recently addressed a situation where the agency "engaged in a 'hypothetical' [reconstructed selection] process" because it "did not make real selections for the Social Insurance Specialist Claims Representative [SISCR] position" and that "one of the two individuals appointed to the [SISCR] position by the agency remains in the position." There, the Board addressed the agency's argument that it was not required to remove other employees whose appointments violated VEOA because to do so would violate, among other things, the selected employees' due process rights.<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 13. The Board reiterated the rule that, in a reconstructed selection process, "an agency must remove the improperly appointed incumbent from the position." <span class="Italic">Id. (citing Marshall v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 114, &#x00B6; 8 (2008)); <span class="Italic">Endres,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 455, &#x00B6; 20. The Board also advised the agency that it "need not remove the individual from the federal service, but need only remove the individual from the position he or she holds as the result of the improper appointment." <span class="Italic">Weed,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 13. Because the Board concluded that the agency did not properly reconstruct the selection process, it ordered the agency to reconstruct the selection process again. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the CID, the administrative judge determined that, "[s]ince these officers were not unlawfully selected in violation of the Office of Personnel Management's pass over regulations, as occurred in <span class="Italic">Endres</span>..., the agency was under no obligation to remove the selectees in order to fairly consider the appellant. We do not agree with the administrative judge's narrow interpretation of this issue. The agency's obligation to remove the selectees during a reconstructed selection process is not triggered by the pass over requirements identified in the relevant statutes or regulations, but rather, by the Board's order to reconstruct the selection process consistent with applicable law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Weed,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 9 ("The Board has also held that reconstructing the selection process requires removing from the position any individual improperly appointed to the position at issue.") (internal citations omitted); <span class="Italic">Dow v. General Services Administration,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 342, &#x00B6; 10 (2008) ("Here, the agency has provided no evidence that it has removed individuals selected from the [Outstanding Scholar Program] to fill the [Chief People Officer] Intern positions. Thus, the agency is still in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b).").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of this precedent, we similarly conclude that the agency's reconstructed process in this matter was hypothetical, and therefore violated the appellant's right to compete under merit promotion procedures, because it did not remove the original selectees from the GS-7 police officer positions. As noted in <span class="Italic">Weed,</span> Commander Quick (or the selecting official) need not fire the original selectees; however, the original selectees must be removed from the GS-7 positions to which they were improperly appointed and reassigned to another position in order to comply with VEOA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the members of the reconstructed selection board were not the original selection board members. Moreover, it does not appear that any members of the reconstructed selection board discussed the original selectees' interviews with any of the original selection board members, that the original selectees were re-interviewed by the reconstructed selection board or that the original selectees' scores or score sheets, based on their responses to the interview questions, were compared to the appellant's score or score sheet during the reconstructed selection process. Because Commander Quick did not have comparable assessments of the original selectees before him during the reconstructed selection process, we cannot conclude that the appellant actually competed with the original selectees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, it is unclear from the record how many GS-7 positions were originally filled under the relevant vacancy announcement. While the agency contends it was two, the appellant asserts nine positions were filled. The record evidence does not resolve this issue to our satisfaction. In order to properly reconstruct the hiring process, the agency must rely on the circumstances at the time of the original selections, including filling the same number of positions during the reconstructed process as it did in the original one. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 10 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we conclude that the appellant was not given an opportunity to compete, consistent with VEOA, for the GS-7 police officer positions during the reconstructed selection process. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission,</span> 505 F.3d 1380, 1383-84 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding that an individual's rights under VEOA were not violated because he was "given a full 'opportunity to compete' in the merit selection process by which the appointment was made," i.e., he submitted an application, he was one of four applicants who qualified for final consideration, and he and the other three applicants were interviewed before a final selection was made; his subsequent nonselection did not mean that he did not have a "full 'opportunity to compete'").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Relief</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual, like the appellant, whose right to compete under merit promotion procedures has been violated, is not normally "automatically" entitled to the position for which he applied. <span class="Italic">Deems v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 17 (2005); <span class="Italic">but see Marshall v. Department of <span id="Page_736"></span>Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 587 F.3d 1310, 1316-17 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (where the record is clear that the appellant would have been selected absent the veterans' preference violation, the appropriate remedy is to place the appellant in the position for which he applied). Rather, in light of our expressed concerns, the appropriate remedy is for the agency to reconstruct the selection process, so that he has a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> opportunity to compete. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a) (the Board "shall order the agency to comply with" veterans' preference statutes and regulations); <span class="Italic">see also Marshall,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 114, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Dow,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 342, &#x00B6; 16; <span class="Italic">Endres,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 455, &#x00B6; 20. This time, however, we are including specific instructions to the agency, so that it understands our expectations regarding the reconstructed selection process. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Williams,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 17 (directing the agency to comply with several instructions); <span class="Italic">Dow,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 342, &#x00B6; 16 (setting forth requirements for the agency's second reconstructed selection process); <span class="Italic">Endres,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 455, &#x00B6; 20 (ordering the agency to reconstruct the selection process for the Chief Financial Officer position with specific instructions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Order</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of the deficiencies in the agency's reconstructed selection process, we ORDER the agency to provide a list of the names of the candidates originally selected for the GS-7 police officer positions since July 30, 2007, at the Dahlgren location under vacancy announcements DON0083. We further ORDER the agency to reconstruct the selection process for these positions, in accordance with this Opinion and Order and with VEOA, by following these instructions: (1) the agency must remove as selectees all individuals originally selected for the GS-7 police officer positions in question; (2) the agency shall compare the resumes of the original selectees with the appellant's resume; (3) the agency shall ensure that the appellant was asked the same interview questions as the original selectees; (4) the agency shall compare the original selectees' responses to the selection board's interview questions (and scores) with the appellant's responses to the selection board's questions (and score) or it must re-interview all of the original selectees as well as the appellant; (5) the agency must identify all candidates selected for the positions in the reconstructed selection process; and (6) if the agency does not select the appellant for a GS-7 police officer position in its next reconstructed selection process, it must provide an explanation for his nonselection and evidence showing that its reconstruction process was done correctly.

<p class="Body-Text">Of an argument that removal of an incumbent from a position entails a deprivation of the incumbent's due process rights, the Board determined in <span class="Italic">Weed v. SSA</span>, 110 MSPR 468, 473-74 &#x00B6; 13, 2009 MSPB 17 (2009) (<span class="Italic">following remand,</span> <span class="Italic">Weed v. SSA</span>, 111 MSPR 450, 2009 MSPB 108 (2009) (agency in compliance: the individuals selected for the positions would have accepted the positions at the time of the agency's original selection, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Weed v. SSA</span>, 367 Fed. Appx. 144 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) (no reversible error in the agency's reconstruction process as reviewed in 2009 MSPB 108)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that VEOA does not require the agency to remove other employees who were appointed in violation of law and regulation. In this regard, the agency argues that such a removal would violate due process and the provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 that an adverse action may only be taken for "such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." The agency attempts to distinguish this case, where the appellant was fifth on a list of eligibles seeking two positions, from the facts in <span class="Italic">Dow</span> and <span class="Italic">Endres</span> where the aggrieved individual was the highest rated veteran on the list of eligibles seeking a single position. We fail to see the distinction and note that the Board has repeatedly held that, as part of the reconstruction process, an agency must remove the improperly appointed incumbent from the position. <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 114, &#x00B6; 8 (2008); <span class="Italic">Endres</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 455, &#x00B6; 20. Contrary to the agency's assertion, however, the agency need not remove the individual from the federal service, but need only remove the individual from the position he or she holds as the result of the improper appointment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency satisfies a reconstruction requirement if, following its internal reconstruction processes, it offers the sought-after job to the appellant, with back pay, but subject to the appellant's ability to obtain a required security clearance and to clear a background check, <span class="Italic">Gingery v. DOD</span>, CH-3330-08-0695-X-1 (NP 5/24/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, as noted above, the agency has submitted evidence that eligibility for a security clearance was a requirement of the Auditor position at the time the appellant would have been selected and that it has remained a requirement of the position continuously since that time. The competitive service vacancy announcements under which the appellant was selected both state that completion of a security investigation is a key requirement. While the appellant argues that the language of the agency's letter offering him the position suggests that an Auditor's need for such a clearance may depend on circumstances, he acknowledges that a security background check is required. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the agency has properly made its offer of the position contingent on the appellant's ability to show eligibility for a security clearance. Accordingly, we find that the agency is in compliance with the Board's order to reconstruct the selection process and dismiss the appellant's petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dow v. GSA</span>, 109 MSPR 342, 347-48 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13, 2008 MSPB 155 (2008), remanded for further agency action relative to compliance with a finding of a VEOA violation involving the Outstanding Scholar Program. The Board determined that reconstruction of the hiring process for an intern position required placing all OSP candidates behind any preference eligible candidates on the list. OPM passover authority could be requested, but the agency was required to demonstrate OPM approval for a passover in favor of a particular candidate. The Board did not penalize the agency when it had destroyed some of its records involving the selection process in accordance with its document destruction schedule, for a "presumption of regularity" attached to the agency's actions. In continuing enforcement proceedings, reported in <span class="Italic">Dow v. GSA</span>, 110 MSPR 215, 217-18 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 2008 MSPB 226 (2008), the Board noted that reconstruction of a selection need not require that the appellant, or anyone else, be selected for a position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the Board's Opinion and Order, the agency submitted evidence and argument stating that it has complied with the Board's instructions. Specifically, the agency submitted evidence that the CPO Intern position is no longer encumbered by any person from OSP, or by anyone else. Moreover, the agency submitted a reconstructed "certificate of eligibles" which includes the appellant's name appearing at the top of the certificate. Finally, the agency submitted its request to OPM to pass over the appellant, its notice to the appellant of its request to OPM, and the appellant's response, by his attorney, to the agency request to pass over him. The appellant replied to the agency's response disagreeing that the agency is in compliance with the Board's order because "[t]he agency has failed to designate a selectee."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under VEOA, the agency must fully comply with the violated provisions of the statute or statutes relating to veterans' preference in the selection process to restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">See Lodge v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16 (2007). In this regard, although VEOA gives veterans the right to compete for positions in the Federal government, it does not ensure that the veteran's application will be successful. <span class="Italic">See Abell v. Department of the Navy,</span> 343 F.3d 1378, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2003). In other words, neither VEOA nor OPM's regulations require the agency to select an individual for a vacancy. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1384. The Board therefore rejects the appellant's argument that the agency has not complied with the Board's order because the agency has not designated a selectee for the CPO Intern position. Instead, we find that the agency has now complied with the Board's order allowing the appellant to fairly compete for the CPO Intern position in accordance with VEOA and OPM's regulations. As ordered by the Board, the agency has submitted evidence of the following: (1) there are no selectees (including candidates from the OSP certificate) in the CPO Intern position; (2) the agency reconstructed its certificate of eligibles containing at least three names for possible appointment; and (3) the agency has requested OPM approval to pass over the appellant and has given him the opportunity to respond to its request. The agency also indicated that it sent OPM a copy of the Board's underlying decision in this case. Therefore, the Board finds that the agency's selection process is now consistent with VEOA and is in compliance with the Board's orders, and we dismiss the appellant's petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See Endres v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 3.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mr. Dow took his case to court and the parties jointly requested a remand from the Federal Circuit and the case returned to the Board for additional consideration of the remedy. By then the agency made Dow an offer of a tentative position pending pre-employment requirements involving a security background investigation. However, the position ceased to exist by the time of the Board enforcement decision, although the date that the position ceased was not in the record. After the case was again considered by the AJ, the Board concluded, on consideration of the AJ's recommendation of a finding of noncompliance, that the agency should offer the position to Mr. Dow retroactively, through the date the position ceased to exist. The Board directed that the agency further clarify the requirement of a background investigation for the internship job that was at issue. Further adjudication was directed as to entitlement of Mr. Dow to liquidated damages. <span class="Italic">Dow v. GSA</span>, 116 MSPR 369, 2011 MSPB 51 (2011) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Dow v. GSA</span>, 117 MSPR 616, 2012 MSPB 22 (2012)).
