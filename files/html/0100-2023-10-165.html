<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-165"><span class="space">e.</span> Remarks About Counsel, Party, Merits, Settlement; Remarks During Hearing; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Ex Parte</span></span> Communication</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bieber v. Dept. of Army</span>, 287 F.3d 1358, 1361-63 (Fed. Cir. 2002), emphasized that a showing of "deep-seated antagonism," not only proof of injudicious remarks, is necessary to demonstrate bias through the AJ's remarks concerning a party or the party's counsel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the course of the hearing, the administrative judge denigrated Bieber's concerns (for example, stating that "I really think what people wear to work is no concern of their fellow employees," and asking "[b]ut why...didn't Mr. Bieber just shut up?," and repeatedly stated that he could not understand why Bieber "continued to be obsessed with [the dress code issue]." The administrative judge went so far as to state that Bieber's frequent berating of his coworkers regarding their clothing "defies civility to me."[1] Bieber did not file a motion to recuse the administrative judge, and complains of bias for the first time on appeal to this court from the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The administrative judge further stated: "I'm really groping to understand why you behaved as you did and I'm not hearing anything"; asked "[w]hat difference does it make to you what other people are wearing? What earthly difference, Mr. Bieber?"; and warned Bieber that "[y]ou're losing it."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bieber argues that this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Grubka v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 858 F.2d 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), requires that we reverse because administrative judge's conduct violated Bieber's right to due process and "a meaningful opportunity to be heard." The requirements of due process, of course, apply to administrative proceedings. <span class="Italic">Utica Packing Co. v. Block</span>, 781 F.2d 71, 77 (6th Cir. 1986). In <span class="Italic">Grubka</span>, we reversed the Board's decision sustaining the Internal Revenue Service's demotion of petitioner Grubka as not supported by substantial evidence. We found that the administrative judge demonstrated "undeniable bias" against Grubka by commenting that "[a]fter going too far, [Grubka] was caught," meaning apparently caught engaging in misconduct. <span class="Italic">Grubka</span>, 858 F.2d at 1574. We noted that "this statement...shows undeniable bias on the part of the [administrative judge] against Grubka, and makes the [administrative judge] partisan against Grubka when he should have been neutral and nonpartisan," and that "[t]his statement tainted [the administrative judge's] decision on credibility in this [misconduct] charge, as well as in all of the other charges in this case," thereby depriving Grubka of due process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1575. Rather than remanding for a new trial, however, the court simply reversed the Board and remanded with instructions to restore Grubka to his former position, because it found that there was no record evidence of impropriety to sustain the demotion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1576-77.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here some of the administrative judge's comments during the November 9, 1999, hearing might well fall within the <span class="Italic">Grubka</span> standard. We do not condone the remarks of the administrative judge. While the majority of the administrative judge's actions of which appellant complains constituted routine trial management, some of the administrative judge's remarks were plainly inappropriate. Nonetheless, we conclude that the due process aspect of <span class="Italic">Grubka</span>, which was <span class="Italic">dictum</span> in any event, is no longer good law in light of the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in <span class="Italic">Liteky v. United States</span>, 510 U.S. 540, 114 S. Ct. 1147, 127 L. Ed.2d 474 (1994), decided six years after <span class="Italic">Grubka</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Liteky</span>, the Supreme Court recognized that a showing of "deep-seated...antagonism" toward a party is necessary for a successful bias or partiality motion under the federal judicial recusal statute, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 455 (1994), where the motion is based on the judge's conduct in the course of the proceeding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[O]pinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion <span class="Italic">unless they display</span> <span class="Italic">a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment</span> <span class="Italic">impossible</span>. Thus, judicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge. They <span class="Italic">may</span> do so if they reveal an opinion that derives from an extrajudicial source; and they <span class="Italic">will</span> do so if they reveal such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, <span class="Italic">Liteky</span> concerned judicial bias in the context of recusal, and here neither the federal judicial recusal statute nor the recusal statute specifically governing administrative judges, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 556(b), applies because Bieber does not seek the administrative judge's recusal, but rather seeks a new hearing. Nonetheless, we think that the same standard, requiring a showing of "a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible," must govern in both contexts. Other courts of appeals have applied <span class="Italic">Liteky</span> outside of the recusal context, where a party seeks a new trial on the ground that the judge's bias in the course of the proceedings deprived that party of a fair trial. In <span class="Italic">United States v. Donato</span>, 99 F.3d 426 (D.C. Cir. 1996), the District of Columbia Circuit applied <span class="Italic">Liteky</span> to reverse defendant's conviction and remand for a new trial where the district judge's conduct "crossed [the <span class="Italic">Liteky</span>] threshold" in that the district court judge's "hostility" to defendant and her counsel "reveal[ed] such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 435 (quoting <span class="Italic">Liteky</span>, 510 U.S. at 555, 114 S. Ct. 1147*). The court noted that the district judge's degrading comments to defendant and near-constant criticism of her attorney "raise in us a serious doubt as to whether this defendant received a fair trial." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 438. The court reversed defendant's conviction and reassigned the case to a different judge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 439.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Logue v. Dore</span>, 103 F.3d 1040, 1045 (1st Cir. 1997), the First Circuit applied <span class="Italic">Liteky</span> in finding that plaintiff-appellant failed to establish that the judge's comments during trial deprived him of an impartial trial where plaintiff-appellant contended that the judge interjected hostile questions during his testimony, and treated defendant's testimony "solicitously." Citing <span class="Italic">Liteky</span>, the court found that the judge's comments indicated "no more than that [the judge] had grave doubts [about] Logue's credibility," and that "the mere fact that the judge voices his opinion out of the presence of the jury does not irretrievably taint the trial." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1046. The court further cited <span class="Italic">Liteky</span> in holding that the judge's "mid-trial remarks critical of counsel are insufficient to sustain a claim of judicial bias or partiality <span id="Page_1442"></span>against the client," and further stated that the judge's statements made in the jury's presence "did not compromise the fundamental fairness of the proceedings," in that a judge's routine efforts at court administration do not evince bias or partiality. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1046.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although <span class="Italic">Donato</span> and <span class="Italic">Logue</span> involve the conduct of judges presiding over jury trials rather than bench trials, we think the same standard ought to apply regardless of whether the trier of fact is a jury or judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge's comments simply do not rise to the <span class="Italic">Liteky</span> threshold of evidencing "a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible." <span class="Italic">Liteky</span>, 510 U.S. at 555, 114 S. Ct. 1147. The administrative judge's comments in this case were in fact less objectionable than the judge's statements and conduct in <span class="Italic">Logue</span>, where the judge stated that "I totally disbelieve plaintiff in this case" and "I think he's an absolute and incorrigible liar." <span class="Italic">Logue</span>, 103 F.3d at 1046. The court in <span class="Italic">Logue</span> found that these comments did not violate due process under <span class="Italic">Liteky</span>. Likewise, the administrative judge's comments in this case, while in some instances inappropriate, do not violate due process under <span class="Italic">Liteky</span> and thus do not warrant a new hearing.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;...[N]othing we say here should be construed to deny the Board or this court the authority to order a case reassigned on remand if there is evident bias, even though it does not satisfy the <span class="Italic">Liteky</span> standard<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that he had several "<span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications" with the administrative judge prior to the hearing, during which the administrative judge lost his temper, pressured the appellant to accept a $20,000 settlement, hinted that he would not rule in the appellant's favor, and told the appellant that he did not care about the children being potentially hurt. The record reveals that the administrative judge indicated in his December 1, 2010 prehearing conference summary that "the parties agreed to waive the prohibition against <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications for purposes of further settlement discussions." Thus, we discern nothing improper in the mere fact that the administrative judge engaged in <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's additional assertions regarding the administrative judge essentially amount to a claim of bias. Even if the administrative judge made the comments attributed to him by the appellant, such statements are insufficient to establish bias because they fail to rise to the level of deep-seated and unequivocal antagonism that would render a fair hearing impossible. <span class="Italic">See Bieber v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Porzillo v. DHHS</span>, 369 Fed. Appx. 123, 129-30 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), rejected a suggestion of bias resulting from an AJ's hearing comments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Porzillo contends that the Board ignored the "favoritism demonstrated by the administrative judge to the agency and the continuous antagonism he demonstrated" toward her. She bases that assertion on several incidents, including the administrative judge's allegedly improper conduct in settlement discussions, his alleged reference to Ms. Porzillo as a "dry drunk," his reprimand of Ms. Porzillo for showing emotion during the hearing, and his reference to Jesus Christ in his opinion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to be entitled to a new hearing on the basis of bias, Ms. Porzillo must show that the administrative judge exhibited "a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible." <span class="Italic">Bieber v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 287 F.3d 1358, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002). "[J]udicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge. They <span class="Italic">may</span> do so if they reveal an opinion that derives from an extradministrative judicial source; and they <span class="Italic">will</span> do so if they reveal such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">None of Ms. Porzillo's evidence even remotely satisfies that standard. The administrative judge's involvement in the settlement discussions was not improper, and the administrative judge's statement that Ms. Porzillo faced the risk that she might "walk away with nothing" did not establish "a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible." <span class="Italic">See Atanus v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 434 F.3d 1324, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Nor is there any impropriety in the administrative judge's reference to the term "dry drunk." Ms. Porzillo initially introduced that term during the hearing, and the administrative judge used the term only in seeking clarification regarding its relevance, e.g., "Why do I need to know about a dry drunk?"; "it can only be relevant if [Dr. Presant] can state to me, with some specificity, that you were a dry drunk and that it did impair your ability[.] " Such use does not evidence antagonism or the potential for unfairness. The administrative judge's reprimand of Ms. Porzillo during the hearing likewise does not constitute reversible error. He merely reminded Ms. Porzillo to conduct herself in accordance with proper hearing decorum: "We have to not express any emotion or laughter or disappoint[ment] or crying.... I don't want [you] to...make faces at the witness...that's not fair." Such instructions were well within the administrative judge's authority in conducting the hearing, and he similarly admonished the agency's counsel later in the hearing. Finally, the administrative judge's reference to Jesus Christ in the opinion was in a quotation of Ms. Porzillo's e-mail message that accused Ms. Akel of lying. There was nothing improper in quoting the message, which was the subject of Charge 3 (failure to follow supervisory guidance); it does not in any way demonstrate bias against Ms. Porzillo. Having reviewed the hearing transcript in its entirety, we conclude that Ms. Porzillo's claims of bias or partiality on the part of the administrative judge are unsubstantiated and clearly do not constitute reversible error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Barnes v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 21, 24-25 (1991), noted prehearing commentary by an AJ concerning the merits of appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In making a claim of bias or prejudice against an administrative judge, a party must overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies administrative adjudicators. <span class="Italic">See Oliver</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of Transportation</span>, 1 MSPB 368, 1 MSPR 382, 386 (1980). We find that the appellant has failed to overcome that presumption here. Rather, upon careful review of the instances that, he asserts, demonstrate that the administrative judge was biased against him and predisposed to rule in favor of the agency, we find that the cited examples merely show that the administrative judge attempted to inform the parties of pertinent case law, and, generally, of the relative strengths, as he perceived them, of their positions on the issues. Such prehearing commentary is within the realm of the administrative judge's authority to "take all necessary action to avoid delay in all proceedings" under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41. Without more, it is insufficient to establish that the administrative judge was biased<span class="Italic">. See Barthel v. Department of the Army,</span> 38 MSPR 245, 250 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Comments by an AJ implying the adjudicator's position on a case before all the evidence was in did not demonstrate bias in <span class="Italic">Woo v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 317, 320-21 (1987), involving a challenge to an allegedly coerced settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the questioning of the appellant, the administrative judge requested that the appellant listen closely to the questions and answer the questions as asked without giving long explanations. In addition, after the presentation of testimony and evidence from both parties on the appellant's performance under critical elements one and two, the administrative judge commented that the parties had presented "sufficient" evidence on both critical elements, and that the appellant's representative should prepare to begin presentation of evidence on the appellant's affirmative defenses. At this time, the appellant's representative conceded to the administrative judge that the appellant's testimony with regard to the additional specifications of unsatisfactory performance would be essentially the same as his testimony already given.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, while the administrative judge's choice of words arguably may have been unfortunate, in effect, he was merely taking action to exclude the presentation of further evidence and testimony that had not been shown to be relevant, material, and nonrepetitious, as he is authorized to do by the Board's regulations<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(b); <span class="Italic">cf. Bethlehem Steel Co. v. National</span> <span class="Italic">Labor Relations Board,</span> 120 F.2d 641, 652 (D.C.

An administrative judge also is authorized to take all necessary action to avoid delay in the disposition of the proceeding, to conduct a fair and impartial hearing, and to raise the issue of settlement at any time. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)-(c).

<p class="Body-Text">A remark in an AJ's decision suggesting that he disbelieved union officials, leading to an unfair labor practice charge (apparently against the Board), did not serve to establish disqualifying bias by the AJ's part in a subsequent case involving the attorney who filed the ULP charge. There was no showing that there was bias in the latter case against either the appellant or the attorney. <span class="Italic">Washington v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">From its inception, the Board has had a regulation, originally interim in nature, at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.42 concerning the disqualification of its administrative judges, then called presiding officials, <span class="Italic">see</span> 44 Fed. Reg. 3949 (1979), and since the issuance of its final regulations, effective June 29, 1979, it has provided for such disqualification on the basis of bias. 44 Fed. Reg. 38,353 (1979). During that time, it has taken seriously the concerns of the parties who come before it and assert a claim that a particular judge should be disqualified on this basis; nonetheless, in accordance with judicial practice, it has consistently held that in making a claim of bias or prejudice against an administrative judge, a party must overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies all administrative adjudicators<span class="Italic">. In re King</span>, 1 MSPR 146, 151 (1979). There must be a substantial showing of bias to disqualify a hearing officer<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Oliver v. Department of Transportation</span>, 1 MSPR 382, 386 (1980), the Board first applied those holdings to its interlocutory review of the issue, and it has continued to apply that presumption in all cases to the present. Based on our review of the Board's own cases, relevant court decisions, and the provisions for disqualification applicable to the federal courts, codified at 28 USC &#x00A7; 455, we find no merit to the appellant's motion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no requirement that the Board be bound by the federal judicial rule, inasmuch as it is not a court, but it generally applies the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in cases involving discovery where such rules are analogous, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.72(a), and we see no reason not to look to the rule and case law arising from 28 USC &#x00A7; 455, where relevant, as well<span class="Italic">. But see United States v. Jordan</span>, 49 F.3d 152, 157 (5th Cir. 1995) ("[E]ach &#x00A7; 455(a) case is extremely fact intensive and fact bound, and must be judged on its unique facts and circumstances more than by comparisons to situations considered in prior jurisprudence"). We note that counsel cited that statute in moving for recusal. Pursuant to section 455,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Any judge, justice, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, counsel's motion is based solely on the fact that he and his law firm have filed and are pursuing a ULP charge against the administrative judge, at which he expects to be a witness. He has not, as the administrative judge stated, suggested that he has ruled improperly against the instant appellant, or even that he holds any animosity toward him. Nor has he asserted that any statement or action by the judge in this or other cases indicates any degree of animosity against him, his law firm, or its representation of appellants in general. It is true that relationship to a party's attorney, not just to the party, has been specified as a basis for disqualification since 1948, <span class="Italic">see</span> 28 USC &#x00A7; 455, Note; and we recognize that recusal was required in a case in which the appellant's liberty was then at stake before the judge, where the appellant was involved in an "extremely hostile relationship" with a long-standing close friend of the judge that resulted in "extensive" negative publicity<span class="Italic">. Jordan</span>, 49 F.3d at 157-58. None of those factors are present here, even remotely, however, and the vast majority of the case law has reached the opposite result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, in <span class="Italic">Yagman v. Republic Insurance</span>, 136 F.R.D. 652, 657 (C.D. Cal. 1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 987 F.2d 622 (9th Cir. 1993), where the Ninth Circuit had previously remanded to a different judge a motion filed by the same plaintiff, the court held that the prior disqualification was "isolated in time and circumstance to that case, and...does not suggest that forever there will be an appearance of impartiality [sic.]." Further, comments made only shortly before by the judge in a contempt proceeding unrelated to the case then under consideration, that counsel for the defense in both cases was "a disgrace to the profession" and that the judge did not want to see or hear from him again, were found insufficient to require recusal in the second case<span class="Italic">. United States v. Ahmed</span>, 788 F. Supp. 196, 200-04 (S.D.N.Y.), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 161 (2d Cir. 1992). As pointed out in that case; the courts have drawn a sharp distinction between alleged bias against a litigant and bias against his attorney, and recusal in the latter situation "is not warranted except in extreme or rare instances." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 202-03, relying for support on the decisions of several judicial circuits. Nor was recusal in the case then at bar found necessary despite the judge having previously recused himself from three cases involving the same counsel because of his feeling that he might be biased against him as a result of the attorney's unprofessional conduct, when there was no showing of bias against the appellant in the latter proceeding and no evidence of continuing bias against the attorney<span class="Italic">. Diversified Numismatics, Inc. v. City of Orlando</span>, 949 F.2d 382, 384-85 (11th Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even in a case where counsel and client both "indulged in unbridled attacks on the impartiality and integrity of the trial judge," filed a charge of conspiracy against him, and requested damages in excess of $15,000,000.00, trebled, as well as punitive damages, the same result obtained<span class="Italic">. Ely Valley Mines, Inc. v. Lee</span>, 385 F.2d 188, 190-91 (9th Cir. 1967). Without discussing the validity of the instant administrative judge's claim that a ULP charge against him for a finding made in the course of an adjudication is not viable, or his suggestion that counsel now before us is attempting to "judge-shop," we note that in support of its denial of the recusal motion in the <span class="Italic">Ely Valley</span> case, the Ninth Circuit pointed to the district judge's immunity from suit for his official actions, such as those cited by the plaintiffs in the conspiracy action, and to the rule that a separate lawsuit by a party cannot be brought for the purpose of disqualifying him<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 191.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the courts have consistently held that litigants are entitled to an unbiased judge, not one of their choosing, and that a "judge is as much obligated not to recuse himself when it is not called for as he is obliged to when it is." <span class="Italic">In re Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc</span>., 861 F.2d 13077 1312 (2d Cir. 1988). There, one of several reasons alleged in support of the recusal motion was that the judge had repeatedly made personal attacks on defense counsel's integrity. The court denied the motion, holding that generally, a determination of bias may not be based on conduct arising in a trial setting, and legal disagreements with counsel are not sufficient, since "bias against a lawyer, even if found to exist, without more, is not bias against his client." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1314. Alleged bias, even against the appellant personally, indicated by remarks at another trial, also have frequently been found not to suffice<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we find support for our conclusion in <span class="Italic">Liteky v. United States</span>, 114 <span id="Page_1443"></span>S. Ct. 1147, 1157 (1994). After tracing the history of 28 USC &#x00A7; 455 and analyzing whether a claim of bias must be based on extrajudicial conduct alone, the Court found no basis on which to require recusal in the case before it. Holding that judicial remarks (none of which, we reiterate, were asserted to be present in the instant appeal) "that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel...do not support a bias or partiality challenge. They may do so if they reveal an opinion that derives from an extrajudicial source; and they <span class="Italic">will</span> do so if they reveal such a high degree of favoritism as to make fair judgment impossible." (Emphasis in the original.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Arrayed against this body of law, we conclude that the appellant's motion must fail. In support, he relies on two district court opinions, <span class="Italic">Marshall v.

Tex. 1975), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Taylor v. Montgomery</span>, 539 F.2d 715 (7th Cir. 1976), and <span class="Italic">sub nom. Pilla v. American Bar Association</span>, 542 F.2d 56 (8th Cir. 1976). While the latter court held that a judge should be disqualified in a case in which he is also a defendant, it left it in the judge's sound discretion to determine the need for disqualification where he is only a defendant in a civil case brought by a party to a criminal case he is then hearing<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 482-83. And, in <span class="Italic">Marshall</span>, the court, in explaining her decision to exercise her discretion to grant recusal, pointed to counsel's contentions that he personally had been treated unfairly by the judge, attacked her abilities, and asserted that she was racially biased<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 630-31. Moreover, consistent with the rule that the facts of each case govern, she stated that her ruling was attributable to her feeling that counsel's remarks "could not be erased from the court's mind, nor soon forgotten," and not to "a single remark made by counsel zealously representing his client's cause," but to "the accumulation of derogatory remarks." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 633.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our view, nothing approaching circumstances that would require the administrative judge's recusal here has been presented to us. The bare claim asserted by the appellant at this early stage of the proceeding, that the judge may be biased by counsel's activity in a separate case, involving a different appellant and a different agency, unsupported by any hint that the judge acted or ruled inappropriately in this case or otherwise displayed any evidence of bias against the appellant or his counsel, is simply insufficient to rebut the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies this, and all, of the Board's administrative judges<span class="Italic">. See Oliver</span>, 1 MSPR at 386; <span class="Italic">King</span>, 1 MSPR at 151. We find, too, for the same reasons, that any risk of the appearance of a conflict of interest is not enough, alone, under these circumstances, to warrant a different result.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit was critical of comments in an AJ's initial decision, but the court declined to find bias in <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-2072.Opinion.12-26-2019.pdf">795 Fed. Appx. 834</a>, 839-40 (Fed. Cir. 2019 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Griffin argues that the Board abused its discretion by ignoring certain arguments and evidence, by considering evidence "outside the charge" of the decision, and by interpreting Navy requirements "against" Griffin's interests. For support, Griffin points to, among other things, the way AJ Clement characterized Griffin's assertions. Specifically, Griffin argues that the AJ "issued an intemperate opinion that largely denigrated SA Griffin and failed to adequately consider the essential legal issues germane to such an action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that AJ Clement described Griffin's arguments as "preposterous," "laughable," and "completely unconvincing." While we disagree that the Board decision is erroneous, we find the language unnecessary and bordering on disrespect, and contrary to the role of administrative judges as neutral arbiters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Judicial impartiality is a cornerstone of due process. M<span class="small">ODEL</span> C<span class="small">ODE OF</span> J<span class="small">UDICIAL CONDUCT</span> Canon 1 (Am. Bar Ass'n 2011). The rule of law depends on public confidence in the integrity and independence of those administering the law. <span class="Italic">See Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp.,</span> 486 U.S. 847, 864 (1988). The language used by AJ Clement has the potential of conveying to the public a lack of impartiality, a lack of open-mindedness, and a lack of reasoned decision-making. We caution AJ Clement and all other AJs to refrain from the use of such language in the future.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ did not display bias by stating that the appellant failed to present evidence in support of an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hutchcraft v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 60 MSPR 299, 303 (1994); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 10 MSPR 461, 464 (1982) (no bias by the AJ who stated that under the "old law" he would throw out the appellant's dismissal based upon the charges before any hearing would be held, but under the "new law" he must listen to the charges made by the agency). An AJ was not biased who called an appellant's representative incompetent and who told him that he was "bordering on the point of being totally absurd." The Board concluded there was considerable provocation on the part of the representative, and although the AJ's remarks were intemperate, the record as a whole demonstrated no bias in favor of the agency. Nevertheless, the Board suggested that the AJ, as the agent for the Board, is required to maintain a judicial temperament throughout the whole proceeding. <span class="Italic">Deleon v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 640, 643 n.2, 7 MSPB 471 (1981); <span class="Italic">see Tyler v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 545, 548 &#x00B6; 8 (2002) (bias was not shown when the "AJ may have become somewhat abrupt or impatient with the appellant, and even implied several times that the appellant was not telling the truth"); <span class="Italic">DeGraaff v. VA</span>, 73 MSPR 224, 228 (1997) ("Although it was inappropriate for the...judge to state...that the appellant was prevaricating, he apologized for his remark"; "While the administrative judge was somewhat short-tempered with the appellant's representative, this did not interfere with the development of evidence at the hearing."); <span class="Italic">Townsend v. USDA</span>, 14 MSPR 242, 244 (1982) (bias was not demonstrated by a remark from the AJ that he would not tolerate another outburst from the appellant's counsel).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Personal bias was not demonstrated by "the administrative judge's mere expression of her opinion that an agency official bears a resemblance to a film actor." <span class="Italic">Cotton v.

Dept. of Army</span>, 44 MSPR 688, 698 (1990) (reference in a decision to the appellant as a "gadfly" was made in reference to the appellant's reprisal allegations; the statement was not inherently biased). Unless there is a pattern of disrespect or disdain, an AJ's use of, or failure to use, an honorific in an initial decision is not evidence of bias. <span class="Italic">Hutchcraft v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 60 MSPR at 302.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegations of insulting behavior and "unbridled hatred" by an AJ toward the appellant's counsel are not enough to support a finding of bias. <span class="Italic">Fuhs v. USPS</span>, 22 MSPR 283, 285 (1984) (insufficient were allegations that the AJ exhibited disdain for the appellant's counsel through his credibility findings, and through the AJ's "biting his fingernails and refusing to look directly at the attorney"); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Herman v.

However, even assuming that he spoke in what might be called a "spiteful" manner, this would appear to be nothing more than a manifestation of his frustration with the breakdown of the settlement process, which the administrative judge attributed to the appellant's unreasonableness."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Nasuti v. Dept. of State</span>, 112 MSPR 587, 598 &#x00B6; 26, 2009 MSPB 218 (2009) (AJ did not exhibit bias by instructing the appellant to refrain from personal or argumentative statements against agency counsel or other persons; the admonition was within the AJ's discretion to maintain decorum during the proceedings); <span class="Italic">Simon v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 301, 302 (1985) (appellant failed to provide specific examples of the allegedly abusive, arrogant, and insulting conduct of the AJ).

<p class="Body-Text">An AJ's exhibition of dislike of an appellant's attorney was insufficient to overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies administrative adjudicators. <span class="Italic">Farris v.

The disinclination to accept ill-tempered remarks as evidence of bias was made clear in the performance-based removal case of <span class="Italic">Cleavenger v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">After the appellant's representative again requested a decision based on the written record, the administrative judge noted,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr. Beesley, I just want to note for the record that I am very disturbed about your tactic here this morning. This is not the first time that you have done this, and I think that is what is abusive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When asked by the appellant's representative whether he had engaged in some misconduct, the administrative judge indicated "[t]hat you would come down here, have everyone appear because you walked in the door this morning knowing that you were going to request a decision based on the record." The administrative judge noted that the appellant's representative had done this before, and that she found his conduct "highly inappropriate and very unprofessional." The administrative judge again informed the appellant's representative that she found it highly inappropriate and unprofessional because he "walked in here today knowing that you were going to request a decision based on the record." The administrative judge also informed the appellant's representative that he was being very discourteous in packing up his things while the hearing was still on the record and the parties were attempting to identify a date for final submissions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1444"></span>We also find that the administrative judge's comments regarding the unprofessional and disrespectful actions by the appellant's representative did not show bias, but were reasonable, appropriate responses to the actions of the appellant's representative and within the administrative judge's authority to control the proceedings. In making a claim of bias against an administrative judge a party must overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies administrative adjudicators<span class="Italic">. Oliver v. Department of Transportation</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 382, 386 (1980). An administrative judge's conduct during the course of a Board proceeding warrants a new adjudication only if her comments or actions evidence "a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible." <span class="Italic">Bieber v. Department of the Army</span>, 287 F.3d 1358, 1362-63 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (quoting <span class="Italic">Liteky v. United States</span>, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994)). Although the administrative judge may have become understandably frustrated with the appellant's representative under the circumstances described above, the appellant has not overcome the presumption of administrative judge honesty and integrity, nor has he established that the administrative judge showed a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible. <span class="Italic">See Liteky</span>, 510 U.S. at 555 ("judicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge"; "<span class="Italic">[n]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ot</span> establishing bias or partiality...are expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even anger, that are within the bounds of what imperfect men and women, even after having been confirmed as federal judges, sometimes display.") (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board, although not agreeing that the following statements were made by the AJ, nevertheless decided that they would not demonstrate bias, 29 MSPR at 230 n.1:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"These cases are almost impossible to defend."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"It isn't too important (as to whether additional evidence should be introduced by the agency) because you (meaning Management) have already offered considerable evidence in my judgment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"She is a GS-4 and she can't type and she can't file, that's why they didn't give her (another) job."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nettles v. Dept. of Army</span>, 52 MSPR 181, 185 (1991), reiterated the theme that, given the Board's policy of encouraging settlements, the Board will not find an AJ biased just because he encourages the parties to settle. <span class="Italic">Reape v. DHHS</span>, 41 MSPR 406, 409-10 (1989), did not credit a contention that an AJ was biased because the appellant apparently rejected overtures by the AJ to settle his case. The Board opined that "when an administrative judge encourages the parties to settle in appropriate cases, he is, in fact, advancing a legitimate purpose." It was added in <span class="Italic">Washington v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 278, 281 n.1 (1990), as to an appellant's allegation that "the administrative judge spent an inordinate amount of time trying to convince me to accept a cash settlement and drop all of my issues," that "[T]he administrative judge's conscientious attempt to settle this appeal is consistent with her responsibility under 5 CFR 1201.41(c), and does not demonstrate bias." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Dept. of Army</span>, 57 MSPR 124, 126-27 n.1 (1993), determined there was nothing improper in an AJ's attempt to point out weaknesses in an appeal to encourage a party to agree to a just and equitable settlement. [Refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-045.html#sec16-46">Coercion or Bias by Judge</a>," concerning coerced settlements.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 683, 686 (1989), the Board said of an AJ who was alleged to have become annoyed after the parties failed to settle a case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant states that the administrative judge, in attempting to settle the appeal, expressed his exasperation at the appellant's refusal to negotiate as to the back-pay amount and told him that he did not have a case, we find these allegations to be insufficient in this case to overcome the presumption of the administrative judge's honesty and integrity.[1] There is nothing improper in the administrative judge's making the parties aware of the perceived weaknesses of their cases in order to encourage them to agree to a just and equitable compromise of their differences....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We do not mean to suggest that such conduct may be appropriate in all cases, since our finding here is limited to a determination of whether the appellant established his showing of bias in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit did not fault an AJ's comments on the merits of an appeal during the course of settlement discussions, <span class="Italic">Porzillo v. DHHS</span>, 369 Fed. Appx. 123, 129 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Porzillo argues that the administrative judge improperly conducted <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> settlement discussions with the agency without her approval. Her allegations, however, are contradictory. She argues that she was "never given the opportunity to enter into [&#8197;] negotiations" with the agency, yet she concedes that she was offered (and declined) at least one settlement proposal. She further contends that the administrative judge "interfered and took over the negotiations," but also states that "there is no evidence that settlement negotiations actually took place." As support for her contention regarding the administrative judge's "interference," Ms. Porzillo references a voicemail message from the administrative judge, in which he allegedly "accused [her] of making 'demands" and stated that she was unlikely to prevail in her case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The voicemail message and Ms. Porzillo's own brief demonstrate that the administrative judge simply attempted to facilitate settlement discussions by conveying information from the agency to her. The voicemail message relays a settlement offer made by the agency. It also references the "letter and accompanying chart" that she sent to the agency, which listed the minimum amount that she insisted on to settle her appeal and indicated that "anything less than [that amount] is unacceptable." The administrative judge's message encouraged Ms. Porzillo to submit a more "reasonable" counteroffer and offered the administrative judge's "considered opinion," upon review of the full record, that there was a risk that she might "walk away with nothing" if the case went to a hearing. Ms. Porzillo ultimately rejected the agency's settlement offer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The recited evidence shows that Ms. Porzillo was able to participate meaningfully in settlement discussions with the agency. Contrary to Ms. Porzillo's contentions, nothing suggests that the administrative judge was negotiating unilaterally with the agency. The administrative judge served merely as a facilitator of communications between the parties, a role that is expressly permitted by the relevant regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(c)(1) ("The judge may initiate attempts to settle the appeal informally at any time.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 49 MSPR 442, 443-44 n.* (1991), reasserted that an AJ commits no error by informing the parties of the weaknesses in their cases and explaining what they must show to carry their respective burdens of production and proof. In an interesting turn of events, after stating during a prehearing conference that the agency's case was "flimsy," remarks that led to an unsuccessful motion by the agency to disqualify the AJ, the AJ sustained some of the agency's charges in his initial decision. The appellant then contended in his PFR that the agency representative's actions so intimidated the AJ that the AJ changed his opinion concerning the charges. The Board concluded that bias was not established because the AJ changed his assessment of the agency's charges after a full hearing on the merits of the appeal. The Board observed in <span class="Italic">Garst v. Dept. of Army</span>, 56 MSPR 371, 377 (1993), that it will "not infer bias based on an administrative judge's rulings on issues even when a party has filed a motion to disqualify the administrative judge."</p>
