<h3 class="h3" id="sec1-393"><span class="space">D.</span> ADJUDICATION STANDARDS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 731.201 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The standard for a suitability action defined in &#x00A7; 731.203 and taken against an applicant, appointee, or employee is that the action will protect the integrity or promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The efficiency of service standard in a suitability case is assessed by suitability criteria established at 5 CFR 731.202 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Criteria for making suitability determinations.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General</span>. OPM, or an agency to which OPM has delegated authority, must base its suitability determination on the presence or absence of one or more of the specific factors (charges) in paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Specific factors</span>. In determining whether a person is suitable for Federal employment, only the following factors will be considered a basis for finding a person unsuitable and taking a suitability action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Misconduct or negligence in employment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Criminal or dishonest conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Refusal to furnish testimony as required by &#x00A7; 5.4 of this chapter;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;Alcohol abuse, without evidence of substantial rehabilitation, of a nature and duration that suggests that the applicant or appointee would be prevented from performing the duties of the position in question, or would constitute a direct threat to the property or safety of the applicant or appointee or others;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;Illegal use of narcotics, drugs, or other controlled substances without evidence of substantial rehabilitation;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;Knowing and willful engagement in acts or activities designed to overthrow the U.S. Government by force; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(8)&#x2003;Any statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the lawful employment of the person involved in the position in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Additional considerations</span>. OPM and agencies must consider any of the following additional considerations to the extent OPM or the relevant agency, in its sole discretion, deems any of them pertinent to the individual case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The nature of the position for which the person is applying or in which the person is employed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The nature and seriousness of the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The circumstances surrounding the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;The recency of the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;The age of the person involved at the time of the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;Contributing societal conditions; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;The absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board adjudication standard is at 5 CFR 731.501 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board</span>. When OPM or an agency acting under delegated authority under this part takes a suitability action against a person, that person may appeal the action to the Merit Systems Protection Board (hereinafter "Board").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Decisions by the Merit Systems Protection Board.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;If the Board finds that one or more of the charges brought by OPM or an agency against the person is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, regardless of whether all specifications are sustained, it must affirm the suitability determination. The Board must consider the record as a whole and make a finding on each charge and specification in making its decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If the Board sustains fewer than all the charges, the Board must remand the case to OPM or the agency to determine whether the suitability action taken is appropriate based on the sustained charge(s). However, the agency must hold in abeyance a decision on remand until the person has exhausted all rights to seek review of the Board's decision, including court review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Once review is final, OPM or an agency will determine whether the action taken is appropriate based on the sustained charges and this determination will be final without any further appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To sustain its burden of proof in a negative suitability determination appeal, it must be shown that the appellant's conduct may reasonably be expected to interfere with or prevent efficient service in his position or effective accomplishment by the employing agency of its duties or responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Reed v. OPM</span>, 74 MSPR 616, 622 (1997). <span class="Italic">Mervar v. OPM</span>, 1 MSPR 309, 311 (1980), admonished that OPM must provide analysis demonstrating a reasonable relation between preemployment conduct and a negative suitability determination. An applicant for an air traffic controller position was unsuitable because he was dismissed from a position as an announcer with a radio station for an unsuitable broadcast. The Board reversed the negative suitability determination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(3) states that O.<span class="small">P.M.</span> shall consider "the circumstances surrounding the conduct." Just as individuals are apt to conduct themselves differently at wakes than they do at funerals, it follows that an employee's behavior as a disc jockey is not predictive of his behavior as an air traffic controller.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, OPM under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(2) is to consider "the nature and seriousness of the conduct." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(7) directing OPM to consider "the absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward rehabilitation" indicates that unfavorable suitability determinations are to be issued only for the most serious misconduct. It is difficult to envision rehabilitation from having played a "wolf howl." We consider the use of 5 CFR Part 731 in connection with misconduct so trivial to be an abuse of OPM's authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, because the OPM determination of unsuitability violates 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202(b) in its failure to consider the factors of seriousness and surrounding circumstances, we reverse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The determination that appellant is unsuitable for employment is hereby rescinded. OPM shall restore appellant to all appropriate Civil Service registers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board summarized the burden of proof in suitability determinations in <span class="Italic">O'Dell v. OPM</span>, 23 MSPR 297, 299 (1984), sustaining a determination of unsuitability as a result of disruptive conduct in prior federal employment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When rendering a negative suitability determination, OPM must show by a preponderance of the evidence a pattern of conduct which would be incompatible with successful performance in the position sought or would interfere with or prevent effective performance by the employing agency of its duties and responsibilities<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 731.202(a) (1983). <span class="Italic">See also Stewart v. OPM</span>, 7 MSPB 746, 747, 8 MSPR 289, 292-93 (1981). If OPM's decision is based on incidents of misconduct in prior employment, OPM must consider the recency and circumstances surrounding the conduct, as well as the absence or presence of efforts toward rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 731.202(c) (1983). The Board's review of suitability determinations is not restricted to the administrative record but is a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review. Thus, the Board may properly consider evidence relating to a period of time extending beyond the date of OPM's decision to disqualify an applicant<span class="Italic">. Stewart</span>, 7 MSPB at 748, 8 MSPR at 294.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Revisions in 2001 to regulations governing Board review of suitability determinations did not alter the Board's role of assessing the significance of charges or their nexus to the appellant's ability to perform a job. Those regulations required, however, that the Board could not set aside a suitability determination as long as some charges are sustained, although a remand may be appropriate for reconsideration by the agency making the suitability determination of whether the same result should be reached if some charges are not sustained. Analysis of the 2001 regulation was provided by <span class="Italic">Folio v. DHS,</span> <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1283863.html">402 F.3d 1350</a>, 1353-56 (Fed. Cir. 2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue before us is the scope of the Board's review of an agency's suitability decision. The narrower issue as to whether the Board correctly upheld the sole charge is not contested on appeal. As to the broader issue, we are persuaded that the Board's review of a suitability decision includes an evaluation of all of the criteria set forth in &#x00A7; 731.202, but not the ultimate action taken by the agency. We therefore agree with the <span id="Page_783"></span>parties on this point, and we accordingly vacate the decision of the Board and remand for it to consider all of the factors and considerations bearing on suitability set forth in &#x00A7; 731.202.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The jurisdiction of the Board is not plenary, but is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Fernandez v. Dep't of Army</span>, 234 F.3d 553, 555 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Section 731.501 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations pertains to appeals of agency suitability determinations to the Board and sets out that jurisdiction. It provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual who has been found unsuitable for employment may appeal the determination to the Merit Systems Protection Board. If the Board finds that one or more charges are supported by a preponderance of the evidence, it shall affirm the determination. If the Board sustains fewer than all the charges, the Board shall remand the case to OPM or the agency to determine whether the action taken is still appropriate based on the sustained charge(s). This determination of whether the action taken is appropriate shall be final without any further appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated, the AJ found that this regulation precludes the Board from reviewing the "nexus" between any misconduct and the efficiency of the service. She believed that the Board could not reach the ultimate issue of unsuitability, including the nexus between the charge and the efficiency of the service. By nexus, it appears that the AJ was referring to the relationship between the "specific factors" set forth in &#x00A7; 731.202(b) and the "additional considerations" set forth in &#x00A7; 731.202(c). We conclude that both those factors and considerations are reviewable by the Board and that such review is within the constraints of &#x00A7; 731.501.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That section provides for an appeal of an unsuitability determination. Under &#x00A7; 731.202, such a determination is to be based on the specific factors and additional considerations listed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of that section. Section 731.202 reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003; General. In determining whether its action will protect the integrity or promote the efficiency of the service, OPM, or an agency to which OPM has delegated authority, shall make its determination on the basis of the specific factors in paragraph (b) of this section, with appropriate consideration given to the additional considerations outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003; Specific factors. When making a determination under paragraph (a) of this section, the following may be considered a basis for finding an individual unsuitable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Misconduct or negligence in employment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Criminal or dishonest conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;Material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;Refusal to furnish testimony as required by &#x00A7; 5.4 of this title;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(5)&#x2003;Alcohol abuse of a nature and duration which suggests that the applicant or appointee would be prevented from performing the duties of the position in question, or would constitute a direct threat to the property or safety of others;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(6)&#x2003;Illegal use of narcotics, drugs, or other controlled substances, without evidence of substantial rehabilitation;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(7)&#x2003;Knowing and willful engagement in acts or activities designed to overthrow the U.S. Government by force;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(8)&#x2003;Any statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the lawful employment of the person involved in the position in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003; Additional considerations. In making a determination under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, OPM and agencies shall consider the following additional considerations to the extent they deem them pertinent to the individual case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;The nature of the position for which the person is applying or in which the person is employed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;The nature and seriousness of the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;The circumstances surrounding the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;The recency of the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(5)&#x2003;The age of the person involved at the time of the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(6)&#x2003;Contributing societal conditions; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(7)&#x2003;The absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 731.501 further provides that an "action"[*] based on the determination shall be final without any further appeal to the Board. That preclusion, however, does not prevent the Board from considering the additional considerations that constitute the "nexus" between the specific factors of paragraph (b) and the additional considerations of paragraph (c). Section 731.202(a) expressly states that those specific factors and the additional considerations form the basis of the general determination whether the action will protect the integrity or promote the efficiency of the service. They are all reviewable by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003; The term "action" is defined by the regulations as "one or more of the following: (1) Cancellation of eligibility; (2) Denial of appointment; (3) Removal; (4) Cancellation of reinstatement eligibility; [and] (5) Debarment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(a) (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 731.501 directs that if "one or more charges" are supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the Board shall affirm the agency's determination of unsuitability. That regulation also provides that if the Board sustains "fewer than all the charges" of unsuitability, the Board shall remand the case for the agency to decide whether the "action" taken is still appropriate. These provisions merely indicate that support for any charge is sufficient to justify an affirmance of a determination of unsuitability, but that, if one or more charges is not sustained, a remand is necessary for review of the suitability of any action taken. They do not bear on the question whether the Board may go beyond review of specific charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's statements in response to public comments made in light of changes to its rule on personnel suitability support our interpretation of the regulation that the Board may consider all aspects of a suitability determination, except the actions taken pursuant to it. In that response, OPM stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The new regulation seeks to demarcate the differences between suitability actions and adverse actions so that no one will confuse them in the future. Specifically, the regulation is designed to clarify that the Board's role in reviewing OPM or agency unsuitability decisions always has been a limited one. <span class="Italic">The Board may determine only whether a charge of unsuitability is sustained by a preponderance of the evidence in accordance with the substantive standard set forth in section 731.202.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">65 Fed. Reg. 82239, 82243 (Dec. 28, 2000) (emphasis added). OPM's reference to &#x00A7; 731.202 indicates that the Board has a broader scope of review in suitability determinations than merely reviewing the facts underlying the charges. The regulation's reference to the Board's "limited" role relates only to its preclusion from reviewing any actions taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, it is important to note that the regulation at issue was promulgated by OPM and that Congress granted OPM the authority to define the scope of the Board's authority. The jurisdictional statute for the Board provides that "[a]n employee, or applicant for employment, may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule or <span class="Italic">regulation</span>." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) (2000) (emphasis added). Section 731.501 is such a regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We typically afford deference to OPM's interpretation of its own regulation, unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. <span class="Italic">See Bowles v. Seminole Rock &#x0026; Sand Co.</span>, 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945); <span class="Italic">James v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 372 F.3d 1365, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Here, OPM, joining in the brief before this court, has asserted that the Board's jurisdiction to review OPM's determination is broader than the Board claims. An agency seeking broader review by its reviewing entity is indeed entitled to special deference, especially when supported by a regulation. OPM's interpretation is also consistent with its own December 2000 commentary accompanying the promulgation of the new regulations and is in no way erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations. Even if OPM's interpretation had been expressed only in its brief in the instant case, it would nonetheless be entitled to some deference. <span class="Italic">See Auer v. Robbins</span>, 519 U.S. 452, 461-62 (1997). We give it deference here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we defer to OPM's interpretation of the regulation in question and vacate the Board's decision that its jurisdiction in unsuitability cases is limited to a review of the factual underpinnings of the allegations on which the unsuitability charges are based. We hold that &#x00A7; 731.501 provides the Board with jurisdiction to review all aspects of an unsuitability determination, including whether the charged conduct renders an individual unsuitable for the position in question. The Board is precluded only from reviewing or modifying the ultimate action taken, which is left to OPM or the appropriately delegated agency. Here, specifically, the AJ may consider on remand all aspects under &#x00A7; 731.202 of Folio's ability to perform as an Immigration Inspector in order to decide whether he is in fact unsuitable for that job. We thus vacate the Board's decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Folio v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 402 F.3d 1350, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the court held that, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501, the Board has jurisdiction to review all aspects of an unsuitability determination, including whether, based on the factors set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202, the charged conduct renders an individual unsuitable for the position in question. The court found further that, although section 731.501 "provides that an 'action' based on the determination shall be final without any further appeal to the Board," that preclusion "does not prevent the Board from considering the additional considerations that constitute the 'nexus' between the specific factors of paragraph (b) and the additional considerations of paragraph (c)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1354 (footnote omitted). Thus, the court concluded that the Board must consider the individual's ability to perform in the position in order to determine whether the individual is in fact unsuitable for that job and, in making such a nexus determination, all aspects under section 731.202 may be considered. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1356.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the AJ determined that OPM did not show a nexus between the appellant's conduct and her duties. In making this determination, the AJ noted that the appellant was not in law enforcement, there was no evidence that her use of marijuana had any impact on her ability to work as a Physical Scientist, and there was evidence that she was a valuable employee. OPM argues that the AJ erred in her nexus analysis because she considered only whether the appellant was able to perform the duties of her Physical Scientist position and not whether the appellant's removal would protect the integrity of the service. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.201, which sets forth the standard for suitability determinations, "an applicant, appointee, or employee may be denied Federal employment or removed from a position only when the action will protect the integrity or promote the efficiency of the service." OPM included the word "integrity" to clarify that integrity and honest conduct have always been an important part of the efficiency of the service standard, explaining as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The current efficiency of the service language might inadvertently lead some to believe that efficiency and effectiveness are limited to their dictionary definitions, namely, the capacity to produce desired results with a minimum expenditure of energy, time or money, or the ability to produce results. In fact, the efficiency of the service standard as used by OPM in a suitability context always has been a broader concept that involves, among other things, the integrity of the competitive examination system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">65 Fed. Reg. 82,239, 82,241 (Dec. 28, 2000). Thus, the AJ should have considered whether the appellant's removal would protect the integrity of the service. <span class="Italic">See also Ferguson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 9 (2005) (a suitability inquiry is directed toward whether the character or conduct of a candidate is such that employing him may have an impact on the integrity or efficiency of the service).<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, in making its suitability determination, OPM, or an agency with delegated authority, must consider the specific factors in paragraph (b) of section 731.202, which include the sustained charge in the instant appeal, with appropriate consideration given to the additional considerations outlined in paragraph (c) of that section. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(a)-(b). Those additional considerations, "to the extent they [are] deem[ed] pertinent to the individual case," are as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The nature of the position for which the person is applying or in which the person is employed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The nature and seriousness of the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The circumstances surrounding the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;The recency of the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;The age of the person involved at the time of the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;Contributing societal conditions; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;The absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As mentioned above, the AJ properly sustained the criminal or dishonest conduct charge against the appellant. We note that her conduct was serious; two of the three charges against her were felonies--possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance and possession with intent to manufacture or produce a controlled substance. As a Physical Scientist for OSHA, the appellant's duties included ensuring a safe work environment for employees. Her duties also included performing independent professional analysis of toxic materials in samples from the workplace, providing expert advice on sampling and analytical methods, and providing expert testimony during litigation. The appellant's credibility is therefore critical to her position. OPM points out that OSHA is a law enforcement agency responsible for public safety and that the public perception of the trustworthiness of its employees is integral to accomplishing OSHA's purpose. The Board has held that, in reviewing an applicant's suitability for employment, it is permissible for the agency to consider the public trust in the agency in expressing its own level of trust and confidence in the appellant. <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Resolution Trust Corp</span>., 66 M.S.P.R. 302, 311 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because the appellant engaged in criminal or dishonest conduct of a serious nature, and because her position requires credibility generally and is tied to the agency's interest in maintaining the public trust, we find that OPM established a nexus between the drug-related charges against the appellant and her position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Ferguson v. OPM</span>, 100 MSPR 347 (2005), the Board applied <span class="Italic">Folio</span> and made its own nexus determination concerning the appellant's ability to perform in a Border Patrol agent position and whether he was unsuitable for the position by reason charges proven by the agency. <span class="Italic">Leibowitz v. DOJ</span>, 88 MSPR 635, 638-40 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Leibowitz v. DOJ</span>, 41 Fed. Appx. 412 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP), provided an analysis of suitability adjudication factors concerning an individual who sought an INS job while he admitted to a violation of immigration laws concerning harboring of illegal aliens:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A suitability inquiry is directed toward whether the "character or conduct" of a candidate is such that employing him would adversely affect the efficiency of the service. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.101; <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of Justice,</span> 87 MSPR 518, 15 (2001). The agency makes its determination on the basis of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, whether the individual's conduct may reasonably be expected to interfere with, or prevent, efficient service in the position or effective accomplishment by the employing agency of its duties or responsibilities. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202(a); <span class="Italic">McClain v. Office of Personnel Manage</span>ment, 76 MSPR 230, 235 (1997). Among the specific factors that might be relied upon in rendering a negative suitability determination is criminal or dishonest conduct related to the duties to be assigned to the applicant or appointee, or to that person's service in the position or the service of other employees. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(2). Additional considerations include, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the kind of position for which the person is applying, including the degree of public trust or risk in the position; the nature and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the recency of the conduct; and the absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward rehabilitation. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge found, and the agency has not contested, that, during his previous INS tenure, the appellant received performance awards and above average supervisory reviews, had a superior attendance record, and was well-liked and respected as a hard-working officer. In addition, the administrative judge noted that the appellant had not been found guilty of criminal conduct. Moreover, the appellant stated that he told his brother-in-law that he must leave and that his brother-in-law has moved out.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in its decision letter, the agency noted that INS is charged with enforcing the laws against harboring illegal aliens and that the appellant's conduct directly conflicted with the agency's mission. It specifically stated that the DAO position requires frequent contact with aliens, some of whom may be in the country illegally; that the position was one of high trust and great responsibility; and that the appellant's conduct was inconsistent with that required of a DAO. The appellant has not contested this description of the agency's function or the DAO position. Indeed, he admitted: "My conduct of allowing my brother-in-law to reside with me, especially while I was attempting reinstatement with the INS, in retrospect, may have showed poor judgment in the eyes of many persons."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the agency did not err in determining that the appellant's conduct was such that employing him would adversely affect the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Morones v. Department of Justice,</span> 35 MSPR 285, 290-93 (1987) (finding that the INS has a legitimate duty to require its officers to avoid any appearance of impropriety in dealing with illegal aliens and that the appellant's actions in affording shelter to and concealing the administrative file of an illegal alien and having a personal relationship with her were antithetical to the agency's general mission and ran directly contrary to his duties and responsibilities as a Supervisory Detention and Deportation Officer), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds,</span> 852 F.2d 1294 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table). Accordingly, we sustain the agency's negative suitability determination.</p>
