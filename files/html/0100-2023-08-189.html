<h6 class="h6" id="sec1-187"><span class="space">(i)</span> Involuntary Retirement, Resignation</h6>
<p class="Body-Text">The exclusion from Board jurisdiction of major adverse actions involving VA healthcare professionals creates analytical difficulties as to constructive adverse actions, most frequently allegedly coerced resignations or retirements. <span class="Italic">Falso v. OPM</span>, 116 F.3d 459, 460-61 (Fed. Cir. 1997), decided by the Federal Circuit in 1997, was equivocal as to Board jurisdiction, but the subsequent decision in <span class="Italic">Khan v. United States</span>, 201 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2000), unequivocally relegated constructive adverse actions involving VA Title 38 healthcare professionals to forums other than the MSPB, e.g., to the VA grievance system. Falso, a registered nurse, asserted that her retirement was involuntary because it was based on misleading information she received from her employer, the VA. The court determined in <span class="Italic">Falso</span> that the MSPB should consider whether it had jurisdiction over her appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We vacate the Board's decision that it lacked the jurisdiction to consider Ms. Falso's involuntary retirement claim. A retirement may be found to be involuntary if it is based on misleading statements by the employing agency upon which the employee reasonably relied to her detriment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Oden v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 249, 252 (1993). Ms. Falso contends that she has alleged such a set of facts. Whether the claim can be established by Ms. Falso is for the fact finder.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to jurisdiction, the Board correctly stated that DVA health care employees appointed under 38 USC 7401(1) can only appeal adverse actions to the Board in limited circumstances. However, the Board erred in concluding that its decision in <span class="Italic">Cochran v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 167, 169-74 (1995) provides grounds for questioning whether jurisdiction is proper in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cochran</span>, the board held that it had jurisdiction over an adverse action brought by a DVA health care provider appointed under 38 USC 7401(1) (1994) when that action is not a "major adverse action" which involves a "question of professional conduct or competence." 67 MSPR at 171-72. When a "question of professional conduct or competence" is raised, the DVA's Disciplinary Appeals Board, rather than the Merit Systems Protection Board, has exclusive jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Ms. Falso's claim is that her retirement was involuntary. It involves no question of professional medical conduct or competence requiring action by the DVA's specialized tribunal. Although there may be other reasons why jurisdiction is not proper in this case, the ground upon which the Board relied, <span class="Italic">Cochran</span>, presents no hurdle to jurisdiction. Accordingly, we vacate the Board's determination that it lacked jurisdiction and remand this case to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand from the Federal Circuit, the Board remanded the <span class="Italic">Falso</span> appeal to the regional office for adjudication, <span class="Italic">Falso v. OPM</span>, 77 MSPR 207, 209-11 (1998), while directing the AJ to consider questions of the timeliness of the appeal and the sufficiency of the allegations of involuntariness of the challenged retirement, resolved that the Board's jurisdiction over the employee was still unresolved:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the court noted...our final decision did not "articulate any impediment" to joinder of DVA as a party to an involuntary retirement appeal and remand of the appeal to the field office for adjudication. <span class="Italic">See Falso</span>, 70 MSPR at 475. Our precedent permits us to do so in the interest of adjudicatory efficiency, so (as suggested by the court) we join DVA as a party and remand the case for further processing. <span class="Italic">See Isabelle v. OPM</span>, 69 MSPR 176, 182 (1996); <span class="Italic">Oden v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 249, 252 (1993). In adjudicating this involuntary retirement appeal, the administrative judge will have to consider several dispositive issues of timeliness and jurisdiction. Although the appellant retired in October 1994, she did not file any appeal with the Board before August 1995, and the administrative judge thus should afford the parties an opportunity to address the timeliness question on remand. <span class="Italic">See Isabelle</span>, 69 MSPR at 183. To establish that her retirement was involuntary and falls within the Board's jurisdiction, moreover, the appellant will have to show that it was based on misleading statements by DVA upon which she relied to her detriment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1574-75 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Oden</span>, 58 MSPR at 252.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, an involuntary retirement is an adverse action (removal) appealable to the Board under 5 USC chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 583, 585 (1995). Besides stating the adverse actions covered under chapter 75, however, subchapter II of chapter 75 also defines whether or not an individual is an "employee" for purposes of adverse action coverage. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7511(a), (b), 7512. It excludes from coverage as an "employee" any individual who holds a position within the Veterans Health Administration which has been excluded from the competitive service by or under a provision of title 38, unless the individual was <span id="Page_312"></span>appointed to the position under section 7401(3) of title 38. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7511(b)(10). As we explained in <span class="Italic">Pichon v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 325, 326-27 (1995), the relevant statutory provisions [38 USC 7402(b), 7403(a)] make clear that DVA nurses and other health-care professionals appointed under 38 USC 7401(1) are appointed without regard to civil-service requirements regarding qualifications and thus are excluded from the competitive service. We therefore concluded that 5 USC 7511(b)(10) excluded such professionals from coverage as "employees" under the adverse action provisions of subchapter II of chapter 75 and that they could not appeal chapter 75 adverse actions to the Board. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant appears to have been a DVA Registered Nurse, and registered nurses are among the DVA health-care professionals appointed under 38 USC 7401(1). 5 USC 7511(b)(10) thus may bar the appellant from appealing a chapter 75 adverse action (like an involuntary retirement) to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Pichon</span>, 67 MSPR at 326-27. The documentary record on this point, however, is unclear, and the administrative judge shall afford the appellant and DVA an opportunity to submit additional evidence showing the specific appointment under which she served at the time of her retirement. After receiving evidence and argument on this question, the administrative judge may decide whether or not the appellant is a covered "employee" entitled to appeal an adverse action to the Board. In determining the outcome of this appeal, of course, the administrative judge may dismiss it on either timeliness or jurisdictional grounds, if appropriate, without resolving the remaining issues. <span class="Italic">See Isabelle</span>, 69 MSPR at 183.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing the appeal in <span class="Italic">Pichon</span> for lack of jurisdiction based on 5 USC 7511(b)(10), the Board distinguished <span class="Italic">Cochran</span>, finding that the appeal there had been brought under the Whistleblower Protection Act (particularly 5 USC 1221) and that the "jurisdictional facts in <span class="Italic">Cochran</span> differ materially from the jurisdictional facts in this appeal." <span class="Italic">See</span> 67 MSPR at 327-28. We emphasize here, similarly, that the specific jurisdictional facts in <span class="Italic">Cochran</span> (an IRA appeal brought under chapters 12 and 23 of title 5) are not present in this chapter 75 appeal of an alleged adverse action. Our prior citation of <span class="Italic">Cochran</span> was only intended to point out generally that DVA health-care professionals have limited appeal rights to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Falso</span> did not resurface in the precedential decisions of the Board or the Federal Circuit. However, that court considered Board jurisdiction over the allegedly involuntary retirement of a VA healthcare professional in <span class="Italic">Khan v. United States</span>, 201 F.3d 1375, 1378-82 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In <span class="Italic">Khan</span>, on appeal from a judgment of the Court of Federal Claims, the Federal Circuit determined that the Board did not have jurisdiction over an appeal from a retirement that, the employee asserted, resulted from his reliance upon inaccurate information from the VA. Because the case did not involve a question of professional competence or conduct, it would not be within the purview of a VA DAB. The matter could, however, be subject to the VA grievance procedure. The court implied that the resulting grievance decision could be subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his second prayer for relief, Dr. Khan asked "[t]hat he be restored to active service with the [VHA] in the prior position and that his service credit be amended to accurately reflect full service [from date of retirement] to the present." We construe this to be a claim for reinstatement and back pay based on involuntary retirement<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Staats v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (misinformation or deception by an agency may provide basis for involuntary retirement claim); <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (misleading information, even if innocently provided, is basis for involuntary retirement claim).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The trial court's conclusion that Dr. Khan's claims are not cognizable under the Tucker Act does not apply to his involuntary retirement claim. If Dr. Khan were to prevail on this claim, he would be entitled to reinstatement as a VHA physician and back pay during his period of involuntary retirement. Furthermore, since his years of involuntary retirement would count as years of active service, his base pay upon retirement would properly include 100 percent of the special pay he received pursuant to 38 USC &#x00A7; 7431. In other words, if Dr. Khan were to meet his burden of proving involuntary retirement, his compensation would be covered by "money-mandating" statutes, namely 38 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7431-33 and 7438(b)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an alternate ground, the trial court held that, because the CSRA provides an exclusive remedy for Dr. Khan's claims, jurisdiction is not proper in the Court of Federal Claims<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Khan</span>, slip op. at 10 (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 444-45, 454 (1988)). The government argued to the contrary that Dr. Khan was <span class="Italic">precluded</span> from utilizing the procedures of the CSRA because, as a VHA physician appointed under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7401(1) (1994), he was restricted to the grievance procedures set forth in 38 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7461-64 (1994). The trial court dismissed this argument on the grounds that: (1) the grievance provisions of title 38 apply only to <span class="Italic">disciplining</span> and discharge of unsatisfactory medical personnel; (2) Dr. Khan was not subjected to disciplinary action; and (3) the provisions codified at 38 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7461-64 do not provide a mechanism for review of <span class="Italic">nondisciplinary</span> involuntary retirement claims. Based on this, the court held that Dr. Khan's involuntary retirement claim "should be brought in the same manner as those brought by civil service employees under title 5." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 9 (citing <span class="Italic">Falso v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 116 F.3d 459 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For VHA medical personnel appointed under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7401(1), such as Dr. Khan, section 7461(b) provides two separate procedures for challenging adverse agency actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;If the case involves or includes a question of professional conduct or competence in which a major adverse action was taken, such an appeal shall be made to a Disciplinary Appeals Board under section 7462 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;In any other case, such an appeal shall be made--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;through Department grievance procedures under section 7463 of this title, in any case that involves or includes a question of professional conduct or competence in which a major adverse action was not taken or in any case of an employee who is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement under chapter 71 of title 5....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, if an action involves a question of professional conduct or competence in which a major adverse action is taken, then it must be appealed to a Disciplinary Appeals Board under section 7462<span class="Italic">. See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 7461(b)(1) (1994). In this case, it is clear that, while Dr. Khan's involuntary retirement claim involves a "major adverse action," it does not involve a question of professional conduct or competence. Accordingly, it does not belong under section 7462.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases involving "other adverse actions," the appropriate avenue of appeal is through the grievance procedures of section 7463<span class="Italic">. See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 7461(b)(2) (1994). Section 7463 defines "other adverse actions" as any action that: "(1) is not a major adverse action; <span class="Italic">or</span> (2) does not arise out of a question of professional conduct or competence." 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463(a) (emphasis added). Thus, if <span class="Italic">either</span> of those two requirements is met, then an appeal must be brought within the agency under the grievance procedures of section 7463. There is no dispute that an involuntary retirement is a "major adverse action." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Department of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1997432108f3d3241352">108 F.3d 324</a>, 326 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (an involuntary retirement is treated as if it were a removal). However, Dr. Khan's alleged involuntary retirement is <span class="Italic">not</span> one that arises out of a question of professional conduct or competence. Instead, it arises, if at all, out of an innocent error or negligence on the part of the agency. Thus, because Dr. Khan's involuntary retirement claim meets the second prong of section 7463(a), it must be filed as a grievance with the agency under the procedures set forth in section 7463<span class="Italic">. See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 7461(b)(2) (1994) (stating in the imperative that "such an appeal <span class="Italic">shall</span> be made...under section 7463" (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having concluded that Dr. Khan must bring his involuntary retirement claim under the grievance procedures of 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463, we must decide whether he is precluded from appealing from the agency to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board). We must reach this issue because the trial court's decision is based, in part, on the notion that Dr. Khan was entitled to appeal his claim to the MSPB using the procedures of the CSRA. The court reasoned that, because Dr. Khan has a right of appeal to the MSPB, he <span class="Italic">cannot</span> have a right to appeal to the Court of Federal Claims....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the Court of Federal Claims read our decision in <span class="Italic">Falso</span> to mean that Dr. Khan has a right to appeal his involuntary retirement claim to the MSPB, the court erred. In <span class="Italic">Falso</span>, the MSPB held that it lacked jurisdiction over an involuntary retirement claim brought by a VHA nurse appointed under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7401(1). The Board held that such claims were within the <span class="Italic">exclusive</span> jurisdiction of the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Falso v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 70 MSPR 470, 475 (1996) (relying on <span class="Italic">Cochran v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 67 MSPR 167, 169-174 (1995)). We vacated the Board's holding <span class="Italic">solely</span> on the ground that <span class="Italic">Cochran</span> was inapposite, leaving open the question of whether the Board actually had jurisdiction over Falso's claim<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Falso</span>, 116 F.3d at 460 ("Although there may be other reasons why jurisdiction is not proper in this case, the ground upon which the Board relied, <span class="Italic">Cochran</span>, presents no hurdle to jurisdiction."). On remand, the Board did not change its holding. Instead, it disclaimed reliance on <span class="Italic">Cochran</span> and pointed to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(b)(10) (1994), which clearly bars VHA healthcare professionals appointed under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7401(1) from appealing adverse actions to the Board under title 5, chapter 75<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Falso v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 MSPR 207, 210-11 (1997); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Khan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, No. DC-0752-0588-I-1, slip op. at 4 (MSPB Sep. 8, 1997) (relying on <span class="Italic">Falso</span>, 77 MSPR at 210).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Involuntary retirement claims are generally appealed to the Board under chapter 75 of title 5 (titled: "Adverse Actions, Removal, etc."). However, chapter 75 is not available to an employee "who holds a position within <span id="Page_313"></span>the Veterans Health Administration which has been excluded from the competitive service by or under a provision of title 38, unless such employee was appointed to such position under section 7401(3) of such title." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(b)(10) (1994). Dr. Khan was not appointed under section 7401(3); therefore, if we find that he was "excluded from the competitive service" under a provision of title 38, then he has no right to appeal to the Board under chapter 75.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have held that "the competitive examination is the touchstone of the competitive service" and that employees who are appointed without a competitive examination are excluded from the competitive service<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Dodd v. Tennessee Valley Auth.</span>, 770 F.2d 1038, 1040 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The qualifications for physicians appointed to the VHA under title 38 do not include a competitive examination<span class="Italic">. See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 7402(b) (1994) (requiring only a medical degree, completed internship, and license to practice medicine). The record shows that Dr. Khan was appointed as a VHA physician under 38 USC &#x00A7; 4104 (1970), which was later recodified as 38 USC &#x00A7; 7401(1) (1994)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Khan</span>, slip op. at 3 n.2. Thus, we hold that Dr. Khan was excluded from the competitive service under a provision of title 38 and is therefore not entitled to appeal to the Board under chapter 75 of title 5. This conclusion is consistent with MSPB case law on the subject<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Falso</span>, 77 MSPR at 210; <span class="Italic">Khan</span>, No. DC0752970588-I-1, slip. op. at 4 (MSPB Sep. 8, 1997); <span class="Italic">Pichon v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 67 MSPR 325, 326-27 (1995); <span class="Italic">Bacani v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 64 MSPR 588, 596 n.7 (1994); <span class="Italic">Chan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 53 MSPR 617, 620 (1992); <span class="Italic">Alvarez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 49 MSPR 682, 684-85 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that section 7401(1) employees are not necessarily precluded from appealing to the Board under provisions <span class="Italic">other</span> than chapter 75. In <span class="Italic">Cochran v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 67 MSPR 167 (1995), the Board held that it had jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a DVA physician who brought an Individual Right of Action appeal under the Whistleblower Protection Act<span class="Italic">. See also</span> <span class="Italic">Dick v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 83 MSPR 464, 467 (1999). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Von Zemenszky v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 80 MSPR 663 (1999), the Board held that it had jurisdiction over an appeal from a section 7463 grievance action in which a DVA physician challenged his separation under an administrative Reduction In Force. These cases are distinguishable from the Board's holdings in <span class="Italic">Falso</span> and <span class="Italic">Khan</span> because they were not brought under chapter 75 of title 5. Instead, the appeals in <span class="Italic">Cochran</span> and <span class="Italic">Dick</span> were based on 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221 (1994), and the appeal in <span class="Italic">Von Zemenszky</span> was brought under 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3501-4 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having established that Dr. Khan must bring his involuntary retirement action under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463 and that he may <span class="Italic">not</span> appeal from the agency to the MSPB under chapter 75 of title 5, we must finally decide whether the VHA's jurisdiction under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463 is exclusive. Whether 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463 creates an exclusive remedy for section 7401(1) personnel is a question of first impression for this court. Dr. Khan argues that, even if his claim falls within section 7463, "that does not necessarily mean that such procedures preclude presenting the claim to the Court of Federal Claims." The government argues that <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, which held that a Tucker Act court has no jurisdiction over claims that are independently covered by the CSRA, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 455, is broad enough to encompass section 7463 claims as well as CSRA claims. We agree. Indeed, <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> is directly on point in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, an employee of the Fish and Wildlife Service was dismissed for unauthorized use of a government vehicle. He appealed to the MSPB, which dismissed his appeal on the ground that, as a nonpreference eligible in the excepted service, he had no right to appeal to the Board. Fausto then filed a claim in the Claims Court, seeking damages under the Back Pay Act. The issue on appeal was whether the CSRA precluded judicial review of Fausto's claim, notwithstanding the fact that it provided no formal right of appeal to the Board. The Supreme Court held that, because of the comprehensive nature of the CSRA, and because the challenged adverse action was of the type specifically envisioned by the CSRA, Congress intended to preclude judicial review of Fausto's claim<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 455 ("[The] deliberate exclusion of employees in respondent's service category from the provisions establishing administrative and judicial review for personnel action of the sort at issue here prevents respondent from seeking review in the Claims Court....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like the appellant in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, Dr. Khan falls within a special category of employee that has been <span class="Italic">specifically excluded</span> from the procedures and protections set forth in chapter 75 of the CSRA. As in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, Dr. Khan's cause of action is <span class="Italic">of the type</span> envisioned by the CSRA<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512 (1994) (chapter 75, subchapter II applies, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to removal and suspension for more than 14 days.); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Fisher v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 68 MSPR 70 (1995) (holding that involuntary retirement claim is appealable to the Board). Accordingly, the specific <span class="Italic">exclusion</span> of Dr. Khan from the CSRA provisions covering involuntary retirement claims prevents him from seeking review in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 455.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, of course, that Dr. Khan is not entirely precluded from seeking judicial review of his claim. VHA doctors and other section 7401(1) personnel may appeal a final agency decision to the appropriate district court under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 702, 706 (1994)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Berry v. Hollander</span>, 925 F.2d 311, 315 (9th Cir. 1991). The decision of the agency may be reversed if the employee was denied due process or if the decision was arbitrary, capricious or otherwise illegal<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 706(2) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Dr. Khan's first claim for monetary relief is not a proper Tucker Act claim over which the Court of Federal Claims may exercise jurisdiction. We further hold that Dr. Khan must use the grievance procedures set forth in section 7463 of title 38 to appeal his claim of involuntary retirement. Because the VHA has exclusive jurisdiction over this claim, and because jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims is precluded by <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, the trial court did not err in dismissing the claim for lack of jurisdiction. Because the trial court lacked jurisdiction, we do not reach the question of whether Dr. Khan failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Subbaraya v. MSPB</span>, 387 Fed. Appx. 959, 960-61 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), concluded the Board lacked jurisdiction over an allegedly involuntary resignation a VA Title 38 probationary physician:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board's jurisdiction is not plenary, but is limited to those matters over which it has been granted jurisdiction by law, rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Johnston v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 518 F.3d 905, 909 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Subbaraya had the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the board had jurisdiction over her appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subbaraya alleges that her resignation from her position with the agency was involuntary. Even if she could establish that her resignation was involuntary, however, the board lacks jurisdiction to consider her appeal. "Congress has given the Secretary of Veterans Affairs broad discretion to appoint to positions in the [Veterans Health Administration] such personnel as the Secretary may find necessary for the medical care of veterans. One category of personnel that may be appointed to the [Veterans Health Administration] under &#x00A7; 7401 includes physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, registered nurses, physician assistants, and expanded function dental auxiliaries." <span class="Italic">Scarnati v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 344 F.3d 1246, 1248 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Health care workers appointed pursuant to section 7401(1) generally have no right to appeal adverse personnel actions to the board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(10); <span class="Italic">Bonner v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 477 F.3d 1343, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (emphasizing that Veterans Health Administration "employees hired under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(1)...have never had the right to appeal &#x00A7; 7512 type adverse actions to the MSPB."). Thus, regardless of whether Subbaraya was serving as a probationary employee at the time she resigned, she had no right to appeal to the board because she was appointed to her position pursuant to section 7401(1). <span class="Italic">See James v. Von Zemenszky</span>, 284 F.3d 1310, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("[C]hapter 74 of title 38 contains a number of provisions that treat [Veterans Health Administration] healthcare professionals differently from ordinary civil service employees.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board likewise correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Subbaraya's allegation that she suffered reprisal for disclosures protected under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 ("WPA"). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). The board can exercise jurisdiction over a WPA claim only when an employee has exhausted his administrative remedies before the Office of Special Counsel ("OSC"). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3); <span class="Italic">Ward v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 981 F.2d 521, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1992).

The parties have had the opportunity to present argument and evidence on this issue, and it is undisputed that the appellant was appointed under38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(1). For this reason, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's involuntary disability retirement appeal. Thus, we vacate the findings of the administrative judge concerning the appellant's involuntary disability retirement claim and dismiss that claim for lack of jurisdiction because the appellant is not an "employee" for purposes of chapter 75 appeal rights to the Board and cannot, therefore, appeal his involuntary disability retirement claim as an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Pariseau v.
