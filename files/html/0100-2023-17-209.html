<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-207"><span class="space">p.</span> Discrimination</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Helena Dist. and NTEU Chap. 42</span>, 37 FLRA 1410, 1419-22 (1990), reviewed an arbitration award finding discrimination as to a promotion. FLRA sustained the arbitrator's decision to award the grievant a retroactive promotion with back pay consistent with the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596. The use of the three-part analysis of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), was approved: (1) the grievant bears the burden of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination; (2) the agency must then articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action; and (3) if the agency articulates that reason, the grievant has the burden of persuading the arbitrator that the articulated reason is pretextual or that it is more likely that a discriminatory reason motivated the decisionmaker. The <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case can be established if the employee shows that (a) she is a member of a protected class; (b) she applied for and is qualified for the position; and (c) someone of equal or lesser qualifications who is not a member of the class was selected for the position. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Hq., XVIII Airborne Corps and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 42 FLRA 1186, 1192-93 (1991), measured an arbitrator's analysis against some of the accommodation requirements of the Rehabilitation Act and allowed the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA made clear that there must be a finding of intentional discrimination <span id="page_2061"></span>from the vantage point of the deciding official in <span class="Italic">EPA, Region 5 and AFGE Council 238</span>, 70 FLRA 1033, 1033-37 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting), offering close scrutiny of an arbitrator's analysis of a nonpromotion claim based on application of a contract article, not touching upon the influence of lower-level discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case concerns the proper application of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span> (<span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>)[1] to the Union's challenge to a selection. As such, we apply the legal standards for national-origin-discrimination claims under Title VII and grant the Agency's contrary-to-law exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;411 U.S. 792 (1973).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying those standards, where record evidence is insufficient to demonstrate discriminatory intent, the complaining party must lose as a matter of law.[2] And, as will be discussed below, the record evidence of discrimination in this case is legally insufficient to support a conclusion of illegal discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods</span>., 530 U.S. 133, 148 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Reeves</span>) ("[A]n employer would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision, or if plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred."); <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp</span>., 812 F.3d 1109, 1113 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (<span class="Italic">Wheeler</span>) (where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1114 (the central inquiry is whether the plaintiff produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the employer's asserted nondiscriminatory reason was not the actual reason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff on a prohibited basis); <span class="Italic">Minter v. D.C</span>., 809 F.3d 66, 68 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (summary judgment is appropriate if "the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law"); <span class="Italic">Flowers v. Troup Cnty., Ga., Sch. Dist</span>., 803 F.3d 1327, 1338 (11th Cir. 2015) (<span class="Italic">Flowers</span>) (because the plaintiff has the burden of persuasion on this point, it is his responsibility to advance sufficient evidence of discrimination to create a triable factual dispute); <span class="Italic">Conroy v.

<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The relevant facts here are straightforward.[3] The Agency announced an opportunity for employees to apply for two non-supervisory, general schedule (GS)-15 positions, including the Senior Counsel for Water Enforcement and Counseling. The announcement, which the Regional Counsel (the selecting official) emailed to employees, instructed potential applicants to submit a current resume and "an expression of interest that describes (four pages or less, [twelve]-point font, default margins) examples of your work experience and addresses how you would perform the major duties and responsibilities set forth in the position description of the job you are applying for." The ultimate selectee's expression of interest was four pages long and detailed; the grievant's, by contrast, was one page long and less detailed.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also AFGE Local 704</span>, 70 FLRA 676, 676-77 (2018).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A <span class="Italic">screening</span> panel--consisting of three management officials (not including the selecting official)--then read each application independently, and met to discuss their individual findings. The screening panel determined, for various reasons, that all of the applicants should be interviewed, but it recommended two applicants--the ultimate selectee, and one other individual--as the best-qualified candidates for the Senior Counsel for Water Enforcement and Counseling position. The screening panel did not consider the grievant to be in the top six applicants for this position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, a <span class="Italic">selection</span> panel--consisting of three <span class="Italic">different</span> management officials (the selecting official, the Deputy Regional Counsel, and the Associate Deputy Regional Counsel)--interviewed thirteen applicants for the two posted positions. The panel members individually rated the candidates and then met to discuss their respective ratings. They agreed as to who were the top three candidates for the Senior Counsel for Water Enforcement and Counseling position. That list included the ultimate selectee and two other individuals, but did not include the grievant. After a few days, the panel reconvened, and the selecting official then decided to choose the selectee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance that went to arbitration.&#x2003;As relevant here, the grievance alleged that, by not selecting the grievant, the Agency had intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of his national origin (Mexican-American), and so, violated Articles 5, 8, and 36 of the parties' agreement. The Arbitrator found discrimination, and the Agency filed the exceptions that are before us now.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The Award is Contrary to Law.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the burden-shifting framework set out in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>,[7] once a complaining party establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the alleged discriminatory action.[8] If the employer meets this burden of production, then the burden shifts to the complaining party to show that the employer's stated reason for the employment action was, in fact, pretext.[9] However, the existence of the <span class="Italic">prima</span> <span class="Italic">facie</span> case, coupled with evidence of pretext, is not always enough to satisfy the plaintiff's burden of proving intentional discrimination.[10] Rather, at all times, the complaining party retains the ultimate burden of persuasion that the employer intentionally discriminated.[11]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Our dissenting colleague argues that the Arbitrator is due a level of deference that cannot be reconciled with either our statutory duty to review arbitration awards[12] or our case law.[13] Simply put, an award does not escape our <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review simply because the arbitrator couches an issue as a contract violation all while applying legal standards established outside the contract itself. The level of deference which our colleague is willing to accord to arbitral interpretations of contract provisions that enforce Title VII rights is far greater than what the EEOC accords to its administrative judges who are experts in that area of the law.[14]</p>

<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_2062"></span>[13]&#x2003;Although the Arbitrator found a violation of the parties' agreement, the parties relied on the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework, a legal framework, to determine whether there was a violation.

As such, the question before us is whether the Arbitrator properly applied a legal framework that the parties agreed applied; this is a legal question warranting a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 65 FLRA 826, 828 (2011) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>) (where arbitrator looked to contract to find racial discrimination using <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework, Authority reviewed contrary-to-law claims <span class="Italic">de novo</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3615</span>, 55 FLRA 1160 (1999) (same).

<p class="noindent-1">After our <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the award,[15] even with due deference to the few factual findings reached by the Arbitrator,[16] we have reached a different conclusion. Therefore, we must set aside the award and grant the Agency's exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;Member Abbott notes that deference to arbitral factual findings does not mean blind obeisance. As we note below, the Arbitrator failed to apply the proper legal rigor as he reached his factual findings. In such circumstances, no deference, let alone blind obeisance, is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found, and there is no dispute, that the Union met its <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, and that the Agency articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its selection. Therefore, the only questions before us are whether the Union sufficiently demonstrated that the Agency's proffered reasons for selecting the selectee over the grievant are pretext, and whether it has met its overall burden of persuasion that the Agency engaged in intentional discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to demonstrate a pretext, the complaining party must show that the employer's proffered non-discriminatory explanations for its actions "are so incoherent, weak, inconsistent, or contradictory that a rational factfinder could conclude [they are] unworthy of belief."[17] The focus is on the employer's justification for its decision--for example, did the employer offer inconsistent reasons for its decision, or is the employer's explanation so implausible that a factfinder could find it unworthy of credence?[18] In assessing the employer's explanation, courts look to the facts as they appear <span class="Italic">to the person who made the decision</span>.[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In cases involving hiring decisions, courts have said that <span class="Italic">some</span> subjectivity is to be expected.[20] In this regard, "Title VII does not do away with traditional management rights. An employer has discretion to choose among equally qualified candidates, provided that the decision is not based upon unlawful criteria."[21] Thus, "[t]he relevant inquiry is not whether the employer's proffered reasons were wise, fair or correct, but whether it honestly believed those reasons and acted in good faith upon those beliefs."[22]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, while different courts have framed the standards somewhat differently, they consistently have held that, to draw an inference of pretext based on a complaining party being better qualified than a selectee, the degree of difference in their qualifications must be <span class="Italic">significant</span>.[23] In this connection, in Title VII intentional-discrimination cases, the role of courts is "not to act as a super personnel department that second guesses employers' business judgments."[24] The role of arbitrators, and the Authority, should be no different.</p>

We will examine the Arbitrator's award in this case to determine whether the Arbitrator properly applied the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analytical standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">IRS, Helena</span>, 37 FLRA at 1419-21.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> and its progeny, an employee establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination when the employee shows that: (1) the employee is a member of a protected class; (2) the employee is qualified for the position; and (3) someone of equal or lesser qualifications who is not a member of the protected class is selected for the position<span class="Italic">. IRS, Helena</span>, 37 FLRA at 1420. Once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of discrimination is made, the burden then shifts to the employer "to articulate some legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection." <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802. If the employer then articulates a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for not selecting the employee, the employee must "be afforded a fair opportunity to show that [the employer's] stated reason for [the employee's] rejection was in fact pretext." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 804.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, the Supreme Court discussed and further explained its <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> decision. With regard to the burden on an employer in Title VII discrimination cases to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, the Court held that the employer "need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons, but it is sufficient if the [employer's] evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the [employee]." <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 248. The Court noted that it had "stated consistently that the employee's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination will be rebutted if the employer articulates lawful reasons for the action; that is, to satisfy this intermediate burden, the employer need only produce admissible evidence which would allow the trier of fact rationally to conclude that the employment decision had not been motivated by discriminatory animus." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 257.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> standard in this case, the Arbitrator noted that the parties agreed that "a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of discrimination has been made...." The Arbitrator next held that, under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, the Agency was "obligated to articulate some legitimate nondiscriminatory reason" for not selecting the grievant for the position. He stated that the Agency had only "offered the subjective opinions of the Regional Director and his superiors as the reason" for its decision. He found that "[n]either the Regional Director nor his superiors articulated any objective reason(s)" for their decision and "[t]hey could not articulate any objective process for selecting a candidate from the 'Best Qualified' list." The Arbitrator ruled that a subjective reason for the Agency's decision "does not pass muster under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>[,]" and concluded that the Agency had failed to meet its burden of producing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not selecting the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Supreme Court requires only that, in order to rebut a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of discrimination, an employer "produce admissible evidence which would allow the trier of fact rationally to conclude that the employment decision had not been motivated by discriminatory animus[,]" and the employer's "explanation of its legitimate reasons must be clear and reasonably specific." <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 257, 258. The Court also has held that "it is apparent that the burden which shifts to the employer is merely that of proving that he based his employment decision on a legitimate consideration, and not an illegitimate one such as [sex]." <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2064"></span>The Arbitrator improperly rejected the Agency's reasons for its selection of the selectee in this case on the ground that those reasons were subjective. However, we find that the Agency offered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its selection decision under the analytical framework discussed in the cases cited above. According to the Agency, its selection decision was based on the assessment of the comparative qualifications of the three applicants by the Regional Director and other Agency officials. The Regional Director stated that he "considered the knowledge, skills and abilities of the applicants, the quality and scope of the applicants' job experience and performance and the potential of the applicants." In particular, he noted that the selectee had received higher performance ratings than the grievant on the critical elements of timeliness and quality of work and that the selectee had "constantly demonstrated superior knowledge and ability to perform the technical aspects of a supervisory attorney's duties." In forwarding the Regional Director's recommendation to the General Counsel of the NLRB, the Assistant to the General Counsel and the Deputy to the Assistant General Counsel stated that "based on [the applicants'] appraisals and [the Regional Director's] recommendation, we agree that [the selectee] should be selected for the supervisory position."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency offered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its decision under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>. In meeting the second prong of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> test, "the bare articulation of a legitimate nondiscriminatory explanation generally suffices to undermine" a complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">Segar </span>v. <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 738 F.2d 1249, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 471 U.S. 1115 (1985). <span class="Italic">See also</span>, <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, 891 F.2d at 322 (The agency successfully rebutted an employee's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by showing that the employee's demotion and denial of a within-grade pay increase were "plausibly relate[d] to work performance."); <span class="Italic">Keyes v. Secretary of the Navy</span>, 853 F.2d 1016, 1023 (1st Cir. 1988) (It is sufficient to rebut a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of discrimination if the agency provides legitimate, nondiscriminatory evidence "that raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether [it] purposefully discriminated against the plaintiff."). We conclude, contrary to the Arbitrator, that the Agency's stated reasons for its selection decision are sufficient to rebut the grievant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we note that courts have addressed the specific issue of whether an employer's assessment of an applicant's qualifications satisfies the second prong of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> test. For example, in a case involving a complaint of nonpromotion because of racial discrimination, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld a district court's acceptance of an employer's reasons for its promotion decision. The court found that the offered reasons were sufficient to rebut the complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, when the employer testified that it "did not discriminate against [the complainant] because of his race but instead simply considered him relatively less qualified on a subjective and objective basis than the successful applicants." <span class="Italic">Page v. Bolger</span>, 645 F.2d 227, 230 (4th Cir. 1981). Concerning the subjectivity of the employer's reasons, the Fourth Circuit stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Obviously it must be possible for employers legally to make employment decisions that disfavor qualified minority employees on the basis of a comparative evaluation of their qualifications with those of other applicants. Concededly, when that evaluation is to any degree subjective and when the evaluators are themselves not members of the protected minority, the legitimacy and nondiscriminatory basis of the articulated reason for the decision may be subject to particularly close scrutiny by the trial judge. But, as the Supreme Court pointed out in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> itself, the mere fact that subjective criteria are involved in the reason articulated by an employer does not prevent according it sufficient rebuttal weight to dispel the inference of discrimination raised by the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with these decisions, we conclude that the Arbitrator erred by rejecting the Agency's reasons for its selection decision on the ground that those reasons were subjective. The Agency provided detailed reasons for its decision in the testimony of the Regional Director at the arbitration hearing and in the Regional Director's memorandum and the memorandum of the Assistant to the General Counsel and the Deputy to the Assistant General Counsel. The Agency's reasons are "clear and reasonably specific." <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 258. Contrary to the Arbitrator, we find that the Agency articulated "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason[s]" in support of its selection decisions. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following the Agency's articulation of legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its selection decision, the grievant was entitled to "be afforded a fair opportunity to show that the Agency's stated reason[s] for [her] rejection [were] in fact pretext." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 804. Whether the Agency's reasons for the selection action were the real reasons or were a pretext for discrimination was an issue that should have been decided by the Arbitrator. Because the Arbitrator improperly rejected the Agency's stated reasons for choosing the selectee for the supervisory attorney position and failed to make the required determination on the issue of pretext, the award must be set aside and the case remanded to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator for a determination on the issue of pretext. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, 891 F.2d at 322 (case remanded for further proceedings because the lower court failed to articulate the appropriate legal standards); <span class="Italic">Burton</span>, 768 F.2d at 167 (case remanded to district court for analysis of the issue of pretext).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NLRB</span> returned to FLRA following remand. FLRA determined that the arbitrator did not abuse his discretion by denying the union an opportunity to reopen the record for additional evidence. The arbitrator could properly conclude that the subjective grounds for selection did not constitute pretext under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>. <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRB Union</span>, 48 FLRA 1337, 1344-45 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA explained its role in reviewing a finding of discrimination or reprisal by an arbitrator in a promotion case, <span class="Italic">FDIC, Chicago Region and NTEU Chap. 242</span>, 45 FLRA 437, 443-44 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both section 7106(a)(2)(C) and FPM chapter 335, subchapter 1-4, Requirement 4 provide that management has the right in filling positions to select from a group of properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or from any other appropriate source. When an arbitrator is not enforcing an arrangement, management's right to make selections for promotion can be abridged by an award of an arbitrator only when the arbitrator finds a direct connection between improper agency action and the agency's failure to select a specific employee for promotion. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Family Support Administration</span>, 35 FLRA 501, 508 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Family Support Administration</span>). The Agency contends that the Arbitrator failed to find a direct connection between the Agency's reprisal against the grievant and the Agency's failure to select the grievant for promotion. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have held with respect to awards of retroactive promotions with backpay by arbitrators under the Back Pay Act that we will review these awards for evidence of a finding by the arbitrator of a causal connection between an unwarranted agency personnel action and an agency's failure to promote an employee and not for a specific recitation of certain words and phrases. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 31 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio</span>, 41 FLRA 514, 518 (1991). We see no reason for approaching awards of promotions by arbitrators in relation to section 7106(a)(2)(C) and FPM chapter 335 any differently.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the Arbitrator made the required finding of a direct connection between the grievant's failure to be selected for promotion and the Agency's reprisal against the grievant for protected EEO activities. The Arbitrator specifically found that absent consideration of computer skills, the grievant was the superior candidate and "should have been awarded the position in dispute." Moreover, we find that in rejecting the Agency's articulated reason for selecting the employee as a pretext for reprisal against the grievant because he had filed the class action lawsuit against the Agency over the PE exam, the Arbitrator effectively determined that the grievant would have been selected for promotion in the absence of the prohibited reprisal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3446 and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration</span>, 43 FLRA 467, 475 (1991) (arbitrator made the finding required by section 7106(a)(2)(C) to order grievant selected because the arbitrator found that the agency's reasons for failing to select the grievant were a pretext for prohibited discrimination); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Customs Service, Pembina District, Pembina, North Dakota and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 157</span>, 41 FLRA 1420, 1426 (1991) (arbitrator effectively made the required finding that the agency's discrimination against the grievant directly resulted in the grievant's failure to be promoted); <span class="Italic">Family Support Administration</span>, 35 FLRA at 509 (arbitrator made the finding required by section 7106(a)(2)(C) to order the grievant promoted when he determined that the agency would not have found the grievant unqualified absent his protected activity).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and NTEU Chap. 243</span>, 52 FLRA 358, 366-70 (1996), also considered the burdens of proof in a discrimination case involving nonselection for promotion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In employment discrimination cases based on race, once the plaintiff has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, and the defendant has succeeded in carrying its burden of production, the trier of fact proceeds to consider the ultimate question: whether the plaintiff has proven that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff because of race. <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. at 511. In <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, the Supreme Court stated that "[t]he <span id="page_2065"></span>factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant...may, together with the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, suffice to show intentional discrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons will <span class="Italic">permit</span> the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis in original; citation omitted)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">also Randle</span> <span class="Italic">v. City of Aurora</span>, 69 F.3d 441, 451 (10th Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Cigna Corporation</span>, 47 F.3d 586, 596-97 (3d Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator applied this standard in determining, based on inferences from the record, that the Union demonstrated that the Agency intentionally discriminated against the grievant. The Agency correctly states that proof of preselection does not necessarily undercut the proffered reason that the selectee was better qualified than the grievant. However, the Arbitrator did not base his finding of intentional discrimination solely upon his rejection of the Agency's proffered reasons for rejecting the grievant.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Therefore, the cases relied upon by the Agency are inapposite. Indeed, consistent with those cases, the Arbitrator considered all of the evidence, not just evidence of preselection, in finding intentional discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Blue v. United States Department of the Army</span>, 914 F.2d 525, 541 (4th Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">Chambers v. United States Department of the Army</span>, 499 U.S. 959 (1991) (even if plaintiff's testimony concerning preselection is accurate, "it would not, <span class="Italic">without more</span>, indicate that she was the victim of racial discrimination") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Nolette v. Garrett</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01912035, slip op. at 13 (1991) (EEOC found claim of racial discrimination, without more, not supported by evidence that merely shows favoritism played a role in the decision-making process).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Instead, the Arbitrator evaluated all of the evidence, made the necessary credibility determinations, and, in relevant part, found that: (1) the grievant belongs to a racial minority; (2) the grievant applied, and was qualified, for the vacant position of computer specialist; (3) the grievant was not awarded the position; (4) the position was awarded to an applicant who is not a member of a racial minority; (5) the Agency had preselected the selectee for the computer specialist position; (6) the grievant had been denied career training opportunities that the Agency had made available to selectee; and (7) the selection process was flawed. Under traditional arbitration principles, we defer to these findings of fact.... That the Arbitrator found the Agency to have engaged in preselection was just one of many facts that he relied upon in finding that the Agency intentionally discriminated against the grievant. Accordingly, as the Arbitrator applied the standards established by <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> in finding intentional discrimination, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7106(a)(2)(C) provides that management has the right in filling positions to select from among a group of properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or from any other appropriate source. FPM Chapter 335, Appendix A governs an agency's actions to remedy violations of applicable laws that occur in connection with the filling of agency positions. When resolving whether a remedy ordered in an arbitration award impermissibly conflicts with a management right or with the FPM, as in this case, the Authority has held that management's right to make selections for promotion can be abridged by an award of an arbitrator only when the arbitrator finds that the grievant would have been selected for the promotion in the absence of the prohibited racial discrimination. <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 45 FLRA at 443-44. That is, the arbitrator must reconstruct what the responsible selecting official would have done if the unwarranted agency action had not occurred and must find that the selecting official would have selected the grievant but for the unwarranted actions. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Family Support Administration</span>, 35 FLRA 501, 508 (1990). The Authority will not look behind an arbitrator's award in cases where the requisite "but for" finding is made. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2855 and United States Army, Military Traffic Management Command, Eastern Area</span>, 13 FLRA 251, 252 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that the Arbitrator found that the Agency committed an improper action<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Helena District and</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 42</span>, 37 FLRA 1410, 1422 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Helena District</span>) (a finding that the grievant was discriminated against on the basis of race constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action). The Arbitrator also found that had the Agency not engaged in discrimination against the grievant, she would have been selected for the position. In this regard, the Arbitrator specifically found "that but for the aforecited Agency violations of the [g]rievant's rights, the Agency would have selected [g]rievant for and promoted [g]rievant to the position." In view of this finding of fact, and because we do not look behind an arbitrator's award that contains the requisite findings of fact, we reject the Agency's argument that the Arbitrator erred in not accepting the SO's ranking of the candidates. As this argument is the basis of the Agency's contention that the Arbitrator's remedy violates section 7106(a)(2)(C) and FPM Chapter 335, Appendix A, we likewise reject that contention as well. Stated otherwise, in light of the Arbitrator's determination that the grievant would have been selected for the position but for the Agency's improper action, the Arbitrator's direction to the Agency to retroactively promote the grievant is consistent with section 7106(a)(2) and FPM Chapter 335, Appendix A.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3615 and SSA, OHA</span>, 55 FLRA 1160, 1162-63 (1999), provides another overview of the application of shifting burdens of proof to a grievance protesting nonpromotions as discriminatory on the basis of race or disability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas, </span>the Supreme Court set forth the order of presentation and allocation of burdens in a Title VII case alleging discriminatory treatment. 411 U.S. at 802. First, an employee must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case by showing (1) membership in a protected class (2) qualifications for the position; (3) adverse employment action; and (4) some evidence that would allow the inference of improper motivation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barge v. Anheuser Busch, Inc., </span>87 F.3d 256, 258 (8th Cir. 1996). Once a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case has been established, the burden shifts to the employer "to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection." <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas, </span>411 U.S. at 802. Finally, if the employer articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not selecting the employee, the burden shifts to the employee "to show that [the employer's] stated reason for [the employee's] rejection was in fact pretext." <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 804.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court in <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center et al. v. Hicks, </span>509 U.S. 502, 509 (1993) clarified that the employer has discharged its burden if it produces evidence that, if taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action. If this occurs, then the fact finder must "decide the ultimate question: whether...[the employer] intentionally discriminated against the [employee]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 511. In cases where the employer has proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, the issue of whether a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case had been established is immaterial. <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span> <span class="Italic">Board of Governors v. Aikens, </span>460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983) (<span class="Italic">Aikens</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found both that the Union had not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case, and that the Agency had articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. Applying <span class="Italic">Aikens, </span>the Union's exception must be denied unless it establishes that the Arbitrator erred in <span class="Italic">both </span>findings. If the finding of legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons is upheld, then the Arbitrator's failure to find a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case, even if erroneous, is not dispositive. <span class="Italic">See Aikens, </span>460 U.S. at 715.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's exception to the Arbitrator's determination that the Agency articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions does not challenge the legal standard applied by the Arbitrator. Rather, the Union challenges the Arbitrator's findings, based on Agency testimony, that the positions were required at the hearing offices, rather than at headquarters, for reasons of operational efficiency, and that the grievants were not authorized to perform the Senior Attorney Program work, absent a regulatory change by the Health Care Financing Administration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons explained above, the Union has not established that, insofar as these arbitral findings are concerned, the award is based on nonfacts. In addition, the Union has not disputed the Arbitrator's third conclusion, with respect to the ultimate question of discrimination. That conclusion was that the Union had not submitted any evidence that would support finding that membership in a protected class led to the grievants not securing positions in the Senior Attorney Program. The Arbitrator's finding of legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons, as well as his undisputed finding on the ultimate question of discrimination, provide a sufficient basis for his conclusion that the Union had not established discrimination under Title VII standards.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 704 and EPA Region 5</span>, 70 FLRA 676, 677 (2018) (affirming award determining, under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, that no discrimination permeated a nonselection and that grievant failed to establish a disability discrimination claim: noting: "When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, rule, or regulation, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority determines whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. In making that determination, we defer to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The burdens of proof in a nonselection case involving a grievance asserting race discrimination were explored as to motivational analysis, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 65 FLRA 826, 826-29 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While occupying a General Schedule, Grade 12 (GS-12) position with the Agency, the grievant applied for a vacant General Schedule, Grade 13 (GS-13) revenue agent position (the GS-13 position). When the Agency selected another individual (the selectee) for the GS-13 position, the Union filed a grievance alleging, among other things, that the Agency racially discriminated against the grievant when it did not select her. When the grievance was unresolved, the parties proceeded to arbitration. As relevant here, the stipulated issue before the Arbitrator was whether <span id="page_2066"></span>the "Agency discriminate[d] against the grievant...based on race...when it did not select her for [the GS-13 position]...[, and,] [i]f so, what shall the remedy be?"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator relied upon the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas </span>burden-shifting framework (the framework)--which complainants may use to "prov[e] a race discrimination case...in a Title VII trial"--to assess the grievant's complaint of disparate treatment based on race. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 17-19 (quoting and citing <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802-03 (1973) (<span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>) (internal quotation marks omitted)). In this regard, the Arbitrator found that the Union satisfied the first-step burden under the framework by establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination. He found further that the Agency satisfied the second-step burden under the framework by articulating "legitimate non-discriminatory reasons" for preferring the selectee over the grievant, including the Agency's contentions that the selectee: (1) "had the best interview..."; (2) was "ranked at the top of the best qualified list..."; and (3) had "recent relevant experience[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moving to the third step of the framework, the Arbitrator determined that, in order to prevail on the disparate treatment claim, the Union had to "prove[ ] by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency's [articulated reasons were] pretextual." With regard to this third-step burden, the Arbitrator stated that he would not "second-guess[ ]" the Agency's proffered reasons for choosing the selectee unless the Union proved, as relevant here, that: (1) the reasons articulated were "unworthy of credence..."; or (2) the grievant's "qualifications were plainly[, demonstrably, or observably] superior to those of the selectee." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">Burchfield v.

<p class="noindent-1">As part of his assessment of whether the Agency's reasons were "worthy of credence," the Arbitrator examined the parties' compliance with their obligation under the master labor agreement (Agreement) to "mak[e] a complete record during the steps of the grievance procedure[.]" The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated that contractual obligation because, although the Union "made a detailed presentation" at the second- and third-step grievance meetings to support the discrimination claim, the Agency never offered a "substantive reply" or "any definitive explanations for the grievant's non-selection [until arbitration]. Instead, it simply denied the grievance."<span class="Italic"> </span>In addition, the Arbitrator found that the testimony of the selecting official for the GS-13 position was "not credible[,]" because the official articulated different reasons at arbitration than he had articulated to the grievant in a counseling session, which the Arbitrator found to be a violation of Article 13, Section 9.D. of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the Agency's failure to satisfy its contractual obligation to fully articulate its reasons for the grievant's nonselection during counseling and at the second- and third-step grievance meetings, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's proffered reasons were "not credible...because they obviously ha[d] been devised for the arbitration" proceedings. "Thus, the only conclusion that [the Arbitrator could] properly...draw[ ] from th[e] evidence [was] that the Agency's [reasons]...[were] pretext for discrimination based on race." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 25 (failure to provide "substantive response" prior to arbitration "suggest[ed]...pretext for...discrimination based on race"). As an additional ground for finding that the Agency's explanations at arbitration were pretextual, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's qualifications were "plainly superior" to those of the selectee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Union had established its <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and the Arbitrator found the Agency's articulated reasons for nonselection to be pretextual, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency discriminated against the grievant on the basis of race and that, "in the absence of such discrimination[,] the Agency would have selected her for the...[GS-13 position]." Therefore, the Arbitrator sustained the grievance, awarded the grievant a retroactive promotion to the GS-13 position, and directed the Agency to make her whole for any lost pay and benefits....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency disputes the Arbitrator's findings that its articulated reasons for nonselection were pretextual. The question of whether an employer's stated reasons for an employment action are pretextual is a factual one. <span class="Italic">See Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez</span>, 540 U.S. 44, 52 (2003) (quoting <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 804) (at third step of framework, claimant must establish that employer's "stated reason for [employment action] was <span class="Italic">in fact </span>pretext" (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 255 n.10 (1981) (pretext is a question for "trier of fact"); <span class="Italic">Dawson</span>, 630 F.3d at 936 (circumstantial evidence undermining employer's stated reasons "raise[s] a material question of fact on pretext"); <span class="Italic">Bonds v. Leavitt</span>, 629 F.3d 369, 386 (4th Cir. 2011) (claimant "failed to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding...pretext"); <span class="Italic">see also Cones v. Shalala</span>, 199 F.3d 512, 520 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (where pretext determination "ultimately turns on witness credibility," agency's stated reason for employment action "presents a question of fact that is...'quintessentially one for the finder of fact'"). As noted by the Union, the Authority has held that it will defer to arbitral findings--in connection with an arbitrator's analysis at the third step of the framework--that the stated reasons for an adverse employment action were pretextual. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 58 FLRA at 394. In this regard, the Authority defers to arbitral findings of pretext in the same manner that the Authority defers to other arbitral factual findings when applying the <span class="Italic">de novo</span> standard of review. <span class="Italic">See Ala. Nat'l Guard</span>, 55 FLRA at 40. Thus, we defer to the Arbitrator's factual finding that the Agency's stated reasons for not selecting the grievant for the GS-13 position were pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also contends that, as a matter of law, its failure to articulate legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons earlier in the grievance process is insufficient to establish pretext. The Agency does not cite any legal authority to support this contention, and it is not consistent with court decisions regarding this issue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., Inc.</span>, 439 F.3d 1286, 1298 (11th Cir. 2006) (holding that "employer's failure to articulate <span class="Italic">clearly </span>and <span class="Italic">consistently </span>the reason for an [adverse employment action] may serve as evidence of pretext" (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">Harvey v. Office of Banks &#x0026; Real Estate</span>, 377 F.3d 698, 711 (7th Cir. 2004) (holding that fact finder "entitled to infer that [employer's] decision was in fact motivated by racial animus[,]" where employer did not offer "any legitimate reason" for demoting employee when it first notified him of the demotion); <span class="Italic">Lamphere v. Brown Univ.</span>, 875 F.2d 916, 922 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding that "changing reasons, <span class="Italic">failure to articulate reasons contemporaneously</span>, [or] conflicts among individuals' reasons" may suggest pretext for discrimination (emphasis added)). Thus, we find that the Agency has not established that the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law in this respect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends further that the Arbitrator erred, as a matter of law, in finding that the grievant's qualifications were "plainly superior" to those of the selectee. In this regard, the Authority has held that, when an arbitrator bases an award on two or more separate and independent grounds, the appealing party must establish that all of the grounds relied on are deficient in order for the Authority to find the award deficient. <span class="Italic">E.g., Broad. Bd. of Governors, Office of Cuba Broad.</span>, 64 FLRA 888, 892 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Bd. of Governors</span>). If the excepting party has not demonstrated that the award is deficient on one of the grounds relied on by the arbitrator, then it is unnecessary to address exceptions to the other ground. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Arbitrator identified two separate and independent grounds to support his finding that the Agency's articulated reasons were pretextual. Specifically, he found that: (1) the Agency's articulated reasons were "unworthy of credence"; and (2) the grievant's qualifications were "plainly superior[.]" As discussed above, we have found that the Agency has not established that the Arbitrator erred in concluding that the Agency's reasons were "unworthy of credence[.]" As this conclusion provides a separate and independent ground for the award, we find it unnecessary to address the Agency's contention that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the grievant's qualifications were "plainly superior[.]" <span class="Italic">See Bd. of Governors</span>, 64 FLRA at 892.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency contends that the Arbitrator's findings of pretext do not support his ultimate conclusion that the Agency intentionally discriminated against the grievant. However, the Supreme Court has expressly held that findings of pretext, together with the elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, are sufficient to support a finding of intentional discrimination. <span class="Italic">See St. Mary's</span>, 509 U.S. at 511, 519. Because we have found that the Arbitrator did not err in his findings of pretext, and as the Agency does not contest that the Union established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, we find that the Arbitrator's framework analysis correctly applied the legal standard governing the disparate treatment claim.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Framework for Discrimination Claims</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973) (<span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>), the Supreme Court set forth the order of presentation and allocation of burdens in a Title VII case alleging discriminatory treatment in hiring. First, an applicant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing that he or she: (1) is a member of a protected class; (2) is qualified for the <span id="page_2067"></span>position; (3) was not selected for the position; and that (4) a person who is not a member of the protected class was chosen for the position. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Hicks</span>); <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board and National Labor Relations Board Union</span>, 44 FLRA 1223, 1233 (1992) (<span class="Italic">NLRBU</span>). Once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case has been established, the burden shifts to the employer "to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the [applicant's] rejection." <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802. In this connection, the employer "need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. It is sufficient if the [employer's] evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the [applicant]." <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 254-55 (citation omitted). Finally, if the employer articulates a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for not selecting the applicant, the burden shifts to the applicant "to show that [the employer's] stated reason for [the applicant's] rejection was in fact pretext." <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 804. At all times, the applicant bears the burden of persuasion as to the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination. <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 253.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determination as to whether the employer's proffered justification for not selecting an applicant is pretext--i.e., the determination as to whether the employer intentionally discriminated--is a factual one. <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. at 514-16. An applicant can show pretext either directly, by showing that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer, or indirectly, by showing that the employer's explanation is unworthy of credence. <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 256. The factfinder must believe the applicant's explanation of intentional discrimination; it is not enough to simply disbelieve the employer. <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. at 519.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's Conclusion that the Procedural Errors In the Selection Process Did Not Establish Pretext Is Not Contrary to Law</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its first exception, the Union claims that the "Agency's errors in the promotion process clearly show the discriminatory intent present in its nonselection of [the grievant]." According to the Union, "[b]ecause the Arbitrator's award did not follow established case law on procedural irregularity, it is contrary to law and cannot be upheld."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, an applicant claiming discriminatory nonselection bears the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the employer's proffered justification for its decision is pretextual. In attempting to persuade the trier of fact, the applicant can present a variety of evidence. Included in the types of relevant evidence to rebut an employer's claim to have promoted a better qualified applicant is evidence that the non-selected applicant was in fact better qualified than the person chosen for the position. <span class="Italic">Patterson v. McLean Credit Union</span>, 491 U.S. 164, 187-88 (1989).[3] In addition, evidence that the employer--without explanation or justification--deviated from standard procedures or made an "idiosyncratic or suspect" personnel decision is also relevant.[4] <span class="Italic">Lockhart</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Brady, Secretary, Dept. of Treasury</span> (EEOC Appeal 01911755 (Feb. 18, 1992)], slip op. at 13.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Krodel</span>, 748 F.2d at 708 (pretext found where the employer failed to offer any credible explanation of why the selectee was better qualified, statistics supported the charge of discrimination, and the employer's administrator and witnesses credibly testified that the employer generally favored younger employees); <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, slip op. at 3 (pretext found where the applicant's qualifications were "so far superior" than the selectee's and evidence demonstrated that selecting official manipulated the rating criteria, gave undue weight to experience not contained in the job description while discounting experience considered critical, and violated agency procedures and regulations during the selection process). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bauer v. Bailar</span>, 647 F.2d 1037, 1048 (10th Cir. 1981) (the nonselected applicant's qualifications "were not so plainly superior as to require a finding of pretext").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Lockhart</span>, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) found pretext where, along with other procedural irregularities, the agency did not satisfactorily explain why the selectee's application was considered despite the fact that the application was submitted beyond the closing date, did not contain one of the necessary appraisals, and was not signed and dated. This evidence, coupled with evidence of "idiosyncratic" selection decisions, the lack of credibility of the rating and ranking officials, the failure of those officials to comply with the agency's Merit Promotion Plan and the failure of those officials to offer any credible explanation for their failure to afford the applicant any meaningful consideration, sufficiently established pretext. The EEOC noted however, "that each piece of evidence...standing alone, would probably not show pretext." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Union is correct in its assertion that evidence of procedural irregularities in a selection process can demonstrate illegitimate motives on the part of an employer, whether those irregularities sufficiently establish that the Agency's proffered reason was a pretext is a factual matter that must be decided by the Arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. at 519. In his award, the Arbitrator addressed the Union's claims that there were procedural irregularities in the selection process and found that while there were some "unexplained aspects" of the ranking process, based on the evidence and testimony before him, those irregularities did not sufficiently demonstrate that the Agency had acted with discriminatory intent. In this respect, the Arbitrator concluded that because the grievant was ultimately given a "top rating," she was not adversely affected by any of the unexplained aspects of the ranking process. He also found that there was no evidence demonstrating that errors in the rating and ranking process improperly placed the selectee on the BQL. In addition, the Arbitrator did not find that any of the evidence demonstrated that the Agency improperly used its judgment regarding what aspects of the job and the applicants' backgrounds were most important in distinguishing among the applicants. In this regard, the Arbitrator found that the selectee did possess experience--which was relevant to the position--that the grievant did not possess, and that the Agency offered a credible explanation as to why the selectee was ultimately selected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent the Union claims that the Arbitrator was required to reach a particular conclusion on similar evidence as did the EEOC or the courts in other cases, the Union is not correct. While the cases cited by the Union in support of its allegation that the Arbitrator did not follow the "law on procedural irregularity" do provide guidance as to what may constitute sufficient evidence to establish pretext, they do not compel a different conclusion than that reached by the Arbitrator in this case. The Arbitrator did not improperly dismiss without consideration the evidence and testimony presented by the Union, nor did he conclude that the procedural irregularities alleged by the Union were not relevant to his pretext determination. Rather, he reviewed the record, addressing each of the Union's assertions, and made a factual finding that any procedural irregularities in this case did not adversely affect the grievant and did not demonstrate discriminatory motives on the part of the Agency. Having found that the Agency's decision was not based on unlawful criteria or illegitimate motives, the Arbitrator denied the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As there is nothing in the Arbitrator's award or the record demonstrating that he applied a standard that is contrary to law to the facts in this case, and because we defer to the Arbitrator's factual finding that the Agency's proffered reason for its selection was not pretextual, we conclude that the award is not deficient because it is contrary to law<span class="Italic">. Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, 491 U.S. at 187-88 (vacating decision where the lower court erred in holding that for the applicant to demonstrate pretext, she was required to prove that she was better qualified than the selectee).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's Conclusion that the Alleged Remarks Did Not Establish Pretext Is Not Contrary to Law</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its second exception, the Union, relying on <span class="Italic">Cavey</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Frank, Postmaster General, U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01903397 (December 4, 1990)] and <span class="Italic">Sebring</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Veterans Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. B01780234 (February 6, 1981)], argues that the Arbitrator's treatment of the three remarks the Union introduced was "cursory and did not conform to law regarding evidence of pretext and discriminatory intent." Citing <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the Union also asserts those statements establish that the Agency had a prevalent discriminatory atmosphere that caused the grievant "to be subjected not only to an improper selection process, but also to a biased grievance process."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]n applicant claiming discriminatory nonselection can present a variety of evidence in an attempt to persuade the trier of fact that the employer's proffered justification for its selection was pretextual. Included in the types of relevant evidence is evidence of sex-based questions posed to female applicants but not to male applicants.[6] In addition, evidence of the utterance of discriminatory statements that create and demonstrate a prevalent discriminatory atmosphere in the workplace is relevant.[7] However, it is the record as a whole, which may include evidence of sex based statements, that supports an ultimate finding of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cavey</span>, slip op. at 7 (the record as a whole, which included evidence that the selecting official's justifications for choosing the male applicant were not credible because there was no information supporting them, led to a finding of discrimination); <span class="Italic">Sebring</span>, slip op. at 3 (evidence of severe statements, the inability of the agency to point to any objective criteria in the selection process, and statistics showing an abundance of women in lower level dead-end jobs, demonstrated that the agency's sole justification for its selection of the male candidate over the higher rated female candidate--the selectee's ability to handle himself in the interview--was pretext).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Cavey</span>, slip op. at 7 (where the EEOC found that sex-based questions made by the selecting official--whether male employees would work for the female applicant and whether she would take male employees to a bar if they came to her with problems--were a "strong indication" that the applicant was not selected because the official had sexually stereotyped views about women).</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_2068"></span>[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sebring</span>, slip op. at 3 (EEOC relied in part on severe and offensive statements made by the selecting officials and sexist statements made by fellow employees, in finding the agency had an atmosphere of bias); <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, slip op. at 7 (EEOC found that "the pervasive anti-black, anti-female attitudes which were well-entrenched at the agency" and were encouraged by management, impermissibly tainted the selection process resulting in a black female, who had more experience than the selectee that she had trained, not being selected).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator addressed each of the three comments that the Union argued demonstrated pretext. Specifically, the Union asserted that those comments showed the Agency had a prevalent discriminatory atmosphere and viewed the position at issue to be a "male job." In dealing with each comment individually, the Arbitrator addressed the credibility of the witnesses testifying with regard to the comments and made a factual determination that these statements did not sufficiently demonstrate that the Agency made its selection based on illegal motives.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the statement made during the initial briefing, the Arbitrator found that it was not made by management. The Arbitrator did not find, as alleged by the Union, that those statements could not be evidence of discriminatory motives. Rather, he made a factual determination that the statements did not demonstrate pretext in this case because they were not made by management. With respect to the statement allegedly made by one of the interviewing officials, the Arbitrator found that the interviewing official's testimony that any statements were made to all applicants to explain what the position involved was "reasonable and credible." The Arbitrator also found that the grievant was ranked by that official "at the top of the heap[.]" Finally, the Arbitrator addressed the statement allegedly made by the third-step grievance official, and determined that it did not impact on the selection process. Based on these findings, the Arbitrator concluded that the statements the Union alleged demonstrated pretext, did not sufficiently show that the Agency acted with a discriminatory motive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the cases cited by the Union in support of its exceptions compels a different conclusion or demonstrates that the standard applied by the Arbitrator in evaluating the evidence was contrary to law.&#x2003;Further, the Arbitrator did not improperly find that such statements could not demonstrate pretext. Instead, the Arbitrator's finding that the three comments did not sufficiently establish pretext is a finding of fact that was properly based on the evidence and testimony before him. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. at 519; <span class="Italic">Cavey</span>, slip op. at 6 ("credibility judgments of persons in a position to hear and observe a witness are not overturned unless there is substantial evidence in the record to the contrary"). Contrary to the Agency's assertions, the Arbitrator's review of the alleged statements was not cursory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As there is nothing in the Arbitrator's award demonstrating that he applied a standard that is contrary to law to the facts in this case, and because we defer to the Arbitrator's factual finding that the Agency's proffered reason for its selection was not pretextual, we conclude that the award is not deficient because it is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, 491 U.S. at 187-88 (vacating decision where the lower court erred in holding that for the applicant to demonstrate pretext, she was required to prove that she was better qualified than the selectee).</p>
<p class="noindent">Earlier FLRA decisions were disinclined to sustain findings of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">VA Med. and Reg'l Office Ctr. of Wilmington and LIUNA, Fed. Local No. 1154</span>, 32 FLRA 701, 705 (1988), FLRA pushed its "but for" philosophy to the point of violating regulations implementing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. An arbitrator ordered the promotion of a grievant after the arbitrator concluded that the agency made its decision to select a less experienced, less skilled, and less qualified male "at least in part" because the grievant was a female. FLRA set aside the award because:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Although the Arbitrator found that the Agency's decision to pass over the grievant and select what he characterized as a less experienced, less skilled and less qualified employee to fill the WG-8 Cook position was motivated "at least in part" by the fact that the grievant was a female, he did not find that the grievant would have been selected for the promotion except for the Agency's discriminatory action....</p>
<p class="noindent">The problem was that FLRA apparently failed to follow government-wide EEO regulations that defining the burden of proof in an EEO case and the remedy that should be directed when that burden is not met. Under EEOC regulations, 29 CFR 1614.501(c) (2022), the employing agency was to provide a discriminatee a nondiscriminatory placement unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the employee would not have been promoted absent discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's analysis can avoid intricate analysis of burdens of proof. In <span class="Italic">HCFA, DHHS and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 35 FLRA 274, 291-93 (1990), rather than becoming involved in an analysis of the "but for" rule in a nonpromotion case, FLRA set out the elements of an age discrimination claim to show that the arbitrator had applied the proper analysis. Although the arbitrator did not discuss legal tests developed by the courts, nothing required him to do so. It was sufficient that the arbitrator analyzed the evidence in a manner showing that his analysis was consistent with the law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and NTEU Chap. 243</span>, 52 FLRA 358, 365 n.4 (1996), considered the use of statistics in grievances involving allegations of discriminatory nonselections for promotion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he statistical comparators discussed by the Arbitrator do not comport with well-settled law. Statistics on hiring and promotion patterns "may be used to establish an inference of discrimination as an element of plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, or to demonstrate that an employer's stated nondiscriminatory reason for its action is in reality a pretext." <span class="Italic">Carter v. Ball</span>, 33 F.3d 450, 456 (4th Cir. 1994) (<span class="Italic">Carter</span>). The relevant comparison to be made in either case is between the percentage of minority employees and the percentage of potential minority applicants in the qualified labor pool. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Hazelwood School District v.

<p class="noindent">Reviewed in <span class="Italic">Alabama NG and Alabama ACT</span>, 55 FLRA 37, 40-42 (1998), was the award of an arbitrator who decided that a promotion was granted through preselection based on management's interest in meeting goals in an affirmative action plan. The arbitrator, deciding that the agency violated contract provisions designed to ensure fairness in the promotion process, awarded promotion to two grievants. FLRA sustained the finding of a contract violation, but it sent the case back to the arbitrator to reconstruct what would have occurred but for the violation, i.e., whether a particular grievant would have been promoted or, if that determination could not be made, whether priority consideration would be appropriate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has alleged that the remedy portion of the award violates its management rights under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. The Authority's framework for resolving exceptions alleging that an award violates management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute is set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury,</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C.</span> <span class="Italic">and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 201,</span> 53 FLRA 146, 151-54 (1997) <span class="Italic">(BEP). </span>Upon finding that the award affects a management right under section 7106(a), the Authority applies a two-prong test.

If the award provides such a remedy, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong I of the framework and will then address prong II. Under prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP, </span>the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 154. If the arbitrator's remedy reflects such a reconstruction, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong II. For the reasons that follow, we set aside the remedy portion of the award and remand it to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator to determine an appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that an award requiring an agency to make an actual selection for an appointment affects management's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, Council 220 and</span> <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Region VI, Dallas,</span> <span class="Italic">Texas, </span>54 FLRA 1227, 1234 (1998) (Authority held that an award which placed the grievant in a position affected management's right to select); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, San Francisco Region and American Federation of Government Employees, Council 147, </span>48 FLRA 293, 302 (1993) (Authority found that an award ordering retroactive promotion of the grievants affected, but did not impermissibly interfere with, management's right to select). Here, the award orders the Agency to promote the grievants retroactively into WG-9 automotive worker positions. Consequently, the award affects management's right to select.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to prong I, there is no contention that the provisions of the parties' agreement enforced by the Arbitrator, namely Article 20, sections 2 and 6(b)(3), were unenforceable<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., VAMC Coatesville, 53</span> FLRA at 1429; <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force,</span> <span class="Italic">Warner Robins Air Logistics Center Warner Robins Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force Base, Georgia and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 987, </span>53 FLRA 1344, 1348 (1998). Moreover, the Agency has essentially conceded that the Arbitrator was enforcing a contract provision negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b), by focusing its arguments on reconstruction and only excepting to the remedy portion of the award. Accordingly, we find that the award satisfies prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong II, the question is whether the Arbitrator's remedy, directing the Agency to promote both grievants retroactively, is a proper reconstruction of what the Agency would have done had it not violated the parties' agreement. As the Agency suggests, in order to apply prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis, it is essential to identify how the violation relates <span id="page_2069"></span>to the remedy. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Commission and District No. 1, Marine</span> <span class="Italic">Engineers Beneficial Association, </span>54 FLRA 1161, 1174 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Panama Canal</span>). Here, the Arbitrator did not explain how the Agency's selection of Harris for the WG-9 position vacancy, which violated the EEO and preselection provisions of Article 20 of the parties' agreement, related to the retroactive promotion of both grievants into WG-9 positions. The Arbitrator found, and it is undisputed, that the grievants were not properly considered for the position. The Arbitrator also concluded that Harris was preselected for that position. However, the Arbitrator never determined who was the best qualified candidate for the position. In this regard, the Arbitrator only stated that "[h]ad all candidates been properly considered by [the selecting official] in accordance with the merit promotion system and the Affirmative Action Plan, then perhaps Harris' selection would have been proper." Thus, the Arbitrator did not find, nor is the record sufficient to determine, which candidate would have been selected for the position, had the Agency not violated the parties' agreement<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Orlando, Florida and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3627</span>, 54 FLRA 609, 614 (1998) (<span class="Italic">SSA Orlando</span>) (Authority found that the arbitrator's order of a retroactive promotion with backpay was contrary to the Back Pay Act because the arbitrator failed to find that the grievant would have been selected but for the agency's actions); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Louisiana</span> <span class="Italic">State Office, New Orleans, Louisiana and American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, Local 3475,</span> 53 FLRA 1611, 1620 (1998) (Authority remanded the case to the parties, and denied the grievant a retroactive promotion, because the record did not contain sufficient information to determine whether the grievant qualified for the position).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only basis the Arbitrator provides for his promotion award is TPR Part II, paragraph 1. This regulation provides an exception to competitive placement when a candidate is not given proper consideration, but it only affords placement as a result of priority consideration. Here, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to promote both grievants retroactively. Had the Arbitrator determined which grievant was best qualified for the position, assuming that Harris was not, he could have promoted that grievant retroactively and granted the other grievant priority consideration for the next available vacancy, to address the Agency's failure to properly consider the grievants<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., VAMC Houston,</span> 36 FLRA at 129. Or, if the Arbitrator was unable to determine which grievant, if either, was best qualified for the position, he could have simply granted the grievants priority consideration as a remedy. The Arbitrator also could have ordered the Agency to re-run the vacancy announcement and properly consider the grievants, as well as Harris, for the position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Social</span> <span class="Italic">Security Administration, Office of Hearings and</span> <span class="Italic">Appeals and American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Council 215, AFL-CIO, </span>54 FLRA No. 116, slip op at 10 n.6 (1998) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 215</span>), <span class="Italic">citing U.S. Small Business Administration, Atlanta,</span> <span class="Italic">Georgia and American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 3906, </span>37 FLRA 137, 143 (1990); <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Commission and Maritime Metal Trades</span> <span class="Italic">Council, </span>52 FLRA 404, 406 (1996). However, as the award stands now, we are unable to determine upon what basis the Arbitrator ordered the promotion of the two grievants, when only one position was at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we find the remedy portion of the award deficient because it does not represent a proper reconstruction of what the Agency would have done had there been no violation. Accordingly, we set aside the Arbitrator's order to promote both grievants retroactively. However, such a result would leave the Union with no remedy for the violation found by the Arbitrator<span class="Italic">. See AFGE, Council 215, </span>54 FLRA No. 116, slip op at 10; <span class="Italic">SSA Orlando</span>, 54 FLRA at 614. Therefore, it is appropriate to remand this portion of the case to the parties, for resubmission to the Arbitrator to determine an appropriate remedy, if the parties cannot resolve the dispute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Council 215, </span>54 FLRA No. 116, slip op at 10; <span class="Italic">SSA, Orlando, </span>54 FLRA at 614 (citations omitted).</p>
