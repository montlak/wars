<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-56"><span class="space">2.</span> Individual Regarded or Perceived as Disabled</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Southerland v. DOD</span>, 117 MSPR 56, 65-66 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26-27, 2011 MSPB 92 (2011) [replacing the decision at 2011 MSPB 78 (2011)] (overruled on other grounds<span class="Italic">,</span> <span class="Italic">Southerland v. DOD</span>, 119 MSPR 566, 2013 MSPB 46 (2013)), explained the concept of an individual who is regarded as having a covered impairment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ADAAA defines a disability, in relevant part, as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities"[3] or "[b]eing regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1)(A), (C); <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1)(i), (iii). With respect to the "regarded as having such an impairment" provision, both the ADAAA and the amended regulations explain that "[t]his means that the individual has been subjected to an action prohibited by the ADA as amended because of an actual or perceived impairment that is not both 'transitory and minor.'" [4] 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(3); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1)(iii); <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, &#x00A7; 1630.2(l)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The amended regulations provide that "[a]n impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of this section." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). They explain that "the term 'substantially limits' shall be interpreted and applied to require a degree of functional limitation that is lower than the standard for 'substantially limits' applied prior to the ADAAA." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(iv).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Appendix to Part 1630 clarifies that the "transitory and minor" exception to coverage under the "regarded as" prong is a defense to a claim of discrimination but that "this limitation on coverage should be construed narrowly." Appendix to Part 1630, 76 Fed. Reg. at 17,015; <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.15(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The amended regulations further explain that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[w]&#x2003;here an individual is not challenging a covered entity's failure to make reasonable accommodations and does not require a reasonable accommodation, it is generally unnecessary to proceed under the "actual disability" or "record of" prongs, which require a showing of an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity or a record of such an impairment. <span class="Italic">In these cases, the evaluation of coverage can be made solely under the "regarded as" prong of the definition of disability, which does not require a showing of an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity or a record of such an impairment.</span> An individual may choose, however, to proceed under the "actual disability" and/or "record of" prong regardless of whether the individual is challenging a covered entity's failure to make reasonable accommodations or requires a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(3) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(2) ("Whether an individual's impairment 'substantially limits' a major life activity is not relevant to coverage under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) (the 'regarded as' prong) of this section.").[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We note that 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(iii) &#x0026; (v) provide that "the threshold issue of whether an impairment 'substantially limits' a major life activity should not demand extensive analysis" and that this determination "usually will not require scientific, medical, or statistical analysis...." Although the appellant's medical records are relevant to resolving the insubordination charges, it is unlikely the administrative judge needs to consider these records in addressing the "regarded as" prong of the ADAAA and EEOC's implementing regulations; there appears to be no dispute that the appellant has a 10-pound lifting restriction. <span class="Italic">See infra</span> note 6 and accompanying text.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the later opinion, <span class="Italic">Southerland v. DOD</span>, 119 MSPR 566, 573 &#x00B6; 17, 2013 MSPB 46 (2013) (Member Robbins concurring), the Board noted that "the EEOC's amended regulations explain that '[e]stablishing that an individual is 'regarded as having such an impairment' does not, by itself, establish liability. Liability is established under Title I of the ADA only when an individual proves that a covered entity discriminated on the basis of disability within the meaning of section 102 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12112.'"</p>

The agency has not challenged that finding by filing its own petition for review, and therefore it is adopted as a finding of the Board. Because the appellant has been found to be a disabled individual, she cannot also claim that she is not disabled but that the agency discriminated against her because it regarded her as disabled. Therefore, to the extent that the administrative judge committed adjudicatory error in failing to consider this claim, any such error did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">Panter v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, the evidence of record shows that the agency erroneously "regarded" the appellant as disabled since it relied on this impermissible motive, its perception that he had a condition that substantially limited the major life activity of working, when it proposed and effected his removal.[2] Even though the investigation into the appellant's statements showed that they were not as they had been characterized to the appellant's subordinate, the agency proposed to discipline the appellant for his remarks. Additionally, the deciding official, who was aware of the appellant's treatment for depressive illness, and that the appellant's treating professionals stated that the appellant was not homicidal, and that the appellant acted appropriately under pressure in the past, testified that he remained "gravely concerned...about what [the appellant] might do under future stressful circumstances, or even any other circumstances[.] " He stated that the statements that the appellant made to his coworkers should have been made only in therapy with his counselor. Additionally, he testified that he believed the appellant's misconduct was in explaining his psychological condition to others, and the effect that telling that he had been in therapy might have on the workplace. The deciding official minimized the appellant's prior outstanding performance evaluations and recommendation from program review for excellent work as a security officer. He also gave no consideration to the fact that the appellant acted appropriately after he had thoughts of harming his superior, by seeking treatment immediately. Additionally, he gave no consideration to the fact that the appellant's depression was controlled and that he had been released to return to work by medical professionals, who expected his performance after his return to work to be at the same level as his past performance. The deciding official testified that he viewed the appellant as not to be trusted around firearms "where the means and opportunity for homicides are immediately present. He also testified that he considered the appellant's potential for rehabilitation "to be nil. He thus treated the appellant as foreclosed generally from performing the duties of a security officer. <span class="Italic">See Forrisi</span>, 794 F.2d at 935.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The "regarded as" category covers individuals who are <span class="Italic">not disabled</span> but who, because of attitudes or for any other reason, are regarded as disabled by others who have an effect on the individual securing, retaining, or advancing in employment. <span class="Italic">Washington v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The remarks, referenced above, indicating what entered into the decision-making process regarding the appellant, show that the removal decision was made in reliance on the impermissible motive of the appellant's perceived disability. The evidence of discrimination therefore is tied directly to the alleged discriminatory animus, the perception of the appellant as disabled by his depression and treatment, and constitutes direct evidence of disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Fields v. New York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities</span>, 115 F.3d 116, 122 (2d Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Ostrowski v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Cos</span>., 968 F.2d 171, 181 (2d Cir. 1992). Where an appellant establishes direct evidence of discrimination on the basis of disability, to prevail, that is, to show that discrimination on the basis of disability was a motivating factor, he must also show that the agency's admittedly discriminatory action was prohibited, i.e., that he is a qualified disabled person against whom the agency may not discriminate. <span class="Italic">See Monette v. Electronic Data Systems Corp</span>., 90 F.3d 1173, 1184 (6th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 552, 561 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "qualified" disabled person is a disabled person who can perform the essential functions of his position, with or without reasonable accommodation, without endangering the health and/or safety of himself and/or others. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(a). The appellant showed that he was a qualified disabled person protected by the discrimination laws because, as discussed above with respect to the charges, the evidence showed that he was capable of performing his job duties without accommodation. Thus, in this case, the appellant established by direct evidence that his perceived disability was an impermissible "motivating factor" in the agency's removal action. The record shows, however, that another factor also motivated the agency's decision, specifically the sustained charge of bringing an unauthorized firearm onto the grounds of a correctional facility. Thus, the appellant's evidence of discrimination based on disability merely establishes that the agency had mixed-motives, both permissible and impermissible, for its decision. <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 246 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Rehabilitation Act, the remedies available to an employee who proves discrimination because of his disability are defined by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794a. Under Title VII, a federal employee is entitled to some relief if he proves that his disability was a "motivating factor" in the decision made, "even though other factors also motivated" the agency's decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(m), 2000e-16; <span class="Italic">Jones v.

Section 2000e-2(m) amended Title VII to replace the "mixed-motive" framework for analyzing claims of discrimination based on direct evidence set forth in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,</span> 490 U.S. 228, 246 (1989), that is, that, even if an employee proves that membership in a protected category was a substantial factor in the decision to discipline, he is not entitled to any remedy if the employer proves that it had a legitimate motive for the action, that standing alone, would have induced it to make the same decision. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 601, 605 (1994). Section 2000e-2(m) modified the rule of <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> to hold the employer "liable once the plaintiff shows that a protected characteristic played a motivating part in the employment decision." <span class="Italic">See George v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency may limit the extent of the remedy available to the employee, however, if it proves that it would have made the same decision "in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor," i.e., discrimination on the basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B).

<p class="Body-Text">For accommodation to be required for an individual perceived or regarded as being disabled, the evidence must demonstrate that, by reason of the employer's perception the agency viewed the appellant as foreclosed from performing jobs in his geographical area open to the average person having comparable training, skills, and abilities in the appellant's geographical area, <span class="Italic">Carter v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the "regarded as" definition of disability, the AJ, in finding that the agency regarded the appellant as having a substantial impairment, relied entirely on the fact that the "removal action was based on a conclusion that the appellant's back problem rendered him unfit to work as a Supervisory Border Patrol Agent." However, the fact that an employee was terminated as a result of his medical condition is not sufficient alone to establish that the employer regarded him as being substantially impaired in the life activity of working. <span class="Italic">See Moore,</span> 221 F.3d at 952-55; <span class="Italic">Thompson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the record does not support a finding that the agency regarded the appellant as disabled and that it discriminated against him based on his disability by denying his request for reasonable accommodation. Individuals may qualify as disabled under the "regarded as" definition when: (1) An employer mistakenly believes that a person has an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; or (2) an employer mistakenly believes that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, 119 S.

"In both cases, it is necessary that [the employer] entertain misperceptions about the individual--it must believe either that one has a substantially limiting impairment that one does not have or that one has a substantially limiting impairment when, in fact, the impairment is not so limiting." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2150. Thus, "[A]n employee who is merely regarded as disabled by the agency does not need accommodation to perform the essential functions of [his] position because [he] 'does not actually have...a substantially limiting impairment."' <span class="Italic">McFadden v.

Therefore, once the AJ found that the appellant did not have a substantially limiting impairment and that the agency perceived him as substantially impaired, she should not have proceeded to address the reasonable accommodation issue and find that the agency discriminated against the appellant based on his perceived disability by denying his request for reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence, here, shows that the agency at most merely regarded the appellant's chronic back problem as foreclosing him from performing the duties of an LEO eligible for LEO retirement coverage under the Federal Employees' Retirement System, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8407(17), 8412(d), 8422(a)(2)(B), or the Civil Service Retirement System, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8331(20), 8336(c). The appellant has not presented sufficient evidence showing that an alleged physical inability to perform the duties of a covered LEO position significantly restricts his ability to perform a class of jobs in his geographical area as compared to the average person having his comparable training, skills, and abilities.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant reasserts on petition for review his argument that he was disabled because he had a record of an impairment that substantially limited his major life activity of working. An employee satisfies this definition of disability if he "has a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(k). The intent of the "record of" method of proving disability is "to ensure that people are not discriminated against because of a history of a disability...[F]or example,...former cancer patients...based on their prior medical history...[and] individuals misclassified as learning disabled...." 29 CFR part 1630, app., <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To support his argument that he was disabled based on a record of substantially limiting condition, the appellant merely relies on the fact that he was removed for his physical inability to perform the duties of his position and the documentary evidence in the record addressing his removal.

An appellant who raises a claim of disability discrimination must first establish that he is a disabled person entitled to protection of the disability discrimination laws. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22. A disabled person is one who has a "physical or mental impairment" that "substantially limits" one or more "major life activities," who has a record of such an impairment, or who is regarded as having such an impairment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g); <span class="Italic">Fraser v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not argue below that he actually had, or had a record of having, a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities. Rather, the appellant claimed that the agency mistakenly believed that he had such an impairment, because the agency removed him based on its erroneous perception that the impairments identified in his July 2002 fitness for duty examinations rendered him physically incapable of performing the duties of his position. An appellant may qualify as disabled under the "regarded as" definition when: (1) an employer mistakenly believes that the appellant's actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) the appellant's actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits a major life activity only as a result of the employer's attitude toward the impairment; or (3) an employer mistakenly treats the appellant as having an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities even though the appellant has no impairment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(l); <span class="Italic">Fraser</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 72, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the physicians who conducted the appellant's fitness for duty examinations in July 2002 that were the basis for his removal, the appellant had the following physical limitations, primarily attributable to <span id="Page_3422"></span>weakness and instability in his right knee: walking continuously for four hours; repeated bending for two hours; negotiating slippery or uneven walking surfaces; working on ladders or scaffolding; and climbing up to 50 feet. Dr. Petrofsky and Dr. Ellison concluded that because of these limitations, the appellant was physically incapable of safely performing the duties of his position, which required, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, conducting on-site inspections of various utilities facilities under his supervision, walking on slippery and uneven surfaces around a water reservoir, climbing ladders and scaffolding, and bending and stooping in confined spaces and around machinery. The physicians agreed, however, that the appellant's limitations were not necessarily permanent, and the appellant could meet the physical requirements of his position if he "implements use of a knee brace, loses weight, increases his endurance, and engages in regular strengthening exercises." The record shows that the appellant's physical condition did improve, as he was found to be physically capable of performing the duties of his position following another fitness for duty examination in February 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the impairments identified in the July 2002 fitness for duty examinations are not substantial limitations of a major life activity and that the agency did not perceive them to be substantial limitations of a major life activity. While the identified impairments arguably impact the major life activity of "walking," we find that the appellant's impairments did not "substantially limit" his walking or any other major life activity. The appellant did not argue, let alone establish, that his impairments were severe or significantly restricted him in the performance of any major life activity compared to the average person in the general population. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii), (j)(2)(i).

<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual is "regarded as" disabled when a covered entity mistakenly believes that: (1) a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; or (2) an actual, non-limiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. In both situations, the covered entity must entertain some misperception regarding the individual--either that he has a substantially limiting impairment that he does not have or the impairment is not so limiting as believed....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual may also show that he was the victim of disability discrimination if he was regarded as disabled. An individual may qualify as disabled under the "regarded as" definition when: (1) An employer mistakenly believes that a person has an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; or (2) an employer mistakenly believes that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. <span class="Italic">Justice v.

In both cases, it is necessary that the employer entertain misperceptions about the individual--either that the individual has a substantially limiting impairment that he does not have or that he has a substantially limiting impairment when, in fact, the impairment is not so limiting. <span class="Italic">Carter v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...According to the appellant, the agency removed him because the proposing and deciding officials perceived him "as an employee who could not regularly work the overtime required by the chronically understaffed office." The appellant observes that, as a result of his medical condition, he frequently took leave, and in the ten months before the vehicle accident, letter carriers in his office were working ten hour days, six days a week.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not support the appellant's allegation that he was regarded as disabled. There is no evidence that the agency officials believed that the appellant was unable to perform the duties of his position and he admitted in his testimony that he frequently worked overtime prior to his removal. Furthermore, while the appellant does not specifically identify any major life activity that his medical condition affects, his arguments focus on work-related problems (absences from work and an inability to work overtime), and thus it appears that his argument is that his medical condition interferes with the major life activity of work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish that an individual was regarded as disabled from performing the major life activity of work, it must be shown that the employer believed that the individual was unable to perform a broad range of jobs compared to the average person having comparable training, skills, and abilities. <span class="Italic">Justice,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 379 &#x00B6; 25; <span class="Italic">Bullock v.

There is no indication here that the agency regarded the appellant as unable to perform the duties of his Postal Service position, let alone that he was unable to perform a broad range of jobs as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills, and abilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the appellant has failed to show that the agency regarded him as disabled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Use of the language "reasonable accommodation" in communications with an employee does not demonstrate that the agency regarded an employee as disabled if the agency neither regarded the employee as disabled nor treated her as disabled, <span class="Italic">Groshans v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 629, 638-39 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts in her petition for review that the agency should be "estopped" from denying that she is a disabled employee because it "treated her situation" as one involving a disability that required reasonable accommodation. The appellant asserts that the agency referred to accommodating her on the job as necessary, that on April 18, 1994, the agency held a meeting with the appellant to discuss "reasonable accommodation," that the agency Employee Relations Specialist issued a memorandum discussing proposed accommodation of the appellant's condition in terms of "reasonable accommodation," and that the proposed removal notice referred to the agency's being "unable to accommodate" the appellant's condition. Again, even assuming that the agency considered its efforts to deal with the appellant's condition as an accommodation to her anaphylaxis, such fact does not establish that the agency regarded her as disabled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC regulations supply the following definition of "regarded" as disabled:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Is regarded as having such an impairment means</span> has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by an employer as constituting such a limitation; has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitude of such employer towards such impairment; or has none of the impairments defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section but is treated by an employer as having such an impairment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(5).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reference to those who are regarded as having an impairment is intended to apply to those individuals who "do not in fact have the condition which they are perceived as having." <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 1297, 93d Cong., 2d Sess.

Bowen</span>, 794 F.2d 931, 934 (4th Cir. 1986)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in the court cases cited above, the record here is clear that the agency did not doubt the appellant's ability to perform as a Contract Specialist and, in fact, she was always given satisfactory or above-satisfactory performance ratings; instead, it doubted her ability to function in the physical environment of CM-3 and offered her the opportunity to work in a temporary location so that she would be safe. While there is no dispute that it sometimes employed the terminology of reasonable accommodation in its dealings with the appellant on this matter, there is no showing that the agency regarded the appellant as disabled or treated her as such. It merely responded to her self-identified respiratory impairment. <span class="Italic">Cf. Carr v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 61 MSPR 172, 179-80 (1994) (seeking additional medical information and statement that "[s]uch information is also necessary for management to determine how best to reasonably accommodate qualified handicapped employees" merely shows that agency was determining the appellant's status and what action it might take next).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc.</span>, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 2149-50 (1999), the Supreme Court decided that individuals who claim to be regarded as being disabled must demonstrate an error by the employer in assessing the disability of an individual or the job requirements of a position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under subsection (C), individuals who are "regarded as" having a disability are disabled within the meaning of the ADA. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 12102(2)(C). Subsection (C) provides that having a disability includes "being regarded as having," &#x00A7; 12102(2)(C), "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual," &#x00A7; 12102(2)(A). There are two apparent ways in which individuals may fall within this statutory definition: (1) a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or (2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. In both cases, it is necessary that a covered entity entertain misperceptions about the individual--it must believe either that one has a substantially limiting impairment that one does not have or that one has a substantially limiting impairment when, in fact, the impairment is not so limiting....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the second classification of individuals regarded as disabled, that is, an employer's erroneous judgment that a nonlimiting impairment limits the ability to work, <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> determined that the employee must prove that the limitation perceived by the employer prevents the employee from working in a class of positions rather than a particular job before the employer's decisions rise to the level of disability discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, the plaintiffs, applicants for global commercial airline pilot positions, were turned down by United Airlines because they did not meet uncorrected visual acuity requirements. The applicants complained that myopia constituted a disability and that the employer discriminated against them because their vision with correction equaled the employer's requirement for uncorrected vision. Disqualification for myopia did not rise to the level of covered discrimination because it did not foreclose a class of employment opportunity. For the same reason, the impairment would not support a finding that the employer erroneously regarded the applicants as disabled. Under <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 2150-51:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that petitioners are physically impaired. Petitioners do not make the obvious argument that they are regarded due to their impairments as substantially limited in the major life activity of seeing. They contend only that respondent mistakenly believes their physical impairments substantially limit them in the major life activity of working. To support this claim, petitioners allege that respondent has a vision requirement, which is allegedly based on myth and stereotype. Further, this requirement substantially limits their ability to engage in the major life activity of working by precluding them from obtaining the job of global airline pilot, which they argue is a "class of employment." In reply, respondent argues that the position of global airline pilot is not a class of jobs and therefore petitioners have not stated a claim that they are regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Standing alone, the allegation that respondent has a vision requirement in place does not establish a claim that respondent regards petitioners as substantially limited in the major life activity of working....&#8197;By its terms, the ADA allows employers to prefer some physical attributes over others and, to establish physical criteria. An employer runs afoul of the ADA when it makes an employment decision based on a physical or mental impairment, real or imagined, that is regarded as substantially limiting a major life activity. Accordingly, an employer is free to decide that physical characteristics or medical conditions that do not rise to the level of an impairment--such as one's height, build, or singing voice--are preferable to others, just as it is free to decide that some limiting, but not substantially limiting, impairments make individuals less than ideally suited for a job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the allegations of the amended complaint in tandem, petitioners have not stated a claim that respondent regards their impairment as <span class="Italic">substantially</span> limiting their ability to work. The ADA does not define 'substantially limits," but "substantially" suggests "considerable" or "specified to a large degree."...&#8197;The EEOC has codified regulations interpreting the term "substantially limits" in this manner, defining the term to mean "[u]nable to perform" or is significantly restricted." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(i), (ii) (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the major life activity under consideration is that of working, the statutory phrase "substantially limits" requires, at a minimum, that plaintiffs allege they are unable to work in a broad class of jobs. Reflecting this requirement, the EEOC uses a specialized definition of the term "substantially limits" when referring to the major life activity of working:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working." &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC further identifies several factors that courts should consider when determining whether an individual is substantially limited in the major life activity of working, including the geographical area to which the individual has reasonable access, and "the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within the geographical area, from which the individual is also disqualified." &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(H)(A), (B). To be substantially limited in the major life activity of working, then, one must be precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, or a particular job of choice. If jobs utilizing an individual's skills (but perhaps not his or her unique talents) are available, one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs. Similarly, if a host of different types of jobs are available, one is not precluded from a broad range of jobs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The perception by an agency manager of a lack of emotional stability of an appellant does not establish a disability if there is no evidence that supervisors or managers viewed the appellant as being foreclosed generally from her line of work<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Stenmark v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 59 MSPR 462, 470 (1993); <span class="Italic">Schulte v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 126, 129 (1991) (an employee's inability to meet the demands of particular job because of an impairment does not necessarily mean the employee is disabled; the impairment must foreclose generally the type of employment involved). [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-145.html#sec6-144">Adverse Action Related to Disability</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That the employer incorrectly perceives the employee as disabled, and unjustifiably fires him, does not mean that the employer discriminated on the basis of disability unless the employee's health problems generally foreclosed employment. <span class="Italic">Bullock v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 88 MSPR 531, 534-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-19 (2001), explained the relation of disability discrimination and foreclosure of a broad class of employment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may remove an employee from the federal service if he is unable, because of a medical condition, to perform the duties of his position. <span class="Italic">See Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 54, 68-69 (1997). Here, the administrative judge found that the agency failed to meet its burden of showing that the appellant was medically unfit for duty. After a thorough review of the evidence and argument raised regarding this issue, including the extensive hearing testimony, we find that the agency's petition for review on this issue fails to show error in the initial decisions. Additionally, the administrative judge did not sustain the separate charge of excessive absenteeism, and the agency's petition for review does not challenge that determination. Accordingly, we affirm this aspect of that decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the agency discriminated against the appellant based upon a perceived disability, the administrative judge reasoned that the agency removed the appellant because it believed that he suffered from a psychological condition that precluded him from performing not only his former Supervisory High Voltage Electrician position, but high voltage electrical work generally. She further found that the appellant was performing his duties satisfactorily until he was reassigned, and, therefore, he was a qualified disabled person. Finally, she concluded that, since the agency removed the appellant because it regarded him as unfit for duty but did not articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for <span id="Page_3424"></span>its action, the removal was based on a perceived disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency disagrees with these findings and argues that under the Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc.,</span> 527 U.S. 471, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed.2d 450 (1999), and <span class="Italic">Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Inc.,</span> 527 U.S. 516, 119 S. Ct. 2133, 144 L. Ed.2d 484 (1999), the appellant was not regarded or perceived as disabled because he was not excluded from a broad range of jobs. The appellant responds that the agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> and <span class="Italic">Murphy</span> is misplaced because the agency has precluded him from electrician jobs. We agree with the agency that the administrative judge's focus was too narrow.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After correctly stating the elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination under <span class="Italic">Yates v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 MSPR 172, 178-79 (1996), the administrative judge found that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the agency viewed the appellant [&#8197;] as having a condition which precluded him from working. Furthermore, the record reflects that the agency viewed the appellant as unable to perform not only his high voltage electrician job but any other high voltage electrician job as well. I, therefore, find...that the agency regarded him as being disabled in that it thought he had an impairment that foreclosed generally the type of employment involved, i.e., high voltage electrical work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge then found that the appellant was a qualified disabled employee and that he was removed based on a perceived disability. This analysis is defective.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the analysis fails to determine whether the agency believed the appellant had a substantially limiting impairment. The administrative judge held that the appellant did not suffer a "delusional disorder" as the agency's medical witness found, and we find no reason to disturb that conclusion. However, the record is clear (and the parties agree) that the appellant suffered some type of mental disorder, generally described as an "adjustment disorder." There is no indication in the record that the appellant's disorder, by whatever name, is of such permanence or scope as to rise to a disability under the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the question was not, as the administrative judge believed, whether the agency believed merely that the appellant had a "condition which precluded him from working." That analysis skipped the crucial inquiry concerning whether the agency mistakenly believed that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limited one or more major life activities. <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, 119 S. Ct. at 2150. The agency's awareness of the existence of an impairment alone is not a sufficient basis to support a discrimination finding<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Hrobowski v. Henderson,</span> Appeal No. 01973951 (EEOC Aug. 31, 2000) (agency official's affidavit that he was "aware of her disability," by itself, did not mean that the agency regarded the complainant as having an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity); <span class="Italic">see also Sutton</span>, 119 S.

In addition to the factors outlined above, the following factors are relevant in determining whether an individual is substantially limited in the major life activity of working: 1) the geographical area to which the individual has access; 2) the job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment; 3) the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities within the geographical area from which the individual is disqualified because of the impairment; and/or 4) the job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment and the number and types of other jobs not utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills, or abilities within the geographic area from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(ii). The regulations specifically state that to be regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working, one must be regarded as precluded from more than a particular job. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Although not binding upon the Board, we may look to other jurisdictions for guidance. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span> 50 MSPR 523, 529 (1991). Since the issuance of <span class="Italic">Sutton and Murphy</span> in June 1999, several circuit courts of appeal have similarly addressed the meaning of the "substantially limited" provision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Moore,</span> 221 F.3d at 953-54 (an individual trained as a bus driver was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working by medical condition restricting his exposure to cold and damp environments; employment not generally limited and he was also actually employed as a charter bus driver); <span class="Italic">Sorensen v. University of Utah Hospital,</span> 194 F.3d 1084, 1087 (10th Cir. 1999) (a nurse was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working where her employer precluded her from working as a flight nurse because of a medical condition, but allowed her to work as a nurse in other areas of the hospital); <span class="Italic">Shipley v. City of University City,</span> 195 F.3d 1020, 1022 (8th Cir. 1999) (a former firefighter seeking reinstatement was not regarded as disabled because he was able to perform other jobs, e.g., as a car wash attendant, salesman, dry cleaner, and dish washer repairman). The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has also issued numerous decisions since the Supreme Court issued its decisions in <span class="Italic">Sutton and Murphy,</span> applying the principle that to be substantially limited in a major life activity an individual must be precluded from more than one job. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Buckler v. Mahle,</span> Appeal No. 03990123 (EEOC Sept. 8, 2000) (an individual was not substantially limited with regard to working where, although unable to perform as a communications specialist, he had successfully performed as an editor and project manager for the same agency); <span class="Italic">Flynn Banigan v. Reno,</span> Appeal No. 01973401 (EEOC Aug. 3, 2000) (an applicant for a Border Patrol Agent position was not substantially limited by the agency's vision requirements because she had a variety of skills and there were various positions that utilized those skills).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, as discussed above, the appellant was first reassigned from his High Voltage Electrician position to an Engineering Assistant position and then, after he was absent for a long period of time, the agency ordered him to undergo a psychological fitness for duty exam. Thereafter, the agency proposed the appellant's removal based on his medical unfitness for duty and excessive absences. In its proposal notice, the agency outlined the findings of the fitness for duty exam that the appellant's psychological condition prevented him from displaying mental and emotional stability, particularly when called upon to interact with his chain of command. The agency also cited the finding in the report that the appellant's condition prevented him from consistently working with others in a professional, courteous, and cooperative manner. Based on this, the proposing official stated that the appellant <span id="Page_3425"></span>was incapable of performing the duties of his position. The proposing official also stated that the appellant's inability to handle stress directly and adversely affected his ability to work safely with high voltage electricity. The deciding official agreed with these views and stated that the appellant's susceptibility to stress and his conduct on the job while under stress caused the official enormous concern.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Concerning the appellant's alleged stress-related inability to get along with his supervisor and others in the chain of command, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has held that an individual was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working where situational depression prevented her from working at one particular location under one particular supervisor. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Danzig,</span> Appeal No. 03AO0066 (EEOC May 4, 2000); <span class="Italic">see also McAlindin v. County of San Diego,</span> 192 F.3d 1226, 1235 (9th Cir. 1999) (mere trouble getting along with coworkers was insufficient to show a substantial limitation of a major life activity), <span class="Italic">amended on denial of rehearing</span>, 201 F.3d 1211 (9th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 530 U.S. 1243, 120 S. Ct. 2689, 147 L. Ed.2d 961 (2000). These holdings are consistent with the <span class="Italic">EEOC</span> Enforcement Guidance on <span class="Italic">the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> and <span class="Italic">Psychiatric Disabilities</span> at 5 (1997).[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Because the Enforcement Guidance was issued prior to the Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Sutton and Murphy,</span> we carefully view any, material from it. Nevertheless, we find the Guidance to be instructive here and generally consistent with those decisions. <span class="Italic">See Sorensen v. University of Utah Hospital,</span> 194 F.3d 1084, 1088 (10th Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Thus, to the extent that the appellant's condition limited his ability to work with particular coworkers or in a particular chain of command, the condition did not substantially limit him from the major life activity of working. This is consistent with the principle that to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working one must be precluded from a broad range of positions, not just certain positions which interact with certain employers or supervisors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, nothing in this record suggests that the agency viewed the appellant as precluded from a broad range of jobs, either inside or outside of the agency. Even if the agency believed that the appellant was unable to perform his Supervisory High Voltage Electrician position, it demonstrated that it did not believe that he was unable to perform similar positions by placing him in the Engineering Assistant position.[9] Beyond that, however, there is no evidence that the agency believed that the appellant was incapable of performing jobs consistent with his skills and abilities in the greater Montgomery, Alabama area, where the agency is located and the appellant resides. Given the administrative judge's finding that the appellant satisfactorily performed the duties of his original assigned position, and in light of the fact that the agency reassigned him to less strenuous but related duties in another position, the only reasonable conclusion is that the appellant's condition did not substantially limit his ability to work at all.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we conclude that the appellant was not perceived by the agency as disabled. The agency did not believe that the appellant was precluded from a broad range of jobs in his geographic area. Accordingly, the administrative judge incorrectly found that the agency had discriminated against the appellant based on his perceived disability. Those findings in the initial decision are hereby reversed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Based on our review of the cases, regulations, and guidance set forth above, we find that the Engineering Assistant position was sufficiently similar to the appellant's Supervisory High Voltage Electrician position to show that the appellant was not precluded from a broad range of jobs. Thus, the agency's offer of the position supports its claim that it did not perceive him to be disabled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's analysis of discrimination based on an unfounded perception of an individual as disabled was elaborated on in <span class="Italic">Stanley v. DOJ</span>, 48 MSPR 1, 6-8 (1991), involving a correctional officer who, being removed for physical inability to perform his work, successfully established a disability discrimination case by showing that he could do the work and that the agency (incorrectly) perceived him as having a physical disability that foreclosed him from a type of employment--law enforcement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency need not accommodate an employee...if the employee does not qualify as a "handicapped person" under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702. <span class="Italic">See Lehman v. Department of the Army</span>, 30 MSPR 72, 74 (1986). The question of who is a "handicapped person" is best suited to a "case-by-case determination." <span class="Italic">See Forrisi v. Bowen,</span> 794 F.2d 931, 933 (4th Cir. 1986) (citing <span class="Italic">E.E. Black, Ltd. v. Marshall,</span> 497 F. Supp. 1088, 1100 (D. Hawaii 1980)). The inquiry is, of necessity, an individualized one--whether the particular impairment "substantially limits" the employee's ability to work or otherwise constitutes "a significant barrier to employment." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a) and (c); <span class="Italic">Forrisi,</span> 794 F.2d at 933. "Relevant to the inquiry are 'the number and type of jobs from which the impaired individual is disqualified, the geographical area to which the individual has reasonable access, and the individual's job expectations and training.'" <span class="Italic">Forrisi</span>, 794 F.2d at 933 (citing <span class="Italic">Jasany v. United States Postal Service,</span> 755 F.2d 1244, 1249 (6th Cir. 1985)). Further, an employee's inability to meet the demands of a particular job because of an actual or perceived impairment does not necessarily mean that the employee is handicapped. The impairment must foreclose generally the type of employment involved<span class="Italic">. See Anderson v. Department of the Navy,</span> 45 MSPR 136, 141 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Forrisi</span>, 794 F.2d at 934-35). <span class="Italic">See also Price</span> <span class="Italic">v. Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts,</span> Pet. No. 03900045, slip op. at 4-5 (EEOC May 4, 1990) (an impairment must significantly decrease an individual's ability to obtain satisfactory employment in order to be considered a "handicapping condition").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant meets the definition of a "handicapped person" under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a)(3) and (c). First, the parties agree that the appellant suffers from various permanent but treatable medical conditions, including a "hypercoagulable state secondary to circulating lupus anticoagulant" and hypertension. Second, although there is no evidence that any of the appellant's medical conditions affected his work performance at the time of the agency's action, the agency nevertheless removed the appellant based on its perception that his medical conditions created a risk of serious injury to the appellant and prevented him from safely performing all of the duties of his Correctional Officer position. <span class="Italic">See Geiger v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> Pet. No. 01901409, slip op. at 6 (EEOC May 23, 1990) (the appellant met the definition of a "handicapped employee" under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702 because the agency regarded him as being handicapped, having erroneously concluded that his knee injury impaired his ability to work). In sum, since the agency disqualified the appellant from employment as a Correctional Officer based on its erroneous perception that his medical condition prevented him from performing jobs in that line of work, we find that the appellant has met the test as enunciated in <span class="Italic">Forrisi,</span> 794 F.2d at 934-35. In this regard, the record shows that the appellant's work background consisted virtually exclusively of jobs in the field of law enforcement. Thus, the agency's reasons for finding that the medical impairment that it erroneously attributed to the appellant precluded his employment as a Correctional Officer would also make it difficult, if not impossible, for the appellant to secure other employment elsewhere consistent with his job expectations and training.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we find the appellant has shown that he is a "qualified handicapped person" who is entitled to the protection of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 701 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> because he is a handicapped person who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of his position without endangering the health and safety of himself or others. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(f). Indeed, the appellant's performance had been satisfactory up until the time of his stroke, and the record strongly suggests that the appellant would have remained capable of satisfactorily performing his full range of duties as a Correctional Officer, had the agency permitted him to remain in that position. In this regard, the appellant specifically stated in prehearing conferences and in "credible testimony" at the hearing that he desired to return to work as a Correctional Officer and that he believed that he would be able to perform all of the duties of that position. <span class="Italic">See also Jackson v. Veterans Administration,</span> 768 F.2d 1325, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (the Board must necessarily give special deference to the administrative judge's findings regarding credibility where those findings are based on the demeanor of witnesses). Moreover, even if we assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant's risk of serious injury was greater than that of other employees, the agency had previously accommodated other physically handicapped employees by limiting their exposure to stress and risk while still permitting them to perform as Correctional Officers, and the agency has not shown that the appellant could not be similarly accommodated. Accordingly, because the agency failed to establish that it could not reasonably and safely accommodate the appellant's perceived handicap, we agree with the administrative judge and find that the agency's adverse action constituted an act of discrimination against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee is actually disabled, it appears that the "regarded as disabled" classification is inapplicable, and the appeal is analyzed on the basis of the actual disability, <span class="Italic">McFadden v. DOD</span>, 85 MSPR 18, 23-24 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that the administrative judge found that the appellant was a disabled individual because the agency regarded her as having an impairment. An employee who is merely regarded as disabled by the agency does not need accommodation to perform the essential functions of her position because she "does not actually have...a substantially limiting impairment." <span class="Italic">Adams v. Reno,</span> EEOC No. 03940156, slip op. at 8 (Feb. 2, 1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Mansell</span> <span class="Italic">v. Donley,</span> EEOC No. 01891189, slip op. at n.18 (June II, 1993)); <span class="Italic">accord Yates v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 172, 179 (1996); <span class="Italic">see also Sutton v. United Air</span> <span class="Italic">Lines, Inc.,</span> 119 S. Ct. 2139, 2150 (1999) (under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), an employee is "regarded as" disabled when the employer "entertain[s] misperceptions about the individual--it must believe either that one has a substantially limiting impairment that one does not have or that one has a substantially limiting impairment when, in fact, the impairment is not so limiting"). Although <span class="Italic">Sutton</span> arose under the ADA, the ADA's standards have been <span id="Page_3426"></span>incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act. 29 USC &#x00A7; 791(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, an individual is considered "disabled" if she is "regarded as" having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. 29 USC &#x00A7; 706(8)(B)(iii); 42 USC &#x00A7; 12102(2)(C). Under the Rehabilitation Act, "is regarded as having such an impairment" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by an employer as constituting such a limitation; has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitude of an employer toward such impairment; or has none of the impairments as defined in (2) of this section but is treated by an employer as having such an impairment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29&#x2003;CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(5). The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's definition of "is regarded as having such an impairment" for ADA purposes is virtually identical, with no substantive differences. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency challenges the administrative judge's finding that it regarded the appellant as disabled. We agree with the agency's argument. The testimony discussed above shows that the appellant has a physical impairment that <span class="Italic">does</span> substantially limit her major life activities and that the agency correctly perceived that she was impaired. Because the appellant was actually impaired, we find that she was not "regarded as" having a physical impairment by the agency under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(5).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant asserts that she notified her agency that she had a substantially limiting impairment necessitating accommodation, she cannot be "regarded" as disabled. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v.
