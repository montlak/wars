<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-404"><span class="space">b.</span> Remands-Prior Law</h5>
<p class="noindent">Before <span class="Italic">VA Cleveland Reg'l Office and AFGE Local 2823</span>, 59 FLRA 248 (2003), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and through 1998, FLRA could, depending on how the arbitrator's analytical deficiency was characterized, vacate the award and do nothing (meaning that the union could not obtain fees) or remand the award for further consideration by the arbitrator. After confusion in the case law, FLRA issued its decision in <span class="Italic">USDA, APHIS and Nat'l Ass'n of Agric. Employees</span>, 53 FLRA 1688, 1693-95 (1998), involving an award of counsel fees that was arguably inconsistent with the law. FLRA announced that if the record did not permit FLRA to determine the proper resolution of the matter, it would remand the award for further proceedings. If the record permitted the appropriate resolution of the disputed matter despite a lack of proper explanation, FLRA would modify the award or deny the exception:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7122(a) of the Statute provides that on finding an award deficient, the Authority may take such action concerning the award as it considers necessary, consistent with applicable laws and regulations. In the past, the Authority's approach when an arbitration award failed to explain a grant of fees has depended on whether the failure related to the entitlement to attorney fees or to the amount of attorney fees. When the failure related to the underlying entitlement to attorney fees, the Authority has vacated the award and has not remanded the award for further proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Seymour Johnson AFB</span>, 46 FLRA at 463-64; <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">1770 and U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, XVIII</span> <span class="Italic">Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, North Carolina</span>, 44 FLRA 1287, 1290 (1992) <span class="Italic">(Ft. Bragg)</span>.[*] However, "when an arbitrator [found] entitlement to fees but fail[ed] to provide a reasoned decision as to the reasonable amount of attorney fees[,]" the Authority has either modified the award or remanded the award to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator to make the required determination. <span class="Italic">See Seymour Johnson AFB</span>, 46 FLRA at 463-64; <span class="Italic">accord DDRE</span>, 51 FLRA at 159. In addition, the Authority's approach when the deficiency was a legal error, rather than a failure to explain, has been to remand rather than vacate. <span class="Italic">See National Association of Government Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Local R4-6 and U.S. Department of the Army</span>, <span class="Italic">Fort Eustis</span>, <span class="Italic">Virginia</span>, 52 FLRA 1522, 1529 (1997) (arbitrator denied request for attorney fees on basis that his award did not encompass backpay; because that determination was inconsistent with the Back Pay Act, the award was remanded for consideration of the issue of attorney fees).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*]&#x2003;Prior to <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg</span>, awards that denied entitlement to attorney fees without sufficient explanation were remanded by the FLRA. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal</span> <span class="Italic">Revenue Service, Oklahoma City District, Lawton Oklahoma and</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter</span> 45, 37 FLRA 775, 783 (1990). In <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg</span>, the FLRA determined that there was no basis for treating an award that denies entitlement to attorney fees without sufficient articulation different from an award granting entitlement to attorney fees without sufficient articulation. 44 FLRA at 1290.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the issue of hearing expenses could be considered equally an issue of entitlement to expenses or an issue of the amount of expenses and, consistent with the foregoing, the consequence of the categorization is significant: a vacated award versus a remand for further proceedings. However, current precedent does not provide sufficient reasoning to allow us to resolve the issue presented by the exception. In particular, precedent does not assist in determining whether the failure of the award to explain the reasons for the grant of expenses relates to the underlying entitlement to recover the expenses or to the amount of recoverable expenses. This has caused us to reexamine whether the different categories of deficiencies previously identified by the Authority warrant different actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On reexamination, we find no basis in the Statute or the Back Pay Act for taking different action depending on whether the deficiency related to a legal error, entitlement, or amount. In addition, no policy in favor of these divergent actions is explained in case precedent or is apparent. Because of this lack of support for making these distinctions, as well as the difficulty in applying the categories created, we will no longer follow the Authority's prior approach to deficient attorney fee awards. Instead, the Authority's approach to deficient attorney fee awards should be consistent regardless of the type of the deficiency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, simply vacating awards that are not sufficiently explained, without further action, leaves unresolved the issue of whether the grievant is legally entitled to an award of attorney fees. Thus, our approach to awards that are not sufficiently explained will be to take the action necessary to assure that the award is consistent with applicable statutory standards. <span class="Italic">See Seymour Johnson AFB</span>, 46 FLRA 458.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case and future cases, we will no longer vacate without further proceedings attorney fee arbitration awards that are deficient because the arbitrator has not sufficiently explained the determination of a pertinent statutory requirement. Instead, in cases where the record does not permit the Authority to determine the proper resolution of the matter, we will remand the award for further proceedings to assure that <span id="page_2437"></span>the resolution of a request for attorney fees is consistent with law. In cases where the record permits the appropriate resolution of the disputed matter despite a lack of proper explanation, we will modify the award or deny the exception, as appropriate. Authority cases to the contrary will no longer be followed. We note that this approach is consistent with the approach of the MSPB to such matters. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Smit v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury</span>, 61 MSPB 612, 622, 624 (1994) (judge's decision awarding undocumented travel costs as part of a fee award remanded to require the employee to specifically identify the expenses).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the record does not indicate either that the requested hearing expenses are recoverable as part of an award of attorney fees under section 7701(g)(1) or that the amount is reasonable. Accordingly, we remand the claim of hearing expenses to the parties for further proceedings. We note that in its exceptions, the Agency has suggested a willingness to pay the expenses if presented with "an acceptable explanation or description[.]" However, if on remand the parties are unable to settle the dispute, the parties must resubmit the issue to the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent">Should an arbitrator disclaim interest in handling a remand concerning fees, FLRA could direct the parties to select another arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alabama ACT and DOD, Alabama NG</span>, 56 FLRA 231, 235 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">The remand policy was summarized, <span class="Italic">FOP New Jersey Lodge 173 and Dept. of Army, Army Garrison Ft. Monmouth</span>, 58 FLRA 384, 387 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an arbitrator denies a request for attorney fees, but does not address the statutory requirements for such an award, the Authority assesses whether the legal sufficiency of the arbitrator's denial can be derived from the record. <span class="Italic">See Ala. Ass'n of Civilian Technicians,</span> 54 FLRA 229, 233 (1998) <span class="Italic">(ACT). </span>If it cannot be derived, then the Authority remands the matter to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator denied the Union's request for attorney fees, but did not address the statutory requirements for such an award. While many of those requirements appear to be met, the record does not provide a sufficient basis for determining whether certain of those requirements are met. In particular, we are unable to resolve the Union's assertion that fees would be in the interest of justice because issues relevant to this determination cannot be resolved on the record before us.</p>

<p class="noindent">Under law predating <span class="Italic">APHIS</span>, if an award granting counsel fees was deficient because it was not fully supported as required, FLRA would set aside or modify the award as appropriate. Noting that its action would be considered exceptional, FLRA remanded one fee case to the parties for them to request the arbitrator to clarify and interpret his award of fees and to articulate findings on all pertinent statutory requirements. <span class="Italic">NAATS and FAA, Washington Flight Serv. Station</span>, <span class="Italic">on order granting request for reconsideration</span>, 21 FLRA 169, 171-73 (1986). But FLRA subsequently held that if an arbitrator's award of counsel fees did not comply with FLRA requirements, it would be set aside. The failure of the parties to provide the arbitrator with a copy of applicable FLRA rulings did not cure the deficiency, nor did it warrant a remand for clarification. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1749 and Laughlin AFB</span>, 24 FLRA 117, 119 (1986). A deficient fee award was stricken in <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ.

<p class="noindent">Through 1992, it was FLRA's practice that, if the award was deficient, FLRA could (but did not always) remand the case to the parties who were, in turn, directed to request the arbitrator to consider the fee request. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-106 and Dept. of Air Force, Langley AFB</span>, 32 FLRA 1159 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Oklahoma City Dist. and NTEU Chap. 45</span>, 37 FLRA 775, 783 (1990) ("The Arbitrator's one-sentence denial of the Union's request for attorney fees fails to satisfy that requirement."). If the arbitrator's discussion of a fee request was inadequate but the law would plainly preclude a fee award, there would be no remand. <span class="Italic">HCFA, DHHS and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 35 FLRA 274, 290-91 (1990). If the award did not contain the "fully articulated" decision supporting a fee award, FLRA struck that portion of the award concerned with fees, left intact the remainder of the award, and provided no remand to correct the defective fee analysis. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Allen Park and AFGE Local 933</span>, 38 FLRA 688, 699 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ.

That was a harsh result--a result that would always work against the union and for reasons having nothing to do with the merits of the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1992, FLRA attempted to provide some consistency in its treatment of deficient awards concerning fee issues. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army, Hq. XVIII Airborne Corps, Ft. Bragg</span>, 44 FLRA 1287, 1290 (1992), sustained union exceptions to an award denying fees, but FLRA declined to remand the case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Previously, the Authority has remanded to the parties awards denying attorney fees which were not fully articulated and reasoned. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Oklahoma City District and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 45</span>, 37 FLRA 775, 783 (1990). On review, we find no basis for resolving unarticulated denials of fees differently from unarticulated grants. Accordingly, we will set aside all unarticulated awards involving attorney fees under the Back Pay Act and previous inconsistent decisions will no longer be followed. We will continue to remand or modify other fee awards, as necessary. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration, Washington Flight Service Station and National Association of Air Traffic Specialists</span>, 27 FLRA 901 (1987) (portion of articulated award denying fees remanded; other portion modified). In so holding, we again remind the parties of their responsibilities and interests in assuring that arbitrators are advised of pertinent requirements in rendering awards.</p>
<p class="noindent">For an example of an award challenged by a union, found deficient, and then set aside without remand, refer to <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 44 FLRA 1301, 1304-05 (1992). FLRA found conclusory the arbitrator's finding that the underlying award did not constitute a service to the federal workforce or a benefit to the public:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In this regard, the Arbitrator's supplemental award states only that "the [A]gency position and arguments on the grievance clearly manifest...that there was no benefit to the general [F]ederal work force or to the public derived from the action." This conclusionary statement does not, in our view, meet the requirement that an arbitrator provide a fully reasoned, articulated decision. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's supplemental award denying fees on the basis that there was no service to the Federal work force or benefit to the public is deficient, and we will set aside the award....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See Dept. of Navy, Hq., Naval Dist. Washington and FOP, Navy Yard Labor Comm.</span>, 48 FLRA 1264, 1267 (1993) ("[W]e conclude that the Arbitrator's conclusionary statement that attorney fees were not warranted does not meet the requirement of a fully articulated, reasoned decision....&#8197;Accordingly, the Arbitrator's award denying attorney fees is deficient, and we will set aside that portion of the award."); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Polk and NAGE Local R5-168</span>, 44 FLRA 1548, 1568-69 (1992) (union's exceptions granted as to award that did not properly consider counsel fee request; award modified to strike fee denial, but no remand), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 45 FLRA 971, 974 (1992) (reconsideration decision: relying on <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg</span>, <span class="Italic">supra: </span>"absent agreement of the Agency, there are no steps the Union can take to obtain an arbitration decision in the requested fees").</p>
<p class="noindent">Just when FLRA convinced almost everyone that it would not remand deficient awards involving fee requests, it remanded a case in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-52 and Dept. of Army, Red River Army Depot</span>, 45 FLRA 830, 833-34 (1992). The arbitrator stated as the basis for denying fees that they could not be awarded without a provision in the collective bargaining contract, a conclusion inconsistent with the arbitrator's statutory authority under the Back Pay Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator made an award of backpay when he ordered that the grievants be paid any cash awards to which they may be entitled as the result of higher ratings.&#x2003;In 45 FLRA 626, we modified the award to require the Agency to reevaluate the grievants to determine their proper ratings and to pay them any cash awards that may be connected with those ratings. Therefore, the grievants may be entitled to backpay under the modified award. If the grievants are entitled to backpay for cash awards, the Arbitrator has jurisdiction under the Back Pay Act to consider and rule on the Union's request for an award of attorney fees. Accordingly, we will remand the issue of attorney fees to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator in the event that any or all of the grievants are found entitled to backpay under the modified award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that if an award granting or denying a request for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act is deficient because it fails to provide a <span id="page_2438"></span>fully articulated, reasoned decision setting forth specific findings on each pertinent statutory requirement, we will set aside the award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1770 and U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, North Carolina</span>, 44 FLRA 1287, 1289-90 (1992). Other fee awards will be remanded or modified, as necessary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1290. We are remanding the award in the instant case because, rather than failing to provide a fully articulated, reasoned decision setting forth specific findings on each pertinent statutory requirement, the Arbitrator improperly held that he did not have authority to render an award of attorney fees under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">In late 1992, FLRA again modified its case law to permit remands of fee cases when an arbitrator properly determined that fees should be awarded but failed to explain how the amount of fees was calculated or made an erroneous determination as to a reasonable amount, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-188 and Dept. of Air Force, Johnson AFB</span>, 46 FLRA 458, 463-65 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span>, which involved an arbitrator's failure to fully articulate a denial of a request for attorney fees, we also stated that we will continue to remand or modify attorney fee awards, as necessary. In this regard, we cited <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration, Washington Flight Service Station and National Association of Air Traffic Specialists</span>, 27 FLRA 901 (1987) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>). In <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, the Authority remanded portions of an arbitrator's attorney fee award that involved the determination of the reasonable amount of fees, because the arbitrator had failed to fully address all the fees claimed. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span>, we distinguished between two types of attorney fee cases: (1) those in which an arbitrator fails to provide an articulated, reasoned decision on the factors pertaining to entitlement to attorney fees; and (2) those in which an arbitrator finds entitlement to fees but fails to provide a reasoned decision as to the reasonable amount of attorney fees. Therefore, in accordance with <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span> and <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, we hold that when an arbitrator has properly found that attorney fees are warranted under the Back Pay Act and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), but has failed to explain how the amount of those attorney fees was calculated or has made an erroneous determination as to reasonable amount, we will either modify the award or remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator to make the required determination as to reasonableness, consistent with legal requirements. Where it is apparent from the record what the amount of attorney fees would have been if the arbitrator had made a proper determination, we will modify the award accordingly. Otherwise, we will remand the award to the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, after finding that an award of attorney fees was justified under the Back Pay Act and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the Arbitrator made errors of law with respect to the amount of fees that could be awarded and failed to fully explain the reasons underlying his calculation of reasonable attorney fees. It is not apparent from the record what the amount of attorney fees would have been if the Arbitrator had made a proper determination. We conclude, therefore, that a remand of the Arbitrator's award is appropriate. We will remand the deficient portions of the award to the parties so that they may request the Arbitrator to make a determination as to reasonable fees in accordance with legal requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union excepts only to the Arbitrator's determination as to the amount of attorney fees payable. There are no exceptions properly before us concerning the validity of the Arbitrator's award of attorney fees under the other criteria set forth in the Back Pay Act and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). Therefore, we address only whether the Arbitrator properly determined under the Back Pay Act and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) that an award of attorney fees in the amount of $1,800.00 is reasonable. We find that, with certain exceptions discussed below, the Arbitrator's determination of the reasonable amount of attorney fees is deficient. We will remand the matter to the parties for further proceedings consistent with this decision....</p>
<p class="noindent">More succinctly, FLRA explained its revised remand policy in <span class="Italic">DOD, DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr., Washington and AFGE Local 3407</span>, 47 FLRA 1187, 1197-98 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that an award granting or denying attorney fees under the Back Pay Act which fails to provide a fully articulated decision setting forth specific findings on each pertinent statutory requirement, is deficient and will be set aside. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1770 and U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, North Carolina</span>, 44 FLRA 1287, 1289-90 (1992). However, we have distinguished between two types of attorney fee cases: (1) those in which an arbitrator fails to provide an articulated, reasoned decision on the factors pertaining to entitlement to attorney fees; and (2) those in which an arbitrator finds entitlement to fees but fails to provide a reasoned decision as to the reasonable amount of attorney fees. When an arbitrator has properly found that attorney fees are warranted but has failed to explain how the amount of those attorney fees was calculated or has made an erroneous determination as to a reasonable amount, we will either modify the award or remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator. Where it is apparent from the record what the amount of attorney fees would have been if the arbitrator had made a proper determination, we will modify the award accordingly. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R5-188 and U.S. Department of the Air Force, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina</span>, 46 FLRA 458, 463-64 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Seymour Johnson AFB</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's practice in <span class="Italic">DMA</span> concerning remands of fee decisions was restated in <span class="Italic">DOD, Defense Distribution Region East, New Cumberland and AFGE Local 2004</span>, 51 FLRA 155, 159 (1995). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3310 and Dept. of Army, Waterways Experiment Station</span>, 53 FLRA 1595, 1600-01 (1998), added that remand rather than correction of a fee award was required when the arbitrator failed properly to apply the law governing what constitutes a prevailing party.</p>
<p class="noindent">The arbitrator could not award fees in a summary fashion and then retain jurisdiction to later fill in the legal blanks. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Norfolk and NAGE Local R4-83</span>, 40 FLRA 154, 157-59 (1991), admonished as to an award (set aside) that "the Agency [will] pay...reasonable attorneys fees [and that the] Arbitrator retains jurisdiction to resolve attorney fee disputes":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We take this opportunity to remind parties to arbitration proceedings of their interest in informing an arbitrator of the requirements which must be observed in making an award of attorney fees under the Back Pay Act.&#x2003;The Authority stated in <span class="Italic">National Association of Air Traffic Specialists and Federal Aviation Administration, Washington Flight Service Station</span>, 21 FLRA 169, 173 (1989), that "[i]n the future,...if the Authority finds that an award granting attorney fees is deficient because it is not fully supported as required, the Authority will set aside or modify the award as appropriate." The Authority also noted that in prior cases, parties were not "fully apprised by the Authority of their responsibility and interest in ensuring that arbitrators make the requisite determinations." Now that parties to arbitration awards have been fully apprised of the requirements for attorney fee awards, they bear some responsibility for making those requirements known to arbitrators. However, we must also point out that if arbitrators are informed of the requirements and still fail to comply by providing fully articulated decisions, such deficient attorney fee awards will be set aside....</p>
<p class="noindent">To the <span class="Italic">Naval Aviation</span> analysis FLRA added in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Transp. Ctr., Ft. Eustis and NAGE Local R4-6</span>, 40 FLRA 275, 281 (1991), that once a fee award is vacated, future proceedings concerning the fee application were barred unless the parties jointly agreed otherwise. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Norfolk and NAGE Local R4-83</span>, 43 FLRA 80, 85 (1991).</p>
