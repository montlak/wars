<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Kunert v. Dept. of Army</span>, CB-1208-12-0025-U-1 (NP 9/6/2012), found Board Member Robbins granting a stay that encompassed relief against continuation of actions constituting a hostile environment directed against a group of employees who made protected disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A), the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) requests a 45-day stay of the following actions while it completes its investigation into whether the listed actions constitute prohibited personnel practices under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8): (1) All agency actions to collect alleged debts, including repayment of retention bonuses, for any of the six affected individuals identified in this decision; (2) all agency actions that may adversely affect the employment prospects or employment tenure of the affected individuals, including any adverse employment recommendations to current or potential employers or to professional credentialing entities. For the reasons set forth below, I GRANT OSC's request IN PART.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its August 31, 2012 stay request, OSC alleges that the employees, Psychologists Holly Kunert, Michael O'Friel, and Mary Colleen Morgan, Licensed Professional Counselor Tamera Randolph, Administrative Assistant Brooke Wilkins, and Social Worker Teresa Williams, formerly constituted the nonsupervisory staff of the local Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) at Fort Richardson, Alaska. On January 13, 2012, the employees jointly reported to Joint-Base Elmendorf-Richardson Ombudsman Karl Hansen that their Clinical Program Manager and second-level supervisor, Terry Bates, had been observed knowingly falsifying, removing, and/or destroying clinical patient records, and that Bates also created a hostile work environment for her staff. Hansen recommended to Colonel George Appenzeller that the disclosures be investigated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 29, 2012, Regional Clinical Program Manager and Bates's immediate supervisor Scott Mims visited the clinic to conduct an inquiry. The command also sent local medical personnel to investigate the clinical aspects of the disclosures, and the agency temporarily suspended Bates's supervisory and clinical responsibilities. Although Mims found problems with Bates's leadership, he described his primary concern as the current clinical staff's disregard of the established chain of command. On February 10, 2012, Garrison Commander Colonel Ronald Johnson, Army Support Activity Director Michael Haney, and Bates met with the employees. The employees stated that Johnson told them that a review failed to substantiate their concerns, warned that if they could not accept the circumstances they would have to leave, and announced that he would reinstate Bates as clinic manager.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC alleges that, after Bates was reinstated, the following occurred concerning the individual employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">O'Friel</span>: Bates referred to O'Friel as the "ringleader" behind the investigation. On March 1, 2012, Bates provided new standards for recordkeeping and began to audit the employees' files, resulting in Bates berating and reprimanding O'Friel because he placed a form in a file that was 24 hours late. Three days after an employer informed Bates on May 14, 2012, that it was interested in hiring O'Friel, Bates placed him on a performance improvement plan to correct minor problems uncovered in her audit. By June 2012, O'Friel had accepted a new position, and he departed in late July 2012. The agency has sought repayment of retention incentives.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Morgan</span>: Morgan had decided during the investigation to leave the clinic. She gave notice of her resignation on February 10, 2012, and in her resignation letter, she expressed fear that continuing at ASAP would harm her clinical license and future employment prospects. In her letter, she asked that Bates not be told of her decision to leave. By June 2012, Morgan had resigned. The agency has sought repayment of retention incentives of over $2,000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Kunert</span>: On February 9, 2012, Kunert learned that she had not been selected for the vacant ASAP Supervisory Counseling Psychologist position and began to look for work elsewhere. On March 12, 2012, Bates relieved Kunert of her responsibilities as counselor for high-risk patients, although previously Bates had rated her "exceptional" in all performance categories. On March 14, 2012, Bates refused to provide Kunert with an employment reference, citing the agency's investigation, and later told <span id="Page_4064"></span>Kunert that she planned to audit Kunert's files. Kunert sought to return to her former position in Japan. On May 8, 2012, the former employer learned that Fort Richardson would not release Kunert for an inter-agency transfer, and, although Fort Richardson finally released her, it directed her to repay approximately $10,000 in incentive pay. By June 2012, Kunert took annual leave in anticipation of returning to Japan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Wilkins</span>: At the end of March 2012, Haney issued a letter of reprimand to Wilkins for discussing the details of her stressful work environment with another employee. The same day, Bates proposed to suspend Wilkins for failing to follow her instructions, specifically for delegating the task of delivering certain weekly reports to Bates to an intern instead of delivering them herself. Wilkins resigned on April 13, 2012.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Williams</span>: Under the new recordkeeping standards and audits, Bates rated Williams's performance as "needs work" for mistakes such as failing to write the date on a particular spot on a form and told her newly hired Supervisory Psychologist to reprimand Williams for questioning the rating. On June 1, 2012, Bates counseled Williams about minor discrepancies in her files and declared her insubordinate when she questioned the findings. Two weeks later, Haney terminated Williams's appointment during her probationary period, and, consequently, she was directed to repay a retention incentive of over $5,000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Randolph</span>: Bates canceled Randolph's access to the ASAP electronic file system, and, for the first time, required Randolph's patient records entries to be co-signed. On March 27, 2012, Dr. Wanda Kuehr, Bates's second-level supervisor, sent a letter to the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors accusing Randolph of misconduct and opposing her certification. On April 25, 2012, Bates rated Randolph "unacceptable" in 9 of 15 areas in which Randolph's previous supervisor had given her the highest possible score on her 2010 evaluation. By June 2012, Randolph took sick leave. On July 18, 2012, after she returned from sick leave, she learned that her clinical duties had been placed in abeyance pending investigation of Kuehr's charges, leading to her detail to non-clinical work and loss of retention pay. Although, by the end of July 2012, an independent credentialing committee dismissed the accusations against her, management refused to reinstate her retention pay. On August 10, 2012, Randolph left, accepting a demotion. Because she has only recently left ASAP, she has not yet received her notice of repayment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC contends that its request for stay of personnel actions is appropriate while it completes its investigation. It states that, based on the evidence that it has gathered to date, there are reasonable grounds on which to believe that the actions resulted from protected activity and therefore are prohibited under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC "may request any member of the Merit Systems Protection Board to order a stay of any personnel action for 45 days if the [OSC] determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the personnel action was taken, or is to be taken, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(i). Such a request "shall" be granted "unless...such a stay would not be appropriate." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(ii). The statute thus sets up a presumption that OSC's request for an initial stay will be granted, and it makes OSC the lead actor in securing provisional relief when, in OSC's judgment, an agency may have committed a prohibited personnel practice. OSC's stay request need merely fall within the "range of rationality" to be granted, and "the facts should be viewed in the light which is most favorable to a finding of reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice was (or will be) committed." <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Navy,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 169, &#x00B6; 11 (1999) (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">accord Special Counsel v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 9 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) exists where: (1) The employee made a protected disclosure; (2) the official(s) who recommended, took, or threatened the personnel action had actual or constructive knowledge of the protected disclosure; (3) a personnel action was taken or not taken or threatened to be taken or not taken; and (4) the protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the challenged personnel action. <span class="Italic">Office of Special Counsel v. Department of Transportation,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6; 4 (2001). OSC asserts that <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence supports each of these four elements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, OSC contends that the six employees engaged in activity covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) when they disclosed to Ombudsman Hansen and agency investigators evidence that would lead a disinterested observer to conclude, at a minimum, that Bates had abused her authority and violated a law, rule, or regulation. OSC cites disclosures that Bates managed her subordinates through intimidation, by insulting staff and making baseless threats of discipline over minor disagreements, and conclusions by Hansen and even Mims of a negative and hostile working environment. OSC asserts that, likewise, the evidence supports a finding that the employees reasonably believed that Bates violated several laws and regulations, noting that the employees were in a position to observe her signing a former social worker's name on an official form and disclosing the contents of patient medical records to unauthorized personnel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, OSC contends that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the agency knew of the employees' disclosures when the alleged retaliatory harassment occurred because the employees made their disclosures to Hansen, who reported their concerns to his commander. The agency investigated the disclosures and the employees met with Johnson, Haney, and Bates to discuss the results of the investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, OSC contends that harassment is a personnel action, that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the agency engaged in a pattern of retaliatory actions after the employees made their disclosures, and that the pattern of retaliatory actions, viewed in their totality, reasonably threatened the employees' well-being, their continued employment in ASAP, and their future employment prospects. OSC similarly asserts that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the agency significantly changed the employees' working conditions. It claims that O'Friel and Randolph were either placed on or threatened with performance improvement plans; Randolph was detailed, resulting in a loss of pay; Williams was terminated during her probationary period; Kunert was not selected for promotions; and Wilkins and O'Friel received disciplinary actions. Likewise, it claims that, because all of the employees left ASAP due to harassment following their disclosures, it has reasonable grounds to believe that they were constructively removed. It states that, as a result of these personnel actions, every employee except Wilkins faces the prospect of repaying incentive benefits and asserts that agencies have discretion to waive the requirement to repay these benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fourth and finally, OSC contends that the employees' protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel actions under the knowledge-timing test set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). It asserts that the employees suffered threats to their employment, a hostile work environment, and discrete personnel actions immediately after their whistleblowing, and that the pattern of hostile actions continued even after their departure. It further cites Johnson's comments at the February 10, 2012 meeting that an insurgency would be "put down," Mims blaming the employees for failing to follow the chain of command in making their disclosures, and Bates's overheard comments that she would regain control over the ASAP after the investigation concluded and her references to the investigation as the reason for some of her comments and actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given OSC's assertions in its stay request, I find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the agency took these actions against the six employees because of their protected disclosures under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). In this connection, and solely for purposes of this nonprecedential single-member decision in this <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> proceeding, I accept OSC's assertion that a series of unwelcome actions directed at an employee that amount to "harassment" may be a "personnel action" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Covarrubias v. Social Security Administration,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 583, &#x00B6; 15 n.4 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of the scope of the stay remains. Many of the actions that OSC claims were part of a pattern of harassment were themselves "personnel actions," e.g., O'Friel's reprimand, Randolph's "unacceptable" performance rating, and Williams' probationary termination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii), (viii). OSC's proposed order, however, is very specific; OSC does not ask that I order rescission of the reprimand, amendment of the performance rating, cancellation of the probationary termination, or correction of any other action taken or decision made while the six individuals were employed by the agency. Instead, OSC asks me to enjoin the agency from: (1) Collecting incentive payments from the six individuals and (2) providing negative information about them to prospective employers and/or credentialing bodies. I find it appropriate to order item (1) because it is a "decision concerning pay" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ix). I find it appropriate to order item (2) because, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to OSC, such negative statements can be deemed continuing harassment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Order below does not operate with respect to any of the six individuals who are not employed by an "agency" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C). Extending the Order to individuals who are not employed by an "agency" "would not be appropriate," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(ii), because such individuals are not protected from allegedly retaliatory acts taken after they leave government employment. <span class="Italic">See Weed v. Social Security Administration,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 221, 119 (2010); <span class="Italic">Pasley v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 105, &#x00B6; 10 (2008); <span class="Italic">accord Nasuti v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 376 F. App'x 29, 33-34 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 131 S. Ct. 393 (2010). Individuals not employed in an "agency" may seek relief for acts of retaliation taken against them while they were employed in an "agency," <span class="Italic">cf.</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a), but again, in this proceeding OSC does not ask for relief for such acts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, I conclude that granting OSC's stay request in part is appropriate. Accordingly, a 45-day stay is hereby GRANTED as <span id="Page_4065"></span>expressly described below. The stay shall be in effect from September 6, 2012, through and including October 21, 2012. It is ORDERED that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;All agency actions to collect retention bonuses and similar alleged debts for any of the affected individuals employed in an "agency" are hereby stayed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;All agency actions that may adversely affect the employment prospects or employment tenure of the affected individuals employed in an "agency," including any adverse employment recommendations to current or potential employers or to professional credentialing entities, are hereby stayed;...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The sequel to <span class="Italic">Kunert</span> involved an extension to the initially granted by Member Robbins. The extension was issued by the full Board, and although it continued the basic terms of the initial stay, the Board denied a protective order sought by OSC, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Kunert v. Dept. of Army</span>, CB-1208-12-0025-U-2 (NP 10/22/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC originally brought this action on August 31, 2012, on behalf of Psychologists Holly Kunert, Michael O'Friel, and Mary Colleen Morgan, Licensed Professional Counselor Tamera Randolph, Administrative Assistant Brooke Wilkins, and Social Worker Teresa Williams. When the relevant events took place, these six individuals made up the nonsupervisory staff of the Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) at Fort Richardson, Alaska. OSC alleged that the six individuals were subjected to various actions in retaliation for their having reported to Ombudsman Karl Hansen that their Clinical Program Manager and second-level supervisor had falsified, removed, and/or destroyed patient records and that she created a hostile work environment for her staff. A complete statement of OSC's allegations appears in <span class="Italic">Office of Special Counsel ex rel. Kunert et al. v. Department of the Army</span>, MSPB Docket No. CB-1208-12-0025-U-1 (U-1 File), Nonprecedential Stay Decision (Sept. 6, 2012), and is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1), OSC requested a 45-day stay of agency efforts to recover incentive payments from any of the above-named individuals, as well as a stay of the agency's provision of negative information about them to prospective employers and/or credentialing bodies. OSC characterized the agency's actions as "harassment" that should be stayed. Further, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(e)(1)(B)(i), OSC sought an order protecting the six individuals from harassment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Member Robbins granted OSC's stay request in part. He concluded that the agency's attempt to recover incentive payments was a "decision concerning pay," which is a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ix). He assumed, "solely for purposes of this nonprecedential single-member decision in this <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> proceeding," that "a series of unwelcome actions directed at an employee that amount to 'harassment' <span class="Italic">may</span> be a 'personnel action' (emphasis supplied) subject to the Board's stay authority; on that basis, he stayed the agency's provision of negative information about the six individuals to prospective employers and/or credentialing bodies. Member Robbins further concluded, however, that his Order operated only as to those individuals who were either federal employees or applicants for federal employment. Finally, Member Robbins found that, as a single Board member, he lacked authority to rule on OSC's request for a protective order, and he informed the parties that that request would be acted on separately.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a pleading filed after Member Robbins issued his Order, OSC alleged that Kunert, O'Friel, and Randolph are currently employed in other agencies, while Morgan, Williams, and Wilkins are not. OSC further alleged that Morgan "has applied for several federal positions" and that she has been informed that she is "under consideration" for a position with the Army Medical Command. OSC also clarified that the agency is trying to recover relocation expenses (as opposed to retention incentives) from Morgan. OSC further alleged that it has not been able to contact Wilkins because she is in the process of relocating from Alaska to Kentucky and that, on information and belief, Wilkins "plans to seek new federal employment once she has settled in." OSC further alleged that Williams is currently employed at the Anchorage Community Mental Health Services, that she does not currently have an application for federal employment outstanding, and that she "will apply" for positions with the federal government when appropriate vacancies "become available."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC has now filed a timely request that the Board extend the stay for an additional 120 days and expand its scope and that the Board issue a protective order, while OSC conducts an investigation. Specifically, OSC asks the Board to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;modify the existing stay order to apply to all agency actions that may adversely affect the employment prospects of the affected individuals in applying for a covered position at a federal agency; (2) expand the existing stay order to apply to all agency actions to collect retention bonuses, relocation expenses and similar alleged debts for any of the affected individuals; and (3) issue an anti-harassment protective order that ensures that, to the extent they are not covered by a modified stay order, the non-federal employee complainants are provided the same relief from harassment as the federal employee complainants for the same duration that the stay order is in effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its request, OSC incorporates the allegations that it made in its request for an initial stay and for a protective order, but includes some supplemental allegations based on information obtained during its ongoing investigation. The agency has not responded to OSC's request for an extension of the stay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;STAY</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">A.&#x2003;The stay should be extended for 120 days.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will grant OSC's request for an extension of a stay as long as OSC's prohibited personnel practice claim is not clearly unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Waddell v. Department of Justice,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 208, &#x00B6; 3 (2007). OSC's original request for a stay was based on its allegation that the agency took a series of retaliatory actions against the six individuals because they reported to the agency Ombudsman that their supervisor had violated law and regulation and had abused her authority. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to OSC, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Meyers v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 16 (2009), and as explained in detail in Member Robbins' September 6, 2012 Order at pages 6 through 8 (concluding that OSC has alleged a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation for disclosures protected under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8)), we find that OSC's prohibited personnel practice claim is not clearly unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The length of the extension is a separate determination. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Perfetto v. Department of the Navy,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 92, &#x00B6; 12 (2000). Considering that this matter involves numerous actions involving six individuals, and further considering OSC's representations that it must analyze a large number of documents that it has received from the agency and then send an investigator to Alaska, a 120-day extension is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(B) ("[t]he Board may extend the period for any stay...for any period which the Board considers appropriate").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">B.&#x2003;The Board extends the stay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(B) as to four of the six individuals identified in OSC's submissions.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon OSC's request, the Board may stay a "personnel action," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(i), (B), a term that is defined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). "Harassment," <span class="Italic">per se</span>, is not a "personnel action" under section 2302(a)(2)(A). As noted above, exercising the liberal deference accorded OSC upon an initial single-member stay request, Member Robbins initially stayed the agency's provision of negative information to prospective employers and/or credentialing bodies because he credited OSC's allegations that such actions amounted to harassment and because he assumed <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that "harassment" is a "personnel action" that may be stayed. In <span class="Italic">Covarrubias v. Social Security Administration,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 583, &#x00B6; 15 n.4 (2010), cited by OSC, the Board suggested that a series of harassing management actions that creates a stressful or hostile work environment, and that in themselves are not "personnel actions," may in combination amount to a "significant change in...working conditions," which is a "personnel action." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi). Here, OSC alleges a pattern of actions affecting the ASAP staff that it says was harassing and that in combination could amount to a significant change in working conditions. We can stay the provision of negative information to prospective employers and/or professional credentialing bodies because it is part of the alleged pattern.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, regardless of whether the agency's alleged attempts to collect retention pay, relocation expenses, and similar debts are considered part of the alleged pattern of harassment against the six individuals, such collection efforts are decisions concerning pay or benefits. These are personnel actions that can be stayed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ix).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Some of the six individuals are not covered by the stays described above, however. A "personnel action" is one of the statutorily-specified directives or decisions taken "with respect to an employee in, or applicant for, a covered position in an agency" and, where retaliation for whistleblowing is alleged, a government corporation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). This language on its face indicates that an action taken against an individual who is neither a federal employee nor an applicant at the time of the action is not a "personnel action" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(2). Case law is in accord. <span class="Italic">See Pasley v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 105, TT 6, 10 (2008); <span class="Italic">see also Nasuti v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 376 F. App'x 29, 33-34 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 131 S. Ct. 393 (2010). We therefore cannot order a stay of agency actions taken or to be taken against any of the six individuals identified in OSC's submissions who is neither a federal employee nor an applicant for federal employment when the action was or is to be taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;PROTECTIVE ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(e)(1)(B)(i), "[t]he Merit Systems Protection Board may, during an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel or during <span id="Page_4066"></span>the pendency of any proceeding before the Board, issue any order which may be necessary to protect a witness or other individual from harassment." The Board's regulations permit the Board, sitting as a body, to rule on a motion for a protective order or to designate a judge to rule on the motion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.4(a), 1201.146(c). The Board chooses to rule on OSC's motion for a protective order itself. OSC made its request for a protective order concurrently with its initial stay request and shortly after it began its investigation, thus satisfying the requirement that a motion for a protective order be made "as early in the proceeding as practicable." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.146(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although there is some case law concerning protective orders sought by parties other than OSC, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., In re Uriarte,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 8 (2002); <span class="Italic">Oates v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 349, 351 (1994), this is the first time that OSC has requested a protective order in conjunction with a stay request, and for the benefit of the alleged victims of whistleblower reprisal. As a legal matter, it is not clear that the protective order statute was intended to be used in this way. In this connection, we note that OSC does not allege that the agency's alleged harassment of the six individuals who used to work at ASAP is interfering with its investigation. Further, the evidentiary standard that OSC must meet to demonstrate that an order is "necessary" to protect a witness or individual from harassment is not set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(e)(1)(B)(i), nor is it established in any regulation or caselaw; this is therefore a question of first impression.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, OSC's request for a protective order is DENIED without prejudice to refiling. Should OSC choose to refile its request, it should fully brief the legal and evidentiary issues discussed above, and it should be prepared to present oral argument on these significant, novel issues. The agency shall be given a chance to respond to any refiled motion for a protective order that OSC might make.</p>
