<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-97"><span class="space">5.</span> Light and Limited Duty; Medical Restriction</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Light duty cases created some job security for MSPB lawyers in the Office of Appeals Counsel. Many cases were and continue to be appealed, generally (but not exclusively) from Postal Service employees who take leave while they recover from illness or injury and then seek to return to duty on light duty or duty that is restricted according to their physicians' recommendations. Under certain conditions defining light or limited duty entitlement, an appeal ensues when an employee cannot resume his regular job duties because of medical restrictions and the agency declines to either to return the employee to his regular job with those restrictions or to place the employee into an alternative position, typically a light duty job, that is consistent with the medical restrictions. When the employee is not able to return to the job because the medical restrictions cannot be met by the employer, the issue arises whether the employee has been constructively suspended. The legal predicate for these cases is the allegation, express or implied, that the employer has an obligation to provide light duty or job modification under a collective bargaining contract, agency policy or regulation, or in accordance with the accommodation requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. VA</span>, SF-0752-12-0361-I-1 (6/7/2013) ("Constructive suspension claims arise in two situations. The first occurs when an agency places an employee on enforced leave pending an inquiry into his ability to perform. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6; 5 (2000). In that situation, the key question is whether the agency or the appellant initiated the absence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Second, if an employee who initiated his own absence requests to return to work within certain medical restrictions, and if the agency is obligated to offer available light-duty work or is bound by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to accommodate the medical condition and allow the employee to return, the agency's failure to offer available light-duty work or reasonably accommodate the employee becomes a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">McFadden v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 18, &#x00B6; 16 (1999)."). Assuming a light duty obligation, under <span class="Italic">Romine v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 68, 71 (1994), an appeal based on the appellant's allegation that the agency would not allow the appellant to work after it denied his request for permanent light duty: "If the appellant voluntarily absented himself from work, then he did not suffer a constructive suspension. If, on the other hand, he reported for work and was told to leave, he was subjected to a constructive suspension appealable to the Board...."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Constructive suspensions arising from medical conditions generally develop in two ways. An agency may preclude an employee from returning to her regular job until the employee establishes medical fitness to perform the work--the situation described in earlier subsections of this chapter. Alternatively, an individual may suffer a physical or mental impairment that precludes performance of her regular job, but the impairment permits a light duty or alternate duty assignment. If the agency declines to extend light duty work to the employee and instead requires the employee to use leave or to assume LWOP status because the employee cannot perform her regular job, the issue for the MSPB is whether the employee was constructively suspended. In the ensuing constructive suspension appeal the issues will include whether the agency was obliged to offer the employee light duty, whether by refusing light duty that was required the agency had a valid reason for its action, whether the agency discriminated on the basis of disability by refusing to extend light duty, and whether the agency followed necessary due process procedures by imposing or allowing the constructive suspension to occur. Many constructive suspension appeals involve employees of the Postal Service, and the analysis is reasonably straightforward because many of those employees are covered by collective bargaining contracts or agency policies governing the availability of temporary and permanent light duty. Not so straightforward are appeals involving agencies with no policies, regulations, or negotiated agreements defining light duty work, meaning that light duty assignments are provided on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> basis or not at all.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Our discussion of light duty also includes the term "limited duty"; in the Postal Service, "limited duty" refers to modified work provided to employees who have medical restrictions due to work-related conditions, and "light duty" refers to modified work provided to employees who have medical restrictions due to nonwork-related conditions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Beltran v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 425, 427 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dones v. USPS</span>, 107 MSPR 235, 240 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14, 2007 MSPB 268 (2007) (reference to limited duty). <span class="Italic">Johnson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's absence for more than 14 days that results in a loss of pay may be a constructive suspension appealable under 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2) and 7513(d). Constructive suspension claims may arise in two situations. The first situation occurs when an agency places an employee on enforced leave pending an inquiry into her ability to perform. <span class="Italic">See McIver-Smith v.

The AJ addressed this situation, and we agree with his conclusion that the appellant failed to establish jurisdiction under this legal theory because it is undisputed that he initiated the events that led to his leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second situation that may result in a constructive suspension claim, however, occurs when an employee who is absent from work for medical reasons asks to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies the request. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McIver-Smith,</span> 74 MSPR at 467. If an employee who is absent due to medical restrictions requests work within those restrictions, and if the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to such employee, the employee's continued absence constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board if the agency fails to offer the employee any available light-duty work<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that he was available to work light duty as of August 20, 1998, and that the agency constructively suspended him on September 16, 1998 by denying his request to return to work within his medical restrictions.[5] Moreover, the record reflects that the agency's Employee and Labor Relations Manual, as well as the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement, made provisions for temporary reassignments to light-duty positions, and the appellant alleged that other employees received such assignments. Thus, the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency initiated his absence from work after August 20, 1998, and that as a result, he was placed on enforced leave for more than 14 days, i.e., from August 20, 1998 to the present.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The appellant does not allege that his current injury was entirely work-related, and in fact, the record indicates that OWCP specifically found that his recent surgery was not related to a work-related injury, and that any remaining injury was pre-existing. Thus, since OWCP's decision that the appellant was fully recovered relates only to the appellant's work-related injury, 5 USC &#x00A7; 8101(5) (definition of injury for which workers' compensation may be granted includes a disease "caused by employment"), that determination does not prevent the appellant from asserting that he was constructively suspended. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McNamee-Marrero v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears from documents in the record and the appellant's statements that he was diagnosed with narcolepsy at least by October 28, 2004. The appellant was absent from work for some uncertain time period, and according to W. Jeffrey McDaniel, M.D., he could return to work on November 22, 2004, with the sole restriction of no driving of postal vehicles. It is not clear how often the appellant attended work over the next several months, or in what capacity. In a March 7, 2005 note, agency Occupational Health Nurse Administrator Maryanne Fisher, R.N., stated that the appellant's "[p]hysician recommends return to work 3/3/05. Employee cannot drive at this time." In April 2005, the appellant underwent surgery for a rotator cuff injury and was absent for some additional time. In a May 19, 2005 letter, Orthopedist M. Jonathan York, M.D., stated that the appellant could return to work the following week with a lifting restriction of 3 pounds. Dr. York made no mention of any driving limitation. The appellant apparently requested to return to work with restrictions. According to the appellant, his supervisor, Tyrone Harris, at first told him that he could return for 4 hours per day. However, on June 4, 2005, Mr. Harris allegedly informed the appellant that there was no work available until he was released for full duty. The appellant submitted a June 28, 2005 letter from Walter S. James, M.D., stating that he had been diagnosed with narcolepsy and sleep apnea, and would "start treatment with stimulant medication." This letter did not address the appellant's availability for work or any restrictions on his ability to work. The record contains work capability certificates dated July 5 and August 18, 2005, and signed by Dr. James, indicating that the appellant could return to full duty. The August 18 certificate included a list of activities, including operation of a truck, that the appellant could perform. It appears that the appellant returned to work on August 13, 2005.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon reviewing the evidence and argument filed on initial appeal, we find that the appellant has presented non-frivolous allegations of Board jurisdiction which merit a hearing. The appellant has alleged that he was cleared to return to work, with certain restrictions, on May 23, 2005, and that he communicated to agency officials his willingness to work. If an employee, who is absent due to a medical condition, requests work within his medical restrictions, and the agency is bound by agency policy, <span id="Page_2089"></span>regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to such an employee, the employee's continued absence constitutes a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction if the agency fails to offer the available light-duty work to the employee. <span class="Italic">Carmack v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 128, &#x00B6; 5 (2005). Furthermore, once an employee makes a non-frivolous allegation that he was able to work within certain restrictions, that he communicated his willingness to work, and that the agency prevented him from returning to work, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show either that there was no work available within the employee's restrictions, or that it offered such work to the employee and he declined it. <span class="Italic">Hahn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6; 6 (2000). Although the agency apparently informed the appellant on June 4, 2005, that no light-duty work was available, no evidence has been submitted showing that light-duty work within the appellant's medical restrictions was unavailable throughout the relevant time period. In any event, the specificity of the appellant's allegations of fact, coupled with the supporting medical documentation, demonstrates that they are more than mere <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations and, moreover, his allegations represent "claims that, if proven, establish the Board's jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">See Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1344; <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 329. Therefore, the appellant is entitled to a hearing, at which he bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence his claim of constructive suspension.

<p class="Body-Text">The operative words in <span class="Italic">McNamee-Marrero, supra,</span> concerning the claim that an agency should extend light duty work are "if the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light duty work to such employee." Most constructive suspension cases involving claims to light duty involve collective bargaining contracts or some other source of obligation on the part of the agency, including the Rehabilitation Act, to extend the light duty (or alternate duties) rather than putting the employee to the choice of performing all the duties or his regular job or performing no duty and receiving no pay. <span class="Italic">Carmack v. USPS</span>, 98 MSPR 128, 130-32 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-10 (2005), recites the relation between limited duty, light duty, national and local collective bargaining agreements, and constructive suspensions of Postal Service employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant served as a City Mail Carrier. She suffered what appeared to be an on-the-job injury, and the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) approved the claim. The agency then provided the appellant with a limited-duty assignment in accordance with its policy of providing limited-duty assignments to employees who have medical restrictions due to work-related injuries. OWCP later rescinded its approval of the appellant's claim, however, finding that it was untimely, and the appellant requested light-duty work, which may be available to employees who have medical restrictions due to non-work-related injuries. The agency assigned the appellant light-duty work, but subsequently ended the appellant's light-duty assignment, claiming that it did not have any light-duty work available within her medical restrictions. The appellant did not return to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal alleging that the agency's failure to assign light duty within her medical restrictions constituted a constructive suspension. Following a hearing, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the agency's failure to offer the appellant light-duty work was not a constructive suspension because the agency had no obligation to offer light-duty work under the terms of the governing collective bargaining agreement (CBA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant asserts that the agency was required to offer her light duty under Article 13 of the CBA. She asserts that sections 2C and 4A of this Article require the agency to show the "greatest consideration" for employees requiring light duty or other assignments and to make "every effort" to reassign the concerned employee. The appellant argues that this language requires the agency to assign light-duty work if it is available and that the administrative judge erred by not addressing whether light-duty work was, in fact, available. Further, the appellant claims that such work was available because she could have continued to perform her limited-duty assignment as light duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an agency bars an employee from duty for more than 14 days, the employee's absence constitutes a constructive suspension that is within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 680, 691-92 (1996). If an employee, who is absent due to a medical condition, requests work within her medical restrictions, and the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to such an employee, the employee's continued absence constitutes a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction if the agency fails to offer the employee the available light-duty work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 692.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue here is whether the agency was bound by policy or contractual provision to offer the appellant available light-duty work. The appellant asserts that the CBA requires the agency to offer available light-duty work and that such work, in fact, existed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellant claims, Article 13, Section 2C provides that installation heads "shall show the greatest consideration for...employees requiring light duty or other assignments, giving each request careful attention, and reassign such employees to the extent possible in the employee's office." Section 4 discusses general policy procedures, and subsection A states that "[e]very effort shall be made to reassign the concerned employee within the employee's present craft or occupational group, even if such assignment reduces the number of hours of work for the supplemental work force."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Article 13, however, also recognizes the need for developing the procedures for implementing the light-duty assignments through local negotiations. Section 1B of the CBA provides that the union and the agency recognize their responsibility to aid and assist employees who are unable to perform their regularly assigned duties due to illness or injury and places the responsibility for implementing this provision with each installation, after local negotiations. Section 3 specifically discusses the CBA's local implementation. It states that, due to its installations' varied sizes and conditions, issues such as the assignments to be considered light duty within each craft in an office, light-duty assignments from part-time hours, and the number of light-duty assignments should be determined by local negotiations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to this provision, the agency and the National Association of Letter Carriers negotiated a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) governing the assignment of ill or injured employees at the appellant's facility.... It further states that, "[a]s required or needed, effort shall be made to place ill or injured employees on temporary light duty based on the doctor's report, work available, and other considerations specified in Article 13 of the National Agreement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the CBA and the MOU require the agency to make an effort to assign available light-duty, but do not guarantee a light-duty position for an ill or injured employee. This result is consistent with our prior determinations regarding similar CBA terms. <span class="Italic">See Okleson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 415 &#x00B6; 16 (2001);<span class="Italic"> Baker v.

Cir. 2000) (Table); <span class="Italic">Baker</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 692-93. We are unable to determine, however, whether the agency satisfied this obligation because of conflicting evidence regarding the availability of light-duty work. The agency has presented evidence that it had no light-duty assignments within the appellant's medical restrictions, and the appellant admits on review that the agency witnesses testified that light-duty work was unavailable. The appellant, however, has introduced evidence indicating that light-duty work within her medical restrictions existed. Because the administrative judge did not make any findings on this issue, and resolving the conflicting evidence could require credibility determinations, we must remand the appeal for further findings. <span class="Italic">See Woodward v.

Rather, as the administrative judge found, the collective bargaining agreement provision identified by the appellant contained only a general statement that all bargaining unit employees should be treated fairly, and did not indicate that it specifically addressed the issue of light duty. Moreover, the appellant's first-level supervisor, Assistant Grocery Manager Robert Biggs, testified that the agency had no formal light-duty program or policy. The appellant has presented nothing rebutting that testimony. Indeed, she confirmed that Biggs told her doctor's office that the agency had no light-duty program.</p>

An earlier case, <span class="Italic">Garcia v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 223, 226 (1994), recognized but did not resolve whether discontinuation of light duty, gratuitously provided, i.e., not required by a negotiated agreement, could support an adverse action appeal.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a GS-6 Diagnostic Radiologic Technician, filed an appeal alleging that the agency had placed her on enforced leave for more than 14 days, raising a discrimination claim based on disability, and requesting a hearing. In response to a show-cause order on jurisdiction, the appellant asserted that the agency "forced (her] out of work" when it issued an April 29, 1996 letter informing her that it was no longer able to accommodate her neck injury with light-duty assignments because light-duty work was no longer available, and that effective May 3, 1996, her light-duty assignment would be terminated. The appellant also alleged that on May 10, 1996, and June 28, 1996, she returned to work and requested that she be placed on duty but the agency told her there was no work available. She thus claimed that the agency placed her on enforced leave beginning May 10, 1996. The agency responded that the appellant was not subject to an appealable constructive suspension because she never requested or indicated a desire to return to her regular position and she never alleged that she was able to perform the duties of that position.</p>

Department of the Treasury,</span> 58 MSPR 574, 577 (1993).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant submitted an affidavit below attesting to the facts that on May 10, 1996, "she was placed in an enforced leave status without her consent" and that she has been "ready, willing, and able to work" during the entire period of the alleged constructive suspension. In addition, the appellant alleged below in a memorandum on jurisdiction that, after receiving the agency's April 29, 1996 letter advising her that light-duty work was no longer available, she returned to work on May 10, 1996, and June 28, 1996, and requested that she "be placed on duty" but the agency told her there was no work available. She therefore claimed that she was placed on enforced leave as of May 10, 1996, for more than 14 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, however, found, based on the parties' written submissions, that it was "undisputed" that the appellant was physically unable to perform the duties of her regular position. The administrative judge further found that, because the appellant did not allege that on May 10, 1996, and June 28, 1996, she specifically requested to be placed on duty in her regular position, her requests to be placed on duty on those dates amounted at most to demands that the agency continue to provide her with light-duty assignments. Therefore, the administrative judge found, the appellant's allegation that on those two occasions she had reported to work but was told that none was available did not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction that the agency initiated her leave by refusing her work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. Having alleged that she was fully able to work during the entire period of the alleged constructive suspension and that on May 10, 1996, and June 28, 1996, she returned to work and requested that she be placed on duty but the agency told her there was no work available, the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency initiated her absence from work after May 10, 1996, and that as a result, she was placed on enforced leave for a period of more than 14 days, i.e., from May 10, 1996, through at least June 7, 1996, when she filed her petition for appeal. <span class="Italic">See Gallegos,</span> 70 MSPR at 485-86. The appellant thus raised a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction entitling her to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We therefore remand this appeal to the regional office for a hearing on the constructive suspension issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the administrative judge determines on remand that the appellant is in fact claiming that she can only perform light duty and that she is requesting that the agency continue to provide her with light-duty assignments, then the administrative judge shall determine whether the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to the appellant, and if so, whether the agency has failed to offer the appellant available light-duty work. <span class="Italic">See Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 MSPR 680, 692 (1996) (if an employee who is absent due to a medical condition requests work within his or her medical restrictions, and if the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to such an employee, his continued absence is an appealable constructive suspension if the agency fails to offer the employee available light-duty work).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">A suspension for more than 14 days is appealable to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2) and 7513(d). An appealable constructive suspension may occur when an employee who is absent due to medical restrictions requests work within those restrictions, and the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer him available limited-duty or light-duty work but fails to do so.[4] <span class="Italic">See McNamee-Marrero v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 487, 490 (1999). Thus, the jurisdictional issue here is whether the appellant was entitled to limited duty or light duty after September 12, 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant's allegation that the agency improperly denied him limited-duty work may be also within the Board's jurisdiction as a denial of restoration, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401(c). <span class="Italic">See Allen v.

If viewed as a restoration appeal, the Board would have jurisdiction to determine whether the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration to limited duty. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Based on the jurisdictional analysis in the text below, we find that the same result would be reached whether this appeal is characterized as an alleged denial of restoration or an alleged constructive suspension.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">When an individual has "partially recovered from a compensable injury <span id="Page_2091"></span>and...is able to return to limited duty," an agency must "make every effort to restore" him. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). The term "partially recovered" means "an injured employee, though not ready to resume the full range of his or her regular duties, has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light [i.e., limited] duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. After the appellant partially recovered from his compensable injury in 1992, the agency satisfied its obligation under section 353.301(d) by restoring him to limited duty, until September 12, 1997, when it withdrew the limited duty temporarily and subsequently withdrew it permanently.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's withdrawal of limited duty, and the AJ's finding that the withdrawal was appropriate, were based on the "independent" medical evaluation reports dated June 25 and September 19, 1997, by Dr. V.V. Kulkarni, an orthopedic surgeon, and Dr. C.E. Moore, a psychiatrist. As the AJ found, these reports were based on examinations of the appellant in the summer of 1997, and contained the doctors' opinions that the appellant's current medical restrictions were not causally related to his work injury in 1992. Based on these reports, the agency and the AJ determined that the appellant's medical restrictions after September 12, 1997, were no longer causally related to his employment injury and that he thus ceased to be a "partially recovered" individual entitled to restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The determination of whether an individual suffers from a medical condition that is compensable under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) is within the exclusive purview of OWCP (subject to review by the Employees Compensation Appeals Board), and neither the employing agency nor the Board has the authority to make such a determination. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8145; *19320 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.2(a) (1998); <span class="Italic">see New v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 142 F.3d 1259, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">McLain v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 526, 530 (1999); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.1 (1999). Here, OWCP weighed the two independent medical evaluation reports by Drs. Kulkarni and Moore, in light of the pertinent facts and the previously submitted medical evidence, before issuing a September 28, 1997 proposal to terminate the appellant's entitlement to compensation benefits. In response to the proposal, the appellant submitted additional medical evidence. After considering the additional evidence, OWCP issued a January 15, 1998 decision terminating his entitlement to compensation benefits effective February 1, 1998. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> OWCP subsequently issued a decision granting the appellant compensation for wage loss from September 17, 1997, through January 31, 1998, on the basis that the agency's withdrawal of limited duty resulted in a compensable wage loss. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.5(x) (1999) ("<span class="Italic">Recurrence of disability</span>...means an inability to work that takes place when a light-duty assignment made specifically to accommodate an employee's physical limitations due to his or her work-related injury or illness is withdrawn...").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although OWCP terminated the appellant's compensation benefits, it made this decision on January 15, 1998, and terminated those compensation benefits effective February 1, 1998. Because compensation benefits are payable only while an employee has a work-related, viz., "compensable," injury, OWCP's decisions reflected its determination that the appellant remained a compensably injured, partially recovered employee until February 1, 1998. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102 (a "partially recovered" individual is one who suffers from residuals of a "compensable injury"); 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 10.5(14), (17), 10.300 (1998) (to receive wage-loss compensation based on "disability," the employee must have a work-related "injury"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.500 (1999) ("Benefits [under FECA] are available only while the effects of a work-related condition continue."). Until OWCP issued a decision on January 15, 1998, to terminate the appellant's compensation benefits effective February 1, 1998, the employing agency was without authority to determine on its own that his medical restrictions were no longer causally related to his employment injury, i.e., that he was no longer a "partially recovered" employee for purposes of restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). <span class="Italic">See New,</span> 142 F.3d at 1264. We therefore find that the agency improperly withdrew the appellant's limited-duty assignment after September 12, 1997, solely based on its ultra vires determination that he was no longer a partially recovered employee. IAF, Tab 16. Accordingly, the appellant's absence from September 13, 1997, through January 31, 1998, constituted an appealable constructive suspension for more than 14 days.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;This does not mean that an agency may never withdraw a limited-duty assignment in the absence of an appropriate determination by OWCP. If, for instance, an employee suffered a nonwork-related injury after being placed on limited duty, and the injury prevented him from performing his limited-duty assignment, the agency may of course withdraw the assignment. Here, as noted in the text above, the medical evidence showed that the appellant was capable of performing his limited-duty assignment during the period of his constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's absence after January 31, 1998, the restoration rights of partially recovered employees, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), apply only to those who partially (not fully) recover from a compensable injury, i.e, those who continue to suffer from residuals of the work-related injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102 (definitions of "injury" and "partially recovered"); <span class="Italic">see generally Leach v. Department of Commerce,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 8, 15 (1994). Based on OWCP's decisions as discussed above, the appellant fully recovered[9] from the compensable injury as of February 1, 1998, although he continued to have medical restrictions due to noncompensable conditions. Thus, the agency was not obligated to make restoration efforts under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) after January 31, 1998, and was therefore not obligated to offer him limited duty thereafter. In addition, the AJ found that the agency was not bound by any policy, regulation, or contractual provision to provide light duty or to reassign him under the circumstances. The appellant does not dispute on review the AJ's findings in this regard, and we otherwise find no reason to disturb them on review. We therefore find that the appellant was not constructively suspended after January 31, 1998.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;That the appellant fully recovered <span class="Italic">from his compensable injury</span> does not mean that he was a "fully recovered" individual entitled to restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a),(b). For purposes of restoration rights under section 353.301(a),(b), the term "fully recovered" means "compensation payments have been terminated <span class="Italic">on the basis that the employee is able to perform all the duties of the position he or she left or an equivalent one.</span>" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102 (emphasis added). Here, the appellant's compensation benefits were terminated on the basis that any current medical restrictions were not causally related to his employment injury, but it is undisputed that he was not able to perform all the duties of his former position or an equivalent one at the time his compensation benefits were terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's constructive suspension from September 13, 1997, through January 31, 1998, which is within the Board's jurisdiction as discussed above, we find that we must reverse the suspension because the record does not show that the agency satisfied the appellant's constitutional right to minimum due process as to the suspension. <span class="Italic">See McLain,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 526, 530; <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681 (1991). The appellant may be entitled to compensatory damages based on this constructive suspension if he prevails on his claims of discrimination based on his gender and disability, or his claim of retaliation for prior EEO activity involving Title VII; such damages are not available based on his claims of discrimination based on age and of retaliation for pursuing workers' compensation benefits. <span class="Italic">See Farquhar v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 454, 459 (1999)<span class="Italic">; Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 98, 106-07 (1997); <span class="Italic">Currier v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 191, 196 &#x0026; n.5 (1996).
