<h3 class="h3" id="sec4-101"><span class="space">A.</span> EFFECT OF GRIEVANCE RAISING ULP ISSUE</h3>
<p class="noindent">The election of remedies that occurs when a ULP charge is filed as to a failure to bargain, with implications as to the negotiability of proposals, also occurs when a grievance is filed that raises the ULP issue and implicates negotiability issues. FLRA described the situation in <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-051.html">62 FLRA 267</a>, 267-69 (2007) (petition for review granted in part, denied in part, and remanded on other grounds, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 550 F.3d 1148 (D.C. Cir. 2008)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 3, 2004, the Agency notified the Union of proposed changes to its grooming standards policy. The Union requested to bargain and submitted proposals. The parties bargained but were unable to reach agreement. The Agency implemented a revised grooming standards policy on October 19, 2004. On that same date, the Union filed a grievance, which alleged that the Agency violated the parties' agreement and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) by implementing the grooming standards policy prior to completing bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 15, 2004, the Union filed this negotiability appeal with the Authority. In addition to its substantive negotiability claims regarding the proposals, the Agency asserts that it properly implemented the revised grooming standards policy because the Union waived its right to bargain by failing to timely submit proposals in accordance with the parties' collective bargaining agreement and because implementation was consistent with the necessary functioning of the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the post-petition conference, held on January 11, 2005, the Authority representative raised the issue of whether the petition should be dismissed pursuant to &#x00A7; 2424.30 of the Authority's Regulations because the Union had filed a grievance alleging an unfair labor practice (ULP) concerning issues related to the petition.[3] The parties agreed that the Union had withdrawn the portion of the grievance alleging violations of the Statute and that only "the portion of the grievance alleging a violation of the agreement is continuing to be processed."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Section 2424.30(a) provides, in relevant part, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">[W]here an exclusive representative files...a grievance alleging an unfair labor practice under the parties negotiated grievance procedure, and the...grievance concerns issues directly related to the petition for review filed pursuant to this part, the Authority will dismiss the petition for review. The dismissal will be without prejudice to the right of the exclusive representative to refile the petition for review after the...grievance has been resolved administratively, including resolution pursuant to an arbitration award that has become final and binding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arbitration hearing regarding the grievance was held in July 2005, at which time the parties stipulated the issue to be: "Whether the <span id="Page_476"></span>Agency violated the National Agreement between [the Agency] and [the Union] when it implemented [the grooming standards policy] prior to the completion of bargaining and/or by refusing to engage in post-implementation bargaining? If so, what is the appropriate remedy? In the award, issued on October 14, 2005, the Arbitrator rejected the Agency's claims that the Union waived its right to bargain and that implementation was consistent with the necessary functioning of the Agency.[4] As his award, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency violated Article 37 of the parties' agreement "<span class="Italic">and applicable provisions of law</span>" when it implemented the revised grooming standards policy without completing bargaining with the Union. The Agency timely filed exceptions to the award on November 15, 2005, which were docketed as Case No. 0-AR-4026. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 62 FLRA No. 50 (2007) (NTEU).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The Arbitrator also rejected other Agency claims, noting that the Agency disputed the negotiability of some, but not all, of the proposals made by the Union. The Arbitrator noted that a negotiability appeal was pending before the Authority and "decline[d]" to resolve the negotiability of proposals pending in that appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2424.30(a) of the Authority's Regulations provides that the Authority will dismiss a negotiability appeal without prejudice where the union has filed "a grievance alleging a [ULP] under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, and the...grievance concerns issues directly related" to a negotiability appeal. This regulation was adopted in 1999 as part of a "unified process" for negotiability petitions that raised both negotiability and bargaining obligation disputes.[5] 63 Fed. Reg. 66410 (December 2, 1998). Under this process, where a ULP has been alleged, either through statutory ULP procedures or through a negotiated grievance procedure, those procedures are considered to be "better suited to resolving the entire dispute" than is the negotiability procedure. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The regulations thus provide that the Authority will dismiss the negotiability appeal, that the parties will utilize the ULP or grievance procedure, and that the Union may refile the negotiability petition if the issues remain unresolved after the conclusion of the ULP or grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;As relevant here, a "[n]egotiability dispute" is defined in &#x00A7; 2424.2(c) of the Authority's Regulations as a disagreement "concerning the legality of a proposal or provision." A "[b]argaining obligation dispute" is defined in &#x00A7; 2424.2(a) as a disagreement "concerning whether, in the specific circumstances involved in a particular case, the parties are obligated to bargain over a proposal that otherwise may be negotiable."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, a grievance filed by the Union on August 30, 2004, claimed that the Agency's implementation of a revised grooming standards policy constituted a ULP. The Agency also declared certain of the Union's proposals to be nonnegotiable and the Union filed the petition for review in this case concerning the same policy. Thus, at the time the petition in this case was filed, &#x00A7; 2424.30(a) supported dismissal of the Union's petition. However, based on the parties' agreement during the post-petition conference that the Union had withdrawn the portion of the grievance alleging a statutory violation, the Authority did not dismiss the petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with their agreement during the post-petition conference, the parties stipulated to the Arbitrator that the issue was whether the Agency had violated the parties' agreement by implementing the grooming policy. However, the agreement term at issue simply "requires that the Agency exercise its management rights in accordance with the law." Thus, while the parties submitted the issue to the Arbitrator as a matter of contract interpretation, the actual issues to be resolved by the Arbitrator were the Agency's legal defenses to the Union's request to bargain. Those defenses are substantively identical to those presented in this case and substantively identical to the issues that the parties' asserted had been withdrawn from the grievance during the post-petition conference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties thus presented the grievance at the post-petition conference in a manner that avoided dismissal under &#x00A7; 2424.30(a) while also pursuing the result that the regulation was designed to avoid. That is, despite their statements to the Authority, they litigated the exact same statutory bargaining issues before the Arbitrator and the Authority simultaneously. Further, the Arbitrator resolved the issues as both contractual and statutory claims and the Agency's exceptions allege that the Arbitrator's resolution of the statutory claims is contrary to law. As a result of the Union's petition in this case and the Agency's exceptions in Case No. 0-AR-4026, identical issues concerning the statutory obligation to bargain were pending in both cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the course taken by the parties here, to litigate identical bargaining obligation claims simultaneously in a negotiability petition and a grievance, is inconsistent with the purpose of &#x00A7; 2424.30(a) because the parties are effectively<span class="Italic"> </span>litigating a ULP claim in the grievance procedure. It creates an end-run around the Authority's regulatory scheme, which provides that bargaining obligation issues should be litigated in one forum.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2424.30, where a union has filed a grievance that alleges a ULP concerning issues directly related to a negotiability petition, the Authority dismisses the negotiability petition without prejudice to the right of the union to refile the petition after the grievance has been resolved. Dismissal in this case is unnecessary, however. In particular, as noted above, the Agency has filed exceptions with the Authority to the award concerning the grievance at issue and the Authority has issued a decision concerning those exceptions. <span class="Italic">See NTEU. </span>Because the grievance has been "resolved administratively" in a manner that does not resolve the negotiability issues, the Union would have the right to refile the negotiability petition at this time.[6] &#x00A7; 2424.30(a) Thus, as a practical matter, there is no basis to dismiss the petition and we resolve it.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Moreover, because the bargaining obligation issues have been resolved in <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> we have no need to resolve them here.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA dismisses a negotiability petition without prejudice whether a related grievance (raising ULP issues) is filed before or after the negotiability appeal, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-90.html">72 FLRA 469</a>, 469-71 (2021) (Member Abbott concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency notified the Union of its intent to implement an initiative involving peer coaching. The Union invoked impact and implementation bargaining over the initiative and submitted several proposals. The parties agreed on several proposals, which the Agency incorporated into a memorandum of understanding (MOU). However, the Agency asserted that four of the Union's proposals were nonnegotiable. It then implemented the initiative along with the proposals upon which the parties had reached agreement while negotiating the MOU. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 14, 2020, the Union filed a petition concerning the four proposals. Subsequently, the Agency filed its statement of position (statement), and the Union filed a response to the statement (response), to which the Agency filed a reply. On September 15, 2020, the Union filed a grievance alleging that the Agency violated Article 47 of the parties' collective-bargaining agreement (Article 47), and &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Statute by unilaterally implementing the initiative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2424.30(a) provides that where the "exclusive representative files. . .a grievance alleging [a ULP] under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, and the. . .grievance concerns issues directly related to the petition for review[,] the. . .Authority will dismiss the petition for review. . .without prejudice to the right of the exclusive representative to refile the petition for review after the. . .grievance has been resolved administratively. . .."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the pending grievance alleges that the Agency violated Article 47 and the Statute by unilaterally implementing the initiative "during the pendency of negotiations." Specifically, the grievance alleges that the Agency violated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Article 47 and committed [ULPs] under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) by engaging in bad faith bargaining and expressing its intent to unilaterally implement the [initiative] before the [p]arties have reached an agreement. In addition, the [Agency] violated Article 47 and committed [ULPs] under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) by insisting on piecemeal bargaining of mandatory subjects of bargaining.[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The pending grievance therefore concerns, in part, whether the Agency erroneously implemented the initiative before completing bargaining. It follows that in resolving the grievance, an arbitrator could determine that the Agency had no obligation to bargain over the proposals presented in the petition,[13] thereby rendering the issues raised in the Union's negotiability appeal moot. Consequently, the Union's petition and its grievance are directly related.[14]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., NTEU,</span> 62 FLRA 267, 268 (2007) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting, in part, on other grounds) (explaining that "where a ULP has been alleged, either through statutory ULP procedures or through a negotiated grievance procedure, those procedures are considered to be 'better suited to resolving the entire dispute' than is the negotiability procedure" and noting that at the time the petition was filed, a pending grievance supported dismissal of the petition under &#x00A7; 2424.30(a)) (quoting 63 Fed. Reg. 66,410 (Dec. 2, 1998)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;AFGE, Loc. 1502, 70 FLRA 423, 424 (2018) (finding ULP charge directly related to proposals where ULP proceeding could render issue moot); NTEU, 69 FLRA 355, 356 (2016) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that even if its petition and grievance are found to be directly related, the petition should not be dismissed because the grievance was resolved administratively when the parties agreed to hold it in "abeyance." The Authority has found that, <span class="Italic">when a union withdraws, or the Authority resolves a ULP claim</span> related to a petition, the Authority will consider the petition because the ULP claim "has been resolved administratively."[16] However, the Authority has not previously found that a grievance alleging ULPs has been resolved administratively when <span id="Page_477"></span>the parties agree to hold it in abeyance. Accordingly, we reject the Union's argument on this point.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.30(a); <span class="Italic">NAIL, Loc. 5,</span> 67 FLRA 85, 86 (2012). We note that the cases upon which the Union relies for this argument apply a regulation that pre-dates the issuance of &#x00A7; 2424.30(a), which "replace[d] and significantly change[d]" its predecessor. 63 Fed. Reg 48,130-01 (Sept. 9, 1998). Under the previous regulation, where an exclusive representative filed both a petition and a related grievance alleging a ULP, it was required to select which action should be processed first, and the Authority would ordinarily hold the non-selected action in abeyance. However, with the enactment of &#x00A7; 2424.30(a), an exclusive representative "no longer ha[s] the ability to select which [action] should be processed first." <span class="Italic">Id.;</span> see 63 Fed. Reg. 66,405. Thus, to the extent that the Union claims that holding the grievance in "abeyance" amounts to selecting which action should proceed first, the Authority's regulations no longer permit that election, and instead require that the petition be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union states that "if the Authority finds that the [p]arties' agreement to hold the ULP-grievance in abeyance is insufficient to administratively resolve the ULP-grievance," it "requests leave to withdraw the ULP-grievance without prejudice so the [p]arties can have resolution on the negotiability of the proposals at issue." Because we find that the Authority lacks the authority to grant the Union's request, we deny it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we dismiss the Union's petition without prejudice to the Union's right to refile the petition at a later time if it is able to meet the conditions governing the Authority's review of negotiability issues.</p>
<p class="noindent">If a grievance raising ULP issues is administratively resolved (by an award from an arbitrator or by withdrawal of or failure to pursue the grievance), the grievance no longer blocks the negotiability appeal. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 15 and Dept. of Army, Joint Munitions Command, Rock Island</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-30.html">73 FLRA 125</a>, 27 n.31 (2022) (citing "<span class="Italic">NAIL, Loc. 5</span>, 67 FLRA 85, 86 (2012); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 62 FLRA 267, 268-69 (2007), <span class="Italic">aff'd &#x0026; rev'd as to other matters sub nom</span>., <span class="Italic">NTEU v.

If ULP issues are raised in a grievance, and the ULP issues are withdrawn, the union has 30 days to refile an earlier-filed negotiability appeal that was dismissed without prejudice pending resolution of the duty-to-bargain issue raised through the ULP allegation. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Council 238 and EPA,</span> 64 FLRA 223, 225 (2009).
