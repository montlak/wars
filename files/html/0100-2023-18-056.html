<p class="Body-Text">Related to, yet distinct from, the sufficiency of the charges is the construction of a specific charge, e.g., theft, and then a statement of facts supporting the charge that could also support a lesser or different offense. Should the agency be required to prove each element of theft or can its case be supported if the facts add up to misconduct but do not equate to theft? The Board concluded that it is the specific charge, not the factual recitation that controls the agency's burden of proof, <span class="Italic">Nazelrod v. DOJ</span>, 54 MSPR 461, 463-68 (1992) (aff'd <span class="Italic">sub nom</span>., <span class="Italic">King v. Nazelrod</span>, 43 F.3d 663 (Fed. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, an employee of the Federal Correctional Institute at Ashland, Kentucky, was charged with two counts of theft, and two counts of failure to carry out work assignments. She was demoted from the position of Legal Technician, GS-7, to that of Unit Secretary, GS-5. She appealed the demotion to the Board's St. Louis Regional Office. One of the theft charges was dropped during the pendency of the appeal. The administrative judge sustained the remaining theft charge and one of the two charges of failure to complete assignments. On appellant's petition for review the Board ruled that the administrative judge erred in sustaining each of the two charges. Thus, appellant was exonerated on all charges. Here, the Director seeks reconsideration only of the theft charge sustained by the administrative judge and reversed by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That charge was based on appellant's admission to an agency investigator that she had, while working in the agency's mailroom, removed $10.00 from an envelope addressed to an inmate and used it to buy her lunch. She told the investigator that she replaced the $10.00 the following day and posted it to the inmate's account. The administrative judge presiding over the case held a hearing, at which appellant testified that the statements she made to the investigator were the result of coercion. He issued an initial decision sustaining the theft charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the administrative judge found that appellant's statement to investigators was voluntarily given. That admission, he held, established that appellant had committed a theft. In so holding, the administrative judge noted that when an agency chooses to charge an employee with the commission of a crime, it bears the burden of proving all elements of that crime. He found that with regard to the crime of theft, such proof required a showing that the employee intended to appropriate the property in question "to a use inconsistent with the owner's rights and benefits." Acknowledging that appellant returned the money to the envelope the following day, the administrative judge held nonetheless that appellant utilized the money in a manner inconsistent with the owner's rights and benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant petitioned the full Board for review of the initial decision in which she argued that she merely borrowed the money in question, and that there was no agency rule or regulation against such borrowing. She argued further that the administrative judge erred in holding that the agency established that appellant had the requisite criminal intent for theft.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, in its Opinion and Order, refined the administrative judge's identification of the elements of the crime of theft.... [T]he Board held that to sustain a charge of theft, an agency must prove the taking of another's property in a manner inconsistent with the owner's rights and benefits, with an intent to <span class="Italic">permanently</span> deprive the owner of the possession and use of his property. Because appellant returned the money the following day and posted it to the inmate's account, the Board held, no intent of permanent deprivation could be inferred from her actions. The charge of theft, the Board held, could therefore not be sustained. Because the agency had not charged appellant with any lesser offenses, the Board held that it was constrained from considering whether appellant had committed any. The Board reversed the initial decision. 50 MSPR 456 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Director's Petition</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...OPM...argues...that when an agency bases an action on a criminal offense, it does not have to prove the elements of the crime. All that is required, OPM argues, is that the agency give the employee fair notice of the misconduct charged....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Elements of the Charge</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's analysis of the elements of the charge, OPM argues, is "an elucidation of the wrong legal test," and resulted in an incorrect decision. "It does not make any difference whatsoever," OPM states in its brief, "whether the conduct charged might <span class="Italic">otherwise</span> constitute a criminal offense." OPM makes this statement even though the agency did not charge the appellant with conduct that "might otherwise" constitute a criminal offense, but instead charged her with theft, a criminal offense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's notice to the appellant stated simply that she was being charged with "Theft." The agency then set out in the notice what it describes as the "specification in support of this charge." What follows is the allegation that the appellant removed $10.00 from an inmate's envelope and used it to buy lunch. That she returned the money the following day is not mentioned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board correctly determined, however, the fact, established at the hearing, that the appellant returned the money is ultimately crucial to the outcome of the case. The Board held that an intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession and use of the property is an element that must be proven to support a charge of theft. The return of the money belied such an intent. The agency alleged facts that it believed supported a charge of theft, and the Board determined that the facts as proven did not support such a charge. Although those facts may have supported a lesser charge, no such charge was levied by the agency. It is this result, apparently, that OPM believes constitutes an incorrect interpretation of civil service law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"It does not make any difference," OPM asserts, "what the agency calls the conduct, [or] how the agency styles the charge." Carried to an extreme, this contention, if accepted, would allow an agency to charge an appellant with assault, based on allegations of conduct amounting to misuse of government property, so long as the appellant is on notice of the conduct alleged. However, a fact that has been long established in Board decisions is that what the agency calls the conduct makes a great deal of difference in proceedings before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has consistently held that it will not sustain an action based on charges that an agency could have properly brought, but did not. <span class="Italic">Green v. Department of the Army</span>, 25 MSPR 342, 345 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 785 F.2d 326 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table); <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Government Printing Office</span>, 5 MSPB 376, 5 MSPR 354, 357 (1981). In <span class="Italic">Green</span>, the Board noted that the agency might have successfully based an action on charges of conflict of interest, but, having charged the appellant instead with falsification of documents, it had failed to prove appellant's intent to defraud, an element of the charge upon which it based the action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 345. In <span class="Italic">Johnston</span>, the Board stated unequivocally that "if the charges of the agency are not supported by the required evidence, the Board will not sustain the action. Nor will the Board sustain the action based on charges that could have been levied but were not." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 357. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. United States Postal Service</span>, 48 MSPR 472 (1991) (It is the agency's burden to prove the substance of its charge.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These principles were amplified by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. General Services Administration</span>, 878 F.2d 370 (Fed. Cir. 1989). There, the court reversed a Board decision sustaining an agency action based on the charge of insubordination. The agency had so charged the appellant based on her continued failure to produce evidence that she had paid a delinquent Diners Club charge card bill. Holding that the agency had failed to establish that the appellant had at any time refused to obey an agency order, the court held that the finding that the appellant was guilty of insubordination was not supported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 374. The court noted additionally that because the agency had dismissed a previously-levied charge of indebtedness, it would not consider argument related to that charge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Knuckles v. Bolger</span>, 654 F.2d 25, 28 (8th Cir. 1981) (Where the agency failed to prove the elements of a charge against an employee of illegal conversion, due process required that he be allowed to respond to a charge of violating accounting procedures based on the same conduct). These basic holdings by the Board and the courts are in direct conflict with OPM's <span id="Page_3191"></span>unsupported argument that the charge does not matter so long as the conduct on which it is based is adequately described.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's argument also fails to take account of the serious effect its proposed rule could have on employees. Here, for example, appellant would be found to have committed what is commonly understood to be a criminal offense, even though she temporarily took a small sum and returned it the following day. A disproportionate effect on her reputation and employment prospects could well ensue. Agencies, on the other hand, will not be seriously affected by the need in appropriate cases to state misconduct charges without the use of incorrect criminal terminology. In a similar vein, we held in <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 54 MSPR 58, 69 (1992), that if misconduct is charged as sexual harassment under the anti-discrimination laws, the elements of that charge must be proved. We pointed out there that this does not mean agencies may not successfully charge misconduct of a sexual nature as grounds for discipline, even if it does not amount to sexual harassment. It simply means that agencies must exercise care to see that they charge what they intend to prove. Similarly, here we did not hold that appellant's behavior was proper. We simply held that the agency did not prove the elements of its charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Fair Notice is Not at Issue</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After arguing that the need to prove the elements of the offense it has charged is eliminated where an agency has given fair notice of the conduct in issue, OPM analyzes the fair notice requirement. It cites a number of Board decisions that it states hold that "fair notice is the key to an adequate proposed action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While fair notice is the key to an adequate proposed action, the Board is not faced here with whether there has been fair notice. In this case, the Board, acknowledging that the elements of a charge must be proven in order for it to sustain the action based on the charge, clarifies what, if the charge is theft, those elements are. The cases cited by OPM, however, refer to what constitutes proper notice of a charge upon which a proposed action is based.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Bize v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 3 MSPB 261, 3 MSPR 155 (1980), cited by OPM, involves whether the agency, in its proposal to suspend appellant and its decision letter regarding the suspension stated the charges with sufficient specificity. Similarly, <span class="Italic">Clardy v. Veterans Administration</span>, 12 MSPB 147, 13 MSPR 598 (1982), deals with the wording of a proposal notice. <span class="Italic">Pflanz v. Department of Transportation</span>, 21 MSPR 71 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table), and <span class="Italic">Spearman v. United States Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 135 (1990), likewise address whether an appellant was prejudiced by a lack of clarity in the charges upon which a personnel action was based. <span class="Italic">Fidelibus v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 24 MSPR 198 (1984), the final case cited by OPM on this issue, also contains a holding on whether a removal notice was sufficiently specific. OPM argues that the Board's holding in the instant case is "flatly inconsistent" with this line of cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, the instant case bears little relation to the line of cases cited by OPM. The instant case addresses an issue of proof. It answers the question of what elements of the charge of theft must be met to sustain an action based on that charge. The sufficiency of the appellant's notice is not now, nor was it ever at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, OPM incorrectly relies on <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672 (1991), for the view that the agency's failure to prove its charges was harmless procedural error. In <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, the Board held that when an appellant is afforded procedural rights that are minimally adequate for constitutional purposes, a showing of harmful error is necessary to overturn an agency action for failure to afford statutory procedural protections. Like OPM's other arguments, this one fails because it misapprehends what this case is about. We did not overturn the theft charge because procedural protections were denied. We overturned it because the substance of the charge was not proved on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit accepted the Board's reasoning, responding to OPM's petition for judicial review in <span class="Italic">King v. Nazelrod</span>, 43 F.3d 663, 666 (Fed. Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The substance of OPM's argument seems to be that any charge against an employee, regardless of how it may be labeled, should be sustained if the Agency proves what is set out in the specification as the misconduct. Thus, OPM states in its brief: "That the bureau here chose to caption as 'theft' the conduct more fully described in its accompanying specification changes nothing, and cannot elevate the standard of proof needed to establish that Ms. Nazelrod took and used another's money, as was charged and admitted."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject this position because it conflicts with the controlling case law of this court. We have mandated that the agency must prove all of the elements of the substantive offense with which an individual is charged.... Moreover, it is the burden of the agency to prove the requisite intent if intent is an element of the offense charged.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crouse v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 75 MSPR 57, 65 (1997) ("<span class="Italic">Nazelrod</span> stands for the proposition that an agency must be prepared to prove its accusations against an employee, not for a hypertechnical distinction between the caption and specifications of a particular charge."), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Lachance v. MSPB</span>, 147 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Tucker v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit clarified the correlation of a charge and supporting specifications in <span class="Italic">Lachance v. MSPB</span>, 147 F.3d 1367, 1371-74 (Fed. Cir. 1998). The court essentially concluded that if the charge is specific, the agency is held to proving the charge without having to prove each allegation of the supporting narrative. If the charge is ambiguous or unspecific, however, the Board should look to the supporting narrative to support the charge. The court decided that a charge (or narrative) may be stated in the alternative if different theories of discipline are being advanced by the employing agency. Under <span class="Italic">Lachance</span>, involving an allegation that an employee engaged in inappropriate behavior, supported by narrative suggesting that the employee either attempted to obstruct an investigation or conducted himself in a manner that allowed witness intimidation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency proposes to discipline an employee, it must notify the employee of the conduct with which he is charged "in sufficient detail to permit the employee to make an informed reply." <span class="Italic">Pope v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 114 F.3d 1144, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Agencies typically fulfill their responsibility to give notice by designating a particular charge and accompanying the charge with a narrative description setting forth the details of the charged misconduct. If the agency designates a specific charge as the basis for the proposed discipline, it must prove all the elements of that charge, even if those elements go beyond the factual allegations set forth in the accompanying narrative description. <span class="Italic">See King v. Nazelrod</span>, 43 F.3d 663, 666 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). The agency, however, is not required to prove all the facts that it alleges in support of its charge. In particular, "where more than one event or factual specification is set out to support a single charge..., proof of one or more, but not all, of the supporting specifications is sufficient to sustain the charge." <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172; <span class="Italic">see also Otero v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 73 MSPR 198, 204 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that intent is not an element of the second charge against Lieutenant Crouse, which was labeled "Unacceptable and Inappropriate Behavior By a Supervisor." For that reason, OPM argues, the Board was wrong to require the agency to prove that Lieutenant Crouse intended to obstruct an agency investigation. That argument, however, is too broad. The charge of "unacceptable and inappropriate behavior" is entirely unspecific; when an agency uses such general charging language, the Board must look to the specification to determine what conduct the agency is relying on as the basis for its proposed disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Huisman v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 35 MSPR 378, 380-91 (1987) (employee charged with "misconduct"; Board looked to specification to determine true nature of the charge).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board were prohibited from ever looking to the specification to help define the charged conduct, the notice requirement would lose much of its value in cases in which agencies use general charge labels such as "unacceptable and inappropriate behavior" or "misconduct." Where the charge label provides no meaningful description of the charge, an agency would be free to prove any conduct generally relating to the conduct described in the specification, as long as that conduct could be characterized as "inappropriate" or "misconduct." Such a regime would be inconsistent with due process, and the Board has properly declined to endorse it. <span class="Italic">Cf. Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d at 527 (due process requires agencies to provide employees with meaningful notice of the charges against them).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its contention that the Board may never refer to the specification to determine the elements of the charge against an employee, OPM relies on this court's decision in <span class="Italic">King v. Nazelrod</span>, 43 F.3d 663 (Fed. Cir. 1994). <span class="Italic">Nazelrod</span>, however, does not stand for that proposition. In <span class="Italic">Nazelrod</span>, the agency charged the employee with theft, and we held that the agency was therefore required to prove all the elements of the offense of theft. We rejected the agency's argument that it was not required to prove the elements of the designated charge as long as it proved the conduct alleged in the specification. Contrary to the government's contention, however, we did not address whether the Board may construe a general charge in accordance with the specification if the effect of the specification is to require proof of additional elements. Thus, if the agency charges an employee with inappropriate behavior by a supervisor and the specification alleges that the supervisor stole another employee's property, <span class="Italic">Nazelrod</span> does not prohibit the Board from requiring the agency to prove the offense of theft, rather than some lesser offense such as temporarily borrowing property without permission. In fact, <span class="Italic">Nazelrod</span> supports the Board's position on this issue, not OPM's. The principle underlying <span class="Italic">Nazelrod</span> is that the agency must prove what it charges; where the specification contains the only meaningful description of the charge, <span class="Italic">Nazelrod</span> supports the Board's conclusion that <span id="Page_3192"></span>the agency must prove what it has alleged in the specification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM further argues that the Board's ruling is inconsistent with this court's decision in <span class="Italic">King v. Frazier</span>, 77 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Again, we disagree. In <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, an arbitrator ruled that an employee must act intentionally in order to be guilty of the offense of engaging in "notoriously disgraceful conduct." We reversed, holding that the charge of "notoriously disgraceful conduct" does not necessarily require proof of intent. 77 F.3d at 1363-64. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, however, suggests that whenever an agency uses a general charge, such as "notoriously disgraceful conduct," it need not prove intent, even if the specific disgraceful conduct designated in the underlying specification incorporates an element of intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the principles discussed above, we conclude that if the specification had referred only to Lieutenant Crouse's alleged intent to impede the agency's investigation, it would have been proper for the Board to require the agency to prove intent on Lieutenant Crouse's part. We therefore reject OPM's contention that because intent is not an "element" of the charge of "unacceptable and inappropriate behavior by a supervisor," it was improper for the Board to require the agency to prove intent. Nonetheless, we reverse the Board's decision in this case because we conclude that the Board erred in ruling that the specification required the agency to prove that Lieutenant Crouse intended to impede the agency's investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board treats the specification as if it had alleged only that Lieutenant Crouse acted with intent to impede the agency's investigation. The specification, however, was not so limited. Rather, the agency set forth two alternative characterizations of the second charge against Lieutenant Crouse. First, it alleged that Lieutenant Crouse was attempting to persuade Sergeant Scheppler not to cooperate fully with the investigation. Second, it alleged that even if that was not Lieutenant Crouse's intent, his actions were improper because he should have known that, as his subordinate, Sergeant Scheppler would perceive his conduct as intimidating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After finding that the agency failed to prove that Lieutenant Crouse intended to impede the investigation, the administrative judge held the entire charge to be unsupported, rather than going on to consider whether the agency had proved that Lieutenant Crouse should have known that Sergeant Scheppler would perceive his conduct as intimidating. That was error. If that alternative statement of the basis for the second charge is sufficient to constitute "unacceptable and inappropriate behavior by a supervisor"--an issue the parties have not addressed at this juncture--the Board must determine whether the evidence offered by the agency was sufficient to prove that allegation and thus to sustain the charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board argues that the narrative description of the second charge against Lieutenant Crouse makes clear that the "unacceptable and inappropriate behavior" in question was attempted obstruction of an agency investigation, which requires proof of an intent to impede its investigation. In support of that characterization of the charge, the Board points to language in both the proposal and decision notices as well as the testimony of the proposing and deciding officials at the hearing before the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the Board's contention, the proposal and decision notices did not characterize the charge against Lieutenant Crouse as requiring proof of intent to impede the agency's investigation. Instead, both the proposal notice and the decision notice made clear that, while the agency believed that Lieutenant Crouse had acted with intent to impede the investigation, that allegation was not an essential part of the charge against him. As we have noted, the proposing and deciding officials stated that "[I]t appears that you were attempting to persuade Sergeant Scheppler into not cooperating fully in the investigation of your conduct." But each document then added, "Even if this was not your intent, you should have realized how your words and manner would have been perceived by a subordinate employee who was being asked in the investigation of this incident to discuss your behavior." By setting out the charge in alternative terms, the agency made clear that, although it was prepared to prove culpable intent, it did not regard such proof as an essential part of the charge against Lieutenant Crouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The above-quoted portion of the proposal and decision notices is clear enough, but another portion of the decision notice removes all doubt as to the nature of the charge. In response to Lieutenant Crouse's argument that his conduct should not have caused Sergeant Scheppler to feel intimidated, the decision notice explained, "You were charged with 'Unacceptable and Inappropriate Behavior By a Supervisor,' not with attempted intimidation." The notice thus confirmed that the agency did not regard an attempt to intimidate Sergeant Scheppler, and thereby to impede the investigation, as an essential element of the charged offense; rather, it was sufficient for the agency to show that Lieutenant Crouse should have appreciated that Sergeant Scheppler would interpret his conduct as intimidating in nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board responds by pointing to the testimony of the proposing and deciding officials at the hearing before the administrative judge, in which both officials characterized the conduct of Lieutenant Crouse that was the subject of the second charge as attempted intimidation of a subordinate and attempted obstruction of an investigation. While such testimony may help determine the nature of a charge when the charge itself is ambiguous, we do not regard the charge in this case to be ambiguous at all. Moreover, the proposing and deciding officials were not purporting to give a precise and comprehensive statement of the charges against Lieutenant Crouse, but were simply summarizing the allegations as they understood them. Their testimony does not provide a sufficient basis for disregarding the language of the specification and committing the agency to a narrower charge than the one set forth in the proposal and decision notices. Rather, based on the language in the notices, we construe the charge of "unacceptable and inappropriate behavior by a supervisor," as applied to Lieutenant Crouse's case, to require either proof of an intent to impede an investigation or proof that Lieutenant Crouse "should have realized how [his] words and manner would have been perceived by a subordinate employee who was being asked in the investigation of this incident to discuss [his] behavior."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board further contends that because both the proposing and the deciding officials testified that they regarded the alleged obstruction of the investigation as the aspect of the charge against Lieutenant Crouse that most clearly justified his demotion, upholding the second charge based only on less culpable conduct would result in sustaining a penalty that was based on much more serious conduct than the agency was able to prove.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board raises a legitimate concern, that concern is best dealt with by assessing the reasonableness of the penalty in light of the agency's proof, rather than by holding the second charge to be unsubstantiated. The proper approach is for the Board to consider, first, whether the agency proved that Lieutenant Crouse engaged in unacceptable and inappropriate behavior, and then to decide whether the particular unacceptable and inappropriate behavior that was proved justifies the penalty imposed by the agency. If the penalty that the agency imposed was greater than the maximum reasonable penalty for the conduct that the agency proved, the Board may mitigate the penalty without the need to hold that the underlying charge is unsupported. Thus, even if the Board sustains the second charge on the ground that Lieutenant Crouse should have known that his actions would be regarded as intimidating, the Board must still consider whether the penalty of demotion is excessive for that conduct together with the conduct proved under the first charge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Webster v. Department of the Army</span>, 911 F.2d 679, 688 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Parker v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 819 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board examines the specific charge, the supporting narrative, and the penalty analysis to determine the true nature of the charge, for example, whether the agency is required to prove intent rather than a negligent statement, <span class="Italic">George v. Dept. of Army</span>, 104 MSPR 596, 599-601 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8, 2007 MSPB 31 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the agency charged the appellant with "Allowing False Time Cards to be Processed Resulting in Over Payment for Unearned Overtime for Yourself and Subordinates." Under its narrative description of this charge, the agency asserted as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You submitted time cards in advance of a controlled burn at the Olsen Ranch which took place on 13 Oct 04. The work hours you recorded on the time cards were based on your projection that the day's activities would take 10 hours to complete. In fact you and your subordinates actually completed the entire day's mission on 13 Oct 04 prior to 6:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, less than the ten hours you had annotated on the time cards. <span class="Italic">Despite knowing that the mission actually took less time than originally projected, you took no action to correct the time cards to reflect the actual time worked</span>. You allowed the false time cards to be processed for payment for unworked overtime for yourself and subordinate firefighters...and range technicians.... This resulted in the government paying you and subordinate employees for 15 hours of unearned overtime. Your misconduct resulted in your own personal gain; you were overpaid for 3 hours of overtime that you did not work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proposal notice also stated that both the time cards and the <span id="Page_3193"></span>incident report "falsely indicate all employees working at the Olsen Ranch, to include you, worked until 6:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> These separate, but related actions show your clear intent to falsify official records to defraud the government for payment of unearned overtime, a deliberate act for which you reaped personal gains." The proposal notice further provided that "[T]he testimony of all witnesses and the results of the investigation demonstrated to me that you violated that trust by intentionally allowing what you knew to be false time cards to be processed for payment to yourself and subordinates and for falsifying the department's Incident Report." In the discussion of the penalty, the proposal notice indicates that "[m]ost troubling is the evidence that clearly shows your deliberate attempt to falsify multiple official documents for personal gain." The penalty discussion references the offense of "False Statements" in the agency's table of penalties, and states that "[t]his includes falsifying information on a time card." The decision notice also suggests that the first charge included an element of intent. ("You entered an incorrect completion time [on the incident report] and ensured that it correlated exactly with the estimated overtime entered on the time cards)."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After a prehearing conference and based on a review of the proposal and decision letters, the AJ ruled that the first charge "require[s] proof of intentional falsification." The AJ notified the parties of the elements for proving a charge of falsification. Nevertheless, in his initial decision, the AJ agreed with the agency that the first charge only required proof that the appellant was negligent, i.e., that he had a supervisory duty to correct the time cards or ensure they were corrected, that he breached that duty, and that the breach caused the agency to overpay overtime. The AJ found that, because the agency clearly labeled the second charge "falsification," it knew how to bring a charge that required the agency to prove that the appellant's actions were intentional. The AJ also found that the first charge was "carefully worded" and that the proposal notice "notes that falsification of time cards was investigated, but then states only that the investigation confirmed the overpayment of overtime." The AJ found that, although the proposing official referenced "falsifying information on a time card" when discussing the penalty, an agency may charge an employee with an offense that does not include an element of intent, but consider the fact that the employee intentionally committed the offense as a factor in assessing the penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board must review the agency's decision in an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency, and may not substitute what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis<span class="Italic">. Gottlieb v. Veterans Administration,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 606, 609 (1989). If an agency chooses to label an act of misconduct, it is bound to prove the elements that make up the legal definition of that charge. <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 202 (1997). In resolving the issue of how a charge should be construed, the structure and language in the proposal notice and the decision notice will be examined. <span class="Italic">James v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 300, 303-04 (1997).

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6; 12 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency used the word "false" in the label it affixed to its first charge in describing the time cards the appellant allowed to be processed. It did not use the word "incorrect" to describe the time cards, nor did it include the word "negligent" or "negligence" in either the charge or the narrative description underlying the charge. In addition, as set forth above, the proposal letter is replete with language indicating that the agency was charging the appellant with deliberately and intentionally allowing "false" time cards to be processed. Such language can be found in sections of the proposal notice that do not relate solely to the penalty. The proposal notice even references an intent on the part of the appellant to defraud the government of unearned overtime. We further find that the proposal notice does not note, as the AJ found, that falsification of time cards was investigated, but the investigation confirmed only the overpayment of overtime. Instead, the proposal notice says that an investigation was initiated into allegations of falsification of time cards and other Fire Department records, and the results of the investigation "confirmed that Mr. Dykstra's allegation of overpayment for unearned overtime for you and subordinates...was correct." In fact, the investigator found that the appellant "falsely prepared his time card to indicate he worked overtime that he did not work." Thus, to prove its charge, the agency had to show that the time cards were "false," not merely incorrect. <span class="Italic">See Naekel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 782 F.2d 975, 977 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (to sustain a falsification charge, the agency must prove by preponderant evidence that the employee knowingly supplied incorrect information with the intention of defrauding the agency). In addition, based on the language of the charge as a whole and in light of the narrative description, the agency was required to show that the appellant intentionally allowed the false time cards to be processed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, PH-0752-14-0438-I-2 (NP 11/29/2016), sustained removal of an employee who did not attain or receive a required certification, although the charge was failure to complete training:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the clarity of the specification and accompanying circumstances, the appellant urges the Board to technically construe the charge by its label and require the agency to prove the elements of a "failure to complete training" charge. However, the appellant's "exclusive focus on the heading of the Notice of Proposed Removal is misplaced, as charged offenses are to be gleaned from the Notice of Proposed Removal as a whole, particularly the specification(s) supporting the heading." <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 466 F.3d 1065, 1070 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (finding that, although the name of the charge in the proposal notice was "misuse of Postal Service funds," the specification underlying the charge afforded the appellant sufficient notice of the elements of the distinct charge of failure to timely pay his Government-issued credit card). Therefore, we reject the appellant's contention that the charge must be technically construed by its label without reference to the rest of the proposal notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Construing the charge in light of the accompanying specification and the surrounding circumstances, including those explicitly discussed in the proposal notice, it is clear that the proposed removal was based on the appellant's failure to attain his Level III IAT Certification within 6 months of his appointment, which was a DOD requirement and a condition of his employment. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge's implicit interpretation of the charge and find that the proposal notice charged the appellant with failure to fulfill a condition of employment; namely, a Level III IAT Certification within 6 months of his appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that due process requires that a Federal employee facing removal be provided "notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story." <span class="Italic">Alford v. Department of Defense</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 556, &#x00B6; 6 (2012) (quoting <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985)). Here, as discussed above, the appellant received written notice that clearly explained the reason for his proposed removal. He further had an opportunity to make both a written and an oral response to the deciding official, which he did, and the deciding official considered those responses in deciding to impose the removal. Because the appellant was adequately notified of the charges against him and afforded an opportunity to respond, we find that he has failed to establish any due process violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A harmful procedural error occurs when the appellant proves that the agency committed a procedural error, whether regulatory or statutory, that likely had a harmful effect on the outcome of the case before the agency. <span class="Italic">Tom v. Department of the Interior</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 395, &#x00B6; 43 (2004). Here, the appellant argues that the agency committed a harmful procedural error because, "since the agency charged [him] with failure to complete training it's [sic] conclusion should have been that the charge could not be sustained because it failed to meet all the elements of the charge."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's contention that the agency could not prove the charge of "failure to complete training" does not implicate a harmful procedural error; rather, this argument goes to the merits of the removal action. As discussed above, we find that the agency proved the charge, as construed in light of the specification and accompanying circumstances, by preponderant evidence. We discern no basis to conclude that the label of the charge constituted a harmful procedural error. To the contrary, we find that the appellant has not been harmed in the least because the agency labeled the charge as "failure to complete training" rather than a more precise label, such as "failure to obtain certification" or "failure to fulfill a condition of employment." <span class="Italic">Otero</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 203 (finding that the appellant was "not harmed in the least" because the agency used a "broad label").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Boltz v. SSA</span>, 111 MSPR 568, 573-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-20, 2009 MSPB 125 (2009), an element of intent that the agency was required to prove was implied in a general charge of inappropriate behavior:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the specifications, the notice of proposed removal set forth a "narrative description of misconduct," that included three sections--general background, events leading to the appellant's misconduct, and the misconduct of July 25, 2007. The events leading to the appellant's misconduct section chronicled the agency's version of the facts surrounding the reassignment of the case in question to the appellant and stated that the appellant was "well aware" and "knew" that the case had been assigned to her in early July 2007. The "misconduct of July 25, 2007" section then discussed the three statements at issue in greater detail, reiterating that the statements were "false," that the appellant "intentionally misstated" the true facts, and that the appellant's explanations of her statements were not credible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision notice similarly set forth the three sections just described in the notice of proposed removal, and included allegations that the appellant made "false" statements, and that she "knew" and was "well aware" that the case had been assigned to her in early July. This notice also included the deciding official's view that the appellant's claim, that she was unaware that the case at issue had been reassigned to her in early July 2007, was disingenuous and "unbelievable."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency's charge did not <span id="Page_3194"></span>require it to prove that the appellant intentionally falsified her court submission because the inappropriate behavior charge did not contain a specific intent element, and that the inclusion of the term "false" in the accompanying specifications did not require a different result. The administrative judge also found that the agency proved its first and third specifications and, therefore, proved the charge, but further found that the question of the appellant's intent was relevant in assessing the reasonableness of the penalty. The administrative judge then found that the agency did not show that the appellant intentionally falsified the submission and that the lack of intent was a significant mitigating factor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the agency's charge includes the specific intent required for a falsification charge. In resolving the issue of how a charge should be construed and what elements require proof, the Board examines the structure and language of the proposal notice and the decision notice. <span class="Italic">George v. Department of the Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 596, &#x00B6; 7 (2007), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 263 Fed. Appx. 889 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">James v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 300, 303-04 (1997); <span class="Italic">but see O'Keefe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 318 F.3d 1310, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (only the charge and specifications set out in the proposal notice may be used to justify punishment). Where, as here, the agency has employed a generic label for the charge, the Board must look to the specification to determine what conduct the agency is relying on as the basis for its proposed action. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 147 F.3d 1367, 1372-72 (Fed. Cir. 1998). If an agency chooses to label an act of misconduct, it is bound to prove the elements that make up the legal definition of that charge. <span class="Italic">George</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 596, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 202 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency here used the general charge of inappropriate behavior, its specifications and accompanying description of the appellant's actions show that the agency charged the appellant was making false statements to the court in her request for an extension of time. As set forth above, the agency repeatedly used the term "false" in describing the appellant's statements. Further, its conclusion that the appellant was "well aware" that her statements were inaccurate and its use of terms such disingenuous, not credible, and disturbing in rejecting the appellant's explanation of her action support the conclusion that the agency charged the appellant with intentionally making false statements. Indeed, in a later affidavit, the deciding official stated that she decided to remove the appellant from her position based upon the appellant's false statements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also recognize that the proposal and decision letters include some statements that, taken alone, could support the proposition that the agency did not charge the appellant with intentional falsification. These statements, however, do not overcome the references cited above, that warrant the conclusion that the accompanying specifications and circumstances in their entirety show that the agency charged the appellant with intentional falsification. <span class="Italic">See George</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 596, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency removed the appellant for making false statements, the agency must prove, by preponderant evidence, that the appellant knowingly provided wrong information with the intention of defrauding, deceiving, or misleading the agency. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Guerrero v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 617, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2007). Whether the element of intent has been proven must be resolved from the totality of the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 525, &#x00B6; 9 (2008); <span class="Italic">Blake v. Department of Justice</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 394, &#x00B6; 27 (1999). Because there is seldom direct evidence on the issue, circumstantial evidence must generally be relied upon to establish intent. <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 782 F.2d 975, 978 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 525, &#x00B6; 9. A conclusion that an appellant has provided incorrect information, however, does not control the question of intent for purposes of adjudicating a falsification charge. <span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 525, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Mendez v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 596, &#x00B6; 16 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge has fully adjudicated the issue of the appellant's intent in accordance with this standard, with respect to the two specifications he sustained below. The administrative judge's findings on the issue were based upon credibility determinations that included observations of the appellant's demeanor. These findings are entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">Haebe</span>, 288 F.3d at 1301. With respect to the remaining specification, the administrative judge accepted the appellant's claim that she stated a fact that she believed to be true, even though she may have been mistaken in her belief. This finding was also based upon credibility determinations that included demeanor observation, and it is similarly entitled to deference. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee Haebe</span>, 288 F.3d at 1301. We therefore find that the agency has failed to prove its charge against the appellant and, consequently, that her removal cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 73 MSPR 397 (1997), separated out broad descriptions of misconduct in the proposal from specifications appearing in the narrative of the proposal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its notice of proposed removal, the agency first identified four "reasons" for the proposal that repeat the language of certain broad offenses listed in the agency's standard table of offenses and penalties. The agency then set forth a narrative description of its seven "specifications" and ended each "specification" with a statement indicating the offense the appellant was charged with.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, Reason 1 provides: INSUBORDINATION (DELIBERATE AND WILLFUL REFUSAL TO PERFORM ASSIGNED WORK); INSOLENCE (FLAGRANT AND CONTEMPTUOUS DISRESPECT), WHICH IS A VIOLATION OF SECTION 1 OF NGA'S STANDARD TABLE OF OFFENSES AND PENALTIES. Reason 2 provides: CREATING A PUBLIC DISTURBANCE; RUDENESS OR USE OF THREATENING LANGUAGE TO OTHER PERSONS, WHICH IS A VIOLATION OF SECTION 10 OF NGA'S STANDARD TABLE OF OFFENSES AND PENALTIES. Specification A sets forth the facts surrounding the appellant's alleged misconduct on June 5, 1991, and then provides, "[y]ou persist to handle yourself in an insolent and rude manner whenever addressing me with any given issue a majority of the time. I am therefore charging you with both insolence and rudeness for the above described incident." Similarly, with regard to Specification A, the removal decision sustains "the charges of insolence and rudeness for the above described incident."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the AJ found that the agency had charged the appellant with being "insubordinate in that he was insolent and rude to his supervisor and refused to carry out specific orders...." The AJ then defined insubordination, and sustained Specifications A, B, C, D, and G based on findings that the appellant committed the alleged misconduct and that such misconduct constituted insubordination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ, however, should not have construed the agency's charges as alleging insubordination. The "reasons" for the proposed removal set forth by the agency, which included the word "insubordination," as well as such language as "creating a public disturbance," merely identified the broad categories of offenses set forth in the agency's standard table of offenses and penalties under which the appellant's alleged misconduct fell. The actual seven charges against the appellant were identified at the end of each of the agency's seven "specifications." Therefore, as set forth in the proposal and removal notices, the AJ should have determined whether the agency proved the charges of: Insolence and rudeness on June 5, 1991 (Specification A); insolence and rudeness on June 14, 1991 (Specification B); insolence and rudeness on July 18, 1991 (Specification C); insolence on July 23, 1991 (Specification D); and failure to carry out specific verbal orders on August 13, 1991 (Specification G). <span class="Italic">See Colon v. Department of the Navy</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 190, 197 (1993) (the AJ should not have converted a charge of "disorderly conduct" into a charge of "threats, assault, and battery" when the agency did not use those terms to describe the appellant's conduct).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Plenty v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 373 Fed. Appx. 58, 60-61 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), construed a charge according to the specifications rather than the exact charge label:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Plenty argues that the Board erred in sustaining Charge One of the Notice of Proposed Removal because the label of this charge was "Improper Use of Government Records," and the supporting narrative did not allege that Ms. Plenty ever made use of the records provided to her by Ms. Charette. Instead, the narrative set forth that Ms. Plenty improperly requested and obtained the records for other than official purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Ms. Plenty that the Agency erred in conflating the charges of misuse of government records and improper acquisition of those records. Nevertheless, we construe Charge One of the Notice of Proposed Removal as charging Ms. Plenty with both misconducts. <span class="Italic">See Allen v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 466 F.3d 1065, 1070-71 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (interpreting a Notice of Proposed Removal as charging petitioner with two separate charges, even though the heading of the notice only indicated a single charge). Ms. Plenty understood the Agency's primary concern was her improper acquisition of the government records and she responded to this charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the charge is ambiguous, the supporting factual recitation in the proposal or decision letter, as well as the testimony of a deciding official, may be considered to determine the true nature of the charge, <span class="Italic">Crouse v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 70 MSPR 623, 628-29 (1996), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lachance v. MSPB</span>, 147 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 1998), <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge thus relied on the testimony of the deciding official as to the essence of the "inappropriate behavior" charge, as well as the agency's own statement in its proposal notice, to characterize the substance of that charge. This distinguishes the instant case from <span class="Italic">Colon v. Department of the Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 190, 197 (1993) (administrative judge could not convert a charge of "disorderly conduct" into a charge of "threats, assault, and battery" when the agency did not use those latter terms in its proposal notice to describe the appellant's conduct).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A charge should be construed in light of its specifications<span class="Italic">. See Bonanova v. Department of Education</span>, 49 MSPR 294, 298 (1991), citing <span class="Italic">Huisman v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 35 MSPR 378, 380-81 (1987) (remand where administrative judge characterized the charge as one of misconduct based on discourtesy, but sustained the penalty of removal based on the more serious characterization of the misconduct as a threat). In <span class="Italic">Huisman</span>, as in the case at hand, the agency set out a general charge <span id="Page_3195"></span>against the appellant (in <span class="Italic">Huisman</span>, "misconduct"; in the matter at hand, "unacceptable and inappropriate behavior by a supervisor"). Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Huisman</span> as in this case, the testimony of the appellant's supervisor was in conformity with the specifications (discourtesy to a supervisor, and threat). <span class="Italic">See Huisman</span>, 35 MSPR at 380. When specifications and other evidence indicate that the agency is charging the appellant with a serious charge, it is error for the administrative judge to analyze the charge as a lesser offense. <span class="Italic">See Bonanova</span>, 49 MSPR at 298, citing <span class="Italic">Huisman</span>, 35 MSPR at 380-81.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge must determine what are the essential elements of a charge. <span class="Italic">See Hanner v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 MSPR 113, 118-19 (1992) (40-minute length of work disruption was not an element of the charge). In this matter, intimidation of an employee was not a mere consequence of the charged misconduct; it was the gravamen of the charge. Given the ambiguity apparent in the record, the administrative judge did not err in incorporating that element into the title of the charge, and into her analysis, when the agency's narrative description and subsequent testimony identified it as essential.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lowe v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210111127">842 Fed. Appx. 584</a> (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gibson v. USPS,</span> PH-0752-10-0315-I-1 (NP 9/14/2011), considered background narrative as part of the specification:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice of proposed removal is awkwardly organized. As the appellant correctly notes, the agency did not include the appellant's conduct on January 15 in the "Specification" portion of the notice but instead included reference to that conduct in a separate section labeled "Background." We find, however, that the administrative judge correctly found that the language in the proposal's "Background" section was a narrative charge. The "Background" section begins with a description of the events of January 20:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On January 20, 2010, approximately 0849 hrs you were instructed by Acting Supervisor Dawn Murphy on several occasions to report to the supervisors office. You refused all requests from Supervisor Murphy to report to the Supervisors office and continued sitting in the break area writing grievances. Instead of following the instructions you were given by Supervisor Murphy, you repeatedly insisted upon seeing Ms. Murphy's PS Form 1723, higher level assignment paperwork. Supervisor Murphy left the break area and returned several minutes later with Supervisor Stanley Newsome. Supervisor Murphy, in the presence of Supervisor Newsome, gave you instructions to report to the Supervisors office, again you refused to report and again you continued to ask for Ms. Murphy's 1723 paperwork. At this time Supervisor Newsome tried to explain Supervisor Murphy's status to you but you wouldn't listen. Supervisor Murphy, in the presence of Supervisor Newsome, gave you a direct order to report to the supervisor's office, again you refused to report. Supervisor Newsome instructed you to report to the supervisor's office. You proceeded to leave the break room with Supervisor Newsome in the lead. As you were leaving the break area, Supervisor Newsome stopped and turned in order to hear what you were saying. You did not stop but continued to approach Supervisor Newsome and bump into him while stating, "Bitch, what are you going to do about it?"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proposal next addresses the events of January 15:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In addition, on January 15, 2010, approximately 1845 hrs when you returned to the office after delivering your route (013010), you were approached by Station Manager Michael Book. You were instructed to return to the street and carry additional deliveries. You approached Manager Book in a loud voice and stated, "Are you discriminating against me?" You continued in a loud manner, disrupting the workroom floor as you continued shouting the previous phrase and approaching Manager Book. You came within six inches of Manager Book, face to face as you continued asking, "Are you discriminating against me?" Acting Supervisor Dawn Murphy and Supervisor Cynthia Tucker witnessed your unwarranted and threatening behavior and were worried for Manager Book's safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "Background" section continues by stating that the appellant's conduct violated the agency's Zero Tolerance Policy on Workplace Violence, the agency's Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM), Section 665.24 (Violent and/or Threatening Behavior), and several other specific provisions of the ELM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a single stated charge contains two separate acts of misconduct that are not dependent on each other and do not comprise a single, inseparable event, each act constitutes a separate charge. <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 38 F.3d 563, 565 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 12 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Alvarado v. Wynne</span>, 626 F. Supp.2d 1140 (D. N.M. 2009). A charge must be viewed in light of accompanying specifications and should not be technically construed. <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 202 (1997). While an agency need not affix a specific label to a charge and may use a narrative to support a broad label such as "improper conduct," when an agency chooses a particular charge label, it is bound to prove the elements that make up the definition of that charge, if there are any. <span class="Italic">See Alvarado</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, although the title of the "Specification" mentions only the events of January 20, we find that the notice of proposed removal is properly read as containing a narrative charge concerning the events on both January 15 and January 20. Because the events of January 15 and January 20 are not dependent on each other and do not comprise a single, inseparable event, the events of January 15 are appropriately seen as a separate charge of "Improper Conduct" distinct from charges relating to the events of January 20. Moreover, because the agency charged that the appellant's "improper conduct" violated its Zero Tolerance Policy, as well as several enumerated sections of the ELM, the agency is required to prove that his conduct violated these specific policies. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wiley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 535, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 10-11 (2006) (where the agency charged the employee with improper conduct for violating a provision of its zero tolerance policy based on allegations that the employee made threatening statements, the agency was required to prove that the statements violated the agency's zero tolerance policy), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 218 F. App'x 1001 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Accordingly, we find that the agency charged the appellant with three charges of misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Riley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 53 MSPR 683, 688-89 (1992), the agency charged the appellant with AWOL and mentioned as a reason for the charge that the appellant had not requested or received approved leave. Because the charge was AWOL, however, the agency could not have the discipline sustained on the basis of appellant's failure to follow leave reporting or requesting procedures. That was a separate offense and should have been separately charged. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 73 MSPR 397, 401-02 (1997) (AJ erred by determining the appellant to have been insubordinate when the specific charge was that he was insolent and rude and the only mention of insubordination was a passing reference in the factual specification that supported the charge); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 MSPR 102, 103 (1984) (when the proposal charged AWOL from March through April, the AJ correctly refused to consider AWOL from July through October); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Seebach v. Cullen</span>, 338 F.2d 663, 665 (9th Cir. 1964) (assessing the sufficiency of the agency decision in a removal case: when the agency stated that the reasons set forth in the proposal were sustained, resulting in removal, "[s]pecific findings with respect to each example of conduct underlying these reasons were unnecessary").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 450, 456 &#x00B6; 8 (1998), it matters little if an AJ confuses charges with specifications if all of the described misconduct is sustained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge incorrectly treated the agency's factual specifications as separate charges. Although the administrative judge did refer to the specifications as "charges" in the initial decision, the appellant has not demonstrated that this error prejudiced her substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force,</span> 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision). Although the distinction between charges and specifications has some effect on the Board's analysis of the reasonableness of an agency's penalty determination, <span class="Italic">compare White v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 MSPR 521, 525-26 (1996) (instead of imposing the maximum reasonable penalty when not all of the agency's charges are sustained, the Board will independently and responsibly balance the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine a reasonable penalty) <span class="Italic">with Payne v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 72 MSPR 646, 650 (1996) (when all of the agency's charges are sustained, but not all of the underlying specifications are sustained, the agency's penalty determination is entitled to deference and should be reviewed to determine whether it is within the parameters of reasonableness), this distinction is inconsequential when the Board sustains all of the charged misconduct, regardless of whether the described misconduct is characterized as charges or specifications. If the Board sustains all of the described misconduct, the agency's penalty determination is entitled to deference, and the Board will mitigate the penalty only to the extent necessary to bring it within the parameters of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Payne,</span> 72 MSPR at 650-51; <span class="Italic">White,</span> 71 MSPR at 524-25....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At times the Board dismisses the differences between charges and specifications as sloppy draftsmanship and calls it a day, as in <span class="Italic">Tom v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 97 MSPR 395, 404-05 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-20 (2004), when the charge was that the appellant failed to obtain the required security clearance for her position, but the basis, as stated in the narrative, for the removal was that the appellant was unsuitable for continued employment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is axiomatic that the Board may review the agency's adverse action <span id="Page_3196"></span>solely on the grounds invoked by the agency. <span class="Italic">Stuhlmacher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 272 &#x00B6; 14 (2001); <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v. Veterans Administration</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 606, 609 (1989). An agency is required to state the reasons for a proposed adverse action in sufficient detail to allow the employee to make an informed reply, but the charge must be viewed in light of the accompanying specifications and should not be technically construed. <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 202 (1997); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Ayers-Kavtaradze v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 397 &#x00B6; 11 (2002). Hypertechnical common law pleading is not Board practice, and so an agency is not required to label its charge narrowly with magic words for it to be sustained by the Board. <span class="Italic">Otero</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 203; <span class="Italic">Lockett v. U.S. Marine Corps</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 427, 429 (1988). Instead, in determining how charges are to be construed, the Board will examine the structure and language of the proposal notice. <span class="Italic">Stuhlmacher</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 272 &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 98, 107 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant contends that the agency charged her with "failure to obtain the required security clearance" for her position, rather than for being found unsuitable for continued employment. The appellant accurately represents the label that the agency affixed to its charge. However, the AJ found that the agency uses the terms "suitability determination" and "security determination" interchangeably. The record fully supports this finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, the narrative portion of the charge specifically referred to the February 6, 2002 negative suitability determination that Ms. Florence had made. The narrative portion of the charge further stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Your position of Realty Specialist requires that you be cleared at a High Risk Public Trust Position level. It has been determined by the BIA Personnel and Physical Security Office that your continued employment in this position does not promote the efficiency of the Federal service. It was determined that your prior conduct indicates risk of abuse of the public trust in carrying out specific duties, including access to Bureau of Indian Affairs information technology systems and individual Indian and tribal trust resources.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not raised a claim that she did not understand the charge or that she did not receive fair and sufficient notice of the allegations against her. <span class="Italic">See Otero</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 203; <span class="Italic">see also Lockett</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. at 429 (the information provided by the agency must be sufficiently specific to permit the employee to properly respond to the agency's charge). In addition, the record in this case is clear that, at all times, the appellant was fully aware that she was being removed because she had been determined to be unsuitable for continued employment as a Realty Specialist and that she was fully aware of the reasons why she had been found unsuitable. Although we do not condone the agency's sloppy choice of words in its proposal and decision notices, we find that it clearly charged the appellant with unsuitability, and not with the failure to obtain a required security clearance.</p>
