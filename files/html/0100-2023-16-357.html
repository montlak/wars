<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-357"><span class="space">B.</span> FAILURE TO BARGAIN</h3>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's position on remedies in failure to bargain cases evolved through several stages. It is difficult to predict the precise remedy that will or should accompany a ULP finding. The ULP remedies are distinct from FLRA's treatment of negotiability disputes leading to prospective bargaining orders if resolved in favor of the union. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB Union v. FLRA</span>, 834 F.2d 191 (D.C. Cir. 1987) [discussed in <a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec4-1">Chapter 4</a>].</p>
<p class="noindent">Although FLRA at least noted that it is specifically authorized under &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7)(B) to remedy ULPs by fashioning and ordering the terms of collective bargaining agreements, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council and INS</span>, 51 FLRA 1308, 1337 n.17 (1996) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d 964, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1990)), that remedy can be eschewed in favor of a bargaining order designed to force bargaining on a single issue leading to the charge that the agency failed or refused to bargain. In an egregious bad faith bargaining case, and years after the events, FLRA did no more than direct the parties to bargain in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hq., Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Council 214</span>, 36 FLRA 524 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA will enter bargaining orders, including those that impact future negotiations. A bargaining order in an impact bargaining case may require that the agency bargain over procedures and arrangements that management will observe in future implementation of like, or related, assignments or programs. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Border Patrol, San Diego and Nat'l Border Patrol Council, AFGE Local 1613</span>, 35 FLRA 1039, 1040 (1990). The issuance of a bargaining order in a failure to bargain case is routine, unless the dispute is mooted by the passage of time or FLRA discerns that the matter leading to impact bargaining is <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The problem for the parties and FLRA is the relief required when employees <span id="page_1624"></span>arguably suffered monetary losses as a result of a nonnegotiated change in working conditions. FLRA uses two types of remedies. The first is a retroactive bargaining order ("RBO"). Through the RBO, FLRA directs the parties to negotiate with retroactive effect over the work practices leading to the ULP. The parties negotiate a solution to the change in working conditions and apply the negotiated solution retroactively to the date the working conditions changed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another remedy employed by FLRA involves an order to the agency to unscramble the egg by restoring working conditions to the state they were at immediately before the unlawful change in those working conditions. This remedy is characterized as a "<span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>" ("SQA") remedy. It allows the parties to negotiate as if the union received and acted on a timely notice from management concerning a change in working conditions. Generally speaking, when management changes a condition of employment without fulfilling its obligation to bargain over the substance of the decision to make the change, FLRA orders a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy unless there are special circumstances. When the bargaining obligation pertaining to a change is limited to the impact and implementation of the decision, FLRA applies criteria in <span class="Italic">FCI and AFGE Local 2052</span>, 8 FLRA 604, 606 (1982), <span class="Italic">post, </span>to determine whether a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Additionally, if FLRA can determine a loss for an individual employee or for a group of employees, it may require a make whole remedy, that is, an order directing specific payment or backpay as compensation for the loss suffered through the bargaining failure. The make whole remedy may be in addition to, or part of, a remedy that directs bargaining. If FLRA is to create a make whole remedy involving an order directing compensation for an individual or for individuals, a causal relationship must be established between the bargaining failure and the loss that is compensated.</p>
<p class="noindent">To summarize the remedial scheme for bargaining failures, we borrow, with thanks to FLRA, from its 2020 ULP Case Law Outline:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Unilateral Change</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022;&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Status quo ante remedy</span>: When an agency unlawfully implements a change in conditions of employment, the most effective traditional remedy is status quo ante relief. This remedy requires the agency to go back to the way things were before the change. The availability of this remedy encourages agencies to fulfill their bargaining obligations before implementing a change. <span class="Italic">FDIC v. FLRA</span>, 977 F.2d 1493, 1498 (D.C.

<p class="noindent">Each remedy has received extensive and not altogether consistent discussion and application by FLRA and by the courts.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the decisions of FLRA and the courts take many curious twists and follow divergent paths as to relief in cases involving failures to bargain over decisions or the impact of decisions, recent decisions favor a make whole remedy when monetary relief is an issue, along with an order directing either an SQA or other (retroactive or prospective) bargaining order. As good an explanation as any is a case of a unilateral change in working conditions leading to a loss of overtime that could not be precisely calculated, <span class="Italic">Pueblo Depot Activity and NAGE Local R14-5</span>, 50 FLRA 310, 311-12 (1995), relating a back pay remedy and an RBO:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A backpay award is appropriate to remedy an unlawful refusal to bargain over the impact and implementation of a decision when the refusal results in a withdrawal or reduction in an employee's pay, allowances, or differentials, including the opportunity to earn such compensation. <span class="Italic">U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Customs Service, Southwest Region, El Paso, Texas</span>, 44 FLRA 1128, 1129-30 (1992). This is so even where, as here, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is not appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Respondent's violation of the Statute constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the reduction of earning opportunities for bargaining unit employees because a substantial amount of overtime work was performed by those employees who were selected by the Respondent to be on the team. Therefore, a backpay award is proper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, there is no way to ascertain through compliance proceedings which employees would have been selected for the PDO team and, as a consequence, which employees would have been assigned overtime work had the parties bargained and reached agreement. Accordingly, we conclude that the unfair labor practice can best be remedied by the imposition of a retroactive bargaining order. Backpay will be awarded <span id="page_1625"></span>consistent with the outcome of that bargaining. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Hartford District Office, Hartford, Connecticut</span>, 37 FLRA 278, 292 (1990) (where it is clear that some employees have been affected by an unlawful refusal to bargain, but there is no way to ascertain their identity through compliance proceedings, the parties can establish through bargaining the causal nexus between the unlawful refusal to bargain and the loss of pay or benefits that is required by the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Gen. Comm.</span>, 50 FLRA 296, 50 FLRA at 299-300 n.3 (1995), the employer implemented revised performance standards for unit employees while the union's request for assistance with negotiations over the impact and implementation of the revised standards was pending before the FSIP. FLRA considered the distinction between a "make whole" and a "<span class="Italic">status quo</span>" remedy, as it remanded the case for further analysis by the ALJ:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">SSA Council 220</span>, 840 F.2d at 931, the court viewed individualized make-whole relief as a "partial" or "limited" <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy. Of course, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy necessarily includes make-whole relief. However, it is not clear that the reverse also is always true; for example, make-whole relief which does not involve rescission of an unlawful change (even as to individual employees) is not appropriately characterized as a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy. In a situation where make-whole relief does not include <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> aspects, <span class="Italic">FCI</span> does not by its terms apply. Accordingly, although the court in <span class="Italic">SSA Council 220</span> referenced the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors in connection with its discussion of make-whole relief, we do not read that decision as requiring application of <span class="Italic">FCI</span> in every case in which make-whole relief is considered. Put simply, we will not apply <span class="Italic">FCI</span> except in connection with <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedies, whether considered in the traditional manner, encompassing rescission of an unlawful change in its entirety, or more narrowly with respect to individual employees as part of make-whole relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA explained the connection between an SQA remedy and direct monetary relief, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23, SEIU</span>, 42 FLRA 266, 274-75 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Respondent failed to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> to the maximum extent possible, while an impasse concerning the termination of EDP for employees in the Shop was pending before the Panel. Instead, the Respondent terminated the EDP for those employees without bargaining with the exclusive representative of the employees. Generally, in the absence of special circumstances, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is appropriate in cases where, as here, an agency has refused to bargain over the substance of a matter which is within its duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Customs Service, Region IV, Miami District, Miami, Florida</span>, 38 FLRA 838, 844 (1990). We note that no special circumstances are alleged in this case, and none are apparent to us. Accordingly, we find that a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> and a notice posting at the affected locations are appropriate actions to remedy the unfair labor practices which have been committed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also conclude that backpay is an appropriate remedy to make whole any employee who suffered a withdrawal or reduction in pay, allowances, or differentials as a result of the implementation of the decision to terminate EDP in the Shop. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Hartford District Office, Hartford, Connecticut</span>, 37 FLRA 278 (1990), we set forth an approach for determining when, in addition to a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> award, backpay would be appropriate in "cases involving changes in conditions of employment resulting from unlawful refusals to bargain, regardless of whether the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> award stems from a refusal to bargain over [the substance of] a decision or from an analysis conducted under <span class="Italic">Federal Correctional</span> [<span class="Italic">Institution</span>, 8 FLRA 604 (1982)], concerning a failure to engage in impact and implementation bargaining."...&#8197;We stated that in such cases, if we determine that "the agency's actions resulted in a withdrawal or reduction in pay, allowances or differentials of identifiable employees, we will then order the agency to make such employees whole for that withdrawal or reduction." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 292. We further stated that we would "leave to the compliance stage any questions as to the actual amount to be paid." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a comprehensive statement as to the nature and use of the SQA remedy in <span class="Italic">FCI and AFGE Local 2052</span>, 8 FLRA 604, 606 (1982) (<span class="Italic">FCI</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">San Antonio Air Logistics Ctr., Kelly AFB and AFGE Local 1617</span>, 5 FLRA 173 (1981), and <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth</span>, 6 FLRA 74 (1981)), FLRA stated that in discharging its responsibilities, it is vested with wide discretion to fashion appropriate remedies. <span class="Italic">Status quo ante</span> remedies may be issued in certain refusal to bargain cases even when the agency's decision itself was not negotiable. When management has exercised its reserved rights under 7106 without fulfilling its duty to bargain with the exclusive representative concerning the procedures it will observe in the exercise of its prerogatives and regarding appropriate arrangements for unit employees adversely affected, pursuant to 7106(b)(2) and (b)(3), FLRA occasionally may order return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. The appropriateness of an SQA remedy must be determined on a case-by-case basis by carefully balancing the nature and circumstances of the particular violation against the degree of disruption in government operations caused by the remedy. FLRA noted (in a footnote) that &#x00A7; 7101(b) states the congressional intent that the provisions of the Chapter be interpreted consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient government. Under <span class="Italic">FCI</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Accordingly, in determining whether a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy would be appropriate in any specific case involving a violation of the duty to bargain over impact and implementation, the Authority considers, among other things, (1) whether, and when, notice was given to the union by the agency concerning the action or change decided upon; (2) whether, and when, the union requested bargaining on the procedures to be observed by the agency in implementing such action or change and/or concerning appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by such action or change; (3) the willfulness of the agency's conduct in failing to discharge its bargaining obligations under the Statute; (4) the nature and extent of the impact experienced by adversely affected employees; and (5) whether, and to what degree, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy would disrupt or impair the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, after considering the above mentioned factors, the Authority finds that no <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is required or necessary in order to effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute....&#8197;Importantly, the record indicates that while the assignment and staffing changes implemented by the Respondent were directed towards accomplishing the mission of controlling the inmates at the correctional facility and thereby increasing the security, safety, and welfare of the staff, only a few of the approximately 110 correctional officers at the facility were directly affected by the changes. Thus, the impact on employees within the bargaining unit is minimal.</p>

Where management changes a condition of employment without fulfilling its obligation to bargain over the substance of the decision to make the change, the Authority orders a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy in the absence of special circumstances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Asheville, North</span> <span class="Italic">Carolina, </span>51 FLRA 1572, 1580 n.13 (1996) <span class="Italic">(VAMC</span> <span class="Italic">Asheville). </span>In contrast, where the bargaining obligation pertaining to a change is limited to the impact and implementation of the decision, the Authority applies criteria set forth in <span class="Italic">FCI, </span>8 FLRA 604, to determine whether a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Memphis District,</span> <span class="Italic">Memphis, Tennessee, </span>53 FLRA 79, 84-85 (1997). The purpose of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy is to place parties, including employees, in the positions they would have been in had there been no unlawful conduct. <span class="Italic">See VAMC</span> <span class="Italic">Asheville,</span> 51 FLRA at 1580. Other "traditional" remedies, such as retroactive bargaining orders and cease-and-desist orders accompanied by the posting of a notice to employees (which are provided in virtually all cases where a violation is found), and, in appropriate cases, nontraditional remedies, are also available. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming, 52</span> FLRA 149, 161 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent did not fulfill its obligation to bargain over the impact and implementation of the decision that created the change in conditions of employment.&#x2003;Therefore, the Judge was correct to apply the <span class="Italic">FCI </span>criteria in determining whether a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy is appropriate. Accordingly, we address the Respondent's exceptions with respect to these criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Respondent asserts that there was little, if any, evidence of significant impact of the changes on employees and points to the Judge's finding that the impact was not severe. However, the Judge found that the changes had more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>impact on employees' conditions of employment, and that the impact was sufficient to support a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy. The record supports the Judge's findings and we find no merit to the Respondent's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we reject the Respondent's claims that the willfulness of its refusal to bargain must be tempered by the fact that there were negotiations and the fact that any delay in bargaining was mutual. The fact that some bargaining occurred over the Union's proposals does not affect the Judge's finding that the Respondent willfully failed to bargain over the <span id="page_1626"></span>impact and implementation of the changes. <span class="Italic">See Lexington-Blue Grass, </span>38 FLRA at 649 (intentional failure to notify union of an impending change is willful, although based on erroneous conclusion that it was not obligated to bargain over the subject matter). Furthermore, the obligation to bargain arose prior to implementation of the changes. Here, the Respondent unilaterally implemented the changes in lay-in and accountability practices on January 19, 1996, and March 11, 1996, respectively, whereupon the Union promptly requested bargaining. The timing of negotiations subsequent to the implementation of the changes does not temper the willful nature of the Respondent's conduct.[16]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;To the extent the Respondent's "mutual delay" argument could be viewed as a claim that the Union waived its bargaining rights, we note as stated above, that the Agency does not except to the Judge's finding that the Union did not waive its rights in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Respondent argues that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy would be inappropriate because it would disrupt the internal security practices at the correctional institution. In this connection, the Respondent excepts to the Judge's finding that the Respondent pointed "to no specific evidence as to the extent of such disruption, or to the particular internal security risks that would occur" as a result of restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo. </span>The Respondent refers to the testimony of several of its employees as evidence of the disruptive effect of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy. In particular, the Respondent points to testimony explaining that the change in lay-in practice was designed to limit the time during which inmates would be idle and, thereby, limit the opportunity to plan escapes, engage in gang affairs and narcotics transactions, and endanger personnel. The change in accountability practice was designed to control the number of inmates who were released at one time from the work area. According to that testimony, with too many inmates waiting in the lunch lines, "they get unruly."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When it is alleged that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy would cause disruption to the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations, the Authority bases its findings on specific evidence in the record concerning how, and to what degree, such disruption would occur<span class="Italic">. Lexington-Blue Grass, </span>38 FLRA at 649-50. In our view, and as explained below, the testimony referred to by the Respondent does not militate against issuance of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's testimony provides various reasons to support the changes in lay-in and accountability practices. Without question, maintaining appropriate controls over an inmate population and taking measures to prevent the possibility of harm to inmates and employees are of great concern in a correctional facility. However, these considerations are present at all times in a correctional setting. The Respondent has not established how, and to what degree, disruption to the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations would be caused by restoration of the former practices. <span class="Italic">See U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 36 FLRA 655, 672 (1990) <span class="Italic">(status quo ante </span>remedy appropriate notwithstanding fact that change may have improved quality or efficiency of agency's operations because the change was not necessary "from either an operational or legal standpoint[.]"); <span class="Italic">United States</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Justice, United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, El Paso District Office,</span> 34 FLRA 1035, 1046-47 (1990) (Authority found no evidence that <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy would impair efficiency and effectiveness of critical agency operations, noting particularly that agency would be free to enforce existing policies and procedures regarding such operations). We note that the Respondent would be required to adhere to its former practices only until such time as the Respondent fulfills its bargaining obligations under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this result, we recognize that a Federal correctional facility has "special security concerns" that are of "paramount importance." <span class="Italic">FCI Sandstone,</span> 30 FLRA at 500; <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Council of Prison Locals, Local 919 and</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons,</span> <span class="Italic">Leavenworth, Kansas, </span>42 FLRA 1295, 1301 (1991). However, as noted above, these concerns are always present in correctional facilities. The record in this case does not reveal a significant security risk outweighing the totality of the factors favoring a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy. No basis is established to find that the existence of general security concerns precludes a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy where, on balance, the other <span class="Italic">FCI</span> criteria support the remedy and the Authority determines that the remedy will effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See NTEU v. FLRA, </span>910 F.2d at 967 (discussing Authority's broad discretion to fashion appropriate remedies for unfair labor practices).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we agree with the Judge that the Respondent has not shown that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy would unduly disrupt or impair the effectiveness of the Respondent's operations. <span class="Italic">Compare U.S. Department Of</span> <span class="Italic">Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland, </span>37 FLRA 278, 287 (1990) (respondent did not establish a sufficient degree of disruption to its operations to outweigh the benefits of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy) with <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration, </span>42 FLRA 82, 89 (1991) (record supported Judge's finding that, upon balancing the concerns involved, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy would disrupt or impair the efficiency and effectiveness of respondent's operations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the Respondent's assertion that, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Adjutant General Publications Center</span>, 22 FLRA 457, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy would cause a <span class="Italic">per se </span>disruption. In <span class="Italic">Adjutant General Publications Center,</span> the Authority noted that the parties agreed that the changes made by the respondent were an exercise of management's right to determine internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. Given the facts of that case, the Authority gave "greater weight" to the disruptive effect of restoring the pre-existing practice. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 459. The Authority did not hold, however, that the presence of internal security concerns precludes <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>relief in all cases. Thus, while the Respondent's exercise of its internal security right is a factor to be considered in weighing whether a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy would have a disruptive effect upon management's operations, it is not dispositive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy effectuates the broad policies of the Statute. Here, the Respondent violated the Statute when it unilaterally implemented changes in conditions of employment without first giving the Union an opportunity to bargain, and again violated the Statute when it foreclosed bargaining over the impact and implementation of the Union's post-implementation proposals. One critical purpose of the remedy is to deter the Respondent and future parties from failing to satisfy their duty to bargain, and reduce any incentive that may exist to unilaterally implement changes in conditions of employment and then refuse to negotiate over all pertinent aspects of the impact and implementation of the changes. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., FDIC v. FLRA, </span>977 F.2d 1493, 1498 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (the purpose of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy is "to ensure that agencies will have incentive to bargain with their unions."); <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA, </span>910 F.2d at 969 ("[W]here an agency has taken unilateral action that disturbs the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>and has illegally refused to give a union an opportunity to bargain over the decision (or its impact), a stronger case can be made for the proposition that the Authority, as does the NLRB, <span class="Italic">should </span>restore the <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>in a remedial order...."). Issuance of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>order will promote the purpose stated above.</p>
<p class="noindent">The SQA remedy undoes the change that should have been negotiated and theoretically allows the parties to arrive at their own negotiated solution to deal with the change in management practice or the impact of that change. If the SQA remedy cannot be implemented, because of its disruptive effect, for example, FLRA determines whether a RBO is appropriate to compensate employees who suffered demonstrable harm through the unilaterally implemented change in working conditions. As the RBO has developed and as it was explained in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 856 F.2d 293 (D.C. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">post</span>, it is FLRA's responsibility to measure the harm to employees caused by the unilateral change in working conditions and require recompense to employees who suffered resultant financial harm.</p>
<p class="noindent">The SQA remedy favors bargaining; the RBO favors individual relief for employees. The two approaches are neither interchangeable nor mutually exclusive, although FLRA does not precisely explain the circumstances justifying the use of both or just one of the remedies. As a result, the remedial approach is unclear. Without becoming involved in extensive discussion of retroactive bargaining or the restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, FLRA occasionally enters an order requiring restoration of back pay and prospective bargaining of changes in working conditions. In a situation involving a change in access to government vehicles, FLRA directed that employees be made whole for any charges incurred as a result of the change that was made without impact bargaining. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 898</span>, 19 FLRA 497, 499 (1985). FLRA directs a back pay remedy when the causal relation is clear between the unilateral change in working conditions and loss of benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA, Eastern Region, Jamaica and PASS</span>, 27 FLRA 304, 306 (1987); <span class="Italic">FAA and PASS</span>, 27 FLRA 230, 231 (1987), <span class="Italic">partially overruled by</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1164</span>, 37 FLRA 278 (1990). FLRA may find the proof of back pay entitlement insufficient to warrant a direct remedy. FLRA then analyzes the case in terms either of a RBO or SQA remedy. A prospective bargaining order was sufficient to remedy a failure to bargain over the impact of changes in an upward mobility plan. Management contended that most of the proposals were not negotiable, and many of its contentions were sustained. Employees had not yet been reassigned under the revised program. <span class="Italic">INS and Nat'l INS Council, AFGE</span>, 18 FLRA 875, 884 (1985). A prospective bargaining order was also issued to remedy the agency's refusal to bargain over a provision regulating the negotiation of midterm changes in terms of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior and NFFE Local 1309</span>, 52 FLRA 475, 482-83 (1996). The problem is determining the appropriate remedy when the choice is presented.</p>
