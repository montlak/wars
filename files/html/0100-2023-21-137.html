<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-136"><span class="space">a.</span> Customs and Border Patrol Officers</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Some law enforcement retirement benefits appeals focus on Customs and Border Patrol Officers. Coverage for them was considered in <span class="Italic">Kroll v. DHS</span>, 121 MSPR 526, 528-31 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-12, 2014 MSPB 69 (2014) (FERS), examining the meaning of primary and secondary positions and, for secondary positions, the meaning of administrative work requiring CBPO experience:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of proving his entitlement to enhanced retirement coverage. <span class="Italic">Olszak v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 75, &#x00B6; 5 (2011), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 475 Fed. Appx. 757 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Eligibility for enhanced retirement coverage is strictly construed because it is more costly to the government than traditional retirement plans and often results in the retirement of important people at a time when they would have otherwise continued to work for a number of years. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A CBPO "who is separated from the service, except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency...after completing 25 years of service...[or] after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service" is entitled to an annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412(d)(1)-(2). Section 8401(36) of Title 5 defines the term CBPO as "an employee in the Department of Homeland Security (A) who holds a position within the GS-1895 job series (determined by applying the criteria in effect as of September 1, 2007) or any successor position, and (B) whose duties include activities relating to the arrival and departure of persons, conveyances, and merchandise at ports of entry...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has promulgated regulations to govern the CBPO enhanced retirement coverage program and to carry out the foregoing statutory provisions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.1001. Pursuant to those regulations, an employee's service in both "primary" and "secondary" CBPO positions will count toward his eligibility for enhanced retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.1002, 842.1003. Section 1003 of Part 842 defines the terms "primary position" and "secondary position":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Primary position</span> means a position classified within the Customs and Border Protection Officer (GS-1895) job series (determined applying the criteria in effect as of September 1, 2007) or any successor position whose duties include the performance of work directly connected with activities relating to the arrival and departure of persons, conveyances, and merchandise at ports of entry.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Secondary position</span> means a position within the Department of Homeland Security that is either--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Supervisory; i.e., a position whose primary duties are as a first-level supervisor of customs and border protection officers in primary positions; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Administrative; i.e., an executive, managerial, technical, semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a primary customs and border protection officer position is a prerequisite.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties stipulated below that the only matter in dispute is whether the appellant's ACS Specialist position qualified as a secondary CBPO position and, further, that the position of ACS Specialist does not qualify as a supervisory position for coverage purposes. Therefore, in order to qualify under the remaining "administrative" prong of section 842.1003, the appellant was required to establish that the ACS Specialist position was "an executive, managerial, technical, semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a primary [CPBO] position is a prerequisite."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record, however, is devoid of evidence that experience as a CBPO is a prerequisite for the ACS Specialist position. The appellant stipulated that neither the position description nor the vacancy announcement states or indicates that prior experience as a CBPO, GS-1895, or a Customs Inspector, GS-1890, is a prerequisite for employment as an ACS Specialist. He further stipulated that prior service with the agency in a primary position is not required in order to be hired for an ACS Specialist position and that he has personally known individuals in the ACS Specialist position who did not have experience in a primary position prior to being hired as an ACS Specialist. We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's selection for the ACS Specialist position based upon his prior experience does not establish that such experience was a prerequisite for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Simply stated, the appellant is not entitled to enhanced CBPO retirement benefits because he failed to show that the ACS Specialist position required service in a primary CBPO position as a prerequisite. Accordingly, the appellant is precluded from establishing that the ACS Specialist position was a covered secondary position, regardless of what his actual duties in that position were. <span class="Italic">Olszak</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 75, &#x00B6; 9 (citing <span class="Italic">Villarreal v.

Indeed, even though the agency initially designated the ACS Specialist position as a secondary position in contravention of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.1002 and 842.1003(b), the Board cannot order payment of an enhanced retirement benefit based on that designation. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Because <span class="Italic">Olszak</span> was decided prior to the time that OPM had promulgated the regulations at issue in this appeal, the Board there was construing the interim criteria that the agency had developed in consultation with OPM to implement the law. <span class="Italic">See Olszak</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 75, &#x00B6; 7. There are some differences between the terminology in the interim guidance and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.1002. Whereas the relevant portion of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.1002 defines "secondary position" as "an executive, managerial, technical, semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a primary [CBPO] position is a prerequisite," the relevant portion of the agency's interim guidance in <span class="Italic">Olszak</span> required the appellant to show that "experience as a [CBPO] or equivalent experience in [the Department of Homeland Security] is a mandatory prerequisite" for the position at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. We find that the Board's analysis in <span class="Italic">Olszak</span> applies with equal force to issues before us in the instant appeal despite these differences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Although the parties stipulated below that the only dispute presented was whether the appellant's ACS Specialist position qualified as a secondary position, in light of the fact that these OPM regulations are relatively new, they permit two scenarios to allow CBPOs to be entitled to receive enhanced retirement benefits, and, because of the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, we also have considered whether the ACS Specialist position qualified as a primary position and conclude that it does not. As discussed above, OPM's governing regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.1002 defines "primary position" as "a position classified within the [CBPO] (GS-1895) job series (determined by applying the criteria in effect as of September 1, 2007) <span class="Italic">or any successor</span> position whose duties include the performance of work directly connected with activities relating to the arrival and departure of persons, conveyances, and merchandise at ports of entry." (emphasis added). The ACS Specialist position is not a GS-1895 position and there is no indication that it is a new incarnation of "a position within the GS-1895 series." Therefore, it is not a "successor position" within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.1002.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the appellant's remaining arguments on review and find that they present no basis to overturn the initial decision. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant cannot challenge <span id="Page_4307"></span>the agency's job classification of his ACS Specialist position as a means of establishing that his service in that position qualifies him for enhanced retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">See Crum v. Department of the Navy</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 75, 81 (1997) (the Board lacks jurisdiction to review classification decisions). Further, although the appellant contends that he was denied the opportunity to present his own testimony concerning his current duties, the record reflects that he waived his right to a hearing. In any event, as discussed above, the appellant's proposed testimony concerning his current duties in the ACS Specialist position would provide no basis for disturbing the administrative judge's determination that the position was not secondary because CBPO experience was not a prerequisite for that position.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to be eligible for enhanced CBPO retirement benefits under the CSRS, the appellant must satisfy the criteria for coverage in a primary or secondary position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(31), 8336(c); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1603, 831.1604. A primary position is a position classified within the CBPO (GS-1895) job series (determined by applying the criteria in effect as of September 1, 2007) or any successor position whose duties include the performance of work directly connected with activities relating to the arrival and departure of persons, conveyances, and merchandise at ports of entry. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1602. An employee who is not in a primary covered position may be eligible for enhanced retirement benefits if he was employed in a primary covered position for at least 3 years and has been continuously employed in secondary positions since transferring from a primary position without a break in service exceeding 3 days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1604(a). A secondary position is a position within the agency that is either supervisory (i.e., a position whose primary duties are as a first-level supervisor of CBPOs in primary positions) or administrative (i.e., an executive, managerial, technical, semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a primary CBPO position is a prerequisite). 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1602.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Indeed, even if the agency mistakenly or improperly designated positions that did not require experience in a primary CBPO position as secondary administrative positions, those incorrect designations would not in any way justify the designation of the IT Specialist position as a secondary administrative position in contravention of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1604. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(31), 8336(c); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1603, 831.1604; <span class="Italic">see Office of Personnel Management v.

Simply stated, because the IT Specialist position did not require experience in a primary CBPO position as a prerequisite, the IT Specialist position is not eligible for secondary administrative coverage under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1604, and it does not matter for purposes of this appeal if the agency misapplied that regulation in classifying any other position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v.

DHS</span>, DA-0842-14-0035-I-1 (NP 12/4/2014) (discussion of CBPO primary and secondary positions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's analysis of CBPO coverage relative to primary and secondary positions was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. DHS</span>, 837 F.3d 1346, 1354-58 (Fed. Cir. 2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Fitzgerald argues that OPM's regulations--namely, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.1002 (defining secondary position) and 842.1003(c)(2) (defining secondary position retrospectively, prior to the effective date of the Act)--impermissibly contradict the plain language and purpose of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(36). In her view, &#x00A7; 8401(36) expressly provides that employees are entitled to CBPO status in a secondary position if they served in a covered primary position for at least 3 years (as she had prior to her transfer to FLETC) and then transferred directly to a supervisory or administrative position in DHS (as she contends she did). Because the statute does not qualify the latter requirement, she reasons, it entitles CBPOs who transferred to <span class="Italic">any</span> supervisory or administrative position to maintain CBPO status so long as that position is "in DHS." Ms. Fitzgerald further argues that OPM's regulations contradict the broad language of the statute by further restricting entitlement to CBPO status to only those CBPOs who transfer or transferred into (a) CBPO specific supervisory positions or (b) administrative positions that require CBPO-related experience as a prerequisite.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her position, Ms. Fitzgerald avers that OPM's regulations also conflict with the purpose of the statute. According to Ms. Fitzgerald, the legislative history shows that the Act was intended to help recruit and retain CBPOs by providing to them the same retirement benefits enjoyed by LEOs. The regulations do not promote these goals, she contends, because, under the regulations, CBPOs may not transfer to positions for which their experience is valuable but not a prerequisite without losing their CBPO status and associated retirement credit. Without such flexibility, Ms. Fitzgerald reasons, CBPOs have less incentive to work at DHS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For its part, the government contends that the statute is silent regarding what constitutes a "supervisory or administrative" position for purposes of CBPO status. Given this silence, and pursuant to its statutory authority to administer the Act, the government argues, OPM promulgated valid regulations that are entitled to deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>. In the government's view, Congress's reliance on OPM to fill the gaps as to the meaning of the term "supervisory or administrative" position is consistent with its approach to retirement benefits for other special groups (e.g., LEOs and firefighters), which indicates it intended for the Act to be implemented in the same manner. The government also suggests that Congress's silence as to the meaning of this term is consistent with its express delegation of rulemaking authority to OPM to administer the Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding prong two of <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, the government urges that OPM's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. According to the government, the regulations are consistent with the purpose of recruiting and retaining CBPOs because they provide enhanced retirement benefits to CBPOs consistent with those enjoyed by other special groups, and they ensure that senior CBPOs stay in the Agency to share their knowledge and experience with junior CBPOs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our view, Congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue in this case. We have explained that "[i]dentifying 'the precise question at issue' is a necessary prerequisite to determining whether or not Congress has directly spoken on it." <span class="Italic">GHS Health Maint. Org., Inc. v. United States</span>, 536 F.3d 1293, 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 842). The precise question at issue here, we think, is this: what constitutes a supervisory or administrative position in DHS for the purpose of meeting the definition of a CBPO? The statute is silent on this question. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401. Section 8401(36) defines a CBPO to include an "employee who is transferred directly <span class="Italic">to a supervisory or administrative position in [DHS]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">." Id.</span> (emphasis added). The terms "supervisory" and "administrative" are not defined within the definition of a CBPO, however. Nor are they defined in any other part of the statute. In fact, the definitions for an LEO and a firefighter also include the "employee who is transferred directly to a supervisory or administrative position" language, but those definitions likewise fail to explain what constitutes a "supervisory or administrative position." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 8401(14),(17),(33). Consequently, we think the statute does not clearly and unequivocally answer the question at hand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress's awareness of OPM's approach to other special retirement groups bolsters our conclusion on the first prong of <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>. As noted, LEOs and firefighters already received enhanced retirement benefits when the Act was enacted in 2007. Because the statute in place did not define "supervisory or administrative" positions for the purpose of qualifying as an LEO or a firefighter, OPM issued regulations that did. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. Given the general presumption that "Congress is knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to the legislation it enacts," <span class="Italic">Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller</span>, 486 U.S. 174, 184-85 (1988); <span class="Italic">see also Minneapolis &#x0026; St. Louis Ry. Co. v. United States</span>, 361 U.S. 173, 187 (1959) (presuming that Congress was aware of applicable regulations when enacting pertinent legislation), we agree with the government that Congress likely intended for the framework for CBPOs to be implemented similarly to that for LEOs and firefighters. Put another way, Congress likely intended to leave a gap as to the meaning of a "supervisory or administrative position in [DHS] " that OPM would fill through regulations. Finally, our view of Congress's approach to &#x00A7; 8401(36) is also consistent with the Act's express delegation of rulemaking authority to OPM for the purpose of carrying out the amendments made by the Act. Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, &#x00A7; 535(d) ("Any regulations necessary to carry out the amendments made by [section 535] shall be prescribed by the Director of [OPM]."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(g) (providing OPM the authority to "prescribe regulations to carry out the provisions of [FERS] ").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to Ms. Fitzgerald's assertion, neither the statute nor the legislative history clearly demonstrates that Congress intended for secondary CBPO positions to include <span class="Italic">any</span> supervisory or administrative position in DHS. Section 8401(36) plainly refers to "a" supervisory or administration position, not "any" such position. Accepting Ms. Fitzgerald's interpretation would impermissibly read the word "any" into the statute. <span class="Italic">See Vallee v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 58 F.3d 613, 615 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("It is incorrect to read a statute contrary to its plain text, absent compelling evidence of contrary congressional intent.") Lest there be any doubt on this point, counsel for Ms. Fitzgerald agreed at oral argument before us that &#x00A7; 8401(36) cannot refer to any supervisory or administrative position in DHS. Oral Arg. at 3:34-40, <span class="Italic">available at</span> <a href="http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=20 15-3154.mp3">http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=20 15-3154.mp3</a> (The Court: So you agree that [&#x00A7; 8401(36)] cannot be <span class="Italic">any</span> supervisory or administrative position in [DHS], right? Counsel: Correct.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that Congress has not "directly spoken" to the <span id="Page_4308"></span>question of what constitutes a supervisory or administrative position in DHS for the purpose of meeting the definition of a CBPO under &#x00A7; 8401(36). We will therefore defer to OPM's interpretation as long as it is "a permissible construction of the statute." <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to prong two of <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, we think 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.1002 and 842.1003(c)(2) are based on a permissible construction of the statute. As noted, the regulations do not conflict with the statute; instead, they merely cabin it by restricting entitlement to CBPO status to employees in certain CBPO-related positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.1002, 842.1003(c)(2). This restriction is reasonable for at least two reasons. First, it is reasonable to conclude that, for purposes of attaining CBPO status, all supervisory and administrative positions in DHS are not created equal. Indeed, there are likely many supervisory and administrative positions in DHS that have no connection to the CBPO occupation. After all, the Agency is only one of many governmental entities in DHS. <span class="Italic">See</span> 6 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 203; REORGANIZATION PLAN MODIFICATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, H.R. DOC. NO. 108-32, at 4 (2003). Absent a restriction on where CBPOs in primary positions may transfer, a CBPO might be able to transfer, for example, to a position as an administrative assistant in human resources or to a position as an office administrator--positions for which CBPO experience is presumably neither required nor relevant--while maintaining the benefits of CBPO status for purposes of retirement. We do not think it is unreasonable to conclude that Congress did not intend for such results to occur.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Notably, like the regulations for CBPOs, the regulations for LEOs and firefighters also restrict LEO and firefighter status to employees who transfer into (a) LEO or firefighter-specific supervisory positions or (b) administrative positions that require law-enforcement or firefighting experience as a prerequisite. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">And second, the restriction encourages career service as a CBPO. OPM explained that "one policy goal of special retirement coverage is to encourage career service by an employee in the particular occupation chosen by the employee." 76 Fed. Reg. at 41,996. Enticing employees in primary CBPO positions to transfer into, and remain in, CBPO-related positions in order to maintain CBPO status is a sound method for trying to increase the number of employees who remain in CBPO-related occupations throughout their careers.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;In our view, the regulations at issue are likely to achieve the stated "policy goal" because employees will be motivated to maintain CBPO status for at least 25 years (or for at least 20 years if they have reached the age of 50) in order to be eligible for early retirement with an annuity on account of their CBPO status. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412(d)(1),(2). Consequently, employees who start a career as a CBPO will have an incentive to stay in CBPO related positions for the rest of their careers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, Ms. Fitzgerald does not explicitly argue that OPM's interpretation is an impermissible construction of the statute. Rather, she asserts that the regulations are inconsistent with the purpose of the Act, which could be read as a contention that the regulations are unreasonable. Either way, we are not persuaded. Ms. Fitzgerald cites legislative history that suggests the purpose of the Act is "to help recruit and retain [CBPOs] by providing them the same retirement benefits as other [LEOs]." H.R. Rep. No. 110-181, at 9 (2008). But even if we accept that the cited legislative history accurately reflects what Congress had in mind when it drafted the Act, the fact remains that the regulations do not limit the retirement benefits of CBPOs as compared to those of LEOs. Instead, they merely restrict <span class="Italic">who</span> may attain CBPO status in order to obtain the same retirement benefits as LEOs. In addition, while it may be true that more flexible regulations (e.g., ones allowing CBPOs to maintain their CBPO status even after transferring into secondary positions not having the existing, prior experience requirement) would help recruit and retain CBPOs better than the regulations at issue do, that fact alone does not render OPM's interpretation unreasonable. <span class="Italic">See Yangzhou</span>, 716 F.3d at 1377 (explaining that an agency's interpretation need only represent a "reasonable construction of the statute," not necessarily "the most reasonable interpretation") (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because we find that Congress has not answered the specific question at issue and because we find that OPM has provided a permissible construction of the statute, we conclude that the regulations at issue are not invalid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the Agency's denial of Ms. Fitzgerald's claim for retirement credit for her service at FLETC from July 6, 2008, forward.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Fitzgerald asserts that, even if the regulations at issue are not invalid, the Board incorrectly determined that the Initial Position was not a secondary position. The parties do not dispute that the Initial Position was not a supervisory position under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.1003(c)(2)(i). Ms. Fitzgerald also concedes that the job description for the Initial Position did not explicitly state that experience in customs and border protection was required. Nevertheless, in her view, the job description made clear that the Initial Position required CBPO related experience because it stated that FLETC Instructors must have the knowledge to train LEOs from a "wide variety" of Federal organizations, which she suggests includes the specialized law-enforcement area of customs and border protection. According to Ms. Fitzgerald, FLETC would not have hired her but for her prior experience in Retrospective CBPO Positions. The government responds that there is no evidence in the record indicating that the Initial Position required experience in a Retrospective CBPO Position. In its view, the job description alone is substantial evidence that an individual could have obtained the Initial Position without ever having served in a Retrospective CBPO Position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, in order for Ms. Fitzgerald to prevail on her claim for retirement credit based upon her serving as an Instructor at FLETC, the Board had to find, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that CBPO experience in a Retrospective CBPO Position was a mandatory prerequisite for the Initial Position, meaning the Initial Position qualified as a secondary position under &#x00A7; 842.1003(c)(2)(ii). If such experience was not a prerequisite, Ms. Fitzgerald's service could not meet the criteria of &#x00A7; 842.1003(b). The Board concluded that the job description for the Initial Position indicated that such experience was not a prerequisite. After reviewing the job description, we see no reason to disturb the Board's conclusion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.1004(b) ("A determination under &#x00A7; 842.1003(b) must be based on the official position description and any other evidence deemed appropriate by the agency head for making the determination.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On its face, the job description only required "[e]xperience in a primary Federal law enforcement position." Nor did it implicitly indicate that the requisite experience pertained to work related to the unique duties of an individual in a Retrospective CBPO Position--i.e., work directly connected with activities relating to the arrival and departure of persons, conveyances, and merchandise at ports of entry. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.1003(c)(1). Indeed, as the job title suggested--Law Enforcement Specialist (Instructor)--the listed duties reflect those of someone with prior law enforcement experience, not necessarily experience in customs and border protection. Although Ms. Fitzgerald might train a "wide variety" of employees in law enforcement (including CBPOs), and although she might have obtained the Initial Position only by virtue of her prior service in Retrospective CBPO Positions at INS and Customs, that does not establish that her experience in those positions was a "mandatory prerequisite," as required under the regulations. Instead, it merely indicates that some overlap likely exists between the knowledge and experience required for the Initial Position and that gained by Ms. Fitzgerald while working in those positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Board's decision that Ms. Fitzgerald's prior service did not meet the criteria of &#x00A7; 842.1003(b) and that she therefore is not entitled to CBPO retirement credit for her time at FLETC is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.1002 and 842.1003(c)(2) are not invalid, because they do not impermissibly contradict the plain language or purpose of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401 and because they are based on a permissible construction of the statute. We also hold that the Board's final decision, which affirmed the Agency's denial of Ms. Fitzgerald's request for retirement credit, is supported by substantial evidence. We therefore affirm the final decision.</p>
