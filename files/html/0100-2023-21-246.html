<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-246"><span class="space">a.</span> Lack of Notice of Appeal Right</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 353.104 (2022), if an agency denies restoration rights, it should provide notice of MSPB appeal rights.<span class="Italic"> Lehne v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 44, 46 &#x00B6; 4 (1999). <span class="Italic">Cranston v. USPS</span>, 106 MSPR 290, 294-98 &#x00B6; 8-14, 2007 MSPB 181 (2007), outlined the requirements of agency notice concerning MSPB appeal rights, and the time for restoration rights appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations provide that an appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). [1] The regulations further provide that, if a party does not submit an appeal within the applicable time limit, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Where the appellant has filed a timely formal complaint of discrimination with the agency regarding the matter that is appealable to the Board, the time limit for filing the appeal is governed by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154 rather than by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22. In this case, however, the appellant filed an informal complaint of discrimination, but the agency indicated that he did not file a formal complaint of discrimination regarding the allegations the appellant raised in his appeal. Thus, the timeliness of the instant appeal is governed by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an appellant has established good cause to waive the timeliness requirements for filing an appeal, the Board's analysis generally depends on whether the agency was required to provide notice of the appellant's right to appeal the action at issue and whether the agency provided such notice. In the absence of a duty on the agency's part to provide notice of appeal rights, an appellant must establish that he exercised due diligence in discovering and pursuing a right of appeal before the Board will excuse an untimely filed appeal for good cause shown. <span class="Italic">Jones v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 306, 313-14 (1994). However, an appellant who was not provided a required notice of appeal rights is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights; the question is whether he was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned he could do so. <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 588 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to notice of appeal rights concerning a denial of restoration, section 353.104 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When an agency separates, grants a leave of absence, restores or fails to restore an employee because of uniformed service or compensable injury, it shall notify the employee of his or her rights, obligations, and benefits relating to Government employment, including any appeal and grievance rights. However, regardless of notification, an employee is still required to exercise due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights, and to seek reemployment within the time limits provided by chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, for restoration after uniformed service, or as soon as he or she is able after a compensable injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, OPM's regulation requires an agency to notify an employee of his rights, including his appeal rights, when the agency fails to restore an employee upon his recovery from a compensable injury. In addition, the agency's action in returning the appellant to work in a modified position following his partial recovery from a compensable injury and then abolishing that position constitutes a failure to restore the appellant for which the agency was required to notify the appellant of his appeal and grievance rights. <span class="Italic">See Allen v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 73, 74-75 (1997) (discontinuing a light-duty position to which an agency has restored a partially recovered employee may constitute a denial of restoration for the purposes of Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. part 353).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing the instant appeal as untimely filed, the AJ, <span class="Italic">relying on Green,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 15, found that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 established an exception to the general rules concerning the diligence required of an appellant who was not provided a required notice of appeal rights by requiring an appellant who was denied restoration to exercise due diligence in discovering his appeal rights, regardless of whether the agency had notified the appellant of those appeal rights as required by the regulation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 3-5. Although <span class="Italic">Green</span> discussed 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 and the fact that the regulation had changed since the Federal Circuit remanded <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> to the Board in 1988, the Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Green</span> was contrary to the Board's interpretation of the amended regulation in an earlier case, <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger v. Department of the Army,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 607 (1995). In <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger,</span> the Board concluded that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 only requires an appellant to be diligent in discovering and exercising his restoration rights, not his appeal rights from a denial of restoration, and it stated that it was "fundamentally unfair for an employee to be obligated to find out about appeal rights when the agency has failed to notify him that the denial of restoration is an appealable action." <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 612-13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 set forth in <span class="Italic">Green,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 15, conflicts with the Board's prior interpretation of that regulation as set forth in<span class="Italic"> Dunklebarger,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 612. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger</span> contains the correct interpretation of this regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 set forth in <span class="Italic">Green</span> is not supported by the Federal Register notice through which OPM promulgated the amendment to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 that requires employees to exercise due diligence to ascertain and exercise their rights. This notice did not indicate that OPM intended the due diligence requirement to apply to an employee's discovery and exercise of his appeal rights. Restoration to Duty from Military Service or Compensable Injury, 53 Fed. Reg. 857 (Jan. 14, 1988). In addition, the interpretation of the regulation set forth in <span class="Italic">Green</span> is arguably inconsistent with the Board's authority to prescribe regulations governing its own procedures and with its broad discretion to waive its timeliness requirement for good cause shown. As set forth above, the time limit for filing an appeal, including a restoration appeal, is governed by the Board's regulations, and the discretion to decide whether to waive these regulations for good cause shown rests with the Board, not OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h) (the Board has the authority to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the performance of its functions; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.12 (the Board may revoke, amend, or waive any of its regulations); <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) ("We have often stated that whether the regulatory time limit for an appeal should be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the Board's discretion."). Despite the fact that the discretion to waive the regulatory time limit for filing an appeal rests with the Board, <span class="Italic">Green</span> essentially concluded that the OPM regulation imposed limitations on this discretion by requiring the Board to account for the appellant's diligence in discovering his appeal rights when considering whether the circumstances might constitute good cause for an untimely filing. Because OPM did not indicate that this was its intent when it promulgated the diligence requirement upon amending 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 in 1988, we reaffirm the Board's conclusion in <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger</span> that the regulation's due diligence requirement does not relate to "appeal rights," but is instead "oriented toward alerting employees that they are obligated to find out and pursue their rights concerning the requirements for restoration of duty."<span class="Italic"> Dunklebarger,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 612. Accordingly, we overrule <span class="Italic">Green</span> to the extent that it suggests that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 requires an employee to exercise diligence in discovering his appeal rights upon a denial of restoration following partial recovery from a compensable injury.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Nevertheless, <span class="Italic">Green</span> is distinguishable from the instant appeal because the appellant therein had an extensive history of litigation before the Board, including a prior restoration appeal, and, therefore, regardless of whether the agency notified him of his appeal rights, he could not credibly contend that he was unaware of the requirement to timely file his restoration appeal or to demonstrate good cause for his delay. <span class="Italic">Green,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 16. The Board's records do not reflect that the instant appellant, who filed his appeal <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, had any such prior experience with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulation requires the agency to give an employee notice of his appeal rights when, among other things, it restores or fails to restore an employee after a compensable injury. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104. Therefore, as the Federal Circuit asserted in <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> and the Board reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The critical and controlling fact in [a restoration] case is not the alleged diligence on the part of the [appellant], but the flagrant violation of the regulations by the [agency] in failing to give [the appellant] notice of [his] appeal rights in the form and manner prescribed by the regulations at the time the denial [of restoration] decision was issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Shiflett,</span> 839 F.2d at 673;<span class="Italic"> Dunklebarger,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 612 ("[t]he agency's 'flagrant disregard' of the notice requirement under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21 is still the critical fact in this case"). The record in this appeal reflects that the appellant first learned that he could appeal the agency's denial of restoration from the agency's April 18, 2006 final interview letter on his EEO complaint and that he filed his initial appeal two weeks later on May 2, 2006. Therefore, the appellant established that he was diligent in filing his appeal after he learned that he could do so. Because the agency failed <span id="Page_4525"></span>to provide the appellant required notice of his appeal rights, we find that the appellant has established good cause for the untimely filing of his restoration appeal regarding the denial of restoration that resulted from the abolishment of his modified position.<span class="Italic"> Gingrich,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 588 (an appellant who was not provided a required notice of appeal rights is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights; the question is whether he was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned he could do so).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nevins v. USPS</span>, 107 MSPR 595, 602-03 &#x00B6; 20, 2008 MSPB 4 (2008), reiterated the Board's approach toward restoration appellate deadlines in the absence of proper agency notice of appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that it will be unnecessary for the AJ to resolve the issue of the timeliness of this appeal on remand. As we recently discussed in <span class="Italic">Cranston v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 290, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-14 (2007), timeliness is approached differently in a denial of restoration appeal than in a typical Board appeal. OPM's regulation requires an agency to notify an employee of her rights, including her appeal rights, when it denies a request for restoration upon an employee's recovery from a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. 353.104. As the Federal Circuit held in <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 669 (Fed. Cir. 1988), and the Board reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger v. Department of the Army,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 607 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The critical and controlling fact in [a restoration] case is not the alleged diligence on the part of the [appellant], but the flagrant violation of the regulations by the [agency] in failing to give [the appellant] notice of [her] appeal rights in the form and manner prescribed by the regulations at the time the denial [of restoration] decision was issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Shiflett,</span> 839 F.2d at 673; <span class="Italic">see Dunklebarger,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 612 ("[t]he agency's 'flagrant disregard' of the notice requirement under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21 is still the critical fact in this case"). Further, the regulation only requires an appellant to be diligent in discovering and exercising her restoration rights, not her appeal rights from a denial of restoration, and it is "fundamentally unfair for an employee to be obligated to find out about appeal rights when the agency has failed to notify her that the denial of restoration is an appealable action." <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 612-13. As noted, the record reflects that the appellant first learned that she could appeal this matter to the Board "in 2007" when she spoke with her Congressman, and that she filed her initial appeal on March 4, 2007. Therefore, she established that she was diligent in filing her appeal after she learned that she could do so. We find, therefore, that the appellant has shown good cause for the untimely filing of this appeal because the undisputed facts show that the agency did not provide her with notice of her appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Cranston,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 290, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
