<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-106"><span class="space">1.</span> Routine Users; Alternate Means of Disclosure</h4>
<p class="noindent">Most of analysis that follows involves provisions of the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act that preclude access to personal information. The Privacy Act has provisions that authorize disclosure, e.g., to federal officials, of information that is otherwise protected from access to outsiders. One of the access provisions of the Act is known as the "routine use" exception. Agencies may fashion their own regulatory definitions of what comprises a routine use and routine users. The Authority's decisions suggest that a "routine use" exception in a Privacy Act records system notice will need to specify the union as a routine user before the union will be able to obtain information under that exception to the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA limited the access of unions as routine users to performance appraisals in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA, Little Rock and NATCA</span>, 51 FLRA 216, 223-24, 226-27 (1995). Before a union could obtain unredacted information as a routine user, the union was required to show that its information needs could not be met by less intrusive inquiry:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_360"></span>The information requested in this case is contained in the OPM/GOVT-2 system of records. OPM's routine use statement governing that system of records, identified as routine use "e," provides that records may be disclosed "to officials of labor organizations recognized under 5 U.S.C. chapter 71 when relevant and necessary to their duties of exclusive representation." 57 Fed. Reg. 35710 (1992). Accordingly, to determine whether the routine use exception applies to the requested information we must decide whether the requested information is "relevant and necessary," within the meaning of routine use "e."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM issued "guidance to agencies" for interpreting these terms in FPM Letter 711-164, which was published on September 17, 1992. When the FPM was abolished on December 31, 1993, the Letter, along with certain other parts of the FPM, was provisionally retained through December 31, 1994. Office of Personnel Management, FPM Sunset Document at 79. For the following reasons, we conclude that even though the Letter is no longer in effect, the guidance it contained should be applied in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has already adopted and applied the interpretation of routine use contained in FPM Letter 711-164. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Washington</span>, <span class="Italic">D.C.</span>, 46 FLRA 234, 243 (1992) (<span class="Italic">NTEU and Treasury</span>). In doing so, the Authority stated that it would no longer follow its "previous decisions applying a different interpretation...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In those prior decisions, the Authority had declined to defer to or apply OPM's informal and then unpublished interpretation of routine use. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire</span>, 37 FLRA 515, 539 (1990), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom. FLRA v. U.S. Department of the Navy, Portsmouth Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Shipyard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire</span>, 941 F.2d 49 (1st Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">Portsmouth</span>). However, several United States Courts of Appeals disagreed with the Authority's refusal to defer to OPM's interpretation of routine use. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., FLRA </span>v. <span class="Italic">United States Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 958 F.2d 503, 515 (2d Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs</span>); <span class="Italic">Portsmouth</span>, 941 F.2d at 59; <span class="Italic">FLRA v. U.S. Department of Treasury, Financial</span> <span class="Italic">Management Service</span>, 884 F.2d 1446, 1454-56 (D.C. Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 493 U.S. 1055 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Treasury, Financial</span> <span class="Italic">Management). But see FLRA v. U.S. Department of Navy</span>, 966 F.2d 747, 762 (3d Cir. 1992).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The FPM Letter contains two requirements that a union must satisfy in order to establish that disclosure of requested information is consistent with routine use "e": (1) the information must be "relevant" to the express purpose for which it is sought, meaning that the nature of the information must bear a traceable, logical, and significant connection to the purpose to be served; and (2) the information must be "necessary," meaning that there are no adequate alternative means or sources for satisfying the union's informational needs. In clarifying this second requirement, the FPM Letter explains that it is to be determined on a case-by-case basis; the union "must show that it has a particularized need for the information in a form that identifies specific individuals, and that its information needs cannot be satisfied through less intrusive means, such as by releasing records with personally-identifying information deleted."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Addressing, first, the standard of "relevance," and looking at the ordinary meaning of the terms "traceable," "logical" and "significant," we have examined the record to assess whether the Union has established that the nature of the information requested can reasonably be attributed to and is likely to influence or affect the purpose for which the information was sought. We find that the names of bargaining unit employees and other identifiers, insofar as they would effectively provide the Union with unsanitized performance appraisals, bear a traceable, logical, and significant connection to the purpose for which that information was sought. For example, furnishing employees' names clearly would affect the Union's stated purpose of uncovering possible disparate treatment of Union members. It would also enable the Union to make comparisons among employees in order to ascertain whether the appraisals accurately and adequately reflected the employees' duties, training, and commendations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite our finding that the requested information is relevant, however, we are not persuaded that the record before us supports a finding that the information is necessary. Although the General Counsel maintains that the Union needs the requested information to determine whether there was disparate treatment of unit employees and Union members, the Union has not established, and the stipulated record does not otherwise reflect, that this need cannot be satisfied through less intrusive means than by using name-identified appraisals. The only example of less intrusive means contained in the FPM Letter is the release of records with personally-identifying information deleted. In this case, it is clear that this less intrusive means exists--indeed, the Respondent has already furnished appraisals with names and other personal identifiers deleted; according to the Union this information does not satisfy its needs. However, the sanitization of the appraisals already attempted is not the <span class="Italic">only</span> means available to accomplish disclosure that is less intrusive to employees' privacy. For example, there is no indication that the parties have considered the use of a coding scheme that would accompany the sanitized appraisals and indicate unit status and Union membership in order to uncover possible disparate treatment. As to the Union's stated need of contacting employees directly, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the Union is unable to contact the total bargaining unit complement without access to the requested information.[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;The Union represents 27 employees at the Little Rock, Arkansas facility as the agent for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, MEBA/NMU, AFL-CIO, which represents a nationwide consolidated bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Union has not established that the requested information is necessary within the meaning of FPM Letter 711-164.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Mines, Pittsburgh Research Ctr. and AFGE Local 1916</span>, 51 FLRA 276, 284-86 (1995), described how a union might adopt the least intrusive means possible to demonstrate the necessity as a routine user for "name-identified" individual performance plans:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the Union has failed to demonstrate that the requested information is both "relevant and necessary" within the meaning of FPM Letter 711-164. Addressing first the standard of "relevance," and looking at the ordinary meaning of the terms "traceable," "logical," and "significant," we have examined the record to assess whether the Union has established that the nature of the information requested can reasonably be attributed to and is likely to influence or affect the purpose for which the information was sought. In this regard, the Union president testified that the Union expected to use the IPPs in two ways: to "compare the ratings given to employees with similar elements to see if they were given different ratings for similar work" and to "look at individual IPPs in isolation to see if the ratings were justified." The testimony establishes that IPPs, in general, are "relevant." In particular, it appears that providing unsanitized IPPs would affect the Union's stated purpose of uncovering disparate treatment among employees resulting from application of the alleged quota system. It would also enable the Union to establish whether ratings were, in its view, justified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if the requested information is "relevant" within the meaning of the FPM Letter, however, we are not persuaded that the record before us supports a finding that the unsanitized IPPs are "necessary" within the meaning of the FPM letter. Although the General Counsel maintains that the Union needs the requested information to determine whether the Respondent continues to use a quota system in allocating performance ratings, the Union has not established, and the record does not otherwise reflect, that this need cannot be satisfied through less intrusive means than by using name-identified IPPs. In this regard, the Union president testified that it would be necessary to contact some individual employees about facts not set forth in their IPPs. This testimony establishes that, in some circumstances, the Union would need name-identified IPPs to obtain information not readily apparent from the IPPs themselves. However, the testimony does not demonstrate that the Union needs names attached to <span class="Italic">all</span> of the IPPs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union made three separate requests for unsanitized IPPs in this case.&#x2003;These requests differed only in the rating periods covered and in the number of IPPs requested. These differences are not sufficient to support different conclusions as to the necessity under the FPM Letter of the requested name-identified documents, especially since no arguments are presented that distinguish one request from another. With regard to the Union's one request for IPPs executed during the period covered by the settlement agreement, we reach the same conclusion. Under that agreement, the Respondent undertook to provide the Union with access to employees' IPPs identified "as being relevant to <span class="Italic">any</span> of the grievances pursued for the rating year 1988, 1989, and 1990." While, as argued by the General Counsel, the agreement establishes the Union's need for certain IPPs, it does not expressly establish the Union's need for them in unsanitized form.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Union has failed to establish that its information needs cannot be satisfied through less intrusive means than name-identified IPPs. An example of a less intrusive method that could serve the needs identified by the Union would be release of sanitized IPPs coded in a manner allowing later identification of specific individuals if the Union requested such identification and established a need therefor. Under this method, any requisite additional information could be obtained in a more targeted way. Furthermore, we note that the Respondent has previously released summary ratings to the Union under the routine use exception. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the Union could not use this information to satisfy its need to identify employees whom it would have to contact directly for additional information.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 51 FLRA 310, 315-20 (1995), reviewing exceptions to an arbitration award, presents a successful attempt by a union to demonstrate that, as a routine user, no means short of the disclosure of home addresses would satisfy its need for communication with a far-flung, extensive bargaining unit:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_361"></span>Disclosure of requested information is prohibited by the Privacy Act unless it can be shown that disclosure is permitted under an exception to that statute....&#8197;The exception to the Privacy Act that is relevant to the case before us is exception (b)(3), which permits disclosure of information for a routine use. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(3).[6] In assessing whether this exception applies to the requested information in this case, it is necessary to examine the pertinent routine use notice published by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in connection with its systems of records. Specifically, OPM maintains general personnel records, which include employee home addresses, in a system of records identified as OPM/GOVT-1. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Washington, D.C.</span>, 46 FLRA 234, 242 (1992). Routine use "j" published with OPM/GOVT-1 establishes that records in that system may be disclosed "to officials of labor organizations recognized under [the Statute] when relevant and necessary to their duties of exclusive representation concerning personnel policies, practices, and matters affecting working conditions." 57 Fed. Reg. 35706 (Aug. 10, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Determining whether disclosure of name and home address information is required under the routine use exception to the Privacy Act requires a different inquiry than a determination under Exemption 6 of the Freedom of Information Act, which was the exemption addressed by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense</span>. As the Court noted in that case, "we are not asked in this case to consider the potential applicability of any other Privacy Act exceptions, such as the 'routine use' exception." 114 S. Ct. at 1012, n.5. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> Justice Souter's concurring opinion. 114 S. Ct. at 1017.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM issued FPM Letter 711-164 on September 17, 1992, to provide guidance in determining whether, as relevant here, information is "relevant and necessary" within the meaning of routine use j. Specifically, with regard to the provision of employees' home addresses, FPM Letter 711-164 states that the disclosure of unit employees' home addresses will not be found necessary if adequate alternative means exist for communicating with unit employees. The Letter further states that an alternative means of communication "will usually be adequate if it permits information from the union to be available to bargaining unit employees." However, the FPM Letter also provides that if an employee spends most of the time away from the workplace and is not reachable by the union through an existing means of communication, the release of the employee's home address to a union representative may be permitted. The FPM Letter further states that the determination of whether alternative means of communication exists must be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In making the requisite case-specific determination required by the FPM Letter, the Arbitrator made numerous factual findings, which are undisputed, and which show that the bargaining unit operates in a somewhat unique physical and geographical setting and that the parties have devised a number of methods for disseminating information in recognition of the size, scope and geographic dispersion of the bargaining unit. These findings support the conclusion that the Union's alternative means of communicating with unit employees are not adequate within the meaning of the FPM Letter as they do not sufficiently permit information to be available to bargaining unit employees. For example, the Arbitrator found that there are 84 separate locations spread throughout the United States and the District of Columbia at which more than 100,000 bargaining unit employees work; that unit employees frequently are co-located with other tenants in various buildings; that there are multiple work shifts; and that many employees do not physically report to an office. As such, if the Union wishes to conduct meetings with bargaining unit employees, more than 84 separate meetings would have to be scheduled in order to permit attendance by all employees and to accommodate multiple work shifts. Even with careful scheduling of meeting times, however, the Union would be unable to reach the many revenue agents and officers who, as the Arbitrator found, were out of the office for extended periods of time. Additionally, given the location of unit employees in buildings with non-Agency employees, the adequacy of handbilling and face-to-face communications could be seriously circumscribed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no error in the Arbitrator's conclusion that use of the Agency's internal mail system and bulletin boards are inadequate means of communication. The undisputed factual findings establish that internal mailings and postings can take as long as 3 weeks to reach employees, seriously hampering the Union's ability to communicate on time-sensitive matters. Further, no distinction is made between deliveries to bargaining unit employees on the one hand, and managers, supervisors, and other employees on the other hand. Therefore, as found by the Arbitrator, the Union's ability to communicate with bargaining unit employees is inadequate. Although, in this connection, the Agency claims that because it provides the Union with certain information, including employees' names and posts-of-duty, the Union should be able to use the internal mail system more effectively, the Arbitrator found otherwise and we see nothing in the record to disturb the Arbitrator's factual finding on this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's additional findings with respect to seasonal employees, who comprise 15 to 20 percent of the bargaining unit, and revenue agents and officers who are either absent from, or on furlough status, for extended periods of time, also support the conclusion that the alternative means of communication are inadequate. For example, the Arbitrator found that seasonal employees have ongoing concerns with respect to their terms and conditions of employment. It follows that the means of communicating with these employees that are contingent on their presence in an office, such as bulletin boards, take-one bins, meetings, and other face-to-face communications, are not only inadequate but also are unavailable. In reaching this conclusion, we reject the Agency's assertion that it is inappropriate to take into account the percentage of seasonal employees who cannot be contacted at the worksite. The FPM Letter explicitly permits consideration of this very factor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that the Arbitrator did not err, as a matter of law, in determining that home addresses are necessary for the Union to perform its representational functions and that there are no adequate alternative means of communication within the meaning of FPM Letter 711-164.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;Even if the now-abolished FPM Letter were not considered relevant in deciding this exception, we would reach the same conclusion. First, review of the award under OPM's routine use interpretation prior to its articulation in the FPM Letter would involve the same analysis, since that interpretation was embodied in the FPM Letter. <span class="Italic">See FLRA v.

<p class="noindent">Another successful request for information by a union qualifying as a routine user is <span class="Italic">Bureau of Indian Affairs and NFFE Council of Consol. BIA Locals</span>, 52 FLRA 629, 635-38 (1996). The union grieved removal of an employee for damaging a government vehicle while driving under the influence of alcohol. The union requested the agency to supply the dates of birth of other employees involved in DUI incidents. The dates of birth were to be used by the union to secure state government driving and accident records that could then be used to show that the penalty imposed against the grievant was disparate. Because the union lacked other means to obtain the information and the information was relevant to the grievance, FLRA directed the employer to disclose the dates of birth for seven named employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]o determine whether the routine use exception applies to the requested information contained in OPM/GOVT-1, we must decide whether the requested information is "relevant and necessary" within the meaning of routine use statement "j." For the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Little Rock, Arkansas</span>, 51 FLRA 216, 223-26 (1995), in deciding this issue we apply OPM's "guidance to agencies" for interpreting the terms contained in FPM Letter 711-164.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FPM Letter contains two requirements that a union must satisfy in order to establish that requested information is consistent with routine use "j": (1) the information is "relevant" to the express purpose for which it is sought, meaning that the nature of the information must bear a traceable, logical, and significant connection to the purpose to be served; and (2) the information is "necessary," meaning that there are no adequate alternative means or sources for satisfying the union's informational needs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties stipulated that the Union requested the DOBs to obtain the named employees, driver license records in order to determine whether the grievant was treated disparately....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Where, as here, a union requests information to make a determination as to whether disparate treatment has occurred in a discipline case, such information is germane to the processing of an arbitration case involving the same issue....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Union needed the requested information to determine whether there was disparate treatment of the grievant, and we find that the General Counsel has established that this need could not have been satisfied through less intrusive means than by using the employees' DOBs to obtain access to their state driver license records. In this regard, the Respondent had provided the Union with records over a 5-year period showing that there had been numerous accidents involving Government vehicles or damage to Government property, but that no other employee had received any discipline. The Respondent does not dispute the General Counsel's assertion that, "by [the] Respondent's own accounting, there <span id="Page_362"></span>were no disciplinary files for the Union to request in order to compare the discipline meted out to [the grievant] <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> other employees. Only the Utah driving records would reveal whether or not alcohol had been involved in the other accidents." That information--whether alcohol had been involved in the other accidents--was necessary to the Union because it would have allowed the Union to determine whether to settle the grievance or invoke arbitration and to demonstrate to the arbitrator that the grievant's termination was excessive. Additionally, as this case concerns employee discipline, the Union's need for the information is compelling. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Dallas, Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 945, 958 n.12 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's assertion that there are less intrusive sources of information that the Union could have used to mitigate the grievant's termination, and, therefore, the information is not necessary. The proper inquiry is whether the Union's need for information that would reveal if other employees who had been in accidents involving Government vehicles had also been charged with DUI could be satisfied through less intrusive means. The Respondent's records did not contain such information. Further, the Respondent has not asserted that there are less intrusive means of satisfying the Union's need for information that would reveal if other employees who had been in accidents involving Government vehicles had also been charged with DUI. Rather, the General Counsel has established that the only adequate way to obtain information about the accidents involving the named employees is from state driver license records, and the only way to obtain these records from the state is through the use of those employees' DOBs. Accordingly, based on the foregoing, we find that the information is necessary, within the meaning of routine use statement "j."</p>
<p class="noindent">For history and interpretation of the "routine use" exception created in the OPM Privacy Act notice, refer to<span class="Italic"> FLRA v. Dept. of Navy, Navy Ships Parts Control Ctr.</span>, 966 F.2d 747, 761-62 (3d Cir. 1992). OPM subsequently issued regulatory guidance in the now-discontinued FPM Letter 711-164 (Sept. 17, 1992), and articulated the OPM routine use description for agency disciplinary records, OPM/GOVT-3 (57 Fed. Reg. 35712, Aug. 10, 1992), requiring case-by-case evaluation of disclosure and cautioning against approval of broadly-based disclosure requirements. OPM directed a two-step test: first, the union must show that the information requested is "relevant" to a representational function; second, the union must demonstrate that the information is "necessary," i.e., that the union has a particularized need for information in a form that identifies specific individuals and that the informational needs cannot be satisfied through less intrusive means. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, BATF</span>, 46 FLRA 234, 244-45 (1992). As a result of the change in regulations defining "routine use," FLRA turned to an examination of the means of communication available to unions other than disclosure of home addresses. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 51 FLRA 310, 319 (1995) (authorizing disclosure of address information to union, as routine user, because of far-flung and extensive composition of bargaining unit, and because there were no alternative means for union to communicate with unit members without mailings to their homes); <span class="Italic">VA, Med. &#x0026; Reg'l Office Ctr., Fargo and NFFE Local 225</span>, 46 FLRA 1243, 1244-45 (1993).

<p class="noindent">Information may be covered by an agency routine use notice rather than by an OPM notice. The agency notice then controls.

<p class="noindent-1">The case law on which the Agency relies is arguably distinguishable.&#x2003;That case law, and the requirement to analyze both the "relevance" of requested information, and the "necessity" for its disclosure, pertain specifically to information contained in two OPM systems of records mentioned previously, OPM/GOVT-1 and OPM/GOVT-2.[94] Unlike Routine Use G8, which simply requires disclosure to labor-organization officials of "necessary" information,[95] OPM's systems require disclosable information to be both "relevant" and "necessary."[96] Indeed, it is unclear whether the relevant-and-necessary test proposed by the Agency continues to apply, even to requests for information contained in the OPM systems, because that test was based on an OPM interpretation contained in a now-expired Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Letter.[97]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">However, even assuming the applicability of the two-step analysis proposed by the Agency, we find that the phone logs are disclosable.

Regarding the relevance of the phone logs, as the Judge found, the Union "needed the information...to use as evidence in a grievance and arbitration on behalf of [the grievant]...(1) to show how [the grievant's supervisor] treated [the grievant] compared to other...employees [in the grievant's unit]; and (2) to use as evidence in the grievance proceedings to show that [the grievant's supervisor] lacked credibility."

<p class="noindent-1">We also find the phone logs to be "necessary." Regarding alternative means or sources for satisfying the Union's need for the phone-log information, the Agency proposes that "the Union could have supplied waivers...[from] the five individuals" identified in the Union's information request or "could have asked these employees to supply any instances when they either called or were called by [the supervisor]." But even if the Union had obtained authorizations, the Agency would still provide the information in the form requested by the Union. And with respect to employee-provided data, such information would likely be far less reliable than information obtained from the Agency's phone logs. Thus, the Agency has not shown that adequate alternative means or sources exist for satisfying the Union's informational needs. Accordingly, we find that even applying the two-step analysis the Agency proposes, the phone logs are disclosable under Routine Use G8.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 59 FLRA 926, 929-30 (2004), considered the negotiability of Proposal 2, necessitating agreement by the agency that it would release to the union information contained in the agency security system pertaining to unit employees. The Privacy Act precluded release of the information because the union did not qualify as a person or entity to whom the information could be provided under several statutory provisions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By its express terms, Proposal 2 would provide the Union with "information contained in the agency security system within five days of its request for such information." The Agency claims that the proposal conflicts with the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a. In particular, the Agency states that disclosure of the information to the Union would not be authorized under either &#x00A7; 552a(b)(1) or &#x00A7; 552a(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously has recognized that the Privacy Act restricts the disclosure, and redisclosure, of personally identifiable records. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., GSA</span>, 53 FLRA 925, 933 (1997). With certain enumerated exceptions, the Privacy Act provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute in this case that information contained in the Agency's photo ID system constitutes a "record" that is contained in a "system of records" as those terms are defined in the Act, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 552a(a)(4) and (5), and that the Privacy Act applies in this case. Thus, absent written consent by an employee, disclosure of records contained in a system of records is prohibited unless one of the exceptions enumerated in the Privacy Act itself applies. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Defense v. FLRA</span>, 510 U.S. 487, 498 (1994) ("Disclosure of [specified information] is prohibited by the Privacy Act unless an exception to that Act applies.").[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;We find that the Agency was not obligated to demonstrate that disclosure of the information in the photo ID system implicates employee privacy interests. That requirement is applied when an agency defends a refusal to furnish information on the basis that disclosure is prohibited by the Privacy Act because it would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under FOIA Exemption 6. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Transportation, FAA, New York TRACON, Westbury, NY</span>, 50 FLRA 338, 345 (1995) (<span class="Italic">TRACON</span>). As explained below, this case does not involve FOIA Exemption 6. We also note that the Authority's statement in <span class="Italic">TRACON</span>, 50 FLRA at 342 n.5, that the Privacy Act would not apply if disclosure <span id="Page_363"></span>"would implicate no privacy interests," is an obvious reference to an obligation under FOIA Exemption 6, as the Authority's reliance therein on <span class="Italic">National Association of Retired Federal Employees v.

The only argument made by the Union is that "[t]he Privacy Act requirement is not in violation of the Privacy Act if the information is disclosed for the union in performing its duty as outlined in the collective bargaining agreement, Article 16, Section 1 and 29 CFR 1960.40." By stating that the information would be used by the Union for collective bargaining purposes, it is clear that disclosure is not authorized under &#x00A7; 552a(b)(1), which pertains to disclosure of records to officers and employees of the agency who maintain such records and who have a need for the records in the performance of their duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, disclosure is not authorized under &#x00A7; 552a(b)(3). Although the Agency promulgated a routine use for the information in a system of records identified as OPM/Internal 14, the Union is not identified as a routine user. As such, the information may not be disclosed pursuant to OPM/Internal 14. <span class="Italic">Cf. United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Dallas, Tex.</span>, 51 FLRA 945, 959 (1996) (information not disclosable under &#x00A7; 552a(b)(3) as agency's routine use statement "d[id] not include a routine use that provides for disclosure of information to officials of labor organizations").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that the Union makes no other claim that the information may lawfully be disclosed consistent with the Privacy Act. For example, the Union makes no claim that disclosure of the information is required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(2), which requires disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, even if we were to view the Union as raising a claim under FOIA Exemption 6, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 39 FLRA 675, 685-87 (1991) (addressing disclosure of time and attendance reports under that FOIA Exemption), we would find that the use of information for representational purposes is not a sufficient justification for requiring the Agency to disclose information from the photo ID system. As the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">TRACON</span>, "we will no longer...define[&#8197;] the public interest to be weighed under the FOIA in terms of collective bargaining as embodied in the Statute." 50 FLRA at 344 n.6. Rather, the public interest to be weighed is defined "in terms of the extent to which disclosure of the information would shed light on the agency's performance of its statutory duties or otherwise inform citizens as to what their Government 'is up to.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 344 (quoting <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice v. Reptrs. Comm. For Freedom of the Press</span>, 489 U.S. 749, 773 (1989) (footnote omitted). The Union makes no showing that disclosure of the information in this case would serve that purpose.</p>
