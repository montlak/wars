<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-106"><span class="space">f.</span> Jurisdictional, Timeliness Issues</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Preclusion of duplicative litigation over jurisdictional issues is more often analyzed through application of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, discussed earlier, than through application of collateral estoppel. <span class="Italic">Noble v. USPS</span>, 93 MSPR 693, 696-700 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-12 (2003), determined that a subject matter jurisdictional dismissal is not given <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect; <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> applies to an appeal within the Board's jurisdiction. But under <span class="Italic">Noble</span>, collateral estoppel may bar a party from relitigating jurisdiction in a second action when the prior appeal was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Res judicata does not bar this appeal</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, a valid, final judgment on the merits of an action bars a second action involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action. <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995). But the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> applies only in limited circumstances. It is applicable only if: (1) the prior judgment was rendered by a forum with competent jurisdiction; (2) the prior judgment was a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the same cause of action and the same parties or their privies were involved in both cases. <span class="Italic">id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second criterion is not satisfied here. Here, the AJ relied on the judgment in the appellant's 1996 appeal to bar the present action. But the 1996 appeal was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Noble v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, MSPB Docket No. AT-0752-96-0534-I-1 (dismissing the appeal because the Board does not have jurisdiction over lateral reassignments that do not reduce an appellant's grade or pay). A dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not "on the merits" and, therefore, cannot be given <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect. Peartree, 66 M.S.P.R. at 339; <span class="Italic">see</span> also <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 370 &#x00B6; 12 (2002), appeal dismissed, 55 Fed. Appx. 563 (Fed. Cir. 2003 nonprecedential) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is not grounds upon which to dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction but, rather, is a basis to dismiss an appeal over which the Board has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Perdue v. Department of Transportation</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 551 &#x00B6; 8 (2001); <span class="Italic">Mycka v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 675, 679 (1993). Thus, the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> should not have been used to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The appellant is barred from relitigating whether the Board has jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d)</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead, we find that the doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes the appellant from relitigating whether the Board has jurisdiction over his 1996 reassignment and alleged reduction in pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). Collateral estoppel precludes a party from relitigating an issue when: (1) an issue is identical to that involved in a prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action. <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Peartree</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 341.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue of the Board's jurisdiction here was raised and litigated in the 2005 appeal, and the administrative judge's determination on that issue was necessary to the resulting judgment.

In the 2005 appeal, the appellant contended as she does now that she met the requirement of "current continuous service" and the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). The administrative judge rejected her claims that she had satisfied the requirement by having served more than 1 year without a break in service in positions at the Veterans Administration and the Department of the Navy--jobs she had held consecutively between February 15, 1978, and September 28, 1979. The administrative judge noted that the "current continuous service" requirement can only be satisfied by the completion of such a period of employment immediately preceding the adverse action in question. The appellant's period of service ended more than 24 years before her March 8, 2004 appointment with the agency. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Before proceeding to the merits of Mr. Killeen's petition, this court must address the Board's primary holding under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In its <span class="Italic">Enforcement Decision</span>, the Board expressly declined to rule on the propriety of OPM's use of two different calculations for pre-April 7, 1986, and post-April 6, 1986, service. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Decision</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. at 630.

Because it declined to reach the merits, the Board cannot maintain that Mr. Killeen's complaint about the computational methodology employed by OPM was "actually litigated" or "necessarily decided."

<p class="Body-Text">Prior to, but consistent with, <span class="Italic">Noble</span>, if an appellant attempted to cure a jurisdictional defect in a second appeal after an early appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the second appeal was not necessarily precluded by collateral estoppel, <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, a party is barred from relitigating an issue resolved in a previous appeal if: (1) The issue previously adjudicated is identical to the one now presented; (2) that issue was actually litigated in the prior case; (3) the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party precluded by the doctrine was fully represented in the prior case. <span class="Italic">See Peartree v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the appellant has not shown error in the administrative judge's finding that the elements of collateral estoppel have been met in this case regarding the timeliness of his appeal of the 2008 removal, and that he is thus precluded from relitigating this issue. The matter previously adjudicated, the untimeliness of the appeal from his 2008 removal, is identical to the issue in the instant appeal. The timeliness issue was actually litigated in the 2009 appeal, and that timeliness determination was necessary to the resulting judgment. The appellant has filed five pleadings after the show cause order but has never addressed the issue of collateral estoppel, nor has he made a substantive argument of good cause for the untimeliness of his 2009 appeal. The appellant argued merely that he was "busy" studying at the time of the original 2009 appeal and that he was currently applying for federal employment that would investigate his prior work experience. The record shows that he submitted over thirty pages of evidence, addressing only his work experience at the agency, his education records, and a summary of personnel actions taken against him. As argued by the agency, the appellant has failed to address the issue of collateral estoppel in any way or argue legal error in the findings of the administrative judge in the initial decision. Moreover, the appellant offered no explanation of why he waited more than 5 years to file a second appeal of the removal action. Therefore, the doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes the adjudication of the timeliness of the appeal of the agency's removal action.</p>
