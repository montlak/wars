<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-76"><span class="space">5.</span> Clarification, Correction of Awards</h4>
<p class="noindent">Neither &#x00A7; 7121 nor &#x00A7; 7122 prohibits an arbitrator's correction or clarification of an award after its issuance. Without a contract limitation, an arbitrator's authority is not always immediately terminated on issuance of an award. It is generally recognized that an arbitrator has authority to correct or clarify an award. <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs, Army Eng'rs Dist., New Orleans and NFFE Local 1124</span>, 17 FLRA 315, 316 (1985) (award was clarified to require letter of reprimand rather than letter of warning to be placed into personnel file after agency pointed out that contract precluded letter of warning in OPF).</p>
<p class="noindent">Either party may seek clarification of an award; the arbitrator's authority to clarify his award does not depend on a joint request from the parties. <span class="Italic">Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters Local 13 and Panama Canal Comm'n, Gen. Servs. Bureau, Balboa</span>, 43 FLRA 1012, 1012-13 n.1 (1992); <span class="Italic">see AFGE Local 1923 and HCFA, DHHS</span>, 33 FLRA 88 (1988) (clarification of award did not constitute reopening of case at request of one party when arbitrator clarified ambiguity by restating basis for award), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Info. Sys. Command, Savanna Army Depot and NAGE Local R7-36</span>, 38 FLRA 1464 (1991) ("an arbitrator may clarify an ambiguous award and restate the basis for an award which conforms to the arbitrator's original findings"). The parties themselves are free to agree to modify a final and binding award. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2501 and DOD, DLA, New Cumberland</span>, 56 FLRA 1052, 1054 (2001), <span class="Italic">recons. den.</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2501 and DOD, DLA, New Cumberland</span>, 57 FLRA 278, 279 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">To stop the practice of extensions of the exception filing period through reconsideration requests, FLRA clarified the authority of arbitrators following the issuance of their awards in <span class="Italic">Overseas Fed'n of Teachers and DODDS, Mediterranean Region</span>, 32 FLRA 410, 413-16 (1988). FLRA declared that "the authority of an arbitrator to clarify or correct an award after it is issued permits an arbitrator to correct clerical mistakes or obvious errors in arithmetical computation, but does not empower an arbitrator to reopen and reverse an award which has become final":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In section 7122 of the Statute, Congress authorized parties to file exceptions to awards and empowered the Authority to resolve timely filed exceptions to determine whether an arbitrator's award is consistent with law. The appropriate mechanism for a party to challenge the propriety of an arbitration award is the filing of timely exceptions to that award under section 7122(a) of the Statute....&#8197;If a party fails to file timely exceptions to an arbitration award, the award becomes final and binding and the parties must take the actions required by the award....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator's July 30, 1987, award became final and binding when no exceptions were filed....&#8197;The parties were bound by the terms of the award and were obligated under section 7122(b) to implement the award....&#8197;Since the Union did not file timely exceptions to the award, the award was not subject to challenge by other means, including a request by the Union to the Arbitrator to reverse his decision. Because Congress gave the Authority the function of determining whether an award is consistent with law, we reject the Union's contention that an arbitrator should be permitted to change his or her award upon the request of a party when the arbitrator has misapplied the law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The authority of an arbitrator to clarify or correct an award after it is issued permits an arbitrator to correct clerical mistakes or obvious errors in arithmetical computation, but does not empower an arbitrator to reopen and reverse an award which has become final....&#8197;The Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, 17 FLRA 315, merely recognized that under limited circumstances, an arbitrator may clarify or correct an award after it has been issued. The decision does not suggest that an arbitrator is <span id="page_1808"></span>empowered to reconsider an award in a situation like that in the instant case. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stated in <span class="Italic">Devine v. White</span>, 697 F.2d 421 (D.C. Cir. 1983):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[N]othing in the legislative history of the [Civil Service Reform Act] suggests that Congress intended to alter the common law concerning arbitrators' authority to reconsider their decisions. "The cases are unanimous in supporting [the] principle" that "[w]hen the final award has been rendered...all power of the arbitrators is exhausted, and any further action that they take will be utterly void unless the parties confer new authority upon them."...&#8197;[A] request for reconsideration by only one of the parties has no effect[.]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator issued a final award on July 30, 1987. The Union filed exceptions to the award with the Authority, and the exceptions were dismissed as untimely. The Union's subsequent motion to the Arbitrator, which was opposed by the Agency, did not provide the Arbitrator with authority to reconsider his award or to issue a new decision. In the absence of a joint request by the parties, the Arbitrator fulfilled the function of his office and was <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> when he issued the July 30, 1987 award....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the Arbitrator's position that a failure by both parties to an arbitration proceeding to cite applicable law provides a basis for an arbitrator to assert jurisdiction to correct an award in order to bring it into conformance with precedent. The responsibility to identify applicable law is one which is jointly shared by the arbitrator and the parties to an arbitration proceeding. The failure of the parties to identify applicable law may make an arbitrator's task more difficult, but it does not confer jurisdiction on an arbitrator to change an award in an attempt to make the award consistent with the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA also attempted to stake out the permissible bounds of award clarification in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and HCFA, DHHS</span>, 33 FLRA 88, 93-94 (1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although not disputed by the Agency, we confirm that the Arbitrator was authorized to issue the Supplemental Memorandum clarifying his award even though he was requested to clarify his award by the Union alone. Because of the ambiguity raised by the Union as to the basis for the Arbitrator's award of a promotion, the Arbitrator was entitled to clarify the ambiguity and to restate the basis for his award which conforms to his original findings....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, we recently held that after an arbitrator's award has been issued, the arbitrator is not authorized to reopen the arbitration proceeding or to reconsider the award without a joint request of the parties. <span class="Italic">Overseas Federation of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO and Department of Defense Dependents Schools, Mediterranean Region</span>, 32 FLRA 410, 415 (1988)....&#8197;In this case, the Arbitrator's Supplemental Memorandum clarifying the award did not constitute a reopening of the proceedings nor a consideration of his award. Rather, the Arbitrator clarified an ambiguity by restating the basis for his award of a promotion.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">HCFA, DHHS and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 35 FLRA 274, 281-82 (1990), distinguished correction of a clerical or computational error through a unilateral request for clarification and a request for additional findings and revision of a remedy--a distinction FLRA thought was buttressed by the arbitrator's subsequent request for additional information:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union requested the Arbitrator to clarify the portion of the award directing the payment of compensation to the grievant. The Union requested the Arbitrator to: (1) direct the Agency to temporarily promote the grievant with backpay; and (2) specify that an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action directly resulted in the grievant's loss of pay, and that but for the action, the loss would not have occurred. In our view, the Union's request cannot reasonably be interpreted as a request that the Arbitrator correct a clerical mistake or an obvious computational error. Rather, we conclude that the Union requested the Arbitrator to make additional findings and revise the remedy provided in the Arbitrator's original award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note in this regard that the Arbitrator responded to the Union's request by asking the parties to submit additional information and to "focus their attention upon the issue whether the Award must be based upon the provisions of the Back Pay Act or whether the Award can be construed as damages[.]" In our view, a simple clarification of the previous award would not have required the parties to provide this information to the Arbitrator. As such, the Arbitrator's request for additional information buttresses our conclusion that the Union requested a modification, rather than a clarification, of the Arbitrator's original award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, we are unable to conclude that the Arbitrator simply clarified an ambiguity in the award, as occurred in <span class="Italic">Health Care Financing Administration</span>, on which the Union now relies for support. In <span class="Italic">Health Care Financing Administration</span>, the arbitrator issued a supplemental memorandum which the Authority found to constitute a clarification of an ambiguity raised by the union and a restatement of the arbitrator's original award. In this case, the Arbitrator did not clarify or restate his original award. The Arbitrator altered his remedy by directing that the grievant be given a temporary promotion rather than priority consideration. Accordingly, <span class="Italic">Health Care Financing Administration</span> does not support the Union's argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Arbitrator's "clarification" constituted a revision of his previous award. There was no joint request of the parties that the Arbitrator revise the original award. In fact, the Agency immediately objected to the Union's request on the basis that the Union was seeking to have the award revised, rather than clarified. As there was no joint request of the parties to reopen and revise the award, the Arbitrator was not empowered to do so based solely on the Union's request. Consequently, the Arbitrator was not authorized to issue the "Clarification of Award," and that award is set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent">Clarification was revisited in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Info. Sys. Command, Savanna Army Depot and NAGE Local R7-36</span>, 38 FLRA 1464, 1467-68 (1991). The arbitrator set aside a suspension, but he did not award back pay. The union filed exceptions. The arbitrator then clarified his award to state that the award implicitly awarded back pay. FLRA dismissed the union's exceptions as moot:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator served the parties with the clarification of his initial award on October 22, 1990. The Arbitrator stated, in this regard, that the Agency did not join in the Union's request for clarification. No exceptions were filed to the clarification, however, and the Agency has not in any other way indicated that the award, as clarified, is deficient on any grounds specified in section 7122(a) of the Statute. Moreover, after requesting an extension of time to file an opposition to the Union's exceptions, the Agency failed to file an opposition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, and for the following reasons, we will consider the Arbitrator's award, as clarified, in resolving the Union's exceptions. We note two things. First, we find that the Arbitrator was empowered to issue the clarification. It is well-established that an arbitrator may clarify an ambiguous award and restate the basis for an award which conforms to the arbitrator's original findings. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923, AFL-CIO and Health Care Financing Administration, Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 33 FLRA 88, 93 (1988), and the cases cited therein. An arbitrator's authority to clarify an award does not depend on a joint request from the parties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Health Care Financing Administration, Department of Health and Human Services and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923</span>, 35 FLRA 274, 281 (1990) (Arbitrator may not reconsider an award or issue a new decision without a joint request from the parties).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is no assertion, or any other basis on which to conclude, that the Arbitrator's clarification constitutes a reconsideration of, or a replacement for, his initial award. Instead, it is apparent that the Arbitrator merely clarified his initial award to make "explicit" what he viewed as the "implicit" requirement in the initial award that the grievant be made whole for the suspension. Accordingly, we conclude that the Arbitrator was empowered to issue the clarification.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, we conclude that there is no regulatory prohibition on our considering the clarification, which was served on the parties and the Authority by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator has not, in this regard, requested the Authority to take action with respect to the clarification and has not, in any way, argued the merits of his award....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator has not communicated directly to the Authority regarding the merits of the award, and as the clarification does not include or constitute such argument, we find that it is appropriate to accept and consider the clarification....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 400 and Dept. of Army, 10th Mountain Div., Ft. Drum</span>, 50 FLRA 525, 526-27 (1995), providing an example of a permissible correction to an award, determined that "an arbitrator may clarify or correct an award to correct clerical mistakes or obvious errors in arithmetical computation...and may clarify an ambiguous award and restate the basis for an award which conforms to the arbitrator's original findings":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that in the absence of a joint request by the parties, the Arbitrator was <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> after he issued his original award and lacked authority to issue a supplemental award.[*]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*]&#x2003;The principle of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> means that once an official has fulfilled the function or accomplished the designated purpose of his or her office, the official has no further authority. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, National Treasury Employees Union Chapter 33 and U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Phoenix District</span>, 44 FLRA 252, 263 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the principle of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> generally precludes an arbitrator from reconsidering an award after it has been issued, <span class="Italic">Overseas Federation of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO</span> <span class="Italic">and Department of Defense Dependents Schools, Mediterranean Region</span>, 32 FLRA 410, 414-15 (1988) (<span class="Italic">DODDS</span>), an arbitrator may, under limited circumstances, clarify or correct an award after it has been issued. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 415, citing <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Engineer District, New Orleans, Louisiana and</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1124</span>, 17 FLRA 315, 316 (1985). An arbitrator <span id="page_1809"></span>may clarify or correct an award to correct clerical mistakes or obvious errors in arithmetical computation, <span class="Italic">DODDS</span>, 32 FLRA at 414, and may clarify an ambiguous award and restate the basis for an award which conforms to the arbitrator's original findings. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Army Information Systems Command, Savanna Army Depot and National Association of Government Employees, Local R7-36</span>, 38 FLRA 1464, 1467 (1991). An arbitrator's authority to clarify an award does not depend on a joint request from the parties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it is undisputed that the Agency had suspended the grievant for 14 consecutive calendar days, which included only 10 workdays, and that the Arbitrator mitigated the suspension to 5 workdays. The Arbitrator corrected the obvious error involved in calculating the amount of backpay required in mitigating the suspension to a 5-workday suspension. Consequently, we conclude that the Arbitrator had the authority to clarify his initial award and that the award, as clarified, is not deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 11 and Dept. of Air Force, Fairchild AFB</span>, 53 FLRA 1747, 1149-50 (1998), sharpened the distinction between correction of an award and a supplemental award. The arbitrator made a mistake in determining how the contract required arbitration expenses to be apportioned among the parties, but he discovered the error only after the award became final. He then sent a letter revising his billing and pointing out his error. The letter was treated as an award, and the award was set aside because the arbitrator's erroneous interpretation of the contract did not amount to a clerical or arithmetical error:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A threshold question is whether the Arbitrator's letter constitutes an "award" within the meaning of section 7122 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In one other instance, the Authority has considered an exception to a letter sent to a party by an arbitrator after the initial award had been rendered final. <span class="Italic">See Philadelphia</span> <span class="Italic">Metal Trades Council and U.S. Department of Navy, Philadelphia</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Shipyard</span>, 35 FLRA 251, 252 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Shipyard</span>) (while questioning whether arbitrator's letter to grievant constituted an "award" within the meaning of the Statute, the Authority denied union's exception on the merits, rather than dismissing it for want of jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the substance of the Arbitrator's letter (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, allocation of fees) modifies the terms of the initial award. As such, and noting the lack of any argument that the letter does not constitute an award, the Authority will treat this letter as a supplemental award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under certain, limited circumstances, an arbitrator has the authority to clarify or correct an award after it becomes final. <span class="Italic">Overseas Federation of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO and</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense Dependents Schools, Mediterranean</span> <span class="Italic">Region</span>, 32 FLRA 410, 415 (1988) (<span class="Italic">DODDS, Mediterranean Region</span>). For example, an arbitrator has the authority to correct "clerical mistakes or obvious errors in arithmetical computation[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 414. However, once the award becomes final, the arbitrator loses jurisdiction over the subject matter and becomes <span class="Italic">functus officio. National Treasury</span> <span class="Italic">Employees Union, National Treasury Employees Union Chapter 33</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Phoenix District</span>, 44 FLRA 252, 263 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Without specific retention of jurisdiction by the arbitrator, any further action by the arbitrator may only be taken at the joint request of the parties. <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span>, 35 FLRA at 252. An arbitrator exceeds his or her authority by reopening an award without the consent of the parties. <span class="Italic">DODDS, Mediterranean Region</span>, 32 FLRA at 415. More particularly, the Authority has held that an arbitrator did not have the power to reopen the allocation of fees relating to his own award, when the parties had not put that issue before him for resolution. <span class="Italic">General Services Administration</span> <span class="Italic">and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2600</span>, 34 FLRA 1123, 1128 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues, with validity, that the Arbitrator's supplemental award is deficient under section 7122 of the Statute because the initial award had already been rendered final and binding. Once 30 days have elapsed since service of the award upon the parties, the award becomes final and binding, unless an aggrieved party files a timely exception to the award. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.1(c). Here, neither party filed an exception to the initial award. By the time the Arbitrator discovered that he had failed to comply with the collective bargaining agreement's instructions to denote the losing party for purposes of allocating fees, he had already been rendered <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's "erroneous assumption" does not constitute a clerical or arithmetical error. The Arbitrator's assumption stemmed from a misunderstanding of the collective bargaining agreement itself. Had the parties made a joint request to reopen the fee allocation issue, the Arbitrator could have corrected the error. Similarly, had the Agency wished to dispute the initial fee allocation, it could have done so by filing a timely exception to the award. The Arbitrator exceeded his authority when he issued the letter of May 13, 1997 and the accompanying "Revised Statement" without a request from the parties. As such, the supplemental award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">SSA, Region 1 and AFGE Local 1164</span>, 59 FLRA 614, 615-16 (2004), the arbitrator mitigated a short suspension to a written warning, but then the union brought to the arbitrator's attention a prior interpretation of the contract, apparently previously reviewed by FLRA, that described a reprimand, rather than a warning letter, as the lowest permissible level of discipline. The arbitrator issued a clarification of the award, calling on the agency to substitute a reprimand for the warning. On exceptions by the agency, the clarification was set aside. It was not a clarification, for the first award was without ambiguity and the correction did not address a computational or clerical mistake:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the principle of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>, once an arbitrator has accomplished the resolution of the matter submitted, the arbitrator is without further authority<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Tex., </span>58 FLRA 77, 80 (2002) (Member Pope dissenting in part). Accordingly, unless an arbitrator retains jurisdiction after issuance of the award, the arbitrator has no authority to take any further action without the joint request of the parties<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. However, under certain limited circumstances, an arbitrator has authority to clarify or correct an issued award<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., NFFE Local 11, </span>53 FLRA 1747, 1749 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator may clarify an ambiguous award, but the clarification must conform to the arbitrator's original findings<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Army, Army Info. Sys. Command, Savanna Army Depot, </span>38 FLRA 1464, 1467 (1991). An arbitrator may also correct clerical mistakes or obvious errors in arithmetical computations<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Health Care Fin. Admin., Dep't of Health and Human Serv., </span>35 FLRA 274, 281 (1990). The Arbitrator clearly did not correct a clerical mistake or an obvious computational error. Accordingly, the question is whether the Arbitrator's substitution of a "official reprimand" for a "written warning" clarifies the original award or modifies the terms of the original award. We conclude that the Arbitrator modified the terms of the original award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the Agency, in <span class="Italic">SSA, Lansing, </span>the Authority<span class="Italic"> </span>specifically refused to equate a "written warning" with an "official reprimand" under Article 23 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">. See </span>58 FLRA at 95. The Authority ruled, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Had the Arbitrator intended to order the Agency to issue a written reprimand, the Arbitrator could have easily done so in a clear fashion. Instead, the Arbitrator devised his own remedy, which does not, on its face, fall within the confines of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See id</span>. In view of the parties' determination in Article 23 of the collective bargaining agreement to distinguish official reprimands from other actions such as written warnings, a distinction explicitly reflected in our precedent and of which the Arbitrator was specifically made aware by the Union, his action in substituting an "official reprimand" for a "written warning" did not merely clarify an ambiguity in the award. Instead, the Arbitrator modified his original award by substituting an "official reprimand," which constitutes discipline under Article 23 of the parties' agreement, for a "written warning," which does not constitute discipline under the parties' agreement. For these same reasons, we reject the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>. In that case, unlike in this case, there had not been a specific decision by the Authority under the parties' collective bargaining agreement construing the different actions. In <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers, </span>the Authority had never ruled that what the arbitrator intended could not be viewed as a letter of reprimand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the absence of a joint request from the parties, the Arbitrator had fulfilled his functions and was <span class="Italic">functus officio </span>after he issued his March 12, 2003 award. He was not authorized to issue the award of April 4, 2003. Accordingly, we set the April 4 award aside.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs, Army Eng'rs Dist., New Orleans and NFFE Local 1124</span>, 17 FLRA 315, 316 (1985) (award was clarified to require letter of reprimand rather than letter of warning to be placed into personnel file after agency pointed out that contract precluded letter of warning in OPF).</p>
<p class="noindent">A material factual error in an award could not be clarified without a violation of the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio,</span> <span class="Italic">SSA Lawrenceburg and AFGE 3438</span>, 60 FLRA 336, 339-40 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the principle of<span class="Italic"> functus officio</span>, once an arbitrator has accomplished the resolution of the matter submitted, the arbitrator is without further authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Tex.,</span> 58 FLRA 77, 80 (2002) (Member Pope dissenting as to other matters). Accordingly, unless an arbitrator retains jurisdiction after issuance of the award, the arbitrator has no authority to take any further action without the joint request of the parties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Authority has consistently held that an arbitrator may clarify an ambiguous award <span class="Italic">if</span> the clarification conforms to the arbitrator's original findings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Army, Army Info. Sys. Command, Savanna Army Depot</span>, 38 FLRA 1464, 1467 (1991). An arbitrator may also correct clerical mistakes or obvious errors in arithmetical computations.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., Health Care Fin. Admin., Dep't of Health and Human Serv.,</span> 35 FLRA 274, 281 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the initial award, the issue framed by the Arbitrator was whether the Agency failed to properly authorize the grievant travel expenses for a <span id="page_1810"></span>final walk through in the Lawrenceburg, Tennessee Field Office and, if so, what remedy was appropriate. The Arbitrator resolved this issue by finding that the Agency violated the parties' agreement "when it refused to pay the travel expenses and per diem <span class="Italic">incurred by</span> [the grievant] for the final walk through inspection for the relocated SSA (Agency) field office in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee." There is no dispute that the final walk through inspection to which the Arbitrator was referring occurred on August 31, 2001. Thus, by finding that the grievant incurred those expenses for the final walk through inspection on August 31, 2001, the Arbitrator implicitly found that the grievant had attended the final walk through inspection that occurred on August 31, 2001. As a remedy, the Arbitrator directed that the Agency "shall pay for such expenses as required by the Master Agreement."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in the supplemental award, the Arbitrator expressly found that the grievant did <span class="Italic">not</span> attend the final walk through inspection. In this regard, the Arbitrator found that "it would have been better for [the grievant] to have made the trip when all parties were involved in the final walk through inspection." Further, the Arbitrator found that "[t]he Agency surely knew or should have known at the time of the arbitration hearing whether or not [the grievant] attended the final walk through inspection on August 31, 2001." The Arbitrator determined that if the grievant makes a final walk through inspection on behalf of the Union, he is to be reimbursed per the "usual procedure" as required by the parties' agreement; that is, through the issuance of travel orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question to be resolved is whether the Arbitrator's supplemental award constitutes a permissible clarification of the initial award or an impermissible modification of the initial award. The supplemental award in this case cannot reasonably be interpreted as correcting a clerical mistake or an obvious error. Moreover, the Arbitrator did not clarify an ambiguous award in a way that conforms to the findings in the initial award. Rather, the Arbitrator made a factual finding in the supplemental award that was inconsistent with the initial award, and effectively ordered a new remedy based on the different factual premise of the supplemental award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, it is undisputed that the final walk through inspection in the Lawrenceburg, Tennessee Field Office occurred on August 31, 2001. The Arbitrator expressly concluded in the initial award that the Agency violated the parties' agreement when it refused to pay the travel expenses and per diem incurred by the grievant for the final walk through inspection in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. Accordingly, particularly in the absence of any indication in the initial award to the contrary, it is apparent that the Arbitrator's conclusion in the initial award was predicated on an implicit finding that the grievant attended the August 31, 2001, final walk through inspection and incurred expenses and per diem in so doing. Upon receiving the initial award, the Union did not except to, or seek clarification of, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency violated the parties' agreement when it refused to pay the travel expenses and per diem incurred by the grievant for the final walk through inspection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast to the implicit finding in the initial award, the Arbitrator found in his supplemental award that the grievant did not attend the final walk through inspection, and went on to state that if the grievant makes a final walk through inspection, he is to be reimbursed. By doing so, the Arbitrator changed a factual conclusion, substantively modifying the initial award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator impermissibly modified an award without a joint request of the parties, we find that the supplemental award is deficient under the principle of <span class="Italic">functus officio </span>and must be set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent">A party's request for clarification of an award and the possibility of modification of the award by the arbitrator does not render the award interlocutory. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Region I and NTEU</span>, 15 FLRA 816, 817 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and POPA</span>, 24 FLRA 835, 836 (1986) ("only when a modification of an award by the arbitrator gives rise to the deficiencies alleged in the exceptions to the award has the Authority held that the filing period for exceptions began with the arbitrator's modification of the award"). In an award clarifying an earlier award determining that the employer owed employees FLSA overtime, when an arbitrator decided whether the overtime could be reduced by the value of compensatory time already received by employees, the earlier award was not interlocutory, even though the arbitrator did not identify the aggrieved individuals and the damages due to each, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216 and EEOC</span>, 65 FLRA 252, 253-54 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations provides, in pertinent part, that "the Authority...ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals." Accordingly, the Authority will not resolve exceptions to an arbitration award unless the award constitutes a complete resolution of all the issues submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, Wash., D.C.</span>, 60 FLRA 333, 334 (2004). Exceptions to an award are not interlocutory where an arbitrator has retained jurisdiction solely to assist the parties in the implementation of awarded remedies, including the specific amount of monetary relief awarded. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 63 FLRA 157, 158 (2009) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Kirtland Air Force Base, Air Force Materiel Command, Albuquerque, N.M.</span>, 62 FLRA 121, 123 (2007). In addition, the Authority has held that an award holding an agency liable for unpaid overtime was final, and that exceptions to it were not interlocutory, even though the award did not identify, among other things, which employees were affected by the agency's actions. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, USP Admin. Maximum (ADX), Florence, Colo.</span>, 64 FLRA 1168, 1170 (2010) (<span class="Italic">ADX</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's claim, the original award completely resolved the issue submitted to arbitration--whether the Agency violated the FLSA by failing to pay employees overtime compensation--by finding that the Agency violated the FLSA and therefore owed affected employees overtime compensation and liquidated damages. Further, the fact that the Arbitrator did not identify the specific employees to whom overtime compensation was owed and did not determine the amount of overtime compensation owed, does not render the original award non-final for the purposes of determining whether the Union's exceptions are interlocutory. <span class="Italic">See ADX</span>, 64 FLRA at 1170. Moreover, the clarification award, to which the exceptions here pertain, did not leave any submitted issues unresolved. Additionally, the decisions cited by the Agency do not demonstrate that either award is not final. In this regard, nothing in <span class="Italic">Veterans</span>, 61 FLRA at 174-75, indicates that either the original award or the clarification award failed to completely resolve all of the issues submitted to arbitration. Moreover, unlike the situation here, the award in <span class="Italic">Public Works</span>, 27 FLRA at 408, did not provide any type of remedy. Further, whereas the award in <span class="Italic">HHS</span>, 57 FLRA at 926, entitled "Phase One Interim Award[,]" indicated, by its name, that the award was not final, neither the original award nor the clarification award in this case contains such indication. With regard to the Agency's claim that the Union did not adhere to the requirements of the parties' agreement in requesting a clarification of the award, the Agency does not provide any basis for finding the clarification award is not a final award to which the Union may file exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The pendency of exceptions does not preclude an arbitrator from clarifying an award; conversely, FLRA imposes no impediment to processing exceptions while there is an outstanding request for clarification or reconsideration before the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Huntington and AFGE Local 2344</span>, 46 FLRA 1160, 1163 n.2 (1993). Parties must exercise care concerning the effect of a request for clarification. If the clarification of an award first states the dates for an award of back pay, the exceptions filed after the clarification may challenge the back pay award, but they may not operate to challenge the underlying decision granting the grievant a promotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nat'l Archives &#x0026; Records Admin. and AFGE Council 260, Local 2578</span>, 42 FLRA 664, 671 (1991). But the execution of the rule is not always so straightforward.</p>
<p class="noindent">Issuance of an errata sheet by an arbitrator is not sufficient to reinitiate the time for filing exceptions to the underlying award. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1960 and Naval Educ. and Training Program Dev. Ctr., Pensacola</span>, 34 FLRA 799, 802 (1990). <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-45 and DCA, Langley AFB</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v55/55-134.html">55 FLRA 789</a>, 793 (1999), noted that an amended award (modifying the remedy) did not extend the time for filing exceptions to the underlying award. The Authority did not comment on the propriety of the amendment.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA granted exceptions to an award clarified by an email in response to a union representative's inquiry to an arbitrator concerning whether he would entertain a counsel fee petition following the merits award. A dissent, arguing that an email is not an award, was offered by Member Pizzella in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3749 and USDA, FSIS</span>, 69 FLRA 519 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting). Of an email from an arbitrator, treated by FLRA majority as a clarification of an award, Member Pizzella dissented in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3690 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Miami</span>, 69 FLRA 154, 156 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has never before found an email to be contrary to law, and I see no reason to depart from that course and to do so here. An email is simply a method of communication. I am concerned that according routine communications the same status of an award, which may be declared contrary to law, only serves to create uncertainty for the labor-management relations community. Such uncertainty is bound to generate unpredictable volumes of future arbitration exceptions that would focus on any number of email exchanges, facsimile transmissions, and telephone calls between the parties and the arbitrator. The panoply of arguments that could be, and are certain to be raised, in future cases, purportedly in the hopes of clearing, or adding to, ambiguity where none exists, would be limited only by the creative imaginations of agency and union representatives alike. I do not look forward to navigating disputes arising out of that electronic Pandora's box.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an arbitrator clarifies but does not modify a prior award, the time for filing exceptions runs from when the award is first served, not from when it is clarified. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Kelly AFB and AFGE Local 1617</span>, 15 FLRA 200, 201 (1985). The 30-day filing limit was not extended when the arbitrator declined to issue clarification. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1612 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Med. Ctr. for Fed. Prisoners, Springfield</span>, 6 FLRA 5, 6 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE SSA Gen. Comm.</span>, 33 FLRA 821, 822 (1988) ("in his clarification...the Arbitrator did not modify his original award....&#8197;There is nothing in the <span id="page_1811"></span>Arbitrator's clarification of the award which gives rise to any deficiencies to which exceptions might be filed.").</p>
<p class="noindent">When does an arbitrator clarify rather than modify an award? There is no clear answer, although it was suggested that an award is clarified if the arbitrator does no more than advise the parties of the clear intent of the remedy he previously ordered. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 33 and IRS, Phoenix Dist.</span>, 44 FLRA 252, 268 (1992). If an arbitrator responds to a clarification request by modifying an award, the date for filing exceptions to a deficiency first presented in the modified award begins with the date of the modified award. <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and FEMTC</span>, 15 FLRA 181, 182 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 815 F.2d 797 (1st Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Comm'n and Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots, Marine Div.</span>, 22 FLRA 605, 606 (1986) ("a party's request for clarification of an award does not operate to extend the time limit for filing exceptions....[o]nly when an arbitrator in response to a clarification request modifies an award and the modification gives rise to the deficiencies alleged in the exceptions has the Authority held that the filing period for exceptions began with the arbitrator's response to the request for clarification"); <span class="Italic">Army Elec. Research and Dev. Command, Ft. Monmouth and NFFE</span>, 15 FLRA 397, 398 (1984) (post-award request for clarification and possibility of modification of award by arbitrator did not deprive award of finality or render it interlocutory; if award was modified, and the modification gives rise to alleged deficiencies, filing period begins with modification).</p>
<p class="noindent">Implying, but not holding, that there is a limit to the time for requesting clarification, <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 243 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Air Station</span>, 67 FLRA 96, 96-97 (2012), determined of a union's attempt to secure an arbitrator's clarification of an award that apparently denied counsel fees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Three months after Arbitrator Steve A.&#x2003;Shackelford, Jr. issued an award, the Union requested that he clarify whether the award denied the Union attorney fees or simply did not address that issue. Responding by email, the Arbitrator stated that the award addressed the issue of attorney fees as specifically provided for in the collective bargaining agreement and needed no clarification. The Union then filed the exception in this case, and the question before the Authority is whether the exception is timely. Because the exception challenges a portion of the award and the deadline for filing exceptions to the award expired before the Union filed the exception, we dismiss the exception as untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that if the Union was unclear about whether the award denied attorney fees, then it could have requested clarification from the Arbitrator <span class="Italic">and</span> timely filed an exception to the award. That approach would have preserved the Union's right to challenge the award's denial of attorney fees in the event that the Arbitrator clarified that he had, indeed, denied them. But the Union allowed the jurisdictional deadline for filing exceptions to the award to lapse months before seeking clarification from the Arbitrator. As the Union has not demonstrated that the email modified the award in such a way as to give rise to the deficiencies alleged in the exception,we dismiss the exception as an untimely challenge to the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA attempted to clarify the matter of when exceptions must be filed to awards and their clarifications in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, USP Marion and AFGE Local 2343</span>, 64 FLRA 437, 438-39 (2010), involving an underlying award and clarifications requested as to the computation of FLSA pay and damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Statute and the Authority's Regulations, the time limit for filing exceptions to an arbitration award is 30 days beginning on the date the award is served on the filing party. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.1(b). When an arbitrator has issued several awards concerning a matter, the timeliness of an exception is calculated on the basis of the award that gives rise to the deficiency alleged in the exception. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, U.S. Dental Activity Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps &#x0026; Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg, N.C.</span>, 62 FLRA 70, 71 (2007) (<span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the deficiency alleged in the Agency's exception is that "[t]he Arbitrator erred in ruling that interest is to be applied for the period from January 1, 1996 to April 8, 1999, after the April 8 payments were due." Specifically, the Agency contends that awarding both interest and liquidated damages is contrary to law. It is not disputed that the Arbitrator first ordered interest in the second clarification and that the subsequent award merely reaffirmed that order. Consequently, for the Agency's exception to have been timely filed, it must not have been sufficiently clear until the subsequent award that the Arbitrator had awarded both liquidated damages and interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously has considered clarification awards in which arbitrators were "advising the parties of the clear intent of the remedy [the arbitrators] had ordered previously." <span class="Italic">NTEU, NTEU Chapter 33</span>, 44 FLRA 252, 268 (1992). In such cases, the Authority has dismissed exceptions filed to clarification awards as untimely filed because the exceptions relate to the original awards, and not the clarification awards. <span class="Italic">Id.; Dep't of the Air Force, Headquarters 832d Combat Support Group, DPCE, Luke Air Force Base, Ariz.</span>, 24 FLRA 1021, 1022 (1986) (agency failed to demonstrate that it was unclear, until clarified, that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy included backpay).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing here, the Arbitrator specifically stated in the subsequent award that he had already indicated in the first and second clarifications the intent of the remedy granted in the initial award. As discussed previously, the Arbitrator found that there was "no doubt that the parties know or should know" that the formula adopted in the initial award included liquidated damages. In its response to the order to show cause, the Agency does not acknowledge or address this finding. Instead, the Agency responds with the bare assertion that it was not sufficiently clear, prior to the subsequent award, that the Arbitrator had awarded both liquidated damages and interest. In view of the Arbitrator's finding and explanation, such a bare assertion by the Agency does not show cause why its exception should not be dismissed as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin.</span>, 63 FLRA 530, 533 (2009) (agency's bare assertion provided no basis for disputing the arbitrator's findings).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency additionally argues that it would prejudice the parties to dismiss the exception because the order to show cause was issued long after the exception was filed.&#x2003;However, the Authority has repeatedly and uniformly held that the time limit for filing exceptions to arbitration awards is jurisdictional. <span class="Italic">E.g., Bremerton Metal Trades Council</span>, 59 FLRA 583, 584 (2004). Consequently, the Authority is not empowered to waive the time limit for untimely filed exceptions, and equitable considerations are not relevant. <span class="Italic">See id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the forgoing reasons, we dismiss the Agency's exception as untimely filed.</p>
